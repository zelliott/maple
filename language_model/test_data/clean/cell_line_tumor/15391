To establish Gankyrin knocking down 4T1-luc cell model and detect the effects of Gankyrin expression on breast cancer metastasis.

4T1-luc cells carrying shGankyrin construct were established by lentivirus infection and antibiotic screening. Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to check the expression levels of Gankyrin. In vivo imaging system was used to monitor the effects of Gankyrin knocked down on cell growth and tumor metastasis after the in situ implantation of Gankyrin knocking down 4T1-luc cells in BALB/c mice.

The cell expression decreased at the protein and mRNA levels. Gankyrin mRNA expression in different shGankyrin 4T1-luc cells was respectively 4.9%, 25.1% and 69.8% versus the control cells. ShGankyrin#2 4T1-luc cells were chosen for in situ implantation into BAL/c mice because luminescent intensity was consistent with cell numbers. The photon flux of lung metastatic tumor induced by Gankyrin knocking down 4T1-luc cell was 3.02 × 10(6), while that of lung metastasis induced by control cells was 10.9 × 10(6). The differences between two groups were significant. In pathology, Gankyrin was detected positive in lung metastasis tumors induced by control group. However, Gankyrin was negative in the Gankyrin knockdown group.

Lentivirus infection may be effectively used to establish Gankyrin knocking down 4T1-luc cell model. Because of its involvement in the in vivo pulmonary metastasis of breast cancers, Gankyrin should be a novel target for tumor therapy.
