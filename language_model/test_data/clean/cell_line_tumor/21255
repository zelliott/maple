p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, is a focus for study at present. Up to now, its role and functions in hepatocellular carcinoma were not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the expression of p75NTR in hepatocellular carcinoma and the impact of its alteration on tumor growth. We found that the expression of p75NTR was decreased significantly in 158 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma tissues as compared with their adjacent noncancerous counterparts, and its expression was also significantly decreased in various human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Down-regulating p75NTR by specific siRNA promoted the growth of normal liver cell lines, whereas up-regulating p75NTR inhibited the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines in vitro and caused dramatic attenuation of tumor growth in vivo by induction of cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we found that up-regulating p75NTR could down-regulate the expression of cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, cdk2, p-Rb and PCNA, but up-regulate the expression of Rb. Conversely, the results were inverse when p75NTR was down-regulated by specific siRNA. Therefore, we provided the evidence that p75NTR was a potential tumor suppressor and might be used as a therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.
