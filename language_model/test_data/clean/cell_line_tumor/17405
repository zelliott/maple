Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a recently developed tool for genome-wide determination of DNA copy number alterations. This technology has tremendous potential for disease-gene discovery in cancer and developmental disorders as well as numerous other applications. However, widespread utilization of a CGH has been limited by the lack of well characterized, high-resolution clone sets optimized for consistent performance in aCGH assays and specifically designed analytic software. We have assembled a set of approximately 4100 publicly available human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones evenly spaced at approximately 1-Mb resolution across the genome, which includes direct coverage of approximately 400 known cancer genes. This aCGH-optimized clone set was compiled from five existing sets, experimentally refined, and supplemented for higher resolution and enhancing mapping capabilities. This clone set is associated with a public online resource containing detailed clone mapping data, protocols for the construction and use of arrays, and a suite of analytical software tools designed specifically for aCGH analysis. These resources should greatly facilitate the use of aCGH in gene discovery.
