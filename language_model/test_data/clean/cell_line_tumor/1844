Aiming to identify novel sero-diagnostic markers for neuroendocrine carcinomas             of the lung, the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-immunoblot method was used             to analyze tumor-associated autoantibodies in patients with small cell lung carcinoma             (SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). Several autoantigens were             revealed and anti-HuC autoantibody was detected only in sera of SCLC patients.             Since Hu family proteins including HuC are well-known causes of paraneoplastic             encephalomyelitis/sensory neuronopathy (PEM/SN), the expression of HuC as well             as HuD mRNAs and their proteins was studied in 11 lung cancer cell lines. The             expression of HuC and HuD mRNAs and proteins was only detected in SCLC- and LCNEC-derived             cells. To validate the existence of anti-HuC and -HuD auto-antibodies, we studied             a large number of sera including those from lung cancer patients employing dot             blot analysis. Anti-HuC and -HuD autoantibodies were detected only in SCLC cases             with or without PEM/SN, and not in the sera of LCNEC patients. The mechanism leading             to different anti-HuC and -HuD autoantibody production between SCLC and LCNEC             is unclear; however, the results from the present and previous studies suggest             that anti-HuC and -HuD auto-antibodies are novel differential sero-diagnostic             markers for SCLC from LCNEC.
