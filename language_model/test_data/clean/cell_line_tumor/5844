Several microRNAs mediate the functions of p53 family members. Here we characterize miR-1246 as a new target of this family. In response to DNA damage, p53 induces the expression of miR-1246 which, in turn, reduces the level of DYRK1A, a Down syndrome-associated protein kinase. Knockdown of p53 has the opposite effect. Overexpression of miR-1246 reduces DYRK1A levels and leads to the nuclear retention of NFATc1, a protein substrate of DYRK1A, and the induction of apoptosis, whereas a miR-1246-specific inhibitor prevented the nuclear import of NFATc1. Together, these results indicate that p53 inhibits DYRK1A expression through the induction of miR-1246.
