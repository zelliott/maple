Failure to undergo apoptosis has been implicated in the resistance of tumor cells to anticancer therapies. Promotion of apoptosis in tumor cells could potentially increase the efficacy of conventional treatment regimens and improve prognosis. Prostate cancer cells are generally resistant to induction of apoptosis by anticancer agents and death ligands. We investigated the sensitization of prostate cancer cell lines by curcumin (diferuloyl-methane) to TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. Prostate cancer cells treated with curcumin or TRAIL or curcumin and TRAIL together were assessed for induction of apoptosis and pathway of apoptosis was determined from the activation of procaspases and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Curcumin sensitized LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 tumor cell lines to TRAIL. Combined curcumin and TRAIL treatment produced the most loss of viable cells by inducing apoptosis as revealed by accumulation of hypodiploid cells in sub-G1 phase, enhanced annexin V binding, DNA fragmentation, cleavage of procaspases-3, -8, and 9, truncation of proapoptotic Bid, and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Tumor cells expressed constitutively active NF-kappaB and sensitization to TRAIL involved inhibition of NF-kappaB by curcumin. These findings suggest that combined curcumin/TRAIL chemo-immunotherapy may be a beneficial adjunct to the standard therapeutic regimens for prostate cancer.
