In our screening of micro-organisms for novel bioactive natural products, a new staurosporinone, N-carboxamido-staurosporine (1c), and a new sesquiterpene, (5S,8S,9R, 10S)-selina-4(14),7(11)-diene-8,9-diol (2a), were isolated from the culture broth of the marine-derived Streptomyces sp. QD518. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods and by comparison of the NMR data with those of structurally related known natural products, which were isolated from the same strain.
