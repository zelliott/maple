Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) is a pro-apoptotic Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase that is widely expressed in tissues but kept silent in growing cells. Downregulation of DAPK transcription by CpG methylation has been demonstrated in a variety of tumours, providing a selective growth advantage during tumour progression. As the in vivo expression of DAPK in human renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) has not previously been analysed, 72 RCCs were investigated using semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We found that almost 92% (66/72) of all primary RCCs express DAPK mRNA and results obtained from methylation-specific PCR analyses suggest that aberrant CpG methylation of the DAPK promoter is absent even in DAPK non-expressing tumours. Comparison of early/intermediate with advanced tumour stages of clear cell RCCs showed that no significant changes in the expression levels of DAPK were evident. Chromophilic/papillary RCCs display no significantly different expression patterns of DAPK compared with stage-adjusted clear cell RCCs. Furthermore, on analysing the DAPK enzyme activity in RCC cell lines with DAPK mRNA and protein expression, only 1 out of 11 cell lines showed basal DAPK activity in kinase activity assays, suggesting that DAPK, although expressed in RCC, remains largely inactive. Our study demonstrates the in vivo expression of DAPK in RCCs and reveals that, in contrast to other tumour types, RCCs may not downregulate DAPK mRNA expression during tumour progression. Despite persistent DAPK transcription and translation, however, the markedly reduced DAPK enzyme activity in our RCC cell lines suggested a post-translational inactivation of DAPK in RCCs.
