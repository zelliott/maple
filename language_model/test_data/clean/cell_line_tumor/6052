A new liposome-based near-infrared probe that combines both imaging and targeting abilities was developed for application in medical imaging. The near-infrared fluorescent molecule indocyanine green (ICG), and the cetuximab monoclonal antibody for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were attached to liposomes by passive adsorption. It was found that ICG molecules adsorbed to the liposomes are more fluorescent than free ICG and have a larger quantum yield. Cetuximab-adsorbed fluorescent liposomes preserved EGFR recognition, as is evident from internalization and selective binding to A431 colon carcinoma cells overexpressing EGFR. The binding of cetuximab-targeted fluorescent liposomes to A431 compared with IEC-6 cells (normal enterocytes expressing physiological EGFR levels) was greater by a factor of 3.5, ensuring imaging abilities with available fluorescent equipment. Due to relatively high quantum yield and specific tumor cell-recognizing ability, this technology deserves further in vivo evaluation for imaging and diagnostic purposes.
