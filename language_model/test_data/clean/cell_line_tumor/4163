Pentacyclic triterpenes are a group of molecules with promising anticancer potential, although their precise molecular target remains elusive. The current work aims to investigate the antiproliferative and associated mechanisms of triterpenes in breast cancer cells in vitro.

Effect of triterpenes on cell cycle distribution, ROS and key regulatory proteins were analyzed in three breast cancer cells in vitro. Growth inhibition, new DNA synthesis, colony formation assays and Western blot analysis were performed to assess the EGFR inhibitory effect of triterpenes. Molecular docking was performed to study the interaction between EGFR and triterpenes.

We have demonstrated the ability of dimethyl melaleucate (DMM), a pentacyclic triterpene to exhibit cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase by down-regulation of cyclin D1 through PI3K/AKT inhibition. Further, to identify the upstream target of DMM, potential EGFR inhibitory activity of DMM and three structurally related pentacyclic triterpenes, ursolic acid, 18Î±-glycyrrhetinic acid and carbenoxolone was investigated. Interestingly, pentacyclic triterpenes limit EGF mediated breast cancer proliferation through sustained inhibition of EGFR and its downstream effectors STAT3 and cyclin D1 in breast cancer lines. We also show pentacyclic triterpenes to bind at the ATP binding pocket of tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR leading to the hypothesis that pentacyclic triterpenes could be a novel class of EGFR inhibitors. In conclusion, pentacyclic triterpenes inhibit EGFR activation through binding with tyrosine kinase domain thereby suppressing breast cancer proliferation.

Pentacyclic triterpenes may serve as a potential platform for development of novel drugs against breast cancer.
