Overproduction of melanin can lead to medical disorders such as postinflammatory melanoderma and melasma. Therefore, developing antimelanogenic agents is important for both medical and cosmetic purposes. In this report, we demonstrated for the first time that the antidiabetic drug voglibose is a potent antimelanogenic agent. Voglibose is a representative antidiabetic drug possessing inhibitory activity towards human α-glucosidase; it blocked the proper N-glycan modification of tyrosinase, resulting in a dramatic reduction of the tyrosinase protein level by altering its stability and subsequently decreasing melanin production. Acarbose, another antihyperglycaemic drug that has a lower inhibitory effect on human intracellular α-glucosidase compared with voglibose, did not cause any changes in either the N-glycan modification of tyrosinase or the tyrosinase protein level, indicating that voglibose was the most efficient antimelanogenic agent among the widely used antihyperglycaemic agents. Considering that voglibose was originally selected from the valiolamine derivatives in a screen for an oral antidiabetic drug with a strong inhibitory activity towards intestinal α-glucosidase and low cell permeability, we propose an alternative strategy for screening compounds from valiolamine derivatives that show high inhibitory activity towards human intracellular α-glucosidases and high cell permeability, with the goal of obtaining antimelanogenic agents that are effective inside the cells.
