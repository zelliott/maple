FUS1 is a tumor suppressor gene located on human chromosome 3p21.3. Frequent loss of FUS1 protein expression is associated with lung cancer development. This study examined FUS1 expression and its possible tumor-suppressive role in bone and soft tissue sarcomas.

The expressions of FUS1 mRNA and FUS1 protein were assessed in sarcoma cell lines, sarcoma tissues, benign bone and soft-tissue tumor (BST) tissues, and healthy tissues. Exogenous FUS1 gene transfection was performed on sarcoma cell lines.

FUS1 mRNA expression was detected in all sarcoma cell lines, all benign BSTs and healthy tissues, and almost all sarcoma tissues. In contrast, FUS1 protein expression was frequently lost in sarcoma cells and sarcoma tissues. The exogenous FUS1 gene delivery induced strong FUS1 protein expression, inhibition of cell viability and apoptosis in sarcoma cells.

FUS1 may act as a tumor suppressor in bone and soft-tissue sarcomas.
