The present study describes the experimental synthetic procedure and the characterization of a new polyaspartamide macromolecular prodrug of paclitaxel, bearing oxytocin residues as targeting moieties. In vitro stability studies of bioconjugate, performed in media mimicking biological fluids (buffer solutions at pH 7.4 and 5.5) and in human plasma, evidenced the high stability of the targeting portion (oxytocin)-polymer linkage and the ability of this conjugate to release linked paclitaxel in a prolonged way in plasma. Moreover, preliminary in vitro antiproliferative studies, carried out on MCF-7 cells, that are oxytocin receptor positive cells, showed that the polymeric conjugate has the same cell growing inhibition ability of free drug.
