In chronic myelogenous (CML) and chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), neoplastic cells spread via the circulation into various extramedullary organs. As E- and P-selectin constitute the starting point for the leucocyte adhesion/invasion cascade, and CEL and CML cells share many properties with normal granulocytes, we investigated the role of these selectins in CEL and CML cell expansion and organ invasion in a xenotransplantation model using scid mice. Using two human leukemic cell lines (EOL-1 and K562), we were able to show that E- and P-selectins mediate leukemia cell tethering and adherence in a laminar flow assay. While E-selectin binding depended on sialylated carbohydrate moieties, P-selectin binding was completely (K562) or partially (EOL-1) independent of these carbohydrates indicating the involvement of non-canonical selectin ligands. In a xenograft model in scid mice, both cell lines invaded the bone marrow and other organs, formed chloromas, and ultimately produced an overt leukemia. In contrast, in E- and P-selectin knockout scid mice, the cells failed to show engraftment in 8 out of 10 animals and even if they did engraft, they produced only little organ invasion and chloroma formation. Together, these data suggest that E- and P-selectins play an important role in leukemic dissemination in CML and CEL.
