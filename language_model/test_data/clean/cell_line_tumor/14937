We first report the application of 3-acyl-5-hydroxybenzofurans as a scaffold to develop potential drugs for breast cancer. Seven novel derivative compounds were synthesized by using a microwave-assisted synthesis method. Those compounds exhibited different antiproliferation against human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, with the best activity of IC50=43.08μM for compound 1. A Quantum Mechanics Polarized Ligand Docking (QPLD) study was carried out to investigate the binding interactions between these compounds and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). The simulation results showed that the trend of receptor-ligand binding interactions was same as that of their antiproliferative activities. A detailed analysis indicated that compound 1 possesses the highest Van der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions compared to the other six compounds and better inhibitors are achievable by enhancing the hydrogen bond interactions. Based on these results, we addressed that 3-acyl-5-hydroxybenzofuran is an attractive scaffold for designing drugs against breast cancer.
