A novel series of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines bearing a 3-hydroxyphenyl group at C(3) and substituted tropanes at C(7) have been identified as potent B-Raf inhibitors. Exploration of alternative functional groups as a replacement for the C(3) phenol demonstrated indazole to be an effective isostere. Several compounds possessing substituted indazole residues, such as 4e, 4p, and 4r, potently inhibited cell proliferation at submicromolar concentrations in the A375 and WM266 cell lines, and the latter two compounds also exhibited good therapeutic indices in cells.
