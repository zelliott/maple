How nuclear receptors (NRs) coordinate the sequential, ligand-dependent recruitment of multiple coactivator complexes (e.g., SRC complexes and Mediator) that share similar receptor binding determinants is unclear. We show that although the receptor binding subunits of these complexes (i.e., SRCs and Med220, respectively) share overlapping binding sites on estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), information contained in the receptor-coactivator interface allows the receptor to distinguish between them. In support of this conclusion, we have identified an ERalpha AF-2 point mutant (L540Q) that selectively binds and recruits Med220, but not SRCs, both in vitro and in vivo. In cells expressing this mutant, the recruitment of Med220 to the pS2 promoter is delayed, and the expression of the vast majority of estrogen target genes is impaired, suggesting a nearly global functional interdependence of these coactivators. Collectively, our results suggest that "facilitated recruitment," rather than competition, drives the sequential recruitment of SRC complexes and Mediator by NRs.
