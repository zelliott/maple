To investigate the effects of 5% dextrose solution and different CO2 pressures on expression of adhesion molecules (including CD44 and ICAM-1) of endometrial carcinoma cells in vitro. To provide experimental base for the safety question of hysteroscope operation and the selection of better distending medium for the patients with suspected endometrial cancer.

Endometrial cancer cells (HEC-1-B) were put in 5% dextrose, 70 mmHg 100% CO2, 100 mmHg 100% CO2 at 37 degrees C, the control group was not given any administration, respectively for 1 hour. Expression of CD44 and ICAM-1 were measured at 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours by using flow cytometry.

The expression of CD44 and ICAM-1 increased significantly at 0 h-72 h after the cells were exposed to 5% dextrose, 70 mmHg 100% CO2, 100 mmHg 100% CO2 for 1 hour ( p<0.05) respectively, and returned to the control levels by 72 h. With the increase of the CO2 pressure, the expression of the CD44 and ICAM-1 increased ( p<0.05). The expression of the CD44 and ICAM-1 totally increased significantly compared with control.

Both high pressure CO2 (100 mmHg) and 5% dextrose solution can increase the expression of CD44 and ICAM-1 in endometrial cancer cells, and may promote the capability of adhesion of endometrial cancer cells. Lower CO2 pressure does not change the expression of CD44 and ICAM-1 in endometrial cancer cells, therefore the low CO2 pressure (70 mmHg) is safer as distending medium for the patients with suspected endometrial cancer.
