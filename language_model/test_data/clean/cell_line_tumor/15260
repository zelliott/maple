Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable B cell neoplasm causing significant morbidity and mortality. Despite recent advances in the MM-treatment, the disease still remains incurable; necessitating a search for new therapeutic agents. Therefore, Strychnos nux-vomica L. root extract (SN) was screened using the human MM-cell line, U266B1. SN-extract demonstrated anti-proliferative effect in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Morphological studies, cell cycle analysis by FACS indicate apoptosis. Furthermore, assessment of signaling molecules like IL-6 (interleukin-6) and CD-138 (Sydencan-1) confirmed apoptosis. The anti-proliferative activity of SN-extract is associated with apoptosis, which is likely due to the presence of alkaloids, strychnine and brucine, which have been identified by MALDI-TOF-MS and RP-HPLC analysis.
