Potassium channel blockers have been shown to possess antitumor properties, but the role of apoptosis remains to be clarified. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative effect of tetraethylammonium (TEA), a nonspecific potassium channel blocker, in rat C6 and 9L glioma cells.

Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL and annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide assays. Protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed flow cytometrically.

TEA (2-60 mM) significantly inhibited the proliferation of C6 and 9L glioma cells. In addition, increased cell apoptosis was confirmed after treatment with 40 mM TEA. Apoptosis was associated with a dramatic increase in ROS levels and altered Bcl-2/Bax protein balance.

TEA can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in both cell lines; therefore, it might be associated with the increase in intracellular ROS production.
