gamma-Synuclein is a member of the synuclein family consisting of three proteins. Within the last several years increasing attention has focused on these proteins because of their role in human diseases. alpha-Synuclein relevance to Parkinson's disease is based on mutations found in familial cases of the disease and its presence in filaments and inclusion bodies in sporadic cases. gamma-Synuclein is implicated in some forms of cancer and ocular diseases, while beta-synuclein may antagonize their pathological functions. In this paper we present data on the localization and properties of gamma-synuclein in several neuronal and nonneuronal cell cultures. We show that contrary to the current opinion, gamma-synuclein is not an exclusively cytoplasmic protein, but has a dynamic localization and can associate with subcellular structures. It is present in the perinuclear area and may be associated to centrosomes. On late steps of mitosis gamma-synuclein is not found in the centrosomes, and redistributes to the midbody in telophase. Under stress conditions a translocation of gamma-synuclein from the perinuclear area to the nucleus occurs exhibiting nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. gamma-Synuclein overexpression reduces neurite outgrowth in a greater extent then alpha-synuclein overexpression. These data support the view that gamma-synuclein may change its intracellular localization and associate with subcellular structures in response to intracellular signaling or stress.
