It has recently been found that the new class of transcripts, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are pervasively transcribed in the genome. LncRNAs are a large family of non-coding RNAs and regulate many protein-coding genes. Growing evidence indicates that lncRNAs may play an important functional role in cancer biology. Emerging data have shown that lncRNAs are closely related to the occurrence and development of lung cancer. However, the function and mechanism of lncRNAs in lung cancer remain elusive. Here, we investigated the role of a novel lncRNA in transformed human bronchial epithelial cells induced by benzo(a)pyrene. After establishing the transformed cell model using the BEAS-2B cell line in vitro, we found that expression of lncRNA-DQ786227 was high and changed during the transformation of BEAS-2B cells. Silencing of lncRNA-DQ786227 expression in malignant transformed BEAS-2B cells led to inhibition of cell proliferation and colony formation, and increased apoptosis. LncRNA-DQ786227 dramatically promoted the ability of BEAS-2B-T cells to form colonies in vitro and develop tumors in nude mice. These findings revealed that lncRNA-DQ786227 acts as an oncogene in malignantly transformed BEAS-2B cells induced by benzo(a)pyrene. The identification of lncRNA could provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis.
