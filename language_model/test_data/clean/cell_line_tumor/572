We developed and characterized an orthotopic invasive bladder tumor model.

The MB49-I invasive bladder tumor cell line was obtained after 13 consecutive in vivo passages of primary tumor obtained by subcutaneous inoculation of MB49 bladder tumor cells in C57Bl/6J male mice.

MB49-I tumor local invasiveness, tumor weight and spontaneous metastatic capacity were higher than in MB49 tumors. In MB49-I bladder tumors increased vimentin was observed, suggesting epithelial mesenchymal transition. In vitro the MB49-I cell line showed higher invasive properties associated with an increase in cathepsin B, metalloproteinase 9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator proteolytic activities. Orthotopic bladder tumors induced by electrocautery of the bladder wall and subsequent instillation of MB49 and MB49-I bladder cancer cells generated superficial and invasive bladder tumors, respectively.

The new murine bladder model described resembles human bladder disease, making it a useful tool for studying the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression and metastasis, and assaying antimetastatic and anti-invasive agents.
