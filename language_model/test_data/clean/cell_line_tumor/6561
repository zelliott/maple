To fully assess the role of VEGF-A in tumor angiogenesis, antibodies that can block all sources of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are desired. Selectively targeting tumor-derived VEGF overlooks the contribution of host stromal VEGF. Other strategies, such as targeting VEGF receptors directly or using receptor decoys, result in inhibiting not only VEGF-A but also VEGF homologues (e.g. placental growth factor, VEGF-B, and VEGF-C), which may play a role in angiogenesis. Here we report the identification of novel anti-VEGF antibodies, B20 and G6, from synthetic antibody phage libraries, which block both human and murine VEGF action in vitro. Their affinity-improved variants completely inhibit three human tumor xenografts in mice of skeletal muscle, colorectal, and pancreatic origins (A673, HM-7, and HPAC). Avastin, which only inhibits the tumor-derived human VEGF, is approximately 90% effective at inhibiting HM-7 and A673 growth but is <50% effective at inhibiting HPAC growth. Indeed, HPAC tumors contain more host stroma invasion and stroma-derived VEGF than other tumors. Thus, the functional contribution of stromal VEGF varies greatly among tumors, and systemic blockade of both tumor and stroma-derived VEGF is sufficient for inhibiting the growth of tumor xenografts.
