After bacterial infection, neutrophils dominate the cellular infiltrate. Their main function is assumed to be killing invading pathogens and resolving the inflammation they cause. Activated neutrophils are also known to release a variety of molecules, including the neutrophil serine proteinases, extracellularly. The release of these proteinases during inflammation creates a proteolytic environment where degradation of different molecules modulates the inflammatory response. Flagellin, the structural component of flagella on many bacterial species, is a virulence factor with a strong proinflammatory activity on epithelial cells and other cell types. In this study we show that both human and mouse neutrophil serine proteinases cleave flagellin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacterial species. More important, cleavage of P. aeruginosa flagellin by the neutrophil serine proteinases neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G resulted in loss of the biological activity of this virulence factor, as evidenced by the lack of innate host defense gene expression in human epithelial cells. The finding that flagellin is susceptible to cleavage by neutrophil serine proteinases suggests a novel role for these enzymes in the inflammatory response to infection. Not only can these enzymes kill bacteria, but they also degrade their virulence factors to halt the inflammatory response they trigger.
