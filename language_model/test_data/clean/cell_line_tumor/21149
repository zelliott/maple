Gamma-synuclein, also referred to as breast-cancer-specific gene 1, is the third member of the neuronal protein family synuclein. Synucleins attracted the attention of many investigators because of their role in human diseases. Gamma-synuclein participates in the pathogenesis of several types of cancer and some neurodegenerative diseases. Its role in tumorigenesis is due to the upregulation of transcription and the effect on downstream targets, including signaling pathways and transcription factors. Gamma-synuclein is also expressed in neurons and glial cells, but the regulation of its expression, as well as the mechanism of transition from normal functions to pathology in these cell types, is not studied. Here, we examined how gamma-synuclein promoter is regulated in neuronal and glial cells. We also show that gamma-synuclein is able to bind directly to several transcription factors. These results are discussed in connection with the implication of gamma-synuclein in diseases.
