Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are significant enzymes involved in tumor genesis and development. Herein, we report a series of novel N-hydroxyfurylacryl-amide-based HDAC inhibitors, which are marked by introducing branched hydrophobic groups as the capping group. The inhibitory activity of the synthesized compounds against HDACs and several tumor cell lines are firstly determined. Fifteen compounds with promising activities are selected for further evaluation of target selectivity profile against recombinant human HDAC1, HDAC4 and HDAC6. Compounds 10a, 10b, 10d and 16a exhibit outstanding selectivity against HDAC6. Analysis of HDAC4 X-ray structure and HDAC1, HDAC6 homology model indicates that these enzyme differ significantly in the rim near the surface of the active site. Although TSA has been known as a pan-HDAC inhibitor, it exhibits outstanding selectivity for HDAC6 over HDAC4. For further physicochemical properties study, six compounds are chosen for determination of their physicochemical properties including logD7.4 and aqueous solubility. The results suggest that compounds with a smaller framework and with hydrophilicgroups are likely to have better aqueous solubility.
