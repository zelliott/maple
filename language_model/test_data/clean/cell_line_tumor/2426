Polymeric versions of deacetylated auranofin, a gold complex with a sugar ligand, were prepared by post-modifying RAFT glycopolymers. Micellisation of a block copolymer containing pendant Au(I) units produced nanoparticles with an increased anti-proliferative effect against OVCAR-3 human ovarian carcinoma cells.
