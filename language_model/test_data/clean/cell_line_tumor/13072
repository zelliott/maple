Ursolic acid (3β-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acid) is a major biological active component of Corni fructus that is known to induce apoptosis. However, the apoptotic mechanism of ursolic acid using primary malignant tumor (RC-58T/h/SA#4)-derived human prostate cells is not known. In the present study, ursolic acid significantly inhibited the growth of RC-58T/h/SA#4 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. Ursolic acid induced cell death as evidenced by an increased proportion of cells in sub-G1 phase, the formation of apoptotic bodies, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation. After ursolic acid treatment at concentrations above 40 μM, the activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were significantly increased compared that of control. Ursolic acid modulated the upregulation of Bax (pro-apoptotic) as well as the downregulation of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic). Ursolic acid also stimulated Bid cleavage, which indicates that the apoptotic action of caspase-8-mediated Bid cleavage leads to the activation of caspase-9. Thus, the apoptotic effect of ursolic acid was involved in extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways. In addition, ursolic acid increased the expression of the caspase-independent mitochondrial apoptosis factor (AIF) in RC-58T/h/SA#4 cells. The present results suggest that ursolic acid from Corni fructus activated apoptosis in RC-58T/h/SA#4 cells via both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways.
