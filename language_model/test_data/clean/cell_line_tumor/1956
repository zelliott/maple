To study the expression of RAS protein in human glioma tissues and its influence on tumor growth.

RAS protein expression in glioma tissues was determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Subsequently, MTT cell proliferation assay, flow cytometry and Western blotting were used to assay U251 cells with reduced RAS expression.

The expression of RAS in glioma was increased and strongly correlated with pathological grade. Downregulation of RAS resulted in glioma cells growth suppression and increased apoptosis.

The expression level of RAS protein in human glioma was increased. Downregulation of RAS can inhibit glioblastoma cell growth through the RAS signal pathway.
