We have performed comparative genomic hybridization on 12 testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) cell lines and one paraffin-embedded surgical specimen to identify and characterize genome-wide gains and losses of chromosomes in these specimens. All specimens demonstrated overrepresentation of 12p. Other significant chromosomal gains, apart from 12p, included the X chromosome and chromosome arms 1q and 20q. Chromosomal losses were observed for chromosomes 4 and 18 and chromosome arms 2q, 9q, and 13q. Genomic differences were observed between an embryonal carcinoma component of a mixed tumor, 833K, and its cisplastin-resistant derivative line, 64CP, including losses of 6q23 approximately qter and 9p22 approximately q21. Five lines also demonstrated gain of 12p and additional 12p12 approximately p13 material. Similarly, two lines demonstrated gain of 12p and additional 12p11.2 approximately p12 material. The data supports the consistent gain of 12p in adult TGCT cell lines and additional regional amplification of 12p in some lines. This regional amplification has been observed in both primary tumor specimens and TGCT cell lines and may support a hypothesis that at least two different regions of 12p, one proximal and one distal, harbor genes important for the pathogenesis of testicular germ cell neoplasia.
