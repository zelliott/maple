Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) is a useful tumor marker for diagnosis and management of squamous cell carcinoma. It is well known that cell-cell adhesion is important for progression of cancer. However, it is not clarified whether cell-cell adhesion affects SCCA production in squamous cell carcinoma. The present study was, therefore, undertaken to investigate whether E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion affects SCCA production in squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. SKG-IIIa cells or CaSki cells, cervical squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, were treated with anti-E-cadherin antibodies (1 microg/ml) up to 72 h. The cells were dissociated, and SCCA content in the cytosol and SCCA mRNA levels were significantly decreased compared to the control group treated with mouse IgG. Secondly, the signaling pathway for SCCA production mediated by E-cadherin was examined. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is a well-known mediator of E-cadherin-mediated biological events. The treatment with a PI 3-kinase inhibitor suppressed SCCA production in SKG-IIIa cells. It is concluded that E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion maintains SCCA production through PI 3-kinase in squamous cell carcinoma.
