Maspin, a mammary serine protease inhibitor, was originally reported as a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer. The purpose of the present study was to examine maspin expression and evaluate its clinicopathological significance in endometrial cancer. We examined maspin expression immunohistochemically in 41 cases with endometrioid adenocarcinoma. DNA methylation status at the maspin promoter region was determined by the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction method. Aberrant maspin expression was observed in 27 (66%) of 41 endometrioid adenocarcinomas but not in normal endometrial glands. Maspin immunoreactivity of the tumor cells varied in incidence and density among tumors. Positive staining was correlated significantly with the presence of squamous differentiation (presence vs absence = 11/11 [100%] vs 16/30 [53%], P < 0.05), and nuclear subcellular localization of maspin protein was also significantly associated with squamous differentiation (nuclear positive vs nuclear negative = 6/11 [54%] vs 2/30 [6.7%], P < 0.05). An inverse correlation between their immunoreactivity and methylation status was observed (P < 0.01). Three of the four cell lines established from endometrioid adenocarcinomas overexpressed maspin mRNA and its protein product. In a maspin-negative cell line, maspin expression was induced by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent. There was no significant correlation between maspin expression and any clinicopathlogical data. These findings suggest that maspin induced by DNA demethylation at the promoter region may contribute to squamous differentiation of tumor cells in endometrioid adenocarcinomas.
