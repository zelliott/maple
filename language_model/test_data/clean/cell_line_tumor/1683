In this study, the aim is to investigate the cytologic effects of inflammatory bone cells after in vitro low-level laser therapy (LLLT). A human osteosarcoma cell line (MG63) was cultured, infected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and exposed to low-level laser treatment at 5 or 10 J/cm(2) using a 920 nm diode laser. MG63 cell attachment was observed under a microscope, and cell viability was quantified by mitochondrial colorimetric assay (MTT). LPS-treated MG63 cells were irradiated with LLLT, and the inflammatory markers iNOS, TNF-α and IL-1, were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. The data were collected and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); p < 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference. Low-level laser treatment on MG63 cells increased their ability to attach and survive. After irradiation, the expression levels of iNOS, TNF-α and IL-1 in LPS-infected MG63 cells decreased over time (p < 0.05).

low-level diode laser treatment increased the MG63 cell proliferative ability and decreased the expression of inflammatory mediators in MG63 cells.
