We previously reported the discovery of 2-aryl-4-benzoyl-imidazoles (ABI-I) as potent antiproliferative agents for melanoma. To further understand the structural requirements for the potency of ABI analogs, gain insight in the structure-activity relationships (SAR), and investigate metabolic stability for these compounds, we report extensive SAR studies on the ABI-I scaffold. Compared with the previous set of ABI-I analogs, the newly synthesized ABI-II analogs have lower potency in general, but some of the new analogs have comparable potency to the most active compounds in the previous set when tested in two melanoma and four prostate cancer cell lines. These SAR studies indicated that the antiproliferative activity was very sensitive to subtle changes in the ligand. Tested compounds 3ab and 8a are equally active against highly paclitaxel resistant cancer cell lines and their parental cell lines, indicating that drugs developed based on ABI-I analogs may have therapeutic advantages over paclitaxel in treating resistant tumors. Metabolic stability studies of compound 3ab revealed that N-methyl imidazole failed to extend stability as literature reported because de-methylation was found as the major metabolic pathway in rat and mouse liver microsomes. However, this sheds light on the possibility for many modifications on imidazole ring for further lead optimization since the modification on imidazole, such as compound 3ab, did not impact the potency.
