CD147, also named as extracelluar matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), has been proved to be involved in several aspects of tumor progression. In addition to its ability to induce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production, it confers resistance to some chemotherapeutic drugs. To investigate the possible role of CD147 in the mouse hepatocarcinoma cell line Hepa1-6 with no metastatic potential in the lymph nodes, we used RNA interference (RNAi) approach to silence CD147 expression. The results showed that silencing of CD147 in Hepa1-6 cells significantly impeded the expression of VEGF-A at both mRNA and protein levels. The siRNA-treated cells exhibited significantly decreased growth ability when compared with control cells. Colony formation of CD147 deficient cells was dramatically inhibited in soft agar, and tumorigenicity was reduced in nude mice. Furthermore, the downregulation of CD147 expression also sensitized cells to be more sensitive to curcumin. These results suggested that CD147 might be a potential target for therapeutic antitumor drugs.
