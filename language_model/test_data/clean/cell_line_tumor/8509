Because MUC1 carries a variety of sialoglycans that are possibly recognized by the siglec family, we examined MUC1-binding siglecs and found that Siglec-9 prominently bound to MUC1. An immunochemical study showed that Siglec-9-positive immune cells were associated with MUC1-positive cells in human colon, pancreas, and breast tumor tissues. We investigated whether or not this interaction has any functional implications for MUC1-expressing cells. When mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells and a human colon cancer cell line, HCT116, stably transfected with MUC1cDNA were ligated with recombinant soluble Siglec-9, β-catenin was recruited to the MUC1 C-terminal domain, which was enhanced on stimulation with soluble Siglec-9 in dose- and time-dependent manners. A co-culture model of MUC1-expressing cells and Siglec-9-expressing cells mimicking the interaction between MUC1-expressing malignant cells, and Siglec-9-expressing immune cells in a tumor microenvironment was designed. Brief co-incubation of Siglec-9-expressing HEK293 cells, but not mock HEK293 cells, with MUC1-expressing cells similarly enhanced the recruitment of β-catenin to the MUC1 C-terminal domain. In addition, treatment of MUC1-expressing cells with neuraminidase almost completely abolished the effect of Siglec-9 on MUC1-mediated signaling. The recruited β-catenin was thereafter transported to the nucleus, leading to cell growth. These findings suggest that Siglec-9 expressed on immune cells may play a role as a potential counterreceptor for MUC1 and that this signaling may be another MUC1-mediated pathway and function in parallel with a growth factor-dependent pathway.
