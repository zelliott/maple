To investigate the mechanism by which recombinant adenovirus (Ad)-mediated mutations of hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (Ad-HIF-1alpha-Ala564-Ala803) regulates cell apoptosis.

LoVo cells were infected with recombinant Ad-HIF-1alpha-Ala564-Ala803 and control virus Ad-lacZ under normoxia condition. Real-time PCR was used to detect HIF-1alpha and p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA expressions at different time points. Western blotting was employed to verify HIF-1alpha and p21WAF1/CIP1 protein expression. Hoechst 33342 flourescein staining was performed to observe the ratio of apoptotic LoVo cells.

The expression levels of HIF-1alpha mRNA and protein increased after infection with Ad-HIF-1alpha- Ala564-Ala803, accompanied by an increase in p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA and protein expressions. The apoptotic ratio was significantly higher in LoVo cells infected with recombinant Ad-HIF-1alpha-Ala564-Ala803 (16.2%) than in the control cells (5.5%, P=0.00).

HIF-1alpha may induce cell cycle arrest by up-regulating p21WAF1/CIP1 expressions to promote LoVo cell apoptosis.
