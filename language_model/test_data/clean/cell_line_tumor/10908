Eight new feline mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines derived from either primary or metastatic lesions were established. The morphology of all the cell lines was epithelioid and round to spindle in shape, with cell growth occurring in a monolayer fashion. On immunohistochemistry, these cells reacted with anti-keratin and anti-vimentin antisera. The doubling time of these cells was between 19 and 54 hr. Tumor masses were developed in nude mice by subcutaneous inoculation of the cells that were histologically identical to their original mammary tumor lesions. Telomerase activities measured using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay revealed high telemetric activity in all of the cells.
