To investigate the anti-tumor effect of adenovirus-mediated Bcl-XL shRNA on colon cancer cells in vitro.

A recombinant Bcl-xl adenovirus was constructed, amplified, and purified. The effect on mRNA expression of Bcl-XL was assessed by RT-PCR, and the effect on apoptosis-induction of colon cancer(Lovo cell line) in vitro was assessed by MTT assay and cell clonogenic assay.

RT-PCR showed that Ad/Bcl-XL shRNA significantly down-regulated the mRNA expression of Bcl-XL in Lovo cells. Ad/Bcl-XL shRNA suppressed the proliferation of Lovo cells in a dose-dependent as well as a time-dependent manner compared with Ad/GFP ( p<0.05). Treatment with Ad/Bcl-XL shRNA dramatically suppressed the colony formation of Lovo cells in a dose-dependent manner ( p<0.05). Ad/Bcl-XL shRNA showed no effect on normal human fibroblast.

Ad/Bcl-XL shRNA exhibits cytotoxic effect on Lovo cells and may have the potential value in the treatment of colon cancer.
