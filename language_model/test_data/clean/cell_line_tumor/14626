Ovarian epithelial cancer is the leading cause of death among gynecological malignancies. FSH may increase the risk of ovarian malignancy and play an important role in ovarian carcinogenesis. Our previous studies showed that FSH increases the expression of VEGF through survivin. In this study, the function and mechanism of FSH in ovarian cancer were further explored. We found that FSH promoted proliferation and prevented apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells by activating survivin through the SAPK/JNK and PI3K/AKT pathways. FSH also down-regulated the expression of programmed cell death gene 6 (PDCD6) and death receptor 5 (DR5), two molecules required for induction of apoptosis. RNA interference was applied to knock down survivin and PDCD6 expression, and we found that the blockage of survivin reversed the effects of FSH on apoptosis and proliferation, whereas knock down of PDCD6 enhanced these effects. The expression of DR5, cyclin D1, and cyclin E correlated with survivin expression, but PDCD6 did not. Using immunohistochemical staining, we further showed that ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma samples had higher expression of survivin than did benign ovarian cystadenoma and borderline cystadenoma samples ( p<0.01). Furthermore, survivin expression in the ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma specimens was correlated with disease stage ( p<0.05). Our results suggest that FSH promotes ovarian cancer development by regulating the expression of survivin, PDCD6, and DR5. Greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of FSH in ovarian epithelial carcinogenesis and development will ultimately help in the development of a novel targeted therapy for ovarian cancer.
