We compared an antisense-oligodeoxynucleotide and four DNAzymes directed to the prothrombin mRNA for their efficiency to reduce prothrombin transcript level in HepG2 cells. The DNAzymes have different binding arm symmetry and cleavage sites, but are directed to the identical target site of the antisense-oligodeoxynucleotide. The nucleic acid-based inhibitors were transfected into HepG2 cells and prothrombin transcript level was quantified and normalized to the beta-actin transcript level by multiplex PCR. All nucleic acid-based inhibitors reduced prothrombin transcript level and the effect was in almost all cases, strongest 24 h after transfection, but still remarkable up to 68 h after transfection. The antisense-oligodeoxynucleotide was more effective than the DNAzymes tested.
