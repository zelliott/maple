The possibility that a sinusoidal 50 Hz magnetic field with a magnetic flux density of 1 mT can damage MG-63 osteosarcoma spheroids and induce variations in the invasive properties of these three-dimensional model systems after 2 days of exposure was investigated. Specifically, possible damage induced by these fields was examined by determining changes in spheroid surface morphology (light microscopy), growth (spheroid diameter and protein content determination), lactate dehydrogenase release, and reduced glutathione amount. Possible changes in the invasive properties were studied by invasion chambers. The results show no induction of cell damage by ELF fields while invasion chamber assays demonstrate a significant increase in the invasive potential of exposed spheroids. In order to determine if the fibronectin or hyaluronan receptors are involved, Western blot analysis was conducted on these two proteins. No significant variations were observed in either receptor in MG-63 multicellular tumor spheroids.
