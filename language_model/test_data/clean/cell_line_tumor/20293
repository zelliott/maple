Glucose transporter protein-1 (Glut-1) is correlated with biological behaviors of malignant tumors. However, there was no evidence that overexpression of Glut-1 mechanistically lead to invasion or metastasis of cancer cells. We hypothesized that Glut-1 regulates the expression of membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2).

Analysis of the expression of Glut-1, MMP-2, Î²-actin, and MT1-MMP was performed using RT-PCR. Expression of Glut-1 protein, MMP-2, and MT1-MMP was detected by Western blotting.

At mRNA and protein levels, Glut-1 and MMP-2 were co-expressed in the Hep-2 laryngeal carcinoma cell line. After transfection, Glut-1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-ODN) decreased the expression of MMP-2 mRNA and protein as well as Glut-1 mRNA and protein. Glut-1 AS-ODN also decreased the expression of MT1-MMP mRNA.

Co-expression of Glut-1 and MMP-2 in Hep-2 laryngeal carcinoma cells and Glut-1 may regulate MMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression.
