The preventive effect of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-induced differentiation on experimental mammary carcinogenesis has been reported to be due to the inhibition of cell proliferation, increased DNA repair capabilities of the mammary epithelium, decreased binding of the carcinogen to the DNA and activation of programmed cell death genes leading to apoptosis. To further our understanding of the molecular pathway of the hCG action on mammary epithelial cells we have analyzed gene expression profiles of MCF-7 cells treated with hCG for 24, 48, and 96 h, using a DNA microarray consisting of 1176 genes. Comparison of expression between the treated and not treated cells enabled us to identify 48 genes that are affected by this hormone. Importantly, there is a cluster of genes that are overexpressed during the first 24 h and level off thereafter, whereas other genes are maximally expressed at 96 h of treatment. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that genes regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell trafficking, and DNA repair are significantly affected by hCG in human breast cancer cells in vitro.
