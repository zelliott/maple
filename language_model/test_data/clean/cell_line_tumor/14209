Esterification of 3-hydroxyl group in 11-acyloxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trienes with p-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]phenylacetic acid led to antitumor steroids displaying antiestrogenic and cytotoxic activities. Our substances exhibit their activities on the model of murine mammary adenocarcinoma Ca-755, with inhibition of the tumor growth being 94-99%. A new approach was used for the 11alpha-hydroxylation of estra-1,3,5(10)-trienes.
