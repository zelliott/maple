The establishment of a vascular network within tumours is a key step in the progression towards an aggressive, metastatic state, with poor prognosis. We have developed a novel in vitro model to specifically capture the interaction between endothelial cells and solid tumours. Micro-vascularised in vitro tumour constructs were produced by introducing endothelial cells to multicellular spheroids formed in hanging drops. Upon introduction, the endothelial cells migrated into the tumour spheroid, establishing tubular networks and luminal structures. This system relies on the natural pro-angiogenic capacity of multicellular spheroids, and does not require the addition of exogenous angiogenic factors, or use of extracellular-matrix substitutes.
