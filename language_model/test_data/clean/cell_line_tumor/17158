Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is considered the pre-malignant stage of prostate carcinoma, but little is known of its initiation and evolution. The identification of genes associated with these precursors of prostate cancer may elucidate the pathways of the early oncogenesis of this disease. Previously, we have reported that activin, a member of the TGFbeta superfamily, acted as an inhibitory growth factor in prostate cancer. We used laser capture microdissection, mRNA-library amplification (RNA-PCR), subtractive hybridization, and complementary DNA microarray to examine gene expression profiles in activin-positive PIN, compared with activin-negative PIN. Subtractive hybridization showed that 28 genes were differentially expressed (13 and 15 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively). Microarray analysis identified 29 and 56 more genes (4 times) up- and down-regulated, respectively, suggesting that DNA microarray is a more effective method in screening gene profiles. We have validated the known genes identified by both subtractive hybridization and microarray technologies, using Northern blot analysis in the mRNA libraries generated from cells microdissected from pathological slides. We have successfully showed that at least 13 genes are involved in activin-associated PIN. The evaluation of candidate genes that emerge from these experiments provides a rational approach to investigate those genes significant in evolution from PIN to prostate carcinoma.
