In the current study, we aimed to understand the potential role of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) in TMZ-resistance of U251 glioma cells. We established TMZ-resistant U251 clones (U251/TMZ cells), which expressed low level of LRIG1, but high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), topoisomerase-2 (Topo-2) and Bcl-2. Depletion of LRIG1 by the targeted RNA interference (RNAi) upregulated EGFR/Topo-2/Bcl-2 in U251 cells, and the cells were resistant to TMZ. Reversely, over-expression of LRIG1 in U251 cells downregulated EGFR/Topo-2/Bcl-2 expressions, and cells were hyper-sensitive to TMZ. Our data suggested EGFR-dependent mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation was important for Topo-2 and Bcl-2 expressions in U251/TMZ cells. The EGFR inhibitor and the mTOR inhibitor downregulated Topo-2/Bcl-2 expressions, both inhibitors also restored TMZ sensitivity in U251/TMZ cells. Finally, inhibition of Topo-2 or Bcl-2 by targeted RNAi(s) knockdown or by the corresponding inhibitor re-sensitized U251/TMZ cells to TMZ, indicating that both Topo-2 and Bcl-2 were important for TMZ resistance in the resistant U251 cells. Based on these results, we concluded that LRIG1 inhibits EGFR expression and the downstream signaling activation, interferes with Bcl-2/Topo-2 expressions and eventually sensitizes glioma cells to TMZ.
