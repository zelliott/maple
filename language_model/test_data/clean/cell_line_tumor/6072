SIRT1 is a NAD-dependent deacetylase that participates in cellular controls of gene expression, metabolism, genomic stability and anti-aging. Here we report that SIRT1 levels rise in prometaphase leading to SIRT1 global association with mitotic chromatin until telophase. Moreover, SIRT1 contributes to chromosomal condensation by mediating chromosomal loading of histone H1 and the condensin I complex. Consistently, SIRT1 knockdown led to improper condensation and overall aberrant mitosis. Our data highlight new role for SIRT1 in maintenance of chromosome stability in mitosis and suggests how diminished SIRT1 activity during aging and tumorigenesis may lead to aneuploidy and genomic instability.
