Vertihemipterin A, the ascochlorin glycoside, and its aglycone, 4',5'-dihydro-4'-hydroxyascochlorin, were isolated from the insect pathogenic fungus Verticillium hemipterigenum BCC 2370. A new analog, 8'-hydroxyascochlorin, and five known compounds, ascochlorin, LL-Z1272delta, 8',9'-dehydroascochlorin, ascofuranone and ascofuranol, were also isolated from the same fermentation broth. Structures of these compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods. Stereochemistry of the known compound, 4',5'-dihydro-4'-hydroxyascochlorin, was addressed by NMR spectral analyses and the modified Mosher's method. Antiviral (HSV-1) and cytotoxic activities of these ascochlorin analogs were evaluated.
