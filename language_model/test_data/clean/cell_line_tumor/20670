To investigate acquired paclitaxel (PTX) resistance in cancer cells, we             established five monoclonal PTX-resistant cell lines from HEC-1 human endometrial             adenocarcinoma cells by means of long-term PTX-exposed cultures and limiting dilution             cultures. The established PTX-resistant subclones showed apparent resistance to             PTX-induced DNA fragmentation but not to PTX-induced growth suppression. None             of the five PTX-resistant subclones showed apparent resistance to other anticancer             drugs such as cisplatin, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, pirarubicin-HCl, 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide             or mitomycin C. Semiquantitative flow cytometric analysis revealed no apparent             differential expression of 17 molecules that were previously reported to regulate             apoptosis or drug resistance, between the five PTX-resistant subclones and the             parent cells. Karyotyping analysis revealed common changes in chromosomes 4 and             18 in the five PTX-resistant subclones but not in the HEC-1 parent cells. These             results indicate that PTX-induced growth suppression is regulated by different             mechanisms from those involved in PTX-induced apoptosis. It was concluded that             these established PTX-resistant subclones can be useful models in studies related             to the prevention or treatment of recurrent cancers after PTX chemotherapy.
