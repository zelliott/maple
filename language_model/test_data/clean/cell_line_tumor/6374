Tanacetum parthenium Schultz Bip. (Asteraceae) is an aromatic perennial plant, widely distributed in the northern hemisphere. This species traditionally has been used in insecticides, cosmetics, balsams, dyes, medicines and preservatives.

The essential oil of T. parthenium was obtained by hydrodistillation in three developmental stages and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antibacterial activity of the oils was investigated against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria. The oil was tested for cytotoxicity against THP-1 cells using the Trypan blue assay.

Twenty-nine components were identified in the essential oil; the highest amount was extracted at the flowering stage. The main component, in the flowering stage, was camphor (18.94%) and other major components were bornyl acetate (18.35%), camphene (13.74%), bornyl isovalerate (3.15%), borneol (10.93%), juniper camphor (6.23%) and β-eudesmol (2.65%). Minimum inhibitory concentration of essential oil was evaluated from 4 µL mL(-1) against Staphylococcus subtilis to 38 µL mL(-1) against Entrobacter aerogenes. Toxicity assay showed that the oil has no significant toxicity at 5-15% v/v concentrations on THP-1 cells.

This study demonstrates the occurrence of camphor/bornyl acetate chemotype of T. parthenium in western regions of Iran. The finding showed also the studied oils have relatively good antibacterial activity without significant toxicity, thus have great potentiality to be used as natural health product.
