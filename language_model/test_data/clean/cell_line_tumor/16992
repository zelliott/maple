Infective endocarditis is frequently attributed to oral streptococci. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms are not well understood, interaction between streptococci and phagocytes is thought to be important for infective endocarditis. In this study, HL-60 cell-derived monocytes were characterized following interaction with Streptococcus gordonii DL1. Exposure of monocytes to S. gordonii DL1 induced up-regulation of the dendritic cell (DC) markers CD83, CD1a, CD86, and interleukin-12, while monocyte markers PU.1 and MafB, which are typically present at low levels in mature DCs, were down-regulated. Interaction of HL-60-derived monocytes with S. gordonii DL1 was instructive for DC differentiation in the absence of released cytokines. Furthermore, neither the filtered culture medium of S. gordonii nor the hsa mutant, deficient in sialic acid-binding activity, was able to induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that monocytes stimulated with S. gordonii DL1 rapidly undergo monocyte-to-DC differentiation through interaction with the bacterial surface receptor Hsa and that this response may be the initial step in infective endocarditis by oral streptococci.
