The gene encoding the miR-34a microRNA is a transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor protein and subject to epigenetic inactivation in colorectal cancer and numerous other tumor types. Here, we combined pulsed SILAC (pSILAC) and microarray analyses to identify miR-34a-induced changes in protein and mRNA expression. pSILAC allowed to quantify the de novo protein synthesis of 1206 proteins after activation of a conditional miR-34a allele in a colorectal cancer cell line. âˆ¼19% of the detected proteins were differentially regulated, with 113 proteins being down- and 115 up-regulated. The proteins with a miR-34a seed-matching-sequence in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the corresponding mRNA showed a clear bias toward translational repression. Proteins involved in DNA replication, e.g. the MCM proteins, and cell proliferation, were over-represented among indirectly down-regulated proteins lacking a miR-34a seed-match. The decrease in de novo protein synthesis of direct miR-34a targets correlated with reduced levels of the corresponding mRNA in most cases, indicating an interdependence of both types of regulation. In addition, 43 mRNAs encoding proteins not detected by pSILAC were down-regulated after miR-34a expression and contained miR-34a seed-matches. The direct regulation of selected miR-34a target-mRNAs was confirmed using reporter assays. Via down-regulation of the proteins encoded by these mRNAs miR-34a presumably inhibits glycolysis (LDHA), WNT-signaling (LEF1), invasion/migration (AXL) and lipid metabolism (ACSL1, ACSL4). Furthermore, miR-34a may activate p53 by inhibiting its acetylation (MTA2, HDAC1) and degradation (YY1). In summary, miR-34a presumably participates in multiple tumor suppressive pathways by directly and indirectly suppressing the expression of numerous, critical proteins.
