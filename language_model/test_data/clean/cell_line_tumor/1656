To investigate the inhibitory effect of CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 5 (CMTM5) on xenografted human prostatic cancer in nude mice and its action mechanism.

We established a model of xenografted prostatic cancer by inoculating PC-3 cells subcutaneously into nude mice, and 3 weeks later injected CMTM5 adenovirus locally into the tumor followed by daily observation of the tumor volume and body weight of the experimental animals. All the rats were killed 2 weeks after CMTM5 injection and the tumor tissue harvested for detection of the inhibitory effect of CMTM5 on the expressions of VEGF and NF-kappaB proteins by immunohistochemistry.

The tumor volume was significantly smaller and body weight of the CMTM5-treated mice were (573.39 +/- 175.24) mm3 and (0.55 +/- 0.11) g, respectively, significantly decreased as compared with those of the controls ([1482.50 +/- 327.86] mm3 and [1.31 +/- 0.29] g) (P = 0.03 and P = 0.027). Immunohistochemistry showed that the expressions of VEGF and NF-kappaB were obviously down-regulated in the CMTM5 group in comparison with the control group.

CMTM5 suppresses the growth of prostate cancer by down-regulating the expressions of VEGF and NF-kappaB.
