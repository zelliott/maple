To investigate the effect of siRNA targeting Livin and Survivin gene simultaneously on the proliferation and apoptosis of human colon cancer cells.

SiRNA recombinant expression vectors targeting Livin and Survivin gene simultaneously were constructed and transfected into human colon cancer cell line Lovo. The effects of siRNA recombinant expression vector on Lovo cells were detected by RT-PCR, Western blot, MTT reduction assay and flow cytometry.

It was confirmed by restriction endonuclease and sequence analysis that siRNA recombinant expression vector targeting Livin and Survivin gene simultaneously was constructed successfully. The suppressive rates of siRNA targeting Livin and Survivin gene simultaneously on Livin mRNA and protein expression were 27.9% and 22.3% respectively, and those on Survivin mRNA and protein expression were 32.2% and 40.9% respectively. The survival rate of cancer cells was decreased whereas the apoptotic rate was increased, but the coordinate repression was weaker than Livin and Survivin RNA interference alone.

siRNA targeting Livin and Survivin gene simultaneously can decrease the expression of Livin and Survivin gene, suppress cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in human colon cancer. The coordinate repression was weaker than Livin and Survivin RNA interference alone.
