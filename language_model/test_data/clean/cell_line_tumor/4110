Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-I (PARP-1) enzyme is involved in maintaining DNA integrity and programmed cell death. A virtual screening of commercial libraries led to the identification of five novel scaffolds with inhibitory profile in the low nanomolar range. A hit-to-lead optimization led to the identification of a group of new potent PARP-1 inhibitors, acyl-piperazinylamides of 3-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-quinazolin-2-yl)-propionic acid. Molecular modeling studies highlighted the preponderant role of the propanoyl side chain.
