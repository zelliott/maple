Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Over-expression of HDACs has been reported in lung cancer. The mechanism of highly expressed HDAC1 in lung cancer has yet not been determined. In the present study, we showed that miR-449a/b regulates HDAC1 by directly binding with the 3' untranslated region of the HDAC1. The expression of miR-449a/b was down-regulated and the expression of HDAC1 was up-regulated in primary lung cancer. The down expression of miR-449a/b might be one mechanism for over-expression of HDAC1 in lung cancer. miR-449a/b inhibited cell growth and anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, co-treatment with miR-449a and HDAC inhibitors had a significant growth reduction compared with HDAC inhibitor mono-treatment. These results suggest that miR-449a/b may have a tumor suppressor function and might be a potential therapeutic candidate in patients with primary lung cancer.
