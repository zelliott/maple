During the last few years, the use of type III secretion system-based bacterial vectors for immunotherapy purposes has been assessed in various applications. We showed that a type III secretion-based Pseudomonas aeruginosa vector delivering the ovalbumin (OVA) antigen induced an efficient specific CD8+ T-lymphocyte immune response against OVA-expressing cells. Because of the intrinsic toxicity of the vector, further virulence attenuation was needed. Therefore, we explored the effects of the deletion of quorum-sensing genes and the aroA gene toward toxicity and efficiency of the vector strain. The aroA mutation in our strain (making the strain auxotrophic for aromatic amino acids) conferred a strikingly reduced toxicity, with the bacterial lethal dose being more than 100 times higher than that of the parental strain. The quorum-sensing gene mutation alone was associated with a slightly reduced toxicity. In a prophylactic OVA-expressing melanoma mouse model, an OVA-delivering aroA-deficient mutant was the most efficient at a low dose (10(5)), but dose enhancement was not associated with a greater immune response. The quorum-sensing-deficient strain was the most efficient at a mild dose (10(6)), but this dose was close to the toxic dose. Combination of both mutations conferred the highest efficiency at an elevated dose (10(7)), in agreement with the known negative effects of quorum-sensing molecules upon T-cell activation. In conclusion, we have obtained a promising immunotherapy vector regarding toxicity and efficiency for further developments in both antitumor and anti-infectious strategies.
