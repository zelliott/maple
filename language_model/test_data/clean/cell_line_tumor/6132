To study the anti-tumor metastatic constituents from Lindera glauca.

Constituent isolation and purification was carried by repeated column chromatography (silica gel, Toyopearl HW-40 and preparative HPLC). Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectral data analysis. The anti-tumor metastasis assay was applied to evaluate the isolated compounds of their activities.

Ten compounds (1 - 10) were isolated and their structures were identified by comparison of their spectral data with literature values as follows: Laurotetanine (1), N-methyllaurotetanine (2), reticuline (3), pallidine (4), N-trans-feruloyltyramine (5), N-cis-feruloyltyramine (6), atheroline (7), norisosocorydine (8), [9,9,9-(2) H3]-(1S*, 3S*, 4S*, 8S*)-p-menthane-3,8-diol (9), [9,9,9-(2) H3 ]-(1S*, 3R*, 4S*, 8S*)-p-Menthane-3,8-diol (10). Compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 9 showed positive anti-tumor metastatic activities,and compounds 1, 4, and 5 showed significant anti-tumor metastatic activities.

Compound 3 was isolated from this plant for the first time. Compounds 9 and 10 were isolated from Lindera genus for the first time. Compounds 1, 4, and 5 showed significant anti-tumor metastatic activities.
