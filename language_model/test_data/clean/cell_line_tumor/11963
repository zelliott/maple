The effects of sophorolipid on the growth and apoptosis of H7402 human liver cancer cells were investigated. By treatment with sophorolipid, a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation was observed. The cells developed many features of apoptosis, including condensation of chromatin, nuclear fragmentation, and appearance of apoptotic bodies, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling positive cells were stained dark brown. Sophorolipid treatment induced apoptosis in H7402 cells by blocking cell cycle at G1 phase and partly at S phase, activating caspase-3, and increasing Ca2+ concentration in cytoplasm. These findings may suggest a potential use of sophorolipid for liver cancer treatment.
