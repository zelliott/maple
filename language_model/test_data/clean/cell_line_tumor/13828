The association of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) expression with differentiated breast tumors presenting a lower metastasis risk could be explained by the estrogen modulation of cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness. Since desmosomes play a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion and may interfere in tumor progression, we studied their regulation by estrogens in human breast cancer and normal mammary cells. Estrogens increased the formation of desmosomes in normal and malignant cells. Furthermore, four desmosomal proteins (desmocollin, γ-catenin, plakophilin and desmoplakin) appeared significantly up-regulated by estrogens in three ERα-expressing cancer cell lines and this effect was reversed by a pure antiestrogen. Finally, silencing of ERα or desmoplakin expression by specific siRNA revealed that estrogen-modulated desmosomal proteins are essential for the estrogenic control of intercellular adhesion. This estrogen modulation of desmosome formation could contribute to the lower invasiveness of ERα-positive tumors and to the integrity of epithelial layers in estrogen target tissues.
