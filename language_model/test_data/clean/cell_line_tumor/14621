This chapter provides a protocol for qualitative evaluation of nanoparticle internalization by phagocytic cells such as macrophages. This protocol uses luminol chemiluminescence to detect nanoparticle uptake. This protocol provides a preliminary qualitative look at phagocytosis which should be confirmed by other techniques such as electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, or as applicable to a given nanoparticle sample.
