The synthesis and SAR of a series of 2,4-diamino-quinazoline derivatives as beta-catenin/Tcf-4 inhibitors are described. This series was developed by modifying the initial lead 1, which was identified by screening of our compound library and found to inhibit the beta-catenin/Tcf-4 pathway. Replacement of the biphenyl moiety in compound 1 with the N-phenylpiperidine-4-carboxamide chain as in 2, resulted in a number of new analogues, which are potent inhibitors of the beta-catenin/Tcf-4 pathway. Compound such as 16k exhibited good cellular potency, solubility, metabolic stability and oral bioavailability.
