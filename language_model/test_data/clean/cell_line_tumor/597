To screen the radiosensitivity-related genes of colorectal cancer cells.

Gene expression profiles of two different radiosensitivity cells(colorectal cancer cell line Lovo and SW480) were obtained by cDNA array and the differences of gene expression profiles between the two cells were analyzed.

Genes of more than 2-fold expressive differentiation were screened. In Lovo cells, 908 up-regulated genes were found, including higher expression genes CEACAM5, THBS1, SERPINE2, ARL7, HPGD, while 1312 genes were down-regulated. In SW480 cells, higher expression genes were SCD, NQ01, LYZ, KRT20 and ATP1B1.

Gene profiles can reflect the radiosensitivity of colorectal cancer cells, which will provide the choice for the further study of radiosensitivity in colorectal cancer.
