Although new therapies have doubled the survival of multiple myeloma patients, this remains an incurable disease. It has been postulated that the so-called myeloma cancer stem cells would be responsible for tumor initiation and relapse but their unequivocal identification remains unclear. Here, we investigated in a panel of myeloma cell lines the presence of CD20(+) cells harboring a stem-cell phenotype. Thus, only a small population of CD20(dim+) cells (0.3%) in the RPMI-8226 cell line was found. CD20(dim+) RPMI-8226 cells expressed the plasma cell markers CD38 and CD138 and were CD19(-)CD27(-). Additionally, CD20(dim+) RPMI-8226 cells did not exhibit stem-cell markers as shown by gene expression profiling and the aldehyde dehydrogenase assay. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CD20(dim+) RPMI-8226 cells are not essential for CB17-SCID mice engraftment and show lower self-renewal potential than the CD20(-) RPMI-8226 cells. These results do not support CD20 expression for the identification of myeloma cancer stem cells.
