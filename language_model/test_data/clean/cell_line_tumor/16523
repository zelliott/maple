Therapeutic gene delivery systems offer the potential for the treatment of a range of inherited and acquired inherited diseases. In contrast with viral gene vectors, the nonviral gene vectors provide a safer alternative and additional advantage such as the improved delivery efficiency, low cost, and often unlimited capacity to package DNA. Here we describe preparation of nonviral gene delivery technique based on lipid:peptide:DNA (LPD) complexes. The size of LPD particles is in the nanometre range. The use of these nanoparticulate LPDs results in high efficiency transfections and a high level of gene expression in vitro. LPDs provide a convenient and efficient tool for gene therapy for the gene delivery.
