Human malignant mesothelioma (HMM), which is strongly related to asbestos exposure, exhibits high resistance to many anticancer drugs. Asbestos fibre deposition in the lung may cause hypoxia and iron chelation at the fibre surface. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, which is upregulated by a decreased availability of oxygen and iron, controls the expression of membrane transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which actively extrude the anticancer drugs. The present study aimed to assess whether asbestos may play a role in the induction of doxorubicin resistance in HMM cells through the activation of HIF-1alpha and an increased expression of Pgp. After 24-h incubation with crocidolite asbestos or with the iron chelator dexrazoxane, or under hypoxia, HMM cells were tested for HIF-1alpha activation, Pgp expression, accumulation of doxorubicin and sensitivity to its toxic effect. Crocidolite, dexrazoxane and hypoxia caused HIF-1alpha activation, Pgp overexpression and increased resistance to doxorubicin accumulation and toxicity. These effects were prevented by the co-incubation with the cell-permeating iron salt ferric nitrilotriacetate, which caused an increase of intracellular iron bioavailability, measured as increased activity of the iron regulatory protein-1. Crocidolite, dexrazoxane and hypoxia induce doxorubicin resistance in human malignant mesothelioma cells by increasing hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha activity, through an iron-sensitive mechanism.
