Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition             (EMT) has been shown to be related to the pathogenesis of various diseases including             lung cancer. Recently, microRNAs (miRNA) have been recognized as a new class of             genes involved in human tumorigenesis. MiR-23a/24/27a is a miRNA cluster located             in chromosome 19p13.12, which can function as an oncogene in several human cancers.             In this study, we analyzed miR-23a/24/27a expression in 10 non-small cell cancer             (NSCLC) cell lines by real-time PCR analysis. Correlation between expression of             these miRNAs and TGF-β/Smad signaling was evaluated. We found that miR-23a could             be regulated by TGF-β1 in a Smad-dependent manner in A549 lung adenocarcinoma             cells showing the EMT phenomenon. Knockdown of miR-23a partially restored E-cadherin             expression under conditions of TGF-β1 stimulation. In contrast, overexpression             of miR-23a could suppress E-cadherin expression and stimulate EMT. Furthermore,             A549 cells with overexpressed miR-23a were more resistant to gefitinib compared             to the parental cells. These findings suggest that miR-23a regulates TGF-β-induced             EMT by targeting E-cadherin in lung cancer cells and may be useful as a new therapeutic             target in NSCLC.
