The spectral changes of native fluorophores among normal fibroblasts and cancer cell lines of different metastatic ability are investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. The normal (fibroblast), moderately metastatic (DU-145), and advanced metastatic (PC-3) cell lines were each selectively excited at 300 nm, and their fluorescence emission spectra are analyzed using principal component analysis to explore the differences of the relative contents of tryptophan and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in these cell lines. The results show that the tryptophan emission featured predominantly in the fluorescence spectra of the advanced metastatic cancer cells in comparison with the moderately metastatic cancer and normal cells.
