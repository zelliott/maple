Platelet-enriched plasma (PRP) is used in therapy as a source of growth factors in bone fracture and wound healing; however, few data exist on its role in the different aspects of the healing process. The effect of PRP and of the two main growth factors present in this preparation (platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF] and transforming growth factor-beta [TGF-beta]) was evaluated in vitro using the human osteoblastic cell line SaOS-2, which was shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to express both PDGF-alpha and -beta receptors. Batroxobine-activated PRP was added in different concentrations to SaOS-2 cells to assess cell migration (by a microchemotaxis assay) and cell proliferation (by [3H]-thymidine incorporation into the DNA). Immunoneutralization with anti-PDGF-beta or anti-TGF-beta antibodies allowed the assessment of the specific role of these growth factors. The overall results obtained indicate that PRP dose-dependently stimulates both chemotaxis and cell proliferation. PDGF and TGF-beta appear to exert distinct effects on the two parameters, the former involved in stimulating cell migration and the latter in inhibiting cell proliferation. It is concluded that the different growth factors present in activated PRP can specifically contribute to the main processes of tissue regeneration.
