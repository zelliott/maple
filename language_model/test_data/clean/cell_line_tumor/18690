To examine the usefulness of interleukin-18 (IL-18) in the treatment of osteosarcomas, the effect of IL-18 on the growth of Dunn osteosarcoma cells was investigated. Daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of mouse recombinant IL-18 (2 microg/mouse) suppressed the growth of Dunn osteosarcoma cells transplanted subcutaneously (s.c.) into syngeneic C3H mice. This IL-18-induced suppression was not affected by simultaneous treatment with anti-asialo GM1 serum, which inactivates natural killer (NK) cells. However, IL-18 failed to suppress the growth of Dunn osteosarcoma cells transplanted into BALB/c-nude mice devoid of T lymphocytes or C3H-gld/gld mice deficient in functional Fas ligand (FasL). IL-18 also failed to suppress the growth of Dunn osteosarcoma cells in vitro, although expression of IL-18 receptor mRNA and MyD88 mRNA as well as Fas mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On the other hand, antimouse Fas antibody showed cytotoxicity against Dunn osteosarcoma cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, treatment of C3H mice with IL-18 enhanced the cytotoxic activity of CD8(+) T lymphocytes against Dunn osteosarcoma cells. These results indicate that IL-18 inhibits the growth of Dunn osteosarcoma cells in vivo by enhancing the cytotoxic activity of CD8(+) T lymphocytes through the FasL-Fas system.
