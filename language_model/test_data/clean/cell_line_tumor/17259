Estrogen has been considered to be a neuroprotectant and a neuromodulator in many neuronal cell lines and tissue preparations. The protective effects of estrogen may be mediated through classical estrogen receptors (ERs), or may be due to its anti-oxidant properties which are independent of receptors. The current studies show that 17beta-estradiol (E2) is neuroprotective against beta-amyloid protein 25-35 (Abeta)-, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-, high density culture condition-, and serum deprivation-induced neuronal death in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells. SK-N-SH cells express ERbeta, but not ERalpha, as detected by Western blot analysis. Among all the insults, MPTP, high density culture and serum deprivation induce apoptotic cell death in this cell system as detected by ELISA determination of mono/oligonucleosomes and DNA laddering, while Abeta induces necrotic cell death. The protective effects of E2 are abolished by the addition of tamoxifen and ICI 182,780 in the MPTP treated cells, but not in the other models, suggesting that the effect of E2 in the MPTP model is probably associated with activation of ERbeta. The addition of ICI 182,780 shows a mitogenic effect in SK-N-SH cells in the presence of E2 in control culture or in the Abeta treated groups. Also, ICI 182,780 induced expression of ERalpha. Collectively, the current studies suggest that E2 is neuroprotective in apoptotic and necrotic death induced by multiple insults in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells. Involvement of ER is insult type dependent. ICI 182,780 is able to influence the expression of ERs, probably through upregulation of ERalpha when ERbeta is totally antagonized.
