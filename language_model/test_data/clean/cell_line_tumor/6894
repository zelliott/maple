Hypoxia presents pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic biphasic effects that appear to be dependent upon cell types and conditions around cells. The substantial reports demonstrated that commonly used hypoxia-mimetic agents cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)) and desferrioxamine (DFO) could also induce apoptosis in many different kinds of cells, but the mechanism was poorly understood. In this work, we compare the apoptosis-inducing effects of these two hypoxia-mimetic agents with acute myeloid leukemic cell lines NB4 and U937 as in vitro models. The results show that both of them induce these leukemic cells to undergo apoptosis with a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potentials (DeltaPsi m), the activation of caspase-3/8 and the cleavage of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, together with the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein, a critical regulator for the cellular response to hypoxia. Metavanadate and sodium nitroprusside significantly abrogate DFO rather than CoCl(2)-induced mitochondrial Delta Psi m collapse, caspase-3/8 activation, Mcl-1 cleavage and apoptosis, but they fail to influence DFO and CoCl(2)-induced HIF-1alpha protein accumulation. Moreover, inducible expression of HIF-1alpha gene dose not alter DFO and CoCl(2)-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. In conclusion, these results propose that although both DFO and CoCl(2)-induced leukemic cell apoptosis by mitochondrial pathway-dependent and HIF-1alpha-independent mechanisms, DFO and CoCl(2)-induced apoptosis involves different initiating signal pathways that remain to be investigated.
