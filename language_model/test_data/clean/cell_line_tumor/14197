Examination of the aerial parts of Achillea clavennae afforded eight guaianolides (1-8), three bisabolenes (9-11), four flavonols (12-15), sesamin (lignan) and isofraxidin (coumarin). The structures of the new compounds (2, 4, 5, 7 and 10) were determined by spectroscopic methods. The antiproliferative action of 2, 8, 9 and 12 were tested to HeLa, K562 and Fem-X human cancer cell lines. Guaianolides 2 (9alpha-acetoxyartecanin) and 8 (apressin) showed significant cytotoxic effects to all tested lines and inducumenone (9) exhibited a moderate activity. The most active was flavonol centaureidin (12), already known as cytotoxic compound.
