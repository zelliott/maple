Butein is a flavonoid isolated from the bark of Rhus verniciflua Stokes and the flowers of Butea monosperma, and is known to be a potential therapeutic drug for treating inflammation and cancer. Cyclooxygenase (COX) converts arachidonic acid to prostanoids, and increased expression of its isoform COX-2 has been observed in breast cancer tissues. It has been suggested that COX inhibitors can be used as chemopreventive agents against breast carcinogenesis. This study examined the potential suppressive effect of the flavonoid on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced COX-2 expression in the non-tumorigenic MCF-10A and cancerous MCF-7 breast cells. Immunoblot and mRNA analyses revealed that butein at or below 10 Î¼M significantly inhibited PMA-induced COX-2 expression in these breast cells. The blocking of the PKC signaling pathway appeared to be the underlying mechanism. Butein treatment reduced the amount of phospho-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK-1/2, and the total activity of PKC. Activated ERKs might trigger the transcriptional activation of COX-2. Reporter gene assays as well as electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) illustrated that butein inhibited transcription of this gene. This study showed that butein down-regulated PMA-induced COX-2 expression in both cancerous and non-cancerous breast cells, and such findings could provide the basis for pharmaceutical development of butein.
