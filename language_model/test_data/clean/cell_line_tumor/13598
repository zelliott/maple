Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a photochemical modality approved for cancer treatment. PDT has demonstrated efficacy in early stage lung cancer and esophageal cancer. The accumulation of photosensitizers in cancer cells is necessary to enhance the therapeutic benefits of PDT; however, photosensitizers have low uptake efficiency. To overcome this limitation, a drug delivery system, such as the hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope(HVJ-E) vector, is required. In this study, the combination of PDT and HVJ-E was investigated for enhancing the efficacy of PDT. The photosensitizers that were evaluated included 5-aminolaevulinic acid (5-ALA), protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), and HVJ-PPIX. The uptake of the photosensitizers as increased twenty-fold with the addition of HVJ-E. The cytotoxicity of conventional 5-ALA was enhanced by the addition of HVJ-E vector. In conclusion, HVJ-E vector improved the uptake of photosensitizers and the PDT effect.
