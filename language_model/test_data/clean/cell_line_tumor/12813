The 1-methyl-4-phenyl 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induces reactive astrogliosis, the cellular manifestation of neuroinflammation, in various models of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its mechanism of action on astrocytes is not understood. The effect of melatonin on MPTP-induced neuroinflammation in astrocytes is also not known. The present study demonstrated that MPTP treatment of rat astrocytoma cells, C6 for 24 h significantly increased nitrative and oxidative stress and intracellular calcium (Ca2++) level. MPTP also activated phosphorylated p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (P-p38 MAPK) and up-regulated expressions of inflammatory proteins. Moreover, MPTP modulated mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes via activating nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) translocation. Treatment of melatonin with MPTP reversed all these MPTP-induced changes. Study with deprenyl demonstrates that MPTP is inducing neuroinflammation in astrocytoma cells. The present findings elucidated the molecular mechanism of MPTP-induced neuroinflammation and its modulation by melatonin in astrocytoma cells (C6).
