Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) can kill Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) cells, and CTL have been used for the treatment of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive HL. For patients with EBV-negative HL, this strategy cannot be employed and alternative target structures have to be defined. In order to establish a system for the stimulation of HL-reactive T cells, we used dendritic cells (DC) as antigen-presenting cells for autologous T cells and transfected these DC with RNA from established HL cell lines. After stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with RNA-transfected DC, we analyzed the reactivity of primed PBMC by interferon gamma enzyme-linked immunospot. Our results suggest the presence of antigens with expression in HL cell lines and recognition of these antigens in combination with DC-derived human leukocyte antigen molecules. By the analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus microarray data sets from HL cell lines and primary HL samples in comparison with testis and other normal tissues, we identified HL-associated cancer testis antigens (CTA) including the preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME). After stimulation of PBMC with RNA-transfected DC, we detected PRAME-reactive T cells. PRAME and other HL-associated CTA might be targets for HL-specific immune therapy or for the monitoring of HL-directed immune responses.
