Here are reported the antiproliferative effects of the cannabinoid agonist WIN upon human melanoma cells expressing mRNA and protein for both CB1 and CB2 receptors. While WIN exerted antimitogenic effects, selective CB1 or CB2 agonists were unable to reproduce such effects and selective CB1 and CB2 antagonists did not inhibit WIN-induced cell death. Cells treated with WIN, preincubated with the lipid raft disruptor methylcyclodestrin, were rescued from death. WIN induced activation of caspases and phosphorylation of ERK that were attenuated in cultures treated with methylcyclodestrin. Membrane lipid raft complex-mediated antimitogenic effect of WIN in melanoma could represents a potential targets for a melanoma treatment.
