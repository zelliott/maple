In the present work, we explore the possibility of introducing selectivity to existing chemotherapeutics via the design of non-pro-drug, bi-functional molecules comprising a microtubule-binding agent and a substrate for a disease-associated kinase. The design, synthesis, and in vitro biological evaluation of paclitaxel-thymidine and vinblastine-thymidine bi-functional conjugates are reported here. This work provides the first account of 'kinase-mediated trapping' of cancer therapeutics.
