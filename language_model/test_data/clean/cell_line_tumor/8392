The phytochemical investigation of the root barks of Pittosporum verticillatum Bojer subsp. verticillatum led to the isolation of three new triterpene saponins, 3-O-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)]-[α-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1→3)]-[α-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1→4)]-β-D-glucuronopyranosyl-21-O-(2-acetoxy-2-methylbutanoyl)-R1-barrigenol (1), 3-O-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)]-[α-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1→3)]-[α-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1→4)]-β-D-glucuronopyranosyl-21-O-(2-acetoxy-2-methylbutanoyl)-28-O-acetyl-R1-barrigenol (2), 3-O-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)]-[α-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1→3)]-[α-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1→4)]-β-D-glucuronopyranosyl-21-O-β,β-dimethylacryloyl-22-O-angeloyl-R1-barrigenol (3), and one known saponin senaciapittoside B (4). Their structures were elucidated mainly by 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy and HRESIMS. Compounds 1-4 were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against one human cancer cell line (SW480) and one rat cardiomyoblast cell line (H9c2).
