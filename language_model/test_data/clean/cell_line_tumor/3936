Sprouty1 protein belongs to a family of receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling inhibitors, whose members are usually regulated by growth factors to form a negative feedback loop. Correspondingly fluctuations of Sprouty1 mRNA in response to single growth factors have been observed. In this report, we investigate Sprouty1 protein levels and show that in non-small cell lung carcinoma-derived cells, the expression levels are unaffected by the serum content in the cellular environment. Although cells harboring K-Ras mutations express insignificant higher Sprouty1 levels, ectopic expression of constitutive active Ras in normal human lung fibroblasts fails to augment Sprouty1 protein content. Furthermore, serum starvation for threeâ€‰days has no influence on Sprouty1 expression and addition of serum or of singular growth factors leaves Sprouty protein levels unchanged. Cell cycle analysis reveals that Sprouty1 levels remain constant throughout the whole cell cycle. These data demonstrate that Sprouty1 expression is not connected with mitogenic signaling and cell proliferation.
