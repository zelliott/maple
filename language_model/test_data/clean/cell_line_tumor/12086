To investigate the inhibitory effects of RNAi expression vector suppressing the expression of survivin and inducing the apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cell PANC-1.

The expression of survivin was examined with RT-PCR and immunofluorescence protocols. The survivin gene was cloned into the T-vector and sequenced, at the same time, the RNAi expression vectors aimed survivin were successfully constructed, and then transfected into PANC-1 cells with liposomes. The expression of survivin mRNA was detected with RT-PCR and Western-blot techniques. The rate of cell apoptosis was measured with FACS.

There was a high degree expression of survivin in PANC-1 cells. The DNA sequence was according with the survivin gene in GENE BANK. The survivin expression was inhibited about 70% by pTZU6 + 1-svv2 RNAi expression vectors, and the apoptosis cells increased.

The RNAi expression vector can effectively inhibit the survivin expression and induce the apoptosis in PANC-1 cells.
