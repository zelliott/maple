To study the influence of vaccine of bcr-abl fusion gene fragment on inoculated SP2/0/bcr-abl tumor cells in mice, BALB/c mice were immunized with pVbcr-abl, pVbcr-abl/mIL7 plasmids, respectively, then SP2/0/bcr-abl cells expressing the fragment of bcr-abl fusion gene were inoculated subcutaneously into the groin of BALB/c mice in order to observe the effect of vaccine on growth of inoculated SP2/0/bcr-abl tumor cells. The results showed that there were distinct differences on the time of tumor growth, the time of tumor ulceration, tumor volume and survival time of mice bearing tumor between two immunized groups and two control groups (blank and vacant plasmid groups). The mice immunized with pVbcr-abl/mIL7 lived longer as compared to mice immunized with pVbcr-abl. The tissue of inoculated tumor was more compact, tumor organ was larger, tumor form was irregular in 2 control groups, while the tissue of inoculated tumor was looser, tumor volume was smaller, and with mass inflammatory infiltration in two immunized groups. Moreover, the metastatic tumor cells were found in the livers of control groups, but not observed in two immunized groups. It is concluded that the protection occurred in immunized mice which inhibited the growth of SP2/0/bcr-abl tumor cell in vivo.
