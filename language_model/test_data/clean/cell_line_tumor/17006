To identify potential cancer related glycoproteins in breast cancer cells, we enriched N-linked glycoproteins by lentil lectin from the human breast cancer cell line Hs578T and the normal breast cell line Hs578BST for proteomic comparison. Glycoproteins were separated and compared by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Twenty-four glycoproteins were identified that expressed remarkably differently, among which nine were involved in the progress of collagen synthesis. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha polypeptide II (P4HA2) expression and influence in breast cancer was further investigated. Immunohistochemistry revealed that P4HA2 was upregulated in breast tumor cells compared with its adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, overexpression and RNA interference of P4HA2 showed that P4HA2 expression suppressed cell proliferation and migration in Hs578T in vitro.
