Proteinase 3 is the major autoantigen in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. Earlier studies have shown that circulating leucocytes from patients with Wegener's granulomatosis show elevated proteinase 3 surface expression and mRNA levels. Wegener's granulomatosis patients also have increased levels of proteinase 3 in plasma. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (-564 A/G SNP) in the promoter region has been associated with disease. This SNP introduces a new potential Sp1 transcription factor binding site that may be responsible for the observed up-regulated expression of proteinase 3. To investigate this a 740 base pair long region of the promoter was cloned from genomic DNA. The disease-associated -564 A/G, as well as a control -621 A/G exchange, were introduced by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and cloned into a luciferase reporter vector. Endogenous expression levels of proteinase 3 mRNA and promoter activity of the cloned constructs were measured in three myeloid cell lines, HL-60, U937 and NB-4, and in epithelial HeLa cells. The results demonstrate a good correlation between the endogenous proteinase 3 mRNA expression and the promoter activity, as judged by luciferase activity. However, no significant differences in activity between the wild-type, polymorphic and the mutated control variant were found. In conclusion, the -564 A/G polymorphism is not responsible for the increased expression levels seen in myeloid cells from patients with Wegener's granulomatosis.
