The mouse/rat hemokinin-1 (m/rHK-1) was discovered nearly 9 years ago. This molecule is a peptide comprising 11 amino acids. The m/rHK-1 was found to be mainly expressed in central immune organs like bone marrow, and was proven to have lymphopoietic roles in B and T lymphocyte development. m/rHK-1was also reported to have analgesic roles in rat spinal cord, in addition to other functions such as relaxing activity on coronary artery. Unlike its analogues SP, NKA, and NKB, m/rHK-1 does not express in the nervous system. To further study the distribution and function of m/rHK-1, we carried out conventional immunization and cell fusion procedures to acquire the hybridomas secreting specific monoclonal antibodies to m/rHK-1. In the 17 positive clones obtained, three antibodies named 1B12, 2B4, and 4G5 were shown representative in cross-reactivity against m/rHK-1 and its analogues by indirect ELISA, competitive indirect ELISA, and immunofluorescence assays. Among the three clones, the 2B4 monoclonal antibody appeared to be the high-titered and specific clone to m/rHK-1. Monoclonal antibodies to m/rHK-1 will function as good tools in the physiological study of m/rHK-1 in the near future.
