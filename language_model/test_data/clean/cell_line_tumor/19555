The emergence of resistance to chemotherapy remains a principle problem in the treatment of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). We demonstrate that extracellular matrix (ECM) activates phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) signaling in SCLC cells and prevents etoposide-induced caspase-3 activation and subsequent apoptosis in a beta1 integrin/PI3-kinase-dependent manner. Crucially we show that etoposide and radiation induce G2/M cell cycle arrest in SCLC cells prior to apoptosis and that ECM prevents this by overriding the upregulation of p21(Cip1/WAF1) and p27(Kip1) and the downregulation of cyclins E, A and B. These effects are abrogated by pharmacological and genetic inhibition of PI3-kinase signaling. Importantly we show that chemoprotection is not mediated by altered SCLC cell proliferation or DNA repair. Thus, ECM via beta1 integrin-mediated PI3-kinase activation overrides treatment-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, allowing SCLC cells to survive with persistent DNA damage, providing a model to account for the emergence of acquired drug resistance.
