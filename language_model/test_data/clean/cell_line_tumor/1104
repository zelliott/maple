Phthalates are widely used in industry and cause public concern since they have genomic estrogenic-like effects via estrogen receptors. We previously found that some phthalates have nongenomic effects, exerting inhibitory effects on the functional activities of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in bovine chromaffin cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of eight phthalates on the calcium signaling of human nAChR by using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. All eight phthalates, with different potency, have inhibitory roles on the calcium signaling coupled with human nAChR, but not muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). For inhibition of human nAChR, the strongest to weakest potencies were observed as di-n-pentyl phthalate (DPP) --> butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) --> di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) --> dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP) --> di-n-hexyl phthalate (DHP) --> di-(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP) --> di-n-propyl phthalate (DPrP) --> diethyl phthalate (DEP). The potencies of phthalates were associated with their structures such that the most effective ones had dialkyl group carbon numbers of C4 or C5, with shorter or longer numbers resulting in decreased potency. At as low as 0.1 microM, DPP, DBP, BBP, DCHP and DHP significantly inhibited the calcium signaling of human nAChR. The IC50 of phthalates on human nAChR, ranging from 0.32 to 7.96 microM, were 10-50 lower than those for bovine nAChR. We suggest that some phthalates effectively inhibit the calcium signaling of human nAChR, and these nongenomic effects are cause for concern.
