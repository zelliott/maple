A series of novel benzothiazole-2-thiol derivatives were synthesized and their structures determined by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and HRMS (ESI). The effects of all compounds on a panel of different types of human cancer cell lines were investigated. Among them, pyridinyl-2-amine linked benzothiazole-2-thiol compounds 7d, 7e, 7f and 7i exhibited potent and broad-spectrum inhibitory activities. Compound 7e displayed the most potent anticancer activity on SKRB-3 (IC(50) = 1.2 nM), SW620 (IC(50) = 4.3 nM), A549 (IC(50) = 44 nM) and HepG2 (IC(50) = 48 nM) and was found to induce apoptosis in HepG2 cancer cells.
