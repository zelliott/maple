Pancreatic carcinoma is one of the most malignant and aggressive cancers. Increased motility and invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells are believed to be associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the molecular basis of EMT in pancreatic cancer cells is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the relationship between Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2), which is an AP-1 inhibitor, and EMT in human pancreatic carcinoma cells. We demonstrated that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) promoted epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced EMT in co-treated human pancreatic BxPC3 cells and that JDP2 overexpression reversed the EMT that was induced by co-treatment with TGF-β1 and EGF. These results suggest that EGF plays a principal role in EMT through its association with TGF-β1 in human pancreatic BxPC3 cells and that JDP2 may be a molecular target for pancreatic carcinoma intervention.
