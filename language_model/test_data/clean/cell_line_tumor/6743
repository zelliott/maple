Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the bone is a high-grade sarcoma characterized histologically by the composition of fibroblasts and pleomorphic cells with a prominent storiform pattern. Despite institution of multi-modality treatments, the prognosis for patients with this tumor remains unsatisfactory. In the present study, towards the goal of developing active immunotherapy for those affected, we established four cell lines from a 53-year-old woman who suffered from MFH of the humerus with lymph node metastases. MFH2003 and MFH2003-B7.1 were the primary lesion-derived cell line and its B7.1-transfectant, respectively. B2003-EBV and TIL2003 were a B cell line established from peripheral blood lymphocytes and a T cell line established from tumor-invaded lymph nodes, respectively. MFH2003 cells could be maintained over a period of 1 year in vitro, and could be xenotransplanted into nude mice. The phenotype of cells analyzed by immunostaining was similar to the original tumor. TIL2003 cells were all CD8+ and specifically recognized MFH2003 cells and MFH2003-B7.1 cells, but not B2003-EBV cells. An anti-HLA-class I monoclonal antibody completely blocked the anti-MFH2003 response of TILs2003. These findings indicate the existence of an anti-MFH specific immune response in the microenvironment of metastatic lymph nodes. The present autologous cell lines provide the basis for identification of novel tumor-associated antigens and may be helpful in the establishment of immunotherapy for patients with MFH of the bone.
