The IGF-II/M6P receptor targets cathepsin D to the lysosomes and it also binds IGF-II. Although the binding sites for IGF-II and cathepsin D are distinct, reciprocal interactions between the ligands have been observed. We have demonstrated that proIGF-II expression modulates routing of cathepsin D. To test the hypothesis that IGF-II modulation of cathepsin D routing in MCF-7 cells involves IGF-II binding to the IGF-II/M6P receptor, we expressed a mutant form of IGF-II (Arg54 Arg55) that does not bind the IGF-II/M6P receptor and evaluated its effects on cathepsin D secretion. Northern blotting, Western and radioimmunoassay analyses confirmed that these cells express high levels of (Arg54 Arg55) IGF-II mRNA and secretes high levels of IGF-II without modulating the secretion of cathepsin D. These data provide direct evidence that the IGF-II modulation of cathepsin D routing is IGF-II/M6P receptor mediated.
