A cationic liposome system consisting of sphingosine (SP) and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) was developed for in vitro and in vivo gene transfer. A nonionic surface active agent of poloxamer 188 was incorporated in the formulations to stabilize the DNA/liposome complex. Comparison of the results obtained from systems with and without the effect of poloxamer 188 was made to investigate the efficiency of gene expression. In vitro transfection study of the DNA/liposome complex showed that with the effect of poloxamer 188, gene transfer into some cell lines was enhanced. In vivo systemic delivery of the DNA/liposome complex with poloxamer 188 demonstrated gene expression with improved luciferase activity in all major organs including lung, spleen, heart, liver, and kidney. High level transgene activity was found in lung and spleen with prolonged gene expression. This was attributed to poloxamer 188 that stabilized the liposome system and produced homogeneous DNA/liposome complex for enhancement of gene delivery.
