The soluble (Gs) and membrane-bound (Gm) forms of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) attachment protein were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from cultures of HEp-2 cells infected with vaccinia virus recombinants expressing either protein. Sucrose gradient centrifugation indicated that Gs, which is secreted into the culture medium, remains monomeric, whereas Gm is an oligomer, probably a homotetramer. Nevertheless, Gs was capable of binding to the surface of cells in vitro, as assessed by a flow cytometry-based binding assay. The attachment of Gs to cells was inhibited by previous heparinase treatment of living cells, and Gs did not bind to CHO cell mutants defective in proteoglycan biosynthesis. Thus, Gs, as previously reported for the G protein of intact virions, binds to glycosaminoglycans presented at the cell surface as proteoglycans. Deletion of a previously reported heparin binding domain from Gs protein substantially inhibited its ability to bind to cells, but the remaining level of binding was still sensitive to heparinase treatment, suggesting that other regions of the Gs molecule may contribute to attachment to proteoglycans. The significance of these results for HRSV infection is discussed.
