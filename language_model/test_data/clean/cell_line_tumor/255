Xenografting of human blood malignancies to immunodeficient SCID mice is a powerful research tool. We evaluate here whether the immunodeficient turkey embryo can also serve as a xenograft host for human blood malignancies. Human leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma lines engrafted robustly into medullary and extramedullary tissues of turkey embryos as detected by PCR, FACS and histology in 8-10 days. Four of eleven patient AML samples also engrafted the bone marrow. Grafts of two lines responded to chemotherapy with doxorubicin. The turkey embryo therefore has the potential to be a complementary xenograft model for the study of human blood malignancies.
