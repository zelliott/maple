This study was to examine the effects of mechanical stimuli alone and coupled with some inhibitors of related signaling pathways on early cellular responses. MG-63 cells were subjected to cyclic uniaxial compressive or tensile strain at 4000 microstrain, produced by four-point bending system. The effects of mechanical strains alone and coupled with inhibitors of microfilament and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-fos mRNA, and c-Fos protein were examined. ERK could be activated by mechanical stimuli in 5 min and so could be c-fos mRNA and c-Fos protein in 30 min. Tensile stress had a more obvious effect than compressive one. Early cellular responses were connected with cytoskeleton and RTK pathways during the transduction of mechanical signals. The property of strains was an influential factor for the activation effects.
