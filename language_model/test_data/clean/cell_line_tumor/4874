To clone full-length human lipopolysaccharide responsive gene(hlrp) and predict its function by bioinformatics analysis; to observe full-length hlrp protein and quantify its relative gene expression in four cell lines.

Total RNA was extracted from LPS-stimulated human embryonic kidney cells HEK293 and the full-length hlrp was obtained by RT-PCR. Function of hlrp was predicted by bioinformatics analysis with Internet and GenBank database. Expression full-length hlrp protein in HEK293, HepG2, HeLa and PDC was observed by laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscope and compared.

Full-length hlrp of 2 045 bp was amplified and sequenced. Leucine zipper was found in the hlrp series that may have an important function. hlrp gene have been mapped to a particular chromosome location in Xp22.2. Laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscope showed hlrp protein was expressed in the cell lines (HEK293, HepG2, HeLa and PDC).

hlrp has been successfully cloned and its function has been predicted. Expression of hlrp has been detected in 4 cell lines. Present result would provide data for the further study of hlrp.
