In a previous study, we showed that a combination of an oral fluoropyrimidine anticancer agent (S-1) and gemcitabine (GEM) had synergistic effects on cell growth and cell cycle arrest in the pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2. Therefore, we conducted further mechanistic studies using the pancreatic cancer cell lines MIA PaCa-2 and SUIT-2. The combined effect of S-1 and GEM in SUIT-2 cells was evaluated using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and the effects of S-1, GEM and S-1 plus GEM on cell cycle regulation were assessed using flow cytometry. We also examined the expression of several cell cycle regulatory proteins in both MIA PaCa-2 and SUIT-2 cells by western blotting. Classical isobolographic analysis of the MTT assay results showed that the combination of S-1 and GEM had a synergistic effect in SUIT-2 cells, and flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle showed that the combination of S-1 plus GEM induced S-phase arrest to a greater degree than did either S-1 or GEM alone. Also, the combination of S-1 and GEM resulted in the downregulation of cyclin D1 expression and upregulation of cyclin A, p21 and p27 expression levels. Treatment of MIA PaCa-2 and SUIT-2 cells with a combination of both drugs also led to the increased phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1. Combined treatment with S-1 and GEM resulted in more prolonged S-phase arrest than with either treatment alone. This difference is shown to be potentially due to the higher levels of phosphorylated checkpoint kinase 1 in pancreatic cancer cell lines treated with the two agents.
