We investigated the effect of the charge and the hydrophobicity of drug delivery system (DDS) carriers on their specificity to living malignant melanoma B16F10 cells with the atomic force microscope. To model various nanoparticle DDS carriers, we used silica particles that were modified with silane coupling agents. We then measured the compression and decompression forces between the modified colloid probes and the living B16F10 cell in a physiological buffer as a function of their separation distances. The maximum adhesive force on decompression was related to the strength of the specificity of the DDS to the malignant cell. A comparison of the average maximum adhesive force of each functionality group surprisingly showed that negatively charged surfaces and hydrophobic modified surfaces all had similar low values. Additionally, we saw the unexpected result that there was no observable dependence on the degree of hydrophobicity of the probe surface to a B16F10 cell. Only the positively charged particle gave a strong adhesive force with the B16F10 cell. This indicated that DDS carriers with positive charges appeared to have the highest affinity for malignant melanoma cells and that the use of hydrophobic materials unexpectedly did not improve their affinity.
