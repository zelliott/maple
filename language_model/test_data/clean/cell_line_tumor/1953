The present study demonstrated the potential antimetastatic and antiinvasive effect of berberine using both in vivo mouse lung metastasis and in vitro models. Administration of berberine resulted in significant suppression of B16F-10 melanoma induced tumor nodule formation and enhanced the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Berberine treatment also decreased various biochemical parameters associated with lung metastasis. These inhibitory actions may be due to the significant suppression of several signaling molecules such as ERK1/2, NF-ÎºB, ATF-2 and CREB involved in the transcription signaling pathways for MMP gene expression. It could also inhibit the migration and invasion of highly metastatic murine melanoma cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The results clearly show that berberine could significantly inhibit experimental lung metastasis produced by intravenous injection of B16F-10 melanoma cells and this effect could be linked to the down-regulation of metastasis-related signaling molecules.
