Breast tissue possesses the enzymes for local estrogen biosynthesis. We measured the effect of Estradiol (E2), Tibolone (OrgOD14) and its metabolite Org4094 on estrone sulfate (E1S)-sulfatase (STS) using breast cancer (MCF-7) and non-malignant breast cells (HBL-100). Cells were cultured in 5% steroid depleted fetal calf serum for 3 days and subsequently incubated with each steroid for either 24 h or directly in cell extracts. STS mRNA and protein expression, and its subcellular localization were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. STS activity was evaluated by incubating homogenized breast cells with [(3)H]-E1S. The products E1 and E2 were separated by thin layer chromatography. STS was co-localized with the Golgi marker protein GM130 and the endoplasmic reticulum marker protein calnexin. Treatment did not significantly alter STS mRNA expression. STS protein expression was increased by each steroid in HBL-100 cells but by E2 only in MCF-7 cells. 24 h incubation with OrgOD14 and Org4094 did not alter STS activity in both cell lines. However, STS activity was significantly diminished in HBL-100 but slightly increased in MCF-7 cells by 24 h treatment with E2. "Direct" incubation of cell extracts, eliminating cellular regulation of metabolism, reduced estrogen biosynthesis regardless of cell line and treatment. In conclusion, the immediate reduction of estrogen biosynthesis by OrgOD14 is counteracted by an increased STS protein expression. On the contrary, E2 exerts a differential effect on STS in HBL-100 and MCF-7 cells. The transition from normal to malignant breast cells may be accompanied by an abolished autoregulation of local estrogen formation.
