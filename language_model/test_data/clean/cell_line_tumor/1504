We report a unique amplification technique that works efficiently and specifically over a temperature range, rather than at one specific temperature, throughout the amplification process. As bisulfite-modified DNA is one of the difficult to amplify templates, we used this technique to amplify regions of promoter-associated CpG island for 11 genes using this template. This technique amplified specific products for every gene without requiring any optimization.
