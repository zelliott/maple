Toxic cyanobacterial blooms are a worldwide problem, causing serious water pollution and public health hazard to humans and livestock. The intact cells as well as the toxins released after cellular lysis can be responsible for toxic effects in both animals and humans and are actually associated with fish kills. Two fish cell lines-PLHC-1 derived from a hepatocellular carcinoma of the topminnow Poeciliopsis lucida and RTG-2 fibroblast-like cells derived from the gonads of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were exposed to several concentrations of extracts from a natural cyanobacterial bloom and a Microcystis aeruginosa-isolated strain. After 24 hours, morphologic and biochemical changes (total protein content, lactate dehydrogenase leakage, neutral red uptake, methathiazole tetrazolium salt metabolization, lysosomal function, and succinate dehydrogenase [SDH] activity) were investigated. The most sensitive end point for both cyanobacterial extracts in PLHC-1 cells was SDH activity, with similar EC(50) values (6 microM for the cyanobacterial bloom and 7 microM for the isolated strain). RTG-2 cells were less susceptible according to SDH activity, with their most sensitive end point lysosomal function with an EC(50) of 4 microM for the M. aeruginosa-isolated strain and 72 microM for the cyanobacterial bloom. The lysosomal function was stimulated at low concentrations, although SDH activity increased at high doses, indicating lysosomal and energetic alterations. Increased secretion vesicles, rounding effects, decreased cell numbers and size, hydropic degeneration, esteatosis, and apoptosis were observed in the morphologic study. Similar sensitivity to the M. aeruginosa-isolated strain was observed in both cell lines, whereas the cyanobacterial bloom was more toxic to the PLHC-1 cell line.
