To study the effect of Kanglaite injection on cyclooxygenase activity in lung carcinoma A549 cells.

The expression of mRNA of COX-1 and COX-2 were measured by RT-PCR. The expression of COX-2 protein was measured by Western-blot.

Kanglaite injection could selectively decreased COX-2 mRNA expression and protein expression while COX-1 mRNA expression was unchanged.

Kanglaite injection is selectively inhibitory agent of COX-2, and possess inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenase 2.
