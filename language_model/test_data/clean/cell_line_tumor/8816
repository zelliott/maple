Viral nanoparticles (VNPs) have shown great potential as platforms for biomedical applications. Before using VNPs for further biomedical applications, it is important to clarify their biological behavior in vivo, which is rare for rod-like VNPs. In this paper, a study of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a typical rod-like VNP, is performed on blood clearance kinetics, biodistributions in both normal and tumor-bearing mice, histopathology and cytotoxicity. TMV was radiolabeled with (125)I using Iodogen method for in vivo quantitative analysis and imaging purpose. In the normal mice, the accumulation of TMV in the immune system led to a rapid blood clearance. The uptake of TMVs in the liver was less than that in the spleen, which is opposite to the results observed in the case of spherical VNPs. No signs of overt toxicity were observed in examined tissues according to the results of histological analysis. In addition, similar biodistribution patterns were observed in U87MG tumor-bearing mice.
