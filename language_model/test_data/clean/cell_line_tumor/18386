To identify the characteristics of ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated carcinomas, 8 lesions, high-grade dysplasias and invasive carcinomas, were implanted into severely combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice and/or cultured in vitro. Intramucosal neoplasias consisting of high-grade dysplasia showed extremely slow proliferation after implantation (2/3 cases) and in vitro culture failed (4 cases). However, invasive carcinomas demonstrated rapid growth both after SCID mouse implantation and in vitro (4/4 cases). From two cases of invasive carcinomas, 6 cell lines were established, and these are the first to be described in the literature. In addition to variation in immunohistochemically determined phenotypic expression regarding alpha-fetoprotein, chromogranin A and estrogen receptors, the established cell lines showed varying differentiation (moderately or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with multinuclear giant cells and bone formation). The results are in contrast with findings for sporadic colorectal carcinomas. Although the prevalence of DNA alterations is not frequent, loss of heterozygosity (17p and 18q) and deletion of exons 8 to 11 in DPC-4 were revealed in all of 6 cell lines, suggesting relatively high genetic instability. We found loss or translocation of many chromosomes (#3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 19) other than chromosomes 1, 5, 8, 11, 13, 17 and 18, which are frequently involved in sporadic colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Thus, the established cell lines may be good models of tumorigenesis and progression in the chronic inflammation-carcinoma sequence.
