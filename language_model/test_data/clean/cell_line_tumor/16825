To observe the effects of lead on mRNA and protein expression of PKC in U251 cell line.

After U251 cells were exposed to 0.05, 0.50, 5.00, 50.00, 500.00, 900.00 and 1000.00 micromol/L Ph(Ac)2 for 24 hours, the cytotoxicity of Pb on U251 cells was measured by MTT assay. RT-PCR and Western blot assay were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of PKC in U251 cells exposed to 0.05, 5.00 and 500.00 micromol/L Ph (Ac), for 24 hours.

The survival rates of U251 cells treated with 5.00, 50.00, 500.00, 900.00 and 1000.00 micromol/L Pb (Ac)2 were 84.5%, 78.2%, 76.5%, 50.3% and 43.2%, respectively, which were significantly lower than those of control group (P < 0.01). The PKC mRNA expression level (0.40 +/- 0.01) of U251 cells treated with 500.00 micromol/L Pb (Ac)2 was significantly lower than that (0.51 +/- 0.02) of control group (P < 0.01). The PKC protein expression levels of U251 cells treated with 0.05, 5.00 or 500.00 micromol/L Pb(Ac)2 were 0.68 +/- 0.02, 0.62 +/- 0.01 and 0.33 +/- 0.02, respectively, which were significantly lower (0.98 +/- 0.01) than those of control group (P < 0.01).

Lead can decline the cell viability, PKC mRNA and protein expression levels of U251 cells.
