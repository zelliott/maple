We have experimentally investigated the detoxifying and modifying effects of remaxol in the framework of traditional and high-dose chemotherapy in mice with transplanted tumors. The influence of remaxol in comparison with heptral was studied on the toxic and therapeutic action of cytostatic drugs gemzar, lastet (etoposide), and methotrexate during their traditional and high-dose administration in mice with transplanted P388 lympholeukosis. Remaxol demonstrated a detoxifying action with respect to these cytostatic agents, which decreased in the following series: gemzar lastet methotrexate (according to the results of lethality evaluation). Remaxol significantly increased the therapeutic efficacy of gemzar used in both traditional and high-dose regimes. This was manifested by slowing down tumor growth and increasing animal lifetime during combined administration of the drugs. This may be due to the remaxol potentiation of the antitumor effect of gemzar. In combination with lastet and methotrexate, remaxol does not alter their therapeutic efficacy. The detoxifying action of remaxol with respect to these cytostatics is more pronounced than that of heptral.
