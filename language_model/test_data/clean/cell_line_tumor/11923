To study the protective effect of adenovirus mediated brain derived neurotrophic factors on nerve injury.

SH-SY5Y cells were infected by the recombinant Ad-BDNF. In the serum-free condition, the morphological changes were observed, and MTT method was used to examine the trophic effects of different dosages of Ad-BDNF. The whole cells DNA of infected and control groups were extracted to detect the DNA ladder--the marker of apoptosis.

The adenoviruses mediated BDNF gene promoted the cell survival and differentiation. It also inhibited the serum-deprived induced cell apoptosis.
