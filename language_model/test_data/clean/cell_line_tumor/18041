The effects of dietary plant sterols on human drug efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1, ABCC1) were investigated using P-gp-overexpressing human carcinoma KB-C2 cells and human MRP1 gene-transfected KB/MRP cells. The effects of natural phytosterols found in foods, herbs, and dietary supplements such as beta-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, fucosterol, and z-guggulsterone were investigated. The accumulation of daunorubicin or rhodamine 123, fluorescent substrates of P-gp, increased in the presence of guggulsterone in KB-C2 cells. The efflux of rhodamine 123 from KB-C2 cells was inhibited by guggulsterone. Guggulsterone also increased the accumulation of calcein, a fluorescent substrate of MRP1, in KB/MRP cells. The ATPase activities of P-gp and MRP1 were stimulated by guggulsterone. These results suggest that guggulsterone, a natural dietary hypolipidemic agent have dual inhibitory effects on P-gp and MRP1 and the potencies to cause food-drug interactions.
