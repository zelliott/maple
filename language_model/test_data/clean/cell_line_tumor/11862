Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is associated with poor prognosis in malignant tumors. Sodium/glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1) is an active glucose transporter that is overexpressed in many cancers including prostate cancer. Previously, we found that EGFR interacts with and stabilizes SGLT1 in cancer cells.

In this study, we determined the micro-domain of EGFR that is required for its interaction with SGLT1 and the effects of activation/inactivation of EGFR on EGFR-SGLT1 interaction, measured the expression of EGFR and SGLT1 in prostate cancer tissues, and tested the effect of inhibition of SGLT1 on the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to EGFR tyrosine inhibitors.

We found that the autophosphorylation region (978-1210 amino acids) of EGFR was required for its sufficient interaction with SGLT1 and that this interaction was independent of EGFR's tyrosine kinase activity. Most importantly, the EGFR-SGLT1 interaction does not respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase modulators (EGF and tyrosine kinase inhibitors). EGFR and SGLT1 co-localized in prostate cancer tissues, and inhibition of SGLT1 by a SGLT1 inhibitor (Phlorizin) sensitized prostate cancer cells to EGFR inhibitors (Gefitinib and Erlotinib).

These data suggest that EGFR in cancer cells can exist as either a tyrosine kinase modulator responsive status or an irresponsive status. SGLT1 is a protein involved in EGFR's functions that are irresponsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and, therefore, the EGFR-SGLT1 interaction might be a novel target for prostate cancer therapy.
