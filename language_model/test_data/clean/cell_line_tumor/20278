The constitutive activation of the Src family kinases (SFKs) has been established             as a poor prognostic factor in malignant mesothelioma (MM), however, the family             member(s) which contribute to the malignancy have not been defined. This study             aimed to identify the SFK member(s) contributing to cell growth using RNA interference             in various MM cell lines. Silencing of Yes but not of c-Src or Fyn in MM cells             leads to cell growth suppression. This suppressive effect caused by Yes silencing             mainly depends on G1 cell cycle arrest and partly the induction of apoptosis.             Also, the knockout of Yes induces the inactivation of β-catenin signaling and             subsequently decreases the levels of cyclin D necessary for G1-S transition in             the cell cycle. In addition, Yes knockout has less effect on cell growth suppression             in β-catenin-deficient H28 MM cells compared to other MM cells which express the             catenin. Overall, we conclude that Yes is a central mediator for MM cell growth             that is not shared with other SFKs such as c-Src.
