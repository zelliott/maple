The trans-(+/-)-1,2-diaminocyclohexaneplatinum(II) complexes of multidentate L-glutamate (Glu) and L-aspartate (Asp) were prepared and their antitumor activity was examined in relation with their coordination modes. All these complexes were obtained as a mixture of (O,O')- and (O,N)-chelate isomers due to rapid isomerization of the initially formed (O,O')-isomer to the thermodynamically more stable (O,N)-isomer. The (O,O')/(O,N)-isomeric mixture with the mole ratio of 80/20 exhibited excellent antitumor activity while the pure (O,N)-isomer was only marginally active. Therefore, in order to prevent the linkage isomerization of the active (O,O')-isomer to the inactive (O,N)-isomer, we have designed N-substituted amino dicarboxylic acids as a leaving group and prepared a new series of complexes, [Pt(dach)(RGlu)] and [Pt(dach)(RAsp)] (dach=trans-(+/-)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane; R=acetyl (Ac), propionyl (Pro), pivaloyl (Piv), carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) or phthaloyl (Phth)) and characterized by means of elemental analyses, and 1H NMR, 195Pt NMR and IR spectroscopies. The N-substituted amino dicarboxylate ligands were found to coordinate to platinum(II) ion through only the (O,O')-chelation mode, and their Pt(II) complexes were chemically stable in aqueous solution. The present Pt(II) complexes of N-substituted amino dicarboxylic acids showed excellent antitumor activity against both murine leukemia L1210 and human tumor cells. Especially, the highly hydrophobic N-phthaloylglutamate complex, [Pt(dach)(PhthGlu)], exhibited an outstanding in vitro activity (IC50=2.22 microM) on the human stomach cancer cells which are not responsive to cisplatin and carboplatin.
