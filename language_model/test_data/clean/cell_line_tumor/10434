To investigate the effects of glossy ganoderma spore oil on the proliferation, apoptosis, expression of miR-21 and its target genes of human lung adenocarcinoma SPC-A1 cell line, and to explore its possible mechanism.

The SPC-A1 cells were treated with glossy ganoderma spore oil for 24 and 48 hours. The inhibition growth efficacy was determined using cell count kit (CCK-8). Cell morphological changes were observed by light microscopy. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of miR-21, PTEN and PDCD4 were determined by Real-time PCR.

Glossy ganoderma spore oil concentration-dependently inhibited the SPC-A1 cell's proliferation. When the concentration of glossy ganoderma spore oil attained to 0.2%, the cells' morphology changed obviously. Glossy ganoderma spore oil could induce the apoptosis of SPC-A1 cells at low concentration. Glossy ganoderma spore oil down-regulated the expression of miR-21 and up-regulated the expression of PTEN and PDCD4 significantly.

glossy ganoderma spore oil could inhibit the proliferation obviously and cause the changes of cell morphology. Furthermore, glossy ganoderma spore oil induced apoptosis of SPC-A1 cell through down-regulating the expression of miR-21 and up-regulating tumor suppressors.
