An unresolved obstacle in transplantation of islets of Langerhans is the early graft loss caused by thrombotic reactions on the surface of islets after intraportal transplantation. We investigated a versatile method for modifying the surface of islets with liposomes carrying the anticoagulant argatroban using an amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)-phospholipid conjugate derivative (PEG-lipid) and DNA hybridization. Argatroban was gradually released from the liposomes on the islets, and antithrombic activity was detected in culture medium. Modified islets retained the ability to control insulin release in response to glucose concentration changes. Although we mainly examined surface modification of islets, this technique may be useful for immobilizing various types of small molecules on cells and tissues and thus may have many applications in cell therapy and regenerative medicine.
