Aldosterone is principally synthesized in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal by a series of enzymatic reactions leading to the conversion of cholesterol to aldosterone. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the major physiological regulator of aldosterone production acting acutely to stimulate aldosterone biosynthesis and chronically to increase the capacity of the adrenals to produce aldosterone. We previously defined eight transcription factors that are rapidly induced following Ang II treatment using three in vitro adrenocortical cell models. Herein, we investigated the function of these transcription factors in the regulation of the enzymes needed for aldosterone production. H295R adrenal cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for each transcription factor and promoter/reporter constructs prepared for genes encoding the enzymes needed for aldosterone production. NGFI-B family members induced promoter activity of 3-beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD3B2), 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2), and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2). The importance of NGFI-B in the regulation of CYP11B2 was also demonstrated by reduced CYP11B2 transcription in the presence of a dominant-negative-NGFI-B. A pharmacological approach was used to characterize the Ang II pathways regulating transcription of NGFI-B family genes. Transcription of NGFI-B members were decreased following inhibition of Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), protein kinase C (PKC), calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMK), and Src tyrosine kinase (SRC). Taken together, these results suggest that Ang II binding to the AT1R increases activity of PKC, CaMK, and SRC, which act to increase expression of the family of NGFI-B genes as well as CYP11B2. Ang II induction of the NGFI-B family members represents an important pathway to increase the capacity of adrenal cells to produce aldosterone.
