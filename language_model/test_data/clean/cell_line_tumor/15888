The aim of this study is to use multicolor intravital imaging together with an inducible cell model to compare metastatic behavior of control and genetically modified breast cancer cell populations within the intact primary tumor of a mouse.

GFP-MTLn3-ErbB1 cells were generated with doxycycline-regulated conditional transgene expression using lentiviral TREAutoR3-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP). CFP expression together with tumor cell motility is monitored in vitro and in vivo.

Effective and tight control of doxycycline-induced CFP expression was observed both in vitro and in vivo. Intravital multiphoton microscopy on intact orthotopic tumors allowed a clear discrimination between GFP-only and (GFP + CFP) cell populations, which enables direct comparison of the motility behavior of two different cell populations in the same microenvironment in vivo.

This system is robust and versatile for conditional gene expression and can be used to study the role of individual candidate metastasis genes in vitro and in vivo. This technology will allow investigations of cellular events in cancer metastasis and in particular intravasation within a primary tumor.
