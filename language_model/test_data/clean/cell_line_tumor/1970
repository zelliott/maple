RNA interference has promising therapeutic potential. However, safe and efficacious delivery systems are necessary for its application in the clinic.

An oleic acid (OA) derivative of branched polyethylenimine (PEI, M.W. 2000 Da), PEI-OA, was synthesized and evaluated for small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery in SK-HEP-1 liver cancer cells stably transfected with luciferase. The physiochemical properties of PEI-OA/siRNA complexes, their cellular uptake, gene silencing activity based on luciferase reporter gene down-regulation, and cytotoxicity were investigated.

PEI-OA complexes effectively delivered siRNA into SK-HEP-1 cells and efficiently induced down-regulation of luciferase reporter gene expression. Compared with free siRNA and PEI/siRNA, PEI-OA/siRNA was significantly more effective, reducing luciferase activity by ~50%.

PEI-OA warrants further evaluation for therapeutic delivery of siRNA.
