Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is one of the most common high-grade sarcomas in bone and soft tissue and, due to its chemo-resistance, the prognosis of the disease is poor. ST1571 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that was initially developed as a BCR/ABL inhibitor for chronic myeloid leukemia patients. STI571 also selectively inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) and c-kit. We examined the expression of PDGFRs and c-kit in human MFH cell lines, and the effect of STI571 on cell proliferation.

Four human MFH cell lines (TNMY1, GBS-1, Nara-F and Nara-H) were used. mRNA expression of the receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGFRs and c-kit) was analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the inhibitory effect of STI571 on cell proliferation was analyzed using the MTS assay technique.

PDGFRalpha mRNA was expressed in TNMY1 and GBS-1, and PDGFRbeta and c-kit mRNAs were expressed in TNMY1, GBS-1 and Nara-F. All three of these mRNAs were absent in Nara-H. STI571 inhibited cell proliferation of TNMY1, GBS-1 and Nara-F in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but cell proliferation of Nara-H was not inhibited by ST1571 at concentrations of 10 microM or less.

STI571 significantly inhibited proliferation of the three human MFH cell lines that expressed mRNAs of target receptor tyrosine kinases. The inhibitory effect of ST1571 on cell proliferation in these three cell lines might be due to decreased tyrosine kinase activity. STI571 might be a potent chemotherapeutic agent for human MFHs.
