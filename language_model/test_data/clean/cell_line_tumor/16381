A new diphenyl ether methyl 2-(2-formyl-3-hydroxy-5-methylphenoxy)-5-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate (3), together with four known compounds, asterric acid (1), methyl asterrate (2), 9(Z),12(Z)-nonadecadienoic acid (4) and orsellinic acid (5), were isolated from the Phoma sp. strain SHZK-2, which was isolated from a polluted environment in southern China. The structures of these compounds were determined by spectroscopic methods. Cytotoxicities of compounds against HEPG2 cell and Raji cell lines were preliminarily evaluated by the MTT method.
