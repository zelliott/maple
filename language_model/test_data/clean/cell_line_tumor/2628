In this paper, we investigated the feasibility and effect of a novel combination therapy of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) hyperthermia with anticancer drugs for solid malignancies using doxorubicin-loaded alginate-templated magnetic microcapsules (DAMMs) in an animal liver cancer model. Firstly, DAMMs containing 18 nm gamma-Fe2O3 with doxorubicin (Dox) were synthesized and characterized. Then, the particular behavior of Dox release under external alternating current magnetic filed (ACMF) was tested in vitro. Moreover, to obtain accurate thermotherapy, the dose of DAMMs and temperature rise were computed by Hyperthermia treatment plan (HTP) and a fiber optic temperature sensor (FOTS) was used to monitor the temperature rise during treatments on VX-2 liver tumor-bearing rabbits. Furthermore, the therapeutic effect was studied by histopathological examinations and animal survival. The results showed that ACMF can induce Dox fast release during the treatment and the high MNPs content of DMMAs guaranteed the temperature rise for hyperthermia in tumors. The rabbits bearing VX-2 tumors in the magnetic hyperthermia using DMMAs group gained the most tumor necrosis and survival time. It was indicated that DAMMs-based magnetic hyperthermia could be a feasible and effective remedy which could be targeted at liver tumors by dual effects of hyperthermia and chemotherapy.
