A series of tetrasubstituted naphthalene diimide compounds with N-methylpiperazine end groups has been synthesized and evaluated as G-quadruplex ligands. They have high affinity and selectivity for telomeric G-quadruplex DNA over duplex DNA. CD studies show that they induce formation of a parallel G-quadruplex topology. They inhibit the binding of hPOT1 and topoisomerase IIIα to telomeric DNA and inhibit telomerase activity in MCF7 cells. The compounds have potent activity in a panel of cancer cell lines, with typical IC(50) values of ∼0.1 μM, and up to 100-fold lower toxicity in a normal human fibroblast cell line.
