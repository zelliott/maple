Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in males and the ninth most             common in females. However, despite the numerous advances made in the past few             decades, the prognosis of patients with bladder cancer remains poor. Metastasis             is one of the major causes of mortality in bladder cancer patients. Therefore,             the inhibition of metastasis is one of the most significant issues in bladder             cancer research. The present study was conducted to evaluate the anti-metastatic             potential of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, the major phytochemical in green             tea) against bladder cancer and its mechanism of action. EGCG efficiently and             dose-dependently inhibited adhesion, migration and invasion of T24 human bladder             cancer cells. Mechanistically, EGCG inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt             activation that resulted in inactivation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the             inhibition of the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), ultimately             suppressing invasion and metastasis. These findings suggest that EGCG is a potential             therapeutic candidate against tumor invasion.
