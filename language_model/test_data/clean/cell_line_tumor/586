Despite aggressive multimodality therapy, most neuroblastoma-bearing patients relapse and survival rate remains poor. Exploration of alternative therapeutic modalities is needed. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), revealing optical absorbance in the near-infrared region, warrant their merits in photothermal therapy. In order to specifically target disialoganglioside (GD2) overexpressed on the surface of neuroblastoma stNB-V1 cells, GD2 monoclonal antibody (anti-GD2) was conjugated to acidified CNTs. To examine the fate of anti-GD2 bound CNTs after incubation with stNB-V1 cells, rhodamine B was labeled on carboxylated CNTs functionalized with and without anti-GD2. Our results illustrated that anti-GD2-linked CNTs were extensively internalized by neuroblastoma cells via GD2-mediated endocytosis. In addition, we showed that anti-GD2 bound CNTs were not ingested by PC12 cells without GD2 expression. After anti-GD2 conjugated CNTs were incubated with neuroblastoma cells for 6 h and endocytosed by the cells, CNT-laden neuroblastoma cells were further irradiated with an 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) laser with intensity ramping from 0.6 to 6 W cm(-2) for 10 min which was then maintained at 6 W cm(-2) for an additional 5 min. Post-NIR laser exposure, and after being examined by calcein-AM dye, stNB-V1 cells were all found to undergo necrosis, while non-GD2 expressing PC12 cells all remained viable. Based on the in vitro study, CNTs bound with anti-GD2 have the potential to be utilized as a therapeutic thermal coupling agent that generates heat sufficient to selectively kill neuroblastoma cells under NIR laser light exposure.
