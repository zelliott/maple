Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encodes a portal protein that forms a large oligomeric structure believed to provide the conduit for DNA entry and exit from the capsid. Chaperone proteins often facilitate the folding and multimerization of such complex structures. In this report, we show that cellular chaperone proteins, components of the 26S proteasome, and ubiquitin-conjugated proteins are sequestered in discrete foci in the nucleus of the infected cell. The immediate-early viral protein ICP0 was shown to be necessary to establish these foci at early times during infection and sufficient to redistribute chaperone molecules in transfected cells. Furthermore, we found that not only is the portal protein, UL6, localized to these sites during infection, but it is also a substrate for ubiquitin modification. Our results suggest that HSV-1 has evolved an elegant mechanism for facilitating protein quality control at specialized foci within the nucleus.
