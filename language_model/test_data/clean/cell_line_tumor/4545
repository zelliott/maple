This study was designed to identify the cell surface protein markers that can differentiate between chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (APL). The differentially expressed plasma membrane proteins were analyzed between CML cell line (K562) and APL cell line (NB4) using the comparative proteomic approach. The cell membrane proteins were enriched by labeling with a membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin, and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). By comparative proteomic analysis of K562 and NB4 cells, we identified 25 membrane and 14 membrane-associated proteins. The result of LC-MS/MS combined with chemical tagging method was validated by confirming the expression and localization of one of the differentially expressed plasma membrane proteins, CD43, by FACS and confocal microscopy. Our results indicate that CD43 could be a potential candidate for differentiating CML from APL.
