One of the main functions of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family is induction of apoptosis. CD30, a member of the TNFR superfamily is overexpressed in highly proliferating tumors such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). CD30 stimulation leads to apoptosis and growth arrest in cultured ALCL, but not in Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg cells. To identify changes in the transcriptional program responsible for these opposing effects, we performed gene expression analysis in CD30-stimulated ALCL (Karpas 299) and HL (KM-H2) cell lines using cDNA microarrays. Selected genes were validated by real-time PCR. Hierarchical clustering was applied to the whole dataset and separated the cell lines clearly with respect to their origin. In HL, there were only minor CD30-specific alterations, whereas ALCL unequivocally showed a pronounced CD30-specific transcriptional response. Ninety-three genes (6.6% of total) were deregulated by more than a factor of two after CD30 stimulation in ALCL cells. The majority of genes identified are involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. mRNA expression patterns further indicate that in contrast to HL, CD30 stimulation in ALCL induces cell death via the CD95-CD95 ligand (CD95L) pathway and the TNF-R1/TNF-R2 crosstalk. These data provide a detailed view on the transcriptional changes upon CD30 stimulation and may explain the observed functional differences of HL and ALCL.
