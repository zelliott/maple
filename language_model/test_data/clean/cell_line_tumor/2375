As part of our program to develop breast cancer specific therapeutic agents, we have synthesized a conjugate agent that is a conjugate of the steroidal anti-estrogen and the potent cytotoxin doxorubicin. In this effort, we employed a modular assembly approach to prepare a novel 11Î²-substituted steroidal anti-estrogen functionalized with an azido-tetraethylene glycol moiety, which could be coupled to a complementary doxorubicin benzoyl hydrazone functionalized with a propargyl tetraethylene glycol moiety. Huisgen [3 + 2] cycloaddition chemistry gave the final hybrid that was evaluated for selective uptake and cytotoxicity in ER(+)-MCF-7 and ER(-)-MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. The results demonstrated that the presence of the anti-estrogenic component in the hybrid compound was critical for selectivity and cytotoxicity in ER(+)-MCF-7 human breast cancer cells as the hybrid was ~70-fold more potent than doxorubicin in inhibition of cell proliferation and promoting cell death.
