Human lactoferrin (hLF) is a multifunctional glycoprotein that can inhibit cancer growth. The molecular mechanism of hLF-induced tumor growth inhibition is incompletely understood. Moreover, the adenovirus vector-mediated hLF (Ad-hLF) gene therapy on cervical cancer has not been yet characterized. In this study, the replication-deficient Ad-hLF was used to explore tumor growth suppression effects on cervical cancer in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that the recombinant adenovirus encoding hLF delivery resulted in a more differential tumor growth inhibition, and this growth arrest was caused by cell cycle inhibition at G2/M phase. In addition, Fas, a death-inducing receptor, and Bax, a member of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, were increased in the sample of cervical cancer tissue treated by Ad-hLF. Further, it was also observed that caspase-3 was activated and the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 was decreased. These results indicated that the growth inhibitory effects of Ad-hLF on cervical cancer were caused by elevated expression of Fas and decreased the ratio of anti- to pro-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2/Bax.
