To investigate the inhibition effect of Salvia chinensis extraction (SJC) on growth of H22 bearing tumor, and to analyze the mechanism about the anti-tumor effect.

With hepatoma H22 bearing mice, ICR mice were inoculated with H22 cells by subcutaneous injection. On day 2 after inoculation, the ICR mice were randomize into 5 groups, they were the control group, the high, middle, low dosages of SJC, and the positive-control group. Administrated 10 days, the inhibition rate of tumor in the treatment groups were analyzed at 11th day. Meanwhile, Immunostaining with antibodies against CD105 and VEGF were used to investigate the tumor-related angiogenesis. In addition, the effect of SJC on angiogenesis of tumor were investigated on chick embry chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) inoculated H22 cells.

In contrast to model group, the inhibition rate of the high, middle, and low dosages of SJC were 26.44% (P < 0.05), 42.28% (P < 0.01) and 32.59% (P < 0.05), respectively, and SJC could significantly reduced the express of VEGF and microvessel density (MVD) (P < 0.01). Injection with 6.25 g x L(-1) doses of SJC could significantly inhibited the angiogenesis of tumor, the inhibition rate of tumor-related angiogenesis was 50.67% (P < 0.01).

SJC showed anticancer effect, and maybe it is related to down-regulation VEGF and reducing MVD, then inhibiting the tumor-related angiogenesis.
