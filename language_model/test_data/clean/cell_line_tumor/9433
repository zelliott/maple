To compare different expression profiles of all known chemokine receptors in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines with different metastasis potentials.

Eighteen pairs of chemokine receptor primers were designed using Premier software. Expression profiles of the 18 chemokine receptors on four HCC cell lines of lower to higher potentials of metastasis (SMMC-7721, MHCC97-L, MHCC97-H and HCCLM6) were analyzed by RT-PCR. Expression of CXCR4 was detected by RT-PCR.

Expression profiles of chemokine receptors on four HCC cell lines with different metastatic potentials had significant differences (P < 0.01), in which CCR10, CXCR4 and CXCR6 expressions decreased gradually as the metastatic potential of the cell lines increased. The expressions of CCR3, CCR4, CCR10, CCR12 and XCR1 on HCCLM6 were significantly reduced compared with SMMC-7721 (P < 0.01), whereas the expressions of CXCR1 (P = 0.006) and CXCR5 (P = 0.003) exceeded that of SMMC-7721. Except for CXCR2, CXCR6 and XCR1, most of chemokine receptors on MHCC97-H were expressed differently compared with MHCC97-L (P < 0.05), in which expressions of CCR1 (P = 0.002), CCR2 (P = 0.004) and CCR5 (P = 0.046) exceeded MHCC97-L. CXCR4 was detected only on the positive controls and SMMC-7721 when the template of total RNA was reduced one-half in RT-PCR.

Chemokine receptors are expressed very differently at mRNA level on HCC cell lines with different metastatic potentials. The different profiles of chemokine receptors in tumor microenvironment and the function of CXCR4 in HCC should be further studied. Our findings have important implications in understanding the relationship between chemokine receptors and the metastatic potential of HCC.
