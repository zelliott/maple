Regulatory NK cell receptors can contribute to antigen-specific adaptive immune responses by modulating T cell receptor (TCR)-induced T cell activation. We investigated the potential of the NK cell receptor 2B4 (CD244) to enhance tumor antigen-induced activation of human T cells. 2B4 is a member of the CD2 receptor subfamily with both activating and inhibitory functions in NK cells. In T cells, its expression is positively associated with the acquisition of a cytolytic effector memory phenotype. Recombinant chimeric receptors that link extracellular single-chain Fv fragments specific for the tumor-associated surface antigens CD19 and G(D2) to the signaling domains of human 2B4 and/or TCRzeta were expressed in non-specifically activated peripheral blood T cells by retroviral gene transfer. While 2B4 signaling alone failed to induce T cell effector functions or proliferation, it significantly augmented the antigen-specific activation responses induced by TCRzeta. 2B4 costimulation did not affect the predominant effector memory phenotype of expanding T cells, nor did it increase the proportion of T cells with regulatory phenotype (CD4+CD25(hi)FoxP3+). These data support a costimulatory role for 2B4 in human T cell subpopulations. As an amplifier of TCR-mediated signals, 2B4 may provide a powerful new tool for immunotherapy of cancer, promoting sustained activation and proliferation of gene-modified antitumor T cells.
