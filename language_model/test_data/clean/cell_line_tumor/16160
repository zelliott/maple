We have previously shown the inhibition of the small-molecule inhibitor FB2 on imatinib-sensitive and resistance CML cell lines with the wild-type Bcr-Abl fusion gene. Here we report the potent and selective antiproliferation on FB2 on transfected Ba/F3 p210 cell lines expressing various isoforms of Bcr-Abl (wild-type, Y253F, T315I). FB2 which orients Bcr-Abl and Src kinase activities, is shown to override imatinib-resistance CML involving Y253F mutation in the Abl kinase domain of the fusion protein except T315I in vivo and in vitro. Thus, we present FB2 that displays potency toward Bcr-Abl and Src as the molecular target, and which could potentially be used to override drug resistance in CML.
