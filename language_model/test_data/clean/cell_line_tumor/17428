In this report, the development of a microfluidic cell chip for monitoring allergic response is described. A rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3), a tumor analog of rat mucosal mast cells, has been used as a model to observe its allergic response upon antigen stimulus. The cells were cultivated on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) chip, the surface of which was modified by several methods. The PDMS chip, which comprised a cell cultivation chamber and microfluidic channels, was fabricated by conventional molding methods. In order to detect the allergic response, a fluorescent dye, quinacrine, was introduced inside the cell compartment that included histamine. The cells were stimulated with dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) after incubation with anti-DNP IgE. When exocytosis events occurred, the microfluidic system detected the fluorescent signal of quinacrine, which was released from RBL-2H3 cells by using a photomultiplier tube (PMT) fitted onto a microscope.
