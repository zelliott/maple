Annonaceous acetogenins (ACGs), as one of the most powerful groups of mitochondrial complex I inhibitors, exhibit potent cytotoxic activity against a variety of human tumor cell lines. In this study, the antitumor activities of three main types of ACGs were investigated using S180 and HepS xenografts bearing mice simultaneously. The results revealed that select ACGs suppressed tumor growth in a dose-dependent fashion. Tested ACGs showed more selective antitumor activity against HepS. Furthermore, adjacent bis-THF ACGs were more active than mono-THF and nonadjacent bis-THF ACGs against HepS and S180; nonadjacent bis-THF ACGs were more active than mono-THF ACGs against S180, but mono-THF ACGs were more potent than nonadjacent bis-THF ACGs against HepS.
