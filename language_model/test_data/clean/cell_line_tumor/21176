Various animal models of bladder tumor have been developed for the preclinical evaluation of therapeutic modalities for the treatment of bladder cancers. The ideal model for the investigation of therapeutic effects of proposed novel intravesical treatments requires the mass of the implanted tumor to be confined to the urothelium of the bladder at least for the initial phase. However, previously reported bladder tumor models are not suitable for the evaluation of intravesical therapies for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer, since the muscle invasive tumors have developed from the beginnings of the experiments. These models are too aggressive to study local treatment effects. In the current study, we demonstrated that careful instillation of MBT-2 mouse bladder cancer cells into the bladder of a syngenic C3H/HeJ mouse could establish a superficial bladder tumor with an incidence of 100%. The procedure and technique for handling animals are simple for standard animal investigators. Maintenance of the in vitro conditions of MBT-2 cells without contamination of Mycoplasma and careful selection of the substrain of C3H mouse seem to be essential for stable tumor establishment. This bladder tumor model appeared to be easy to reproduce among several investigators in different institutions. The orthotopic bladder tumor model, which was confined to urothelium, lets us evaluate various intravesical treatment strategies.
