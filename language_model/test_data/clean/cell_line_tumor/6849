Here we describe lentivirus-infected cell microarrays for the high-throughput screening of gene function in mammalian cells. To create these arrays, we cultured mammalian cells on glass slides 'printed' with lentiviruses pseudotyped as vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein, which encode short hairpin RNA or cDNA. Cells that land on the printed 'features' become infected with lentivirus, creating a living array of stably transduced cell clusters within a monolayer of uninfected cells. The small size of the features of the microarrays (300 microm in diameter) allows high-density spotting of lentivirus, permitting thousands of distinct parallel infections on a single glass slide. Because lentiviruses have a wide cellular tropism, including primary cells, lentivirus-infected cell microarrays can be used as a platform for high-throughput screening in a variety of cell types.
