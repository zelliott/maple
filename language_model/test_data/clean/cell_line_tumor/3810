The 4:1 supramolecular complexed ionic salt between pyridinium chlorin and polyanionic [Î±-SiMo12O40](4-) exhibits significantly enhanced photodynamic activity against A549 cell lines because of increased singlet oxygen photogeneration through high cellular penetration and localization of the chlorin molecules on the ionic salt into the cancer cell. Confocal laser scanning microscopy images clearly represent a higher uptake and photodynamic effect of this supramolecular complex corresponding to the lower IC50 value compared to the free chlorin.
