To prepare Nano-Liposome encapsulated MAGE3/HSP70(NL M3H) and study its character and antitumor immunity in mouse.

NL M3H was prepared by the thin film-dispersion ultrasonic. The shape and size of NL M3H were detected by electron microscope. The encapsulation rate, drug-carrying capacity, stability and the releasing character were tested by Sephedex-G100 gel filtration. The mouse was immunized by NL M3H, and the antitumor immunity was detected by ELISPOT and LDH release assay.

The mean size of NL M3H was lower than 100 nm. The encapsulation rate was 38%.The drug content was 0.038 g/L. NL M3H has good stability after stored in 4 degrees C for 6 months. The releasing profile showed that 74 percent of proteins was released during the first 24 hours in saline. The results of ELISPOT and LDH release assay showed that NL M3H generated tumor specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte(CTL)to damage tumor cell.

NL M3H has novel characters, it can generate specific CTL to kill tumor cell, and can be used as new kind of vaccine against tumor.
