Sepsis is characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been shown to play an important role in the progression of sepsis thus is a potential therapeutic target. The aim of this study is to produce IgG anti-MIF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with anti-septic abilities in vivo and to determine mechanisms of their function. We generated 8 IgG anti-MIF mAbs with high specificity and 3 of them showed potent protective abilities in murine lethal peritonitis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). One anti-MIF mAb, F11, showed 100% protection within 72 h after sepsis induction and 72% mice treated with this mAb survived up to 84 h with reduced lung and kidney pathology. F11 treatment also reduced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in septic mice. We further found that all 8 anti-MIF mAbs recognized the same epitope located in the amino acid residue 1-20 region of the N terminus of the MIF protein. Three of the mAbs, F11 in particular, inhibited tautomerase activity in association with their protective effect on CLP mice. Thus, we have produced anti-MIF mAbs that protected mice from CLP-induced sepsis by recognizing the same epitope domains in MIF. These mAbs are promising candidates for further development of therapeutics against inflammatory diseases.
