1321N1 astrocytoma cells are frequently used to analyze stimulus-induced intracellular signaling. These experiments require genetic manipulation of the cells and several chemical and physical methods have been employed in the past. Recently, microporation has been suggested as the best method to transfect 1321N1 astrocytoma cells. Here, we demonstrate that lentiviral gene transfer into 1321N1 cells is highly efficient, cheap and non-toxic. In addition, lentiviral gene transfer efficiently facilitates stable expression of small hairpin RNAs. Finally, lentiviral gene transfer can be used to implant promoter/luciferase reporter genes into the chromatin of the cells, allowing promoter studies using templates that are embedded into the nucleosomal structure of the chromatin.
