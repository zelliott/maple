CS055 (Chidamide/HBI-8000) is a novel benzamide-type HDACi (histone deacetylase inhibitor), which has entered Phase I clinical trials in the U.S. and Phase II/III in China. In the present study, we investigated the effects of CS055 on proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in human leukaemia cell lines and primary myeloid leukaemia cells. The results showed that at low concentrations (<1 μM), CS055 induced G1 arrest. At moderate concentrations (0.5 μM-2 μM), CS055 induced differentiation, as determined by the increased expression of the myeloid differentiation marker CD11b. At relatively high concentrations (2 μM-4 μM), CS055 potently induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Co-treatment with the ROS (reactive oxygen species) scavengers N-acetyl-L-cysteine or Tiron blocked CS055-induced cell differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting an essential role for ROS in these effects. Cytochrome c release and ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction are involved in CS055-induced apoptosis of leukaemia. In addition to cell lines, CS055 also exhibits therapeutic effects in human primary leukaemia cells. Moreover, daily oral CS055 treatment of nude mice bearing HL60 cell xenografts suppressed tumour growth, induced tumour cell apoptosis and prolonged the survival of tumour-bearing mice. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that CS055 is a novel HDACi with potential chemotherapeutic value in several haematological malignancies, especially leukaemia.
