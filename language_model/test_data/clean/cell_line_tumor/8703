A total of 24 biologically pure entophytic fungal strains were isolated from stems, leaves, and seed coats of Xylocarpus plants by repeated purification, and identified with Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) rDNA molecular method, which belonging to 14 genera, 11 families, 9 orders and 3 classes. There were differences in genus and species levels among three plant materials from different habitats and species, and it was found that the strains of Phomopsis and Colletotrichum existed in all three plant materials. In vitro assay of antitumor activity by MTT method revealed that the EtOAc extracts of 15 strains exhibited potent antitumor activity. These results suggest that it is of value for further investigation on the above fungal strains.
