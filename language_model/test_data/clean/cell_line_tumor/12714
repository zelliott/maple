The coordination chemistry of the new curcuminoid ligand, 1,7-(di-9-anthracene-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione), abbreviated 9Accm has been studied, resulting in two new copper-9Accm compounds. Compound 1, [Cu(phen)Cl(9Accm)], was synthesized by reacting 9Accm with [Cu(phen)Cl(2)] in a 1:1 ratio (M:L) and compound 2, [Cu(9Accm)(2)], was prepared from Cu(OAc)(2) and 9Accm (1:2). UV-vis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements were some of the techniques employed to portray these species; studies on single crystals of free 9Accm, [Cu(phen)Cl(9Accm)] and [Cu(9Accm)(2)(py)] provided detailed structural information about compounds 1 and 2Â·py, being the first two copper-curcuminoids crystallographically described. In addition the antitumor activity of the new compounds was studied and compared with free 9Accm for a number of human tumor cells. To provide more insight on the mode of action of these compounds under biological conditions, additional experiments were accomplished, including studies on the nature of their interactions with calf thymus DNA by UV-vis titration and Circular Dichroism. These experiments together with DNA-binding studies indicate electrostatic interactions between some of these species and the double helix, pointing out the weak nature of the interaction of the compounds with CT-DNA. The intrinsic fluorescence of the free ligand and both copper compounds provided valuable information over the cellular process and therefore, fluorescence microscopy studies were performed using a human osteosarcoma cell line. Studies in vitro using this technique suggest that the action of these molecules seems to occur outside the nuclei.
