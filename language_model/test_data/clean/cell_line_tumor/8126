The present study describes the antioxidant activities of ethanol extract from Gymnema montanum (GLEt) which is an endemic plant of India. Antioxidant activity of the GLEt was studied in vitro based on scavenging of hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anions, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, reducing power and inhibition of lipid peroxidation estimated in terms of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Further, we examined its protective effect against alloxan-induced oxidative stress in pancreatic beta-cells, HIT-T15 by measuring the free radical generation, malonaldehyde formation and antioxidant levels such as CAT, GPx and GSH. Results showed that G. montanum leaves exhibited significant antioxidant activities measured by various in vitro model systems. The HIT-T15 cell line studies showed the tendency of GLEt to increase antioxidant levels meanwhile decrease the free radical formation and inhibit the lipid peroxidation. The antioxidant activity was found to be well correlated with the phenolic phytochemicals present in the extract. GC-MS analyses revealed the presence of few phenolic compounds in the extract. As this plant has already been demonstrated for a variety of medicinal properties from our laboratory, results of this study suggest that G. montanum is an interesting source for antioxidant compounds and useful for various therapeutic applications.
