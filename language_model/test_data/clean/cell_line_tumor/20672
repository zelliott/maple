The expression of microRNA-203 (miR-203) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma             (ESCC) tissues is remarkably lower than that in non‑ESCC tissues. We investigated             how miR-203 could influence the development of ESCC cells. Our analyses revealed             that miR-203 inhibited the migration and invasion of ESCC cells. Genome-wide gene             expression data and target site inhibition assays showed that miR-203 appears             to directly regulate LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1). The knockdown of LASP1 resulted             in inhibition of the migration and invasion of ESCC cells. Our results suggest             that miR-203 and its target LASP1, may be associated with the progression of ESCC.             In clinical ESCC specimens, the expression levels of miR-203, which were lower             compared to those in normal tissues, were inversely correlated with the mRNA expression             levels of LASP1. Moreover, we found that there was a significant correlation between             the expression levels of miR-203 and the relapse‑free survival. The identification             of a cancer network regulated by miR-203 could provide new insights into the potential             mechanisms of the progression of ESCC.
