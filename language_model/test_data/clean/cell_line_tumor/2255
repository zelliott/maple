Chlorin-based photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy are the promising anticancer agents, but some of their properties such as specific-targeting to tumor need to be improved. The aim of this study was to synthesize chlorin-based unsaturated fatty acid conjugates to obtain an optimal photosensitizers. Thus four chlorin-based fatty acid conjugates were successfully synthesized through an esterification reaction using carbodiimide coupling reagents in enough yields. Then, structures of these conjugates were confirmed by (1)H NMR, MALDI-MS, and UV-vis spectroscopy. Furthermore, their in vitro phototoxicity and cellular uptake were evaluated on TC-1 lung cancer cell line and HeLa cell line.
