Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) protein is a cytosolic transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in numerous human cancers. Inhibitors of activated Stat3-Stat3 protein complexes have been shown to hold therapeutic promise for the treatment of human cancers harboring activated Stat3. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a focused library of salicylic acid containing Stat3 SH2 domain binders. The most potent inhibitor, 17o, effectively disrupted Stat3-phosphopeptide complexes (K(i)=13 μM), inhibited Stat3-Stat3 protein interactions (IC(50)=19 μM) and silenced intracellular Stat3 phosphorylation and Stat3-target gene expression profiles. Inhibition of Stat3 function in both breast and multiple myeloma (MM) tumor cells correlated with induced cell death (EC(50)=10 and 16 μM, respectively).
