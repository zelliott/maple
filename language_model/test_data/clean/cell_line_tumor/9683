The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) plays a central role in virus replication. NS5B has no functional equivalent in mammalian cells and, as a consequence, is an attractive target for inhibition. Herein, we present 1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-diones as a new series of selective inhibitors of HCV NS5B polymerase. The HTS hit 1 shows submicromolar potency in two different HCV replicons (1b and 2b) and displays no activity on other polymerases (HIV-RT, Polio-pol, GBV-b-pol). These inhibitors act during the pre-elongation phase by binding to NS5B non-nucleoside binding site Thumb Site II as demonstrated by crystal structure of compound 1 with the DeltaC55-1b and DeltaC21-2b enzymes and by mutagenesis studies. SAR in this new series reveals inhibitors, such as 20, with low micromolar activity in the HCV replicon and with good activity/toxicity window in cells.
