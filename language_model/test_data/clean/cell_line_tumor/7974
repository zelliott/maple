This study was conducted to evaluate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of Erigeron canadensis (EC) on the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-, interleukin (IL)-4- and IL-1beta-induced stimulation of A549 cells.

In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effects of EC on TNF-alpha-, IL-4- and IL-1beta-induced A549 cells were determined by analyzing eotaxin secretion using ELISA. In addition, the effects of ECon gene expression profiles in stimulated A549 cells were evaluated by microarray analysis.

Oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed that inflammatory-related genes such as NOS1, NOS2A, IL-1beta, IL-8 and CSF2 and cell adhesion-related genes such as SELE, MMP3, VCAM1, ICAM1, ITGA7 and ITGB2 were downregulated in EC-treated A549 cells that had been pretreated with TNF-alpha, IL-4 and IL-1beta. In addition, significant decreases in Eotaxin, ICAM, VCAM and IL-8 gene expression were observed in EC-treated A549 cells.

EC has an anti-inflammatory effect in stimulated A549 cells. Microarray-based genomic survey is a high-throughput approach that is suitable for the evaluation of gene expression in cell lines that have been treated with EC.
