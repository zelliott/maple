Prostate cancer tumor growth and neovascularization is promoted by an interplay between migratory tumor stromal cells such as specialized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and circulating endothelial precursor cells (CEPs). As vehicles for tumor therapy, human CEPs are relatively easy to isolate from peripheral blood, are able to proliferate long-term in vitro, are amenable to viral manipulation, and preferentially home to regions of ischemia found in growing tumors. We show here that human peripheral blood CEPs expanded ex vivo migrate to prostate cancer cells in vitro and efficiently home to human prostate tumor xenografts in vivo. Infection of precursors ex vivo with an adenovirus constructed to secrete a soluble form of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor CD115 that inhibits macrophage viability and migration in vitro significantly decreases the number of TAMs in xenografts (p < .05), reduces proliferation (p < .01) and vascular density (p < .03), and suppresses the growth of xenografts (p < .03). These data show for the first time that targeting stromal cell processes with cellular therapy has the potential to retard prostate tumor growth.
