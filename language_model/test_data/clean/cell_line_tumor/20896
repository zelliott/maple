Cyclin D1 (CCND1) is a well-known regulator of cell-cycle progression. It is overexpressed in several types of cancer including breast, lung, squamous, neuroblastoma, and lymphomas. The most well-known mechanism of overexpression is the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation found in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). It has previously been shown that truncated CCND1 mRNA in MCL correlates with poor prognosis. We hypothesized that truncations of the CCND1 mRNA alter its ability to be down-regulated by microRNAs in MCL. MicroRNAs are a new class of abundant small RNAs that play important regulatory roles at the posttranscriptional level by binding to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs blocking either their translation or initiating their degradation. In this study, we have identified the truncation in CCND1 mRNA in MCL cell lines. We also found that truncated CCND1 mRNA leads to increased CCND1 protein expression and increased S-phase cell fraction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this truncation alters miR-16-1 binding sites, and through the use of reporter constructs, we were able to show that miR-16-1 regulates CCND1 mRNA expression. This study introduces the role of miR-16-1 in the regulation of CCND1 in MCL.
