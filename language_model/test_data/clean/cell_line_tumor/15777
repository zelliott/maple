MicroRNA145 (miR145), a tumor suppressor miR, has been reported to inhibit growth of human cancer cells, to induce differentiation and to cause apoptosis, all conditions that result in growth arrest. In order to clarify the functional effects of miR145, we have investigated its expression in diverse conditions and different cell lines. Our results show that miR145 levels definitely increase in differentiating cells and also in growth-arrested cells, even in the absence of differentiation. Increased expression during differentiation sometimes occurs as a late event, suggesting that miR145 could be required either early or late during the differentiation process.
