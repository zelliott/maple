Hyperthermia is known to serve as a powerful tool in the treatment of prostate cancer which is commonly diagnosed in men. Quercetin and KNK437, Hsp70 inhibitors, play an important role in blocking thermotolerance in some cancer cells. In the present study we investigated the effects of KNK437 and quercetin on the acquisition of thermotolerance and heat-induced apoptosis. Also, it was examined whether the possible mechanism triggering apoptotic pathway included caspase-3 activation in prostate cancer cells. For this purpose, PC-3 and LNCaP cells were treated with hyperthermia following pretreatment with or without KNK437 or quercetin. Thermotolerance was investigated by colony formation assay in these cells, while Hsp70 mRNA levels were measured by real time RT-PCR. Sandwich ELISA was used for detection of Hsp70 protein levels. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometric annexin V binding assay and by western blot analysis of procaspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase levels. In our study, KNK437 and quercetin inhibited thermotolerance in a dose-dependent manner in PC-3 cells. KNK437 and quercetin decreased heat-induced accumulation of Hsp70 mRNA and protein in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. KNK437 and quercetin pretreatment enhanced the apoptotic effect of hyperthermia in both cells. We found that KNK437 was more effective than quercetin in inducing apoptotic cell death, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP in prostate cancer cells. We suggest that KNK437 is a useful agent for enhancing the efficiency of hyperthermic therapy which has less toxic side-effects in prostate cancer.
