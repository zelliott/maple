To study the effect of sudan I, III and IV on the growth of HepG-2 and SGC-7901, the ratio of DNA/RNA and 3D image in HepG-2 treated by different dose of sudan I, III and IV was detected by LCM, the content change of DNA and the cell cycle in SGC-7901 treated by different dose of sudan I, III and IV was detected by flow cytometry. Results showed the ratio of DNA/RNA in control group was 1.2232 +/- 0.0844, after treated by sudan I , III and IV the fluorescence intensity of DNA was stronger than RNA, and the low dose group was very marked compared with control group (p < 0.01), the ratio was 1.609 6 +/- 0.1990, 1.4455 +/- 0.1633,and 1.7081 +/- 0.1090. 3D image showed that the DNA fluorescence mostly assembles on nucleolus, which was denser and stronger than RNA. Sudan I, III and IV accelerated the cell cycle from G1 phase to S and G2 phase, the average content of DNA in G1 phase decreased and in S and G2 phase increased, the index of PI and SPF increased. Sudan I, III and IV could affect cell cycle and advanced its differentiation and proliferation.
