The CD109 gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface protein. Herein it is shown that CD109 is highly expressed in myoepithelial cells of mammary, salivary, and lacrimal glands; and in prostate basal cells. The anti-CD109 antibody generated by the authors was available for formalin-fixed paraffin section, and it strongly stained myoepithelial cells and basal cells but not ductal, acinar, and secretory cells in these glands. CD109 expression was negative in examined breast ductal carcinomas and prostate adenocarcinomas. These findings indicate that CD109 is a useful marker for the diagnosis of invasive breast and prostate carcinomas.
