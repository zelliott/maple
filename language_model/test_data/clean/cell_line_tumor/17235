Iron (Fe) is crucial for cellular proliferation, and Fe chelators have shown activity at preventing the growth of the malarial parasite in cell culture and in animal and human studies. We investigated the anti-malarial activity of novel aroylhydrazone and thiosemicarbazone Fe chelators that show high activity at inhibiting the growth of tumour cells in cell culture [Blood 100 (2002) 666]. Experiments with the chelators were performed using the chloroquine-sensitive, 3D7, and chloroquine-resistant, 7G8, strains of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. The new ligands were significantly more active in both strains than the Fe chelator in widespread clinical use, desferrioxamine (DFO). The most effective chelators examined were 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone and 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde-4-phenyl-3-thiosemicarbazone. The anti-malarial activity correlates with anti-proliferative activity against neoplastic cells demonstrated in a previous study. Our studies suggest that this class of lipophilic chelators may have potential as useful agents for the treatment of malaria.
