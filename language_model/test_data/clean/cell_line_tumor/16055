A series of trifluoromethylated hexahydropyrimidine and tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives were synthesized and their in vitro cytotoxic activities were determined in colon cancer cell line (COLO 320 HSR). Compounds 4f, 4g, 4k, 5, and 7 proved to be the most active in this series of compounds. They represent promising new leads for the development of highly potent and selective anticancer compounds. All the compounds are lipophilic due to the trifluoromethyl group, and are thus expected to penetrate the membrane in appreciable concentration.
