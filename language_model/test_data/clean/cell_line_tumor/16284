In this study, we applied D, L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) hydrochloride as a chemical inhibitor for glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) and tetrandrine (Tet) for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) to reverse daunorubicin (DNR) resistance of human leukemia cell line K562/A02. Cytotoxicity assays showed that either PDMP or Tet enhanced cytotoxic effect of DNR on K562/A02 cells, while cotreatment of these two drugs had a more significant effect on chemosensitization. Using flow cytometric analysis, we confirmed that the enhancement effect was accompanied by elevated cellular DNR accumulation and DNR-induced apoptosis. According to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot, the reversal effect of that composite might owe to the significant downregulation of mdr1 and GCS gene expressions. Importantly, PDMP diminished mdr1 gene expression and Tet also downregulated GCS gene expression. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between GCS and P-gp. Thus, our results suggest that a potential clinical application of PDMP in combination with Tet may enhance chemosensitivity in leukemia.
