Cancer cells are exposed to external and internal stresses by virtue of their unrestrained growth, hostile microenvironment, and increased mutation rate. These stresses impose a burden on protein folding and degradation pathways and suggest a route for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Proteasome and Hsp90 inhibitors are in clinical trials and a 20S proteasome inhibitor, Velcade, is an approved drug. Other points of intervention in the folding and degradation pathway may therefore be of interest. We describe a simple screen for inhibitors of protein synthesis, folding, and proteasomal degradation pathways in this paper. The molecular chaperone-dependent client v-Src was fused to firefly luciferase and expressed in HCT-116 colorectal tumor cells. Both luciferase and protein tyrosine kinase activity were preserved in cells expressing this fusion construct. Exposing these cells to the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin caused a rapid reduction of luciferase and kinase activities and depletion of detergent-soluble v-Src::luciferase fusion protein. Hsp70 knockdown reduced v-Src::luciferase activity and, when combined with geldanamycin, caused a buildup of v-Src::luciferase and ubiquitinated proteins in a detergent-insoluble fraction. Proteasome inhibitors also decreased luciferase activity and caused a buildup of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in a detergent-insoluble fraction. Protein synthesis inhibitors also reduced luciferase activity, but had less of an effect on phosphotyrosine levels. In contrast, certain histone deacetylase inhibitors increased luciferase and phosphotyrosine activity. A mass screen led to the identification of Hsp90 inhibitors, ubiquitin pathway inhibitors, inhibitors of Hsp70/Hsp40-mediated refolding, and protein synthesis inhibitors. The largest group of compounds identified in the screen increased luciferase activity, and some of these increase v-Src levels and activity. When used in conjunction with appropriate secondary assays, this screen is a powerful cell-based tool for studying compounds that affect protein synthesis, folding, and degradation.
