To study the expression of TRPC6 among prostate cancer cells, establish high expression cell lines of TRPC6, and to provide potential cell mode for prostate cancer oncogenesis and development.

Occurrence and development of prostate cancer cells, PC3, PC-3 m DU145, 22 rv1, LNCaP and normal prostate epithelial cells in the PrEC TRPC6 expression level were detected by QPCR method. Calcium phosphate transfection method was used to package retrovirus pLEGFP-N1-TRPC6 and pLEGFP-N1-vector and infect the prostate cancer cells, a stable high expression of TRPC6 prostate cancer cells. Sable cell lines of TRPC6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, MMP9 expression was detected by QPCR and Western blot. Change of cell invasion ability was detected by Transwell.

The expression level of prostate cancer cells TRPC6 were higher than control group PrEC cells. Among TPRC6 the expression of cell line PC 3 transfer potential wre the lowest, and high transfer cell line PC-3M express was the highest. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and western blot results showed that after filter, the seventh generation of cell TRPC6 protein and mRNA expression levels were higher than the control group obviously. Transwell experimental results showed that the overexpression of TRPC6 could promote the invasion ability of PC3 prostate cancer cells.

TRPC6 expressed in prostate cancer cells is in disorder, and its action may be associated with the invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cells; successful establishment of stable high expression of TRPC6 prostate cancer cells primarily confirm the invasion-trigger ability of TRPC6 on prostate cancer, and lay down the Foundation for exploring the TRPC6's role in the occurrence and development of prostate cancer mechanism.
