Local energy transfer from electrons generated in biotissues that are exposed to ionizing radiation is fundamental to cell damage. Our aim in this investigation was to quantify the probability of cell mortality associated with the damage by electrons and the repair processes in the cell nucleus, envisaging a new interpretation of the cell surviving fraction (SF). We introduced a SF formula for cells exposed to X-rays, which is given as a linear combination of the Poisson distributions about the number of long-lived lesions per nucleus and their "non-lethal probabilities", to show the non-linearity of log SF as a function of dose. The model selection was rated by a statistical index, Akaike's information criterion (AIC). It was shown that the new formula is suitable for describing cell survival and explicitly takes account of the non-lethality in damage-processing pathways of the cells.
