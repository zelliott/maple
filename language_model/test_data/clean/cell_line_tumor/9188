Immunohistochemical analysis was used to define the precise cell-specific localization of Glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc6Pase) and cytosolic form of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C) in the digestive system (liver, small intestine and pancreas) and the kidney. Co-expression of Glc6Pase and PEPCK-C was shown to take place in hepatocytes, in proximal tubules of the cortex kidney and at the top of the villi of the small intestine suggesting that these tissues are all able to perform complete gluconeogenesis. On the other hand, intrahepatic bile ducts, collecting tubes of the nephron and the urinary epithelium in the calices of the kidney, as well as the crypts of the small intestine, express Glc6Pase without significant levels of PEPCK-C. In such cases, the function of Glc6Pase could be related to the transepithelial transport of glucose characteristic of these tissues, rather than to the neoformation of glucose. Lastly, PEPCK-C expression in the absence of Glc6Pase was noted in both the exocrine pancreas and the endocrine islets of Langerhans. Possible roles of PEPCK-C in exocrine pancreas might be the provision of gluconeogenic intermediates for further conversion into glucose in the liver, whereas PEPCK-C would be instrumental in pyruvate cycling, which has been suggested to play a regulatory role in insulin secretion by the beta-cells of the islets.
