Upon antigen binding, the BCR transduces a signal culminating in proliferation or in AICD of the B cell. Coreceptor engagement and subsequent modification of the BCR signal pathway are mechanisms that guide the B cell to its appropriate fate. For example, in the absence of coreceptor engagement, anti-sIgM antibodies induce apoptosis in the human Daudi B cell lymphoma cell line. ITIM-bearing B cell coreceptors that potentially may act as negative coreceptors include FcRgammaIIb, CD22, CD72, and CEACAM1 (CD66a). Although the role of CEACAM1 as an inhibitory coreceptor in T cells has been established, its role in B cells is poorly defined. We show that anti-sIgM antibody and PI3K inhibitor LY294002-induced apoptosis are reduced significantly in CEACAM1 knock-down clones compared with WT Daudi cells and that anti-sIgM treatment induced CEACAM1 tyrosine phosphorylation and association with SHP-1 in WT cells. In contrast, treatment of WT Daudi cells with anti-CD19 antibodies does not induce apoptosis and has reduced tyrosine phosphorylation and SHP-1 recruitment to CEACAM1. Thus, similar to its function in T cells, CEACAM1 may act as an inhibitory B cell coreceptor, most likely through recruitment of SHP-1 and inhibition of a PI3K-promoted activation pathway. Activation of B cells by anti-sIgM or anti-CD19 antibodies also leads to cell aggregation that is promoted by CEACAM1, also in a PI3K-dependent manner.
