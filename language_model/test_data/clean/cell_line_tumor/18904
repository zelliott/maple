The ability of cholesterol to modulate receptor-mediated increases in the volume-dependent release of the organic osmolyte, taurine, has been examined. Depletion of cholesterol from SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma by preincubation of the cells with 5 mM methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CD) for 10 min resulted in a 40 to 50% reduction in cholesterol and an enhancement of the ability of proteinase-activated receptor (PAR) 1, muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAChR), and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor to stimulate taurine efflux, when monitored under hypoosmotic conditions. Basal (swelling-induced) release of taurine was also enhanced by cholesterol depletion, but less markedly. Both basal- and receptor-mediated increases in taurine efflux were mediated via a volume-sensitive organic osmolyte and anion channel in control and cholesterol-depleted cells. Studies with the PAR-1 and mAChR receptor subtypes indicated that the stimulatory effect of CD pretreatment could be reversed by incubation of the cells with either CD/cholesterol or CD/5-cholesten-3alpha-ol donor complexes and that cholesterol depletion increased agonist efficacy, but not potency. The ability of cholesterol depletion to promote the PAR-1 receptor-mediated stimulation of osmolyte release was most pronounced under conditions of isotonicity or mild hypotonicity. In contrast to CD pretreatment, preincubation of the cells with cholesterol oxidase, a condition under which lipid microdomains are also disrupted, had no effect on either basal- or receptor-stimulated taurine efflux. Taken together, the results suggest that cholesterol regulates receptor-mediated osmolyte release via its effects on the biophysical properties of the plasma membrane, rather than its presence in lipid microdomains.
