Antioxidants are entities that play a vital role in protecting cells from free radical damage, which is implicated in cancer development. A detailed literature review on nutritional supplementation and cancer has demonstrated that antioxidants may be beneficial in preventing prostate cancer development. A reduced incidence of prostate cancer has been associated with high consumptions of antioxidants. The goal of this study was to utilize the ceramic drug delivery system to evaluate the behavior and response of LNCaP prostate cells upon treatment with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), thymoquinone (TQ), and tannic acid (TA). After treatment with the various antioxidants, the groups were evaluated after 24, 48, and 72 hours of incubation. After all phases of incubation, groups treated with EGCG +TCP demonstrated the greatest reduction in cell count as well as the most cell membrane damage according to malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. In comparison to the control group, all groups demonstrated reductions in cell growth and decreased PSA levels that were significant according to one way analysis of variance (P < 0.001). Findings from this study revealed that sustained delivery with antioxidants may be a means of treating prostate cancer both safely as well as effectively. Future studies are needed to test the mechanisms behind these reactions.
