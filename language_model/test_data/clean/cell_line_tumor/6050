The specific application and transport of drugs into malignant tissue is a critical point during diagnosis and therapy. Nanoparticles are known as excellent drug carrier systems and offer the possibility of surface modification with targeting ligands, leading to a specific accumulation in the targeted tissue. First, the specificity of such a carrier system has to be proven. In this study, cetuximab-modified nanoparticles based on biodegradable human serum albumin (HSA) are investigated regarding their cellular binding and intracellular accumulation. Different EGFR-expressing colon carcinoma cells were used to test possible cytotoxic potential, specific binding and intracellular accumulation. A specific accumulation targeting the EGFR could be shown. These results emphasize that cetuximab-modified HSA-nanoparticles are a promising carrier system for later drug transport. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the specific accumulation of HSA nanoparticles into different EGFR-expressing colon carcinoma cells.

In this study, cetuximab-modified nanoparticles based on human serum albumin (HSA) are investigated regarding their cellular binding and intracellular accumulation. The results suggest that these nanoparticles are a promising carrier system for EGFR overexpressing colon carcinoma cells.
