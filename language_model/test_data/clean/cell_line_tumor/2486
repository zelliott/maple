A series of novel 1,3,4-thiadiazole-containing benzisoselenazolone derivatives were prepared by the condensation of 2-chloroselenobenzoyl chloride and 2-amino-5-substituted-1,3,4-thiadiazole. Their in vitro antiproliferative activities were evaluated in SSMC-7721, MCF-7 and A-549 cells. The results suggest that, in different tumor cells, some compounds have good antiproliferative activity, certain selectivity and potential value of further research.
