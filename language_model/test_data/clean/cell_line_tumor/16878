Based on our recent findings that resveratrol, a natural plant polyphenol found in red grape skins as well as other food products, induces apoptosis via a caspase-independent intrinsic pathway in human lung adenocarcinoma cells, this study is designed to explore whether SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, potentiates the resveratrol-induced apoptosis of human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells. We found that pretreatment with SB203580 enhanced the resveratrol-induced apoptosis by accelerating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway including Bax activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of both caspase-9 and -3. Although treatment with resveratrol alone did not induce caspase-8 activation, cotreatment with both SB203580 and resveratrol not only enhanced FasL cleavage but also activated caspase-8, indicating that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway may be involved in the synergistic effect. Collectively, we for the first time demonstrate that SB203580 synergistically enhances the resveratrol-induced apoptosis by accelerating Bax-mediated intrinsic pathway and initiating extrinsic pathway, suggesting a possible alternative therapeutic strategy for human lung cancer.
