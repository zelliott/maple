5,7-Dimethoxyflavone, a major compound from Kaempferia parviflora, was used as a starting material for structural modification. Seven flavonoid derivatives have been synthesized from this flavone. Two new oxime derivatives 4 and 6 exhibited cytotoxicity against HepG2 cell line with IC50 values of 36.38 and 25.34 microg/mL, respectively, and against T47D cell line with IC50 values of 41.66 and 22.94 microg/mL, respectively. Compound 7 showed cytotoxicity against HepG2 and T47D cell lines with IC50 values of 21.36 and 25.00 microg/mL, respectively. Compounds 6 and 7 showed cytotoxicity nearly equal to the tamoxifen standard. In addition, oxime 6 exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans with an IC50 value of 48.98 microg/mL.
