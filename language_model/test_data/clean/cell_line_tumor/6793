Cross-talk between nuclear receptors involved in the control of drug metabolism is being increasingly recognised as a source of drug side effects. Omeprazole is a well known activator of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). We investigated the regulation of AhR by omeprazole-sulphide, a degradation metabolite of omeprazole, using CYP1A mRNA induction, reporter gene assay, receptor DNA binding, ligand binding, nuclear translocation, trypsin digests, and drug metabolism analysis in mouse Hepa-1c1c7, human HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes. Omeprazole-sulphide is a pure antagonist of AhR in Hepa-1c1c7 and HepG2 hepatoma cell lines. In Hepa-1c1c7 cells, omeprazole-sulphide is a ligand of AhR, inhibits AhR activation to a DNA-binding form, induces a specific pattern of AhR trypsin digestion and inhibits AhR nuclear translocation and subsequent degradation in response to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. However, in highly differentiated primary human hepatocytes treated with rifampicin an agonist of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), omeprazole-sulphide behaves as an agonist of AhR. Inhibition of drug metabolizing enzymes by ketoconazole restores the antagonist effect of omeprazole-sulphide. Metabolic LC/MS analysis reveals that omeprazole-sulphide (AhR antagonist) is efficiently converted to omeprazole (AhR activator) by cytochrome P450 CYP3A4, a target gene of PXR, in primary human hepatocytes but not in hepatoma cells in which PXR is not expressed. This report provides the first evidence for a cross-talk between PXR/CYP3A4 and AhR. In addition, it clearly shows that conclusions drawn from experiments carried out in cell lines may lead to erroneous in vivo predictions in man.
