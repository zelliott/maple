A major obstacle in the successful delivery of antibody-based therapeutics to tumor cells is the heterogeneity of target antigen expression. We reported previously that retinoic acid (RA) is a potent and selective inducer of the cell-surface antigen CD38 in myeloid leukemia cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the RA-induced CD38 antigen could be a target for an anti-CD38-based immunotoxin to induce selective killing of leukemia cells. The combination of RA and the anti-CD38 gelonin immunotoxin induced a synergistic killing of leukemia cells. Thus, coculture of myeloid leukemia cells and cell lines with as little as 1 nM RA in the presence of immunotoxin induced substantial killing (>90%) of leukemia cell clones. More importantly, the blasts of myeloid leukemia patients, irrespective of their morphological and phenotypic features, also responded to the RA and immunotoxin combination when cultured ex vivo. A similar synergistic effect between RA and immunotoxin was observed against a multidrug-resistant variant subline of HL-60 cells. However, another variant of HL-60 cells, HL-60R, in which the retinoid receptor function has been abrogated by a trans-dominant-negative mutation, exhibited complete resistance to the immunotoxin-induced killing effect in the presence or absence of RA. Our results suggest that RA combined with anti-CD38-based therapeutic agent may offer exciting opportunities for the treatment of myeloid leukemias despite their multiplicity of genetic and clinical varieties.
