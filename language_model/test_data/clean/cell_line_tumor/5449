Isothiocyanates, a class of anti-cancer agents, are derived from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage and watercress, and have demonstrated chemopreventive activity in a number of cancer models and epidemiologic studies. Due to public interest in cancer prevention and alternative therapies in cancer, the consumption of herbal supplements and vegetables containing these compounds is widespread and increasing. Isothiocyanates interact with ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein, MRP1, MRP2 and BCRP, and may influence the pharmacokinetics of substrates of these transporters. This review discusses the pharmacokinetic properties of isothiocyanates, their interactions with ABC transporters, and presents some data describing the potential for isothiocyanate-mediated diet-drug interactions.
