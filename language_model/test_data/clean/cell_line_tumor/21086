After transfection of alpha1,3fucosyltransferase (FucT)-VII cDNA into H7721 human hepatocarcinoma cells, the expression of alpha5, but not beta1 integrin was significantly up-regulated. This was evidenced by the increase of alpha5 integrin on cell surface as well as the increase of alpha5 mRNA and protein in the cells. However, the expressions of sialyl Lewis X (SLe(x), the product of alpha1,3FucT-VII) on both alpha5 and beta1 integrin subunits were unchanged. Concomitantly, the tyrosine autophosphorylated FAK and dephosphorylated Src (FAK and Src involve in the signal transduction of integrin alpha5beta1) were up-regulated, while the Tyr-527 phosphorylated Src was down-regulated. The above-mentioned alterations were correlated to the expressions of alpha1,3FucT-VII in different alpha1,3FucT-VII transfected H7721 cell lines. In addition, after alpha1,3FucT-VII transfection, cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fn) and chemotaxic cell migration were obviously promoted. The cell adhesion could be blocked by alpha5 integrin antibody, and cell migration was obviously attenuated by the antibodies to both alpha5 integrin and SLe(x). These findings suggest that the increased surface alpha5 integrin caused by the up-regulation of alpha5 mRNA promotes the cell adhesion to Fn, cell migratiom, and Fn-induced signaling of alpha5beta1 integrin. The up-regulation of surface SLe(x) originated from the over expression of alpha1,3FucT-VII also led to the stimulation of cell migration. This is the first time to report that alpha1,3FucT-VII can regulate the mRNA expression of integrin.
