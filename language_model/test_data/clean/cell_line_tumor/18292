Multiple myeloma is characterized by the accumulation and dissemination of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. Cell migration is thought to be important for these events. We studied migration in a Transwell two-chamber assay and tested the motogenic effect of various cytokines. In addition to insulin-like growth factor-1 and stromal cell-derived growth factor-1alpha, previously known as chemoattractants for myeloma cells, we identified hepatocyte growth factor as a potent attractant for myeloma cells. Hepatocyte growth factor-mediated migration was dependent on phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, involved the MAPK/Erk signaling cascade and VLA-4 integrins, but did not involve Akt, mTOR or G proteins.
