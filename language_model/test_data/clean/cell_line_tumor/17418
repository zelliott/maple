Profiling of surface-bound proteins uncovers a tumor-selective heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) membrane expression that provides a target structure for human NK cells. Hsp70 peptide TKD (TKDNNLLGRFELSG; aa 450-463) was found to enhance the cytolytic activity of NK cells. In this study, we demonstrate that TKD-activated CD3-CD56+CD94+ NK cells are selectively attracted by Hsp70 membrane-positive tumor cells, and supernatants derived thereof. Hsp70 membrane-negative tumors failed to attract these NK cells. The capacity to migrate was associated with a substantial lytic activity against Hsp70-positive tumor cells. Because NK cell migration was independent of cell-to-cell contact, the involvement of a soluble factor was assumed. Interestingly, synthetic Hsp70 protein and Hsp70 peptide TKD, mimicking surface-bound Hsp70, initiates migration of NK cells in a concentration-dependent (1-5 microg/ml), highly selective, and chemokine-independent manner. In summary, our results indicate that Hsp70 peptide TKD not only stimulates cytolysis but also chemotaxis in CD3-CD56+CD94+ NK cells.
