To investigate the effect of inhibiting human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) on expression of C-myc protein by RNA interference (RNAi) in the larynx cancer cell line, Hep-2.

The primary structures of hTERT cDNA were found in GeneBank. Then the structure analyses were done according to the strategy of RNAi, which determined the specific base sequences to design shRNA plasmid. One type of plasmid, pshRNA1, involved in fluorescein gene was synthesized based on the specific base sequence. Control pshRNA2-a random sequence-were also constructed. METAFECTENE was used as the transfect ion reagent. Cells were treated daily with pshRNA1-2 or normal culture medium respectively. After administration of pshRNA1-2, hTERT mRNA was detected by RT-PCR, hTERT protein and C-myc protein were examined by Western Blot.

The expression of hTERT mRNA and protein were both significantly decreased after treated by pshRNA1 (P < 0.05). The expression of C-myc protein was significantly increased after treated by pshRNA1 (P < 0.01).

The inhibition of hTERT expression could increase the expression of C-myc protein in Hep-2 cells.
