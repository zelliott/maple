To study the inhibitory effect of Arsenic Trioxide (As2O3) combined with diamminedichloroplatinum (DDP) on the growth of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell strain CNE-2Z xenograft in nude mice, and to explore the possible effect mechanisms of the antitumor.

The models of human poorly differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma in nude mice were established and randomly divided into four groups, control group, As2O3 group, DDP group and As2O3 + DDP group. The effect of antitumor on each group was studied. The specimen obtained from the mice were detected by optical microscope and tdt-mediated dutp rock end labeling (tunel) method. Expression of DAPK was detected by real time-PCR and immunohistochemistry.

As2O3 group and AS2O3 + DDP group could obviously inhibit the growth of tumor, induce the apoptosis of human naso pharyngeal carcinoma cell and up-regulate the expression of RASSF1A.

As2O3 can greatly inhibit the growth of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell strain CNE-2Z xenograft in nude mice, which were related to the induced apoptosis of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell and up-regulated expression of DAPK Combination of As2O3 with DDP seem to be more effective.
