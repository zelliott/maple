To examine the expression absence of LRRC4 gene in glioblastoma cell lines.

RT-PCR and Northern blot were used to detect the expression of LRRC4 gene in 6 glioblastomas cells lines. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were used to screen the LRRC4 gene mutation, while bioinformation assay was used to search for the reason of LRRC4 gene absence in U251 cell lines.

The expression of LRRC4 was absent in 6 malignant glioma cell lines (U251, U87, BT325, SF126, SF767 and M17), which were examined by Northern-blot and RT-PCR assay. All sequencing of PCR products from gDNA of SF126, SF767, and M17 cell lines contained the point mutation at the same position ( LRRC4 geneT977A) (3/5), which was a synonymous mutation. However, PCR products from gDNA of U251 and U87 cell lines (2/5) were not obtained. The expression absence of LRRC4 was ascribed to the loss of homozygosity of 7q32-ter in U251 cell lines.

The expression of LRRC4 gene is absent in glioblastoma cell lines, and it offers the important experiment proof for LRRC4 to act as a new candidate of brain tumor suppressor gene from glioma. The loss of homozygosity of 7q32-ter contributed to the expression absence of LRRC4 in U251 cell lines.
