New series of 2(or 3)-arylmethylenenaphtho[2,1-b]furan-3(or 2)-ones were synthesized, characterized and tested for anticancer properties in vitro. The target compounds were prepared by Knoevenagel coupling between the naphthofuranones 3, 28-30 and formyl derivatives. 2-(4-Oxo-1-benzopyran-3-ylmethylene)naphtho[2,1-b]furan-3-one 36 was the most active compound (IC50 (L1210) = 1.6 microM). These compounds were also evaluated, in an independent manner, as inhibitors of Src protein tyrosine kinase, but only minor activity was observed.
