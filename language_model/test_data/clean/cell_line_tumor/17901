An efficient route for the synthesis of the tubulysin family of antimitotic peptides was developed. Simplified tubulysin analogues were synthesized to define the minimum pharmacophore required for cytotoxicity. Simplified tubulysin analogues retain significant cytotoxicity and reveal important preliminary structure-activity relationships.
