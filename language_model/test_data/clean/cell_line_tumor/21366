To examine the effect of phloretin on apoptosis of BEL-7402 cells.

The viability changes of BEL- 7402 cells as a result of phloretin-induced toxicity were analyzed using MTT assay, and the cell morphology changes were observed with fluorescence microscope. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle and mitochondrial membrane potential changes, and chromogenic substrate assay performed to detect caspase activity.

Phloretin induced obvious cytotoxicity against BEL-7402 cells with IC50 of 89.23 microg/mL. The growth curve demonstrated decreased growth of the cells as phloretin concentration increased. Cell apoptosis occurred 24 h after treatment with 40-160 microg/mL phloretin. Morphological, the cells exposed to phloretin exhibited nuclear chromatin condensation and increased fluorescence intensity. The activity of caspase-9 reached the peak level 12 h after phloretin exposure, and leak levels of caspase-6 and caspase-3 activities occurred 18 and 24 h after the exposure, respectively.

Phloretin can induce BEL-7402 cell apoptosis though the mitochondrial pathway.
