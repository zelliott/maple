The first event occurring at the boundary between a metal implant and living tissue is the attachment of cells onto the metal surface of the implant. The attachment characteristics of the metal in this situation are critical in determining its biocompatibility and usefulness as artificial bone and tooth implants. Using the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2, we attempted to establish simple and reliable methods for evaluating the attachment of cultured osteoblastic cells onto titanium samples that had been subjected to various surface treatments. Fluorescence actin imaging showed that cells cultured on titanium with hydrofluoric acid etching (HF-Ti) exhibited delayed spreading of their cytoplasm, as compared to cells cultured for the same length of time on nitrided titanium or physically polished titanium. The HF-Ti-cultured cells also exhibited poor assembly of focal contacts, as visualized by vinculin immunofluorescence. Furthermore, in motility assays based on an in vitro wound model, cells cultured on HF-Ti migrated more slowly than cells cultured on other titanium surfaces. These data suggest that Saos-2 cells attach less effectively to the HF-Ti surface. The methods described in this study should be useful for assessing the initial interactions of cultured cells with various materials, including metals.
