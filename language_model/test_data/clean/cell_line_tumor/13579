Gliomas are the most common tumors in the central nervous system. This study aims to investigate the expressions of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) in human brain glioma tissues and the correlation between their expressions with clinical pathological features and clinical significance. The expressions of mRNA or protein of TGF-β1 and E-cadherin were detected by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot in these tissues. Positive rates of the expression of TGF-β1 and E-cadherin were 62.9 % and 38.6 % in brain tissues of glioma patients. The expressions of mRNA or protein for TGF-β1 in brain glioma tissues were significantly higher than that in normal brain tissues (p < 0.01). Their expressions in well-differentiated glioma brain tissues were lower than those in poorly differentiated glioma brain tissues (p < 0.01). A negative correlation was found between TGF-β1 and E-cadherin in brain glioma tissues (r = -0.302, p < 0.011). The cell numbers of C6 glioma through Transwell chambers were decreased significantly (p < 0.01), and the expression of TGF-β1 was downregulated significantly (p < 0.01). However, the expression of E-cadherin was upregulated significantly (p < 0.01) after transfecting TGF-β1 siRNA. The expression changes of TGF-β1 and E-cadherin may be related to the emergence and the development of glioma. Downregulation of TGF-β1 expression using siRNA can decrease the invasive capability of C6 glioma cells.
