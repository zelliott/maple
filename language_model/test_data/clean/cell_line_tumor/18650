Glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94/gp96), the endoplasmic reticulum heat shock protein 90 paralog, elicits both innate and adaptive immune responses. Regarding the former, GRP94/gp96 stimulates APC cytokine expression and dendritic cell maturation. The adaptive component of GRP94/gp96 function reflects a proposed peptide-binding activity and, consequently, a role for native GRP94/gp96-peptide complexes in cross-presentation. It is by this mechanism that tumor-derived GRP94/gp96 is thought to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. Recent data have demonstrated that GRP94/gp96-elicited innate immune responses can be sufficient to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. However, the immunological processes activated in response to tumor Ag-negative sources of GRP94/gp96 are currently unknown. We have examined the in vivo immunological response to nontumor sources of GRP94/gp96 and report that administration of syngeneic GRP94/gp96- or GRP94/gp96-N-terminal domain-secreting KBALB fibroblasts to BALB/c mice stimulates CD11b(+) and CD11c(+) APC function and promotes bystander activation of CD4(+) T cell Th1 cytokine production. Only modest activation of CD8(+) T cell or NK cell cytolytic function was observed. The GRP94/gp96-dependent induction of CD4(+) T cell cytokine production was markedly inhibited by carrageenan, indicating an essential role for APC in this response. These results identify the bystander activation of CD4(+) T lymphocytes as a previously unappreciated immunological consequence of GRP94/gp96 administration and demonstrate that GRP94/gp96-elicited alterations in the in vivo cytokine environment influence the development of CD4(+) T cell effector functions, independently of its proposed function as a peptide chaperone.
