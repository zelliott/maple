Increased levels of interleukin (IL)-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 have been found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. The authors investigated whether inflammatory-activated microvascular pulmonary endothelial cells (HMVECL) regulate expression of IL-8 and MCP-1 in the alveolar epithelial cell line A549 and studied the effects of hypoxia (5% O(2)) and hyperoxia (85% O(2)). The authors observed significant up-regulation of IL-8 and MCP-1 expression in A549 cells that was independent from the IL-1 receptor pathway but was modified by oxygen tension. These data show that the pulmonary microvascular endothelium is able to regulate epithelial cell chemokine expression in a paracrine fashion.
