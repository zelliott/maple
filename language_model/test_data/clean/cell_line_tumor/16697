The aim of this study was to investigate the role of metformin in the regulation             of development and metastasis of ovarian carcinoma cell lines in vitro and ovarian             cancer in a nude mouse model in vivo. The effects of metformin on the ability             of two high-metastatic potential human ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3 and HO8910-PM)             to adhere, invade and migrate in vitro were observed by means of a cell adhesion             test, cell invasion test and cell migration test. The size and number of the inoculated             and metastatic tumours in vivo in a nude mouse were determined following intraperitoneal             injection of metformin. Furthermore, the extent of angiogenesis (vWF) and macrophage             infiltration in the tumour were determined. Proliferation, migration, invasion             and adhesion of ovarian cancer cells were significantly inhibited ( p<0.05)             in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, metformin inhibited hepatic,             intestinal and lung metastasis ( p<0.05), with no weight loss in vivo, consistent             with decreased expression of vWF and macrophage infiltration. Our data suggest             that metformin inhibits the development and metastasis of ovarian cancer by reducing             cellular-ECM interactions, neovascularisation and macrophage infiltration.
