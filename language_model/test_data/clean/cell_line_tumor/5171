Resistance to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy is a major cause of breast cancer treatment failure. We have synthesized six novel analogues using C8-ceramide as the lead analogue and studied their effect on hormone therapy resistant (MDA-MB-231) and chemoresistant (MCF-7TN-R) breast cancer cells. Pharmacologic intervention using these ceramide analogues inhibited clonogenic survival and induced apoptosis, with one analogue being more effective than C8-ceramide. Our results show ceramide-based therapy has therapeutic potential in treating drug resistant breast cancer.
