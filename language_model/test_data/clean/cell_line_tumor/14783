A platinum(II)-based major groove binder [Pt(II)(C^N)(C≡NR)(2)](+) (HC^N = 2-phenylpyridine (phpy), R = 2-naphthyl) was identified as a potent human topoisomerase IIα poison. It stabilizes the covalent TopoIIα-DNA cleavage complex and induces cancer cell death with potency significantly higher than the widely clinically used TopoIIα poison Vp-16.
