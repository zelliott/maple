We reported previously that derivatives of pentoxifylline (PTX) reverse multidrug resistance (MDR) in P-glycoprotein (P-gp) positive L1210/VCR cells. Based on the results of a recent study using 25 N-alkylated methylxanthines with carbohydrate side-chains of various lengths, we formulated the following design criteria for a methylxanthine molecule to effectively reverse P-gp mediated MDR: i) a massive substituent at the N1 position is crucial for MDR reversal potency; ii) elongation of the substituents at the N3 and N7 positions (from methyl to propyl) increases the efficacy of a xanthine to reverse MDR; iii) elongation of the substituent at the C8 position (from H to propyl) decreases the efficacy of a xanthine to reverse MDR. Based on these criteria, we synthesized and tested for potency to reverse MDR a new PTX derivative, 1-(10-undecylenyl)-3-heptyl-7-methyl xanthine (PTX-UHM), with prolonged substituents at the N1 and N3 positions. The derivative was obtained by alkylation of 3-heptyl-7-methyl xanthine with 1-methylsulfonyloxy-10-undecylenyl. NMR and IR structural analyses proved the identity of the product. Cytotoxicity study showed that PTX-UHM is only slightly more toxic to L1210/VCR cells than PTX. We found that both PTX-UHM and PTX were able to reverse vincristine resistance of L1210/VCR cells, yet PTX-UHM was significantly more efficient in the reversal than PTX.
