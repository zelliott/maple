Autoantibody-induced complement activation, which causes disruption of the postsynaptic membrane, is recognized as a key pathogenic factor in myasthenia gravis (MG). Therefore, specific targeting of complement inhibitors to the site of complement activation is a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of MG.

We assessed expression of single-chain antibody fragment-decay accelerating factor (scFv-DAF), comprising a single-chain fragment scFv1956 based on the rat complement inhibitor DAF in prokaryotic systems, and studied its inhibitory effect on complement deposition in vitro.

The recombinant conjugate scFv-DAF completely retained the wild-type binding activity of scFv1956 to AChR and inhibited complement activation of DAF in vitro.

We found that scFv-DAF could bind specifically to TE671 cells, and it is significantly more potent at inhibiting complement deposition than the untargeted parent molecule DAF. scFv-DAF may be a candidate for in vivo protection of the AChR in MG.
