Protein modification is one of the important processes during oxidative stress. This modification of proteins is either due to direct oxidation of proteins by various oxidants or due to secondary modification by lipid peroxidation products, e.g. 4-hydroxynonenal. In the here presented work we compare the intracellular distribution of protein modification products after treatment of human U87 astrocytoma cells with hydrogen peroxide or HNE. The treatment with hydrogen peroxide leads mainly to a cytosolic formation of oxidized proteins whereas HNE treatment is forming HNE-adducts throughout the cell. Therefore, we concluded that HNE diffusion distance in cells enables this lipid peroxidation product to act as a second messenger within the cell and on the other hand is the reason for the genotoxic properties of this compound.
