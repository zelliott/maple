The synthesis is reported of a group of 3,6,9-trisubstituted acridine compounds as telomeric quadruplex-stabilizing ligands with systematic variations at the 3-, 6-, and 9-positions. A new microwave-assisted methodology has been developed for trisubstituted acridine synthesis. Structure-activity relationships are reported using surface plasmon resonance and a fluorescence melting assay to examine quadruplex binding, together with a telomerase inhibition assay. These reveal relationships between G-quadruplex stabilization and telomerase inhibition and optimal 3,6- and 9-substituent side-chain lengths for maximal activity. Qualitative molecular modeling using molecular dynamics simulations has been undertaken on four quadruplex-DNA complexes. Long-term exposure of MCF7 cancer cells to a subset of the most active compounds, at doses lower than the IC(50) values, showed that one compound produced a marked decrease in population growth, accompanied by senescence, which is consistent with telomere targeting by this agent.
