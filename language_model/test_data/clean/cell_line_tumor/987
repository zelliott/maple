Thiol-reactive agents such as thimerosal have been shown to modulate the Ca2+-flux properties of IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) receptor (IP3R) via an as yet unidentified mechanism [Parys, Missiaen, De Smedt, Droogmans and Casteels (1993) Pfl√ºgers Arch. 424, 516-522; Kaplin, Ferris, Voglmaier and Snyder (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 28972-28978; Missiaen, Taylor and Berridge (1992) J. Physiol. (Cambridge, U.K.) 455, 623-640; Missiaen, Parys, Sienaert, Maes, Kunzelmann, Takahashi, Tanzawa and De Smedt (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 8983-8986]. In the present study, we show that thimerosal potentiated IICR (IP3-induced Ca2+ release) and IP3-binding activity of IP3R1, expressed in triple IP3R-knockout R23-11 cells derived from DT40 chicken B lymphoma cells, but not of IP3R3 or [D1-225]-IP3R1, which lacks the N-terminal suppressor domain. Using a 45Ca2+-flux technique in permeabilized A7r5 smooth-muscle cells, we have shown that Ca2+ shifted the stimulatory effect of thimerosal on IICR to lower concentrations of thimerosal and thereby increased the extent of Ca2+ release. This suggests that Ca2+ and thimerosal synergetically regulate IP3R1. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments elucidated an interaction between amino acids 1-225 (suppressor domain) and amino acids 226-604 (IP3-binding core) of IP3R1, and this interaction was strengthened by both Ca2+ and thimerosal. In contrast, calmodulin and sCaBP-1 (short Ca2+-binding protein-1), both having binding sites in the 1-225 region, weakened the interaction. This interaction was not found for IP3R3, in agreement with the lack of functional stimulation of this isoform by thimerosal. The interaction between the IP3-binding and transmembrane domains (amino acids 1-604 and 2170-2749 respectively) was not affected by thimerosal and Ca2+, but it was significantly inhibited by IP3 and adenophostin A. Our results demonstrate that thimerosal and Ca2+ induce isoform-specific conformational changes in the N-terminal part of IP3R1, leading to the formation of a highly IP3-sensitive Ca2+-release channel.
