Few protein biomarkers for oxidative stress have been reported. In this study, we attempted to identify the proteins selectively overexpressed in human colon tumor cells by treating with hydrogen peroxide as oxidative stress. A proteomic analysis followed by western blotting showed that phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) was induced by hydrogen peroxide in a dose-dependent manner, while its expression was suppressed by a co-treatment with delphinidin, a known antioxidant. Furthermore, several antioxidants, including alpha-tocopherol, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and Trolox, also inhibited the PGK1 induction caused by hydrogen peroxide. The data suggest that PGK1 might be a potential protein biomarker of intracellular oxidative status.
