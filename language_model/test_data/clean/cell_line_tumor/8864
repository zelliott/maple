Jiawei-Yupingfeng-Tang (JYT) is a Chinese herbal formula that is widely used to treat respiratory tract illness. However, the effect of JYT on respiratory viruses remains unknown. The influenza virus (IFV) and the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) cause millions of cases of severe illness per year, and many of these illnesses develop into lethal pneumonia. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether JYT can be used to treat these infections.

The effect of JYT against IFV and HRSV was tested using a plaque reduction assay in the lower respiratory tract cell line A549. The expression of ICAM-1 was determined by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting. A mouse model infected with lethal influenza developing into interstitial pneumonia was used to evaluate the effect of JYT in vivo.

JYT extract inhibited both IFV and HRSV in a dose-dependent manner when given before, during and after a viral infection. JYT was effective in blocking the entry of the virus. Furthermore, pre-treatment with JYT reduced the susceptibility of cells to the invasion of HRSV by inhibiting the expression of ICAM-1. Importantly, JYT extract increased the survival rate of lethal influenza-infected mice, prolonged the survival time and alleviated the virus-induced lung lesions, which is comparable with the effects of ribavirin treatment.

These data support JYT as an alternative modality to be used in the treatment of respiratory viral infection induced by HRSV and IFV.
