Honokiol, a novel antitumor agent, could induce apoptosis and inhibit the growth of vascular endothelium in several tumor cell lines and xenograft models. It has been suggested that the antitumor effect of chemotherapy could be increased by combining it with an antiangiogenesis agent in anticancer strategy. The present study explored the potential to increase the antitumor effect of adriamycin by combining it with honokiol in mouse 4T1 breast cancer models, and the underlining mechanism was investigated. Honokiol was encapsulated in liposomes to improve the water insolubility. In vitro, liposomal honokiol inhibited the proliferation of 4T1 cells via apoptosis and significantly enhanced the apoptosis of 4T1 cells induced by adriamycin. In vivo, the systemic administration of liposomal honokiol and adriamycin significantly decreased tumor growth through increased tumor cell apoptosis compared with either treatment alone. Collectively, these findings suggest that liposomal honokiol may augment the induction of apoptosis in 4T1 cells in vitro and in vivo, and this combined treatment has shown synergistic suppression in tumor progression according to the analysis of isobologram. The present study may be important in future exploration of the potential application of the combined approach in the treatment of breast cancer.
