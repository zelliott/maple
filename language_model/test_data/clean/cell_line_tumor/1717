To determine the appropriate surfactant to be added to TiO(2) nanotubes (TNTs) for use in cancer photothermotherapy, this study measured the increase in temperature and examined the size distribution of TNT particles loaded with different surfactants during near-infrared irradiation. In addition, in-vitro cell (fluorescein isothiocyanate and MTT assay) tests were carried out to examine the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin-loaded and polyvinyl alcohol-added TNTs (pTNTs). The mean particle size of the pTNTs was 151.8 nm with a particle size variation of less than 3 nm, which is low enough to flow through blood vessels without causing a blockage. The temperature of the pTNTs was ∼47°C, which is high enough to destroy cancer cells. Doxorubicin-loaded TNTs and pTNTs in combination with a near-infrared laser showed a cell viability of 4.5% - a sufficiently high cytotoxic effect.
