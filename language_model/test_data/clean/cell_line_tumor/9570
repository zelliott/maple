Novel C-5 aminomethyl pyrrolotriazines were prepared and optimized for dual EGFR and HER2 protein tyrosine kinase inhibition. The homopiperazine, 1p, emerged as a key lead and it showed promising oral efficacy in EGFR and dual EGFR/HER2 driven human tumor xenograft models. It is hypothesized that the C-5 homopiperazine side chain binds in the ribose-phosphate portion of the ATP binding pocket.
