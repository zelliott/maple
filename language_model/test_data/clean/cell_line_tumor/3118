MAGE-A4 has been considered as an attractive cancer-testis (CT) antigen for tumour immunotherapy. It has been well accepted that T-helper type 1 (Th1) cell-dominant immunity is critical for the successful induction of antitumour immunity in a tumour-bearing host. The adoptive Th1 cell therapy has been shown to be an attractive strategy for inducing tumour eradication in mouse systems. However, Th1-cell therapy using human tumour-specific Th1 cells, which were expanded from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a clinically useful protocol, has never been performed. Here, we first identified MAGE-A4-derived promiscuous helper epitope, peptide (MAGE-A4 280-299), bound to both HLA-DPB1(*)0501 and DRB1(*)1403. Using the peptide, we established a suitable protocol for the propagation of MAGE-A4-specific Th1 cells in vitro. Culture of CD4(+) T cells with IFN-gamma-treated PBMC-derived adherent cells in the presence of helper epitope peptide resulted in a great expansion of MAGE-A4-reactive Th cells producing IFN-gamma , but not IL-4. Moreover, it was shown that ligation of MAGE-A4-reactive Th1 cells with the cognate peptide caused the production of IFN-gamma and IL-2. Thus, our identified MAGE-A4 helper epitope peptide will become a good tool for the propagation of tumour-specific Th1 cells applicable to adoptive immunotherapy of human cancer.
