Sera from colon carcinoma patients were used to identify tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by screening tumor proteome resolved by 2D electrophoresis. A panel of six TAAs eliciting a serological immune response in colorectal cancer was identified, showing a modification in antigen recognition by B cells in patients as a function of colon cancer progression. The expression of these proteins was either confined or increased in tumor as compared to normal mucosa.
