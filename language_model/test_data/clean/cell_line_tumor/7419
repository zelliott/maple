Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by human breast cancer tissues is associated with poor clinical response. The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), gefitinib ('Iressa', ZD1839), is a leading example of a molecular targeted agent, and has an anti-proliferative effect on various cancer cells. But the details of the anti-cancer effect and mechanism have not been elucidated. We studied the anti-cancer effect of gefitinib in breast cancer cell lines and the intracellular pathway downstream of EGFR associated with cell migration.

In this study, we analysed the anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effect of gefitinib in EGFR (+) breast cancer cell lines by WST-1 analysis and chemotaxis chamber analysis. We analyzed several intracellular phosphorylated pathways which are activated by mitogen activated kinases (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2: MEK), phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) and phpspholipase C (PLC), by blocking those pathways using inhibitors of each kinase, and also investigated the effects on the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC).

Gefitinib inhibited proliferation in most of these cell lines. MDA-MB231 was shown to be resistant. Furthermore, proliferation of MDA-MB231 cells was not affected by EGF stimulation, but migration of MDA-MB231 cells was significantly inhibited. PI3K and PLC inhibitors blocked EGF-stimulated cell migration and MLC phosphorylation, but the MEK inhibitor did not influence cell migration.

Gefitinib has an anti-migratory effect on MDA-MB231 that results in an anti-proliferative effect. PI3K and PLC are important for the migration of MDA-MB231 cells, and gefitinib may inhibit migration by blocking these signalling pathways.
