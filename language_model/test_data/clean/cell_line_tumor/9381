A new sulphur-containing natural alkaloid named microbiaeratin (1a) was isolated, together with the known microbiaeratinin (2, bacillamide) from the culture filtrate of Microbispora aerata strain IMBAS-11A. The organism was isolated from penguin excrements collected on the Antarctic Livingston Island. The structure was elucidated by one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments and mass spectrometric investigations.
