We present a mathematical model to study the effects of HER2 over-expression on cell proliferation in breast cancer. The model illustrates the proliferative behavior of cells as a function of HER2 and EGFR receptors numbers, and the growth factor EGF. This mathematical model comprises kinetic equations describing the cell surface binding of EGF growth factor to EGFR and HER2 receptors, coupled to a model for the dependence of cell proliferation rate on growth factor receptors binding. The simulation results from this model predict: (1) a growth advantage associated with excess HER2 receptors; (2) that HER2-over-expression is an insufficient parameter to predict the proliferation response of cancer cells to epidermal growth factors; and (3) the EGFR receptor expression level in HER2-over-expressing cells plays a key role in mediating the proliferation response to receptor-ligand signaling. This mathematical model also elucidates the interaction and roles of other model parameters in determining cell proliferation rate of HER2-over-expressing cells.
