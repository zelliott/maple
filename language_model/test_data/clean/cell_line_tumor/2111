Vacuolar H(+) -ATPases (v-ATPases) are multimeric proton pumps which acidify various intra-cellular organelles and may participate in pHe and pHi regulation in cancer cell lines. The ATP6V0A4 gene encodes the a4 subunit which is expressed in kidney and epididymis. Because we found a4 mRNA highly expressed in C6Bu1 glioma cell line, we measured it in 205 glioma biopsies and 11 brain biopsies from epileptic patients. a4 was absent in epileptic brain biopsies, but was expressed by 34% (11/32) of grade III oligodendrogliomas, independently of the chromosome 1p19q codeletion. a4 expression in grade III oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas without the 1p19q codeletion tended to be associated with a shorter overall survival of patients. We also observed a4 expression in biopsies of pilocytic astrocytomas (68%; 19/28) and gangliogliomas (37%; 6/16). In pilocytic astrocytomas a4 expression was associated with a tandem duplication of the 7q34 chromosome region, distant 0.5 Mb to the ATP6V0A4 gene locus. In conclusion, a4 expression identifies subtypes of oligodendrogliomas, pilocytic astrocytomas and gangliogliomas and may contribute to refine characterization of these tumors.
