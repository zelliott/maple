To observe the effect of containing drugs serum of weikanguing decoction (WKN) on expression of Cyclin E, CDK2 (Cyclin dependant kinase 2, CDK2) and p27 in gastric cancer cell line MGC-803.

Total of 120 male Wistar rats were divided into control group, high dose group, medium dose group and low dose group fed with natural saline, 20,10, and 5 g/kg of WKN, respectively. The experimental animals were finally killed for the preparation of drug-containing serum. The gastric cancer cell MGC-803 was cultured with the drug-containing serum drawn from the rats in different groups. The expression of Cyclin E, CDK2 and p27 was detected with immunohistochemistry method-SABC. The expression of mRNA of Cyclin E, CDK2 and p27 were detected with RT-PCR.

In high, medium and low dose groups, the gray scales of cyclin E, CDK2 and the OPDTI values of p27 increased significantly, but the gray scales of p27 and the OPDTI values of cyclin E, CDK2 decreased remarkble, compared with that in control group.

The decoction of WKN can decrease the expression of Cyclin E, CDK2, increases the expression of p27. This effect may be involved in mechanism of gastric cancer cell growth inhibition induced by WKN.
