To explore the relationship between Aurora A expression and cell sensitivity to taxol, and elucidate the effect of Aurora A on the treatment efficacy of taxol for prostate cancer.

A cell clone highly expressing Aurora A was constructed through transfected with full length Aurora A gene, and then termed as Du145-Aurora A. Cells were treated with different dose taxols. The growth inhibition rates of cells were detected by MTT assay, and the cell apoptosis rates were detected through flow cytometry. The growth inhibition and apoptosis rates of Du145-Aurora A and Du145 cells were compared for Aurora A up-regulated expression. Simultaneously, cells Du145-Aurora A were treated with DNAzymes for down-regulating the Aurora A expression, and then the variations of cell growth inhibited rate and apoptosis rate were detected.

Up-regulation of Aurora A expression reduced the cell inhibition and apoptosis rates when treated by taxol, but the down-regulation of Aurora A expression after DNAzymes applied increased the cell inhibition and apoptosis rates when treated by taxol.

There is a positive relationship between Aurora A expression and treatment efficacy of taxol for prostate cancer, and inhibiting Aurora A expression will enhance the treatment efficacy of taxol for prostate cancer.
