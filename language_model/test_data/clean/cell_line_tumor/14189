Tumours derived from DLD-1 colon adenocarcinoma cells, transfected to either overexpress inducible nitric oxide synthase (clone iNOS-19) or with empty vector (pBAN2R), were utilised to test the hypothesis that tumour expression of iNOS (a) increases tumour angiogenesis and (b) modulates the anti-tumour activity of the vascular disrupting agent ZD6126. Overexpression of iNOS by clone iNOS-19 cells and murine xenografts was confirmed by the Griess assay and western blot analysis respectively. Clone iNOS-19 tumours grew more rapidly than pBAN2R tumours. Tumour perfusion, assessed by Hoechst 33342 uptake, was significantly greater in the clone iNOS-19 tumours (P < 0.001). A significant reduction in the perfusion of only the pBAN2R tumours, compared with control, was obtained 24 h after treatment with an intermediate dose of 100 mg/kg ZD6126 (P < 0.001), whereas 200 mg/kg significantly reduced the perfusion of both tumour types (P < 0.001). Whilst pBAN2R tumour necrosis increased in a dose-dependent manner, significant at 100 and 200 mg/kg ZD6126 (P < 0.05), intermediate doses did not induce a similar degree of necrosis in clone iNOS-19 tumours. A significant reduction in splenic perfusion was found 24 h after treatment with 100 mg/kg ZD6126, primarily associated with the red pulp. Overexpression of iNOS increases tumour growth, the degree of functionally perfused vasculature and angiogenesis, and also confers resistance to the vascular disrupting agent ZD6126.
