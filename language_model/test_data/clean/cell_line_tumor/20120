A simple and ultrasensitive colorimetric DNA assay based on the detection of the product of a ligation chain reaction (LCR) and the use of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as signal generators has been developed. During LCR, the AuNPs were ligated together, resulting in a distinct color change in real time after a sufficient number of thermal cycles. The cumulative nature of the protocol produced a detection limit of 20 aM with a selectivity factor of 10(3).
