We produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from the fusion of Taura syndrome virus variants from Belize (TSV-BZ) immunized BALB/cJ mouse spleen cells and non-immunoglobulin secreting SP2/0 mouse myeloma cells. One antibody, 2C4, showed strong specificity and sensitivity for TSV in dot-blot immunoassay and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. The MAb reacted against native TSV-BZ, TSV variants from Sinaloa, Mexico (TSV-SI) and TSV variants from Hawaii (TSV-HI) in dot-blot immunoassay. By IHC, the antibody identified the virus in a pattern similar to the digoxigenin-labelled TSV-cDNA probe for the TSV-BZ, TSV-HI and TSV-SI variants, but not for the TSV variants from Venezuela (TSV-VE) and the TSV variants from Thailand (TSV-TH). MAb 2C4 did not react against other shrimp pathogens or with normal shrimp tissue. Western blot analysis showed a strong reaction against CP2, a region of high antigenic variability amongst TSV variants. This antibody has potential diagnostic application in detection and differentiation of certain TSV biotypes.
