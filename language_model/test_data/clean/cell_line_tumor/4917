A series of bile acid-polyamine amides conjugated with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) as potential antitumor prodrugs in the form of phosphoramidates were synthesized in good yields and their antitumor activities were assayed against two human cancer cells in vitro: cervix cancer HeLa cells and renal cancer 7860 cells. The improved antitumor activity probably derived from the enhanced delivery efficiency of AZT due to bile acid-polyamine conjugates.
