In our continuing effort to discover and develop apoptosis inducing 4-aryl-4H-chromenes as novel anticancer agents, we explored the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of alkyl substituted pyrrole fused at the 7,8-positions. A methyl group substituted at the nitrogen in the 7-position of the pyrrole ring led to a series of potent apoptosis inducers with potency in the low nanomolar range. These compounds were also found to be low nanomolar or subnanomolar inhibitors of cell growth, and they inhibited tubulin polymerization, indicating that methylation of the 7-position nitrogen does not change the mechanism of action of these chromenes. Compound 2d was identified as a highly potent apoptosis inducer with an EC50 value of 2 nM and a highly potent inhibitor of cell growth with a GI50 value of 0.3 nM in T47D cells.
