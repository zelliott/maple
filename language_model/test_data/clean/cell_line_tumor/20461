EWS functions in RNA splicing and transcription by encoding an RNA binding protein, which results in the chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) found in Ewing sarcoma. EWS interacts with the microprocessor complex involving Drosha and DGCR8, which play roles as the cofactors of primary microRNA processing. However, the role of EWS in microRNA biogenesis has not been investigated. Here, we show that endogenous EWS interacts with endogenous Drosha by IP-western blotting. In addition, EWS knockout mouse decreased the expression of Drosha. The depletion of EWS results in the accumulation of precursor let-7g but down-regulates mature let-7g in U2OS cells. Consistently, mature let 7g was suppressed in both Ewing sarcoma cell and primary Ewing sarcoma. Also, expression levels of Dicer and CCND1 (Cyclin D1), which are known target genes of the let-7 family were upregulated. Our findings suggest that EWS mediates generation of mature let-7g from pre-let-7g.
