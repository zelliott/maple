We examined the effect of E(2) and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) on the proliferation and estrogen receptor (ER) activities in normal human prostate cells. SERMs such as toremifene, raloxifene and tamoxifen suppressed the proliferation of prostate epithelial and stromal cells whereas anti-androgens did not. In prostate stromal cells, the transactivation activities of ER were enhanced by adding E(2) and reduced remarkably by toremifene. The results indicate that the ER-mediated pathway plays a central role in the growth of normal prostate cells.
