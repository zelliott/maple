The poor prognosis of foregut cancers might, in part, be due to the immune tolerising effect of tumour antigens which are shed into the gastrointestinal tract and processed by the gut immune system. This would create a tumour specific tolerance without compromise of global immune functions. Experimental data shows that orally fed cancer tissue induces a non cross reactive attenuation of the cellular anti tumour host responses and confers a growth advantage specific to individual cancers. Although the cellular basis of such pro-tumourogenic responses has yet to be established, it is likely, based on studies of oral tolerance mechanisms, that recruitment of immune suppressive T cells (T(regs)) may be responsible. Abrogation of oral immune tolerance to the tumour by immune based therapy could represent a significant advance in the management of upper gastrointestinal cancers.
