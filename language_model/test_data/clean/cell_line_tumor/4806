The FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase is expressed in more than 90% of acute myelogeneous leukemias (AMLs), up to 30% of which carry an internal tandem duplication (ITD) within the FLT3 gene. Although varying duplication sites exist, most FLT3-ITDs affect a single protein domain. We analyzed the FLT3-ITD of an AML patient for encoding HLA class I-restricted immunogenic peptides. One of the tested peptides (YVDFREYEYY) induced in vitro autologous T-cell responses restricted by HLA-A*0101 that were also detectable ex vivo. These peptide-reactive T cells recognized targets transfected with the patient's FLT3-ITD, but not wild-type FLT3, and recognized the patient's AML cells. Our results demonstrate that AML leukemic blasts can in principle process and present immunogenic FLT3-ITD neoepitopes. Therefore, FLT3-ITD represents a potential candidate target antigen for the immunotherapy of AML.
