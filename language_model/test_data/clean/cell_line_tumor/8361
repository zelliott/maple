Hydrogen peroxide, as other reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during redox processes, induces lipid membrane peroxidation and protein degeneration causing cell apoptosis. ROS are recently considered as messengers in cell signalling processes, which, through reversible protein disulphide bridges formation, activate regulatory factors of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Disulphide bridges formation is catalysed by sulphydryl oxidase enzymes.

The neuroprotective effect of ALR protein (Alrp), a sulphydryl oxidase enzyme, on H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells has been evaluated.

Cell viability, flow cytometric evaluation of apoptotic cells, fluorescent changes of nuclear morphology, immunocytochemistry Alrp detection, Western blot evaluation of mitochondrial cyt c release and mitochondrial swelling were determined.

Alrp prevents the H(2)O(2)-induced cell viability loss, apoptotic cell death and mitochondrial swelling in SH-SY5Y cells in culture.

The data demonstrate that Alrp improves SH-SY5Y cells survival in H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. It is speculated that this effect could be related to the Alrp enzymatic activity.
