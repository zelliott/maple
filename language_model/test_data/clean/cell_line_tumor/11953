The eukaryotic initiation factor 3f (eIF3f) is the p47 subunit of the multi-subunit eIF3 complex. eIF3 plays an important role in translation initiation. In the present study, we investigate the biological function of eIF3f in translation and apoptosis in tumor cells. We demonstrated for the first time that eIF3f is downregulated in most human tumors using a cancer profiling array and confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR in melanoma and pancreatic cancer. Overexpression of eIF3f inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells. Silencing of eIF3f protects melanoma cells from apoptosis. We further investigated the biological function of eIF3f. In vitro translation studies indicate that eIF3f is a negative regulator of translation and that the region between amino acids 170 and 248 of eIF3f is required for its translation regulatory function. Ectopic expression of eIF3f inhibits translation and overall cellular protein synthesis. Ribosome profile and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) fragmentation assays revealed that eIF3f reduces ribosomes, which may be associated with rRNA degradation. We propose that eIF3f may play a role in ribosome degradation during apoptosis. These data provide critical insights into the cellular function of eIF3f and in linking translation initiation and apoptosis.
