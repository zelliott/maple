Recent evidence indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. This study was designed to evaluate the possible interaction between the COX-2 and EGFR signaling pathways in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Immunohistochemical analysis using serial sections of human HCC tissues revealed positive correlation between COX-2 and EGFR in HCC cells (P < 0.01). Overexpression of COX-2 in cultured HCC cells (Hep3B) or treatment with PGE(2) or the selective EP(1) receptor agonist, ONO-DI-004, increased EGFR phosphorylation and tumor cell invasion. The PGE(2)-induced EGFR phosphorylation and cell invasiveness were blocked by the EP(1) receptor siRNA or antagonist ONO-8711 and by two EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, AG1478 and PD153035. The EP(1)-induced EGFR transactivation and cell invasion involves c-Src, in light of the presence of native binding complex of EP(1)/Src/EGFR and the inhibition of PGE(2)-induced EGFR phosphorylation and cell invasion by the Src siRNA and the Src inhibitor, PP2. Further, overexpression of COX-2 or treatment with PGE(2) also induced phosphorylation of c-Met, another receptor tyrosine kinase critical for HCC cell invasion. Moreover, activation of EGFR by EGF increased COX-2 promoter activity and protein expression in Hep3B and Huh-7 cells, whereas blocking PGE(2) synthesis or EP(1) attenuated EGFR phosphorylation induced by EGF, suggesting that the COX-2/PGE(2)/EP(1) pathway also modulate the activation of EGFR by its cognate ligand. These findings disclose a cross-talk between the COX-2/PGE(2)/EP(1) and EGFR/c-Met signaling pathways that coordinately regulate human HCC cell invasion.
