Greater than 40% of breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen exhibit de novo or acquired tumor resistance. Recent clinical evidence indicates that loss of expression of HER4 is an independent marker for tamoxifen resistance. In direct corroboration with clinical observations, suppression of HER4 expression in the tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 and T47D breast tumor cell lines resulted in resistance to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, HER4 expression was lost in three independent MCF-7 models of acquired tamoxifen resistance. The HER4 intracellular domain (4ICD) is an independently signaling nuclear protein that functions as a potent ERalpha coactivator. In addition, mitochondrial 4ICD functions as a proapoptotic BH3-only protein. Tamoxifen disrupts an estrogen-driven interaction between ERalpha and 4ICD while promoting mitochondrial accumulation of the 4ICD BH3-only protein. BCL-2 inhibition of tamoxifen-induced apoptosis and tamoxifen activation of BAK, independent of BAX, further supports a role for 4ICD during tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. Finally, reintroduction of HER4, but not HER4 with a mutated BH3 domain, restores tamoxifen sensitivity to tamoxifen-resistant TamR cells in a xenograft model. Clinically, breast cancer patients with tumor expression of nuclear 4ICD responded to tamoxifen therapy with no clinical failures reported after 14 years of follow-up, whereas 20% of patients lacking nuclear 4ICD expression succumbed to their disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Our identification of the HER4/4ICD BH3-only protein as a critical mediator of tamoxifen action provides a clinically important role for 4ICD in human cancer and reveals a potential tumor marker to predict patient response to tamoxifen therapy.
