Synthesis of three novel 2'-deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoro-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil derivatives [18F]FPAU, [18F]FBrVAU, and [18F]FTMAU is reported. The compounds were synthesized by coupling of 1-bromo-2-deoxy-2-fluoro sugars with corresponding silylated uracil derivatives. In vitro cell uptake indicated that all three compounds are taken up selectively in RG2TK+ cells with negligible uptake in RG2 cells. The results indicate that [18F]FBrVAU and [18F]FTMAU have better uptake profiles in comparison to [18F]FPAU and have potential as PET probes for imaging HSV1-tk gene expression.
