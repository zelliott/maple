To secure iron from transferrin, hepatocytes use two pathways, one dependent on transferrin receptor (TfR 1) and the other, of greater capacity but lower affinity, independent of TfR 1. To clarify further similarities and differences of the two pathways, we have suppressed TfR 1 by 75-80% in human hepatoma-derived HuH-7 cells co-transfected with vectors bearing full-length TfR 1 cDNA or its first 100 bases in antisense orientation. Suppression of TfR 1 does not lead to down regulation of TfR 2, a recently described second transferrin receptor of as yet uncertain function. Both pathways depend on acidification of the compartments in which iron release from transferrin takes place. Recycling of transferrin is a feature of both pathways, but is substantially more efficient in the receptor-dependent route. Degradation of transferrin occurs only in the receptor-independent route, in the first example of a specific catabolic pathway of transferrin. Linkage of cellular iron uptake to release of the synergistic anion (without which iron is not bound by transferrin) is particularly evident in the receptor-independent pathway. Although the relative importance of the two pathways in normal and deranged hepatic iron metabolism remains to be determined, the receptor-independent route is a substantial accessory for iron uptake to the better-known receptor-dependent track.
