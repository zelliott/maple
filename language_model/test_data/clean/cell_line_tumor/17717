The TCR zeta-chain-associated protein of 70 kDA (ZAP-70) and Syk tyrosine kinases play critical roles in regulating TCR-mediated signal transduction. They not only share some overlapped functions but also may play unique roles in regulating the function and development of T cells. However, it is not known whether they have different effects on the activation and activation-induced cell death of T cells. To address this question, we generated cDNAs encoding chimeric molecules that a tailless TCR zeta-chain was directly linked to truncated ZAP-70 (Z/ZAP) or Syk (Z/Syk) molecules lacking the two Src homology 2 domains. Transfection of these molecules into zeta-chain-deficient cells restored their TCR expression. In addition, Z/ZAP and Z/Syk transfectants but not control cells demonstrated kinase activities in phosphorylating an exogenous substrate specific for ZAP-70 and Syk kinases. Z/ZAP transfectants activated through TCRs underwent a faster time course of apoptosis and had a greater percentage of apoptotic cells than that of Z/Syk and control cells. Activated Z/ZAP transfectants increased Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) expression 3- and 40-fold, respectively. Blocking of the Fas/FasL interaction could inhibit the apoptosis of Z/ZAP transfectants. In contrast, although activated Z/Syk transfectants could increase FasL expression, their Fas expression actually decreased and the percentage of apoptotic cells did not increase. Further studies of the mechanisms revealed that activation of Z/ZAP but not Z/Syk transfectants resulted in rapid activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 that could also be inhibited by blocking Fas/FasL interaction. These results demonstrated that ZAP-70 and Syk play distinct roles in T cell activation and activation-induced cell death.
