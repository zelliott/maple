This work reports results of experiments in hollow-fiber bioreactor C6 glioma cell cultures where the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of intracellular water (iADC) was measured at diffusion times between 0.83 and 40 ms. The experiments were carried out before and after the onset of permanent ischemia. The changes in iADC following ischemia were dependent on the diffusion time employed in the experiment. An ischemia-induced decrease in the iADC was measured at short diffusion times, while at long diffusion times the iADC increased. Decreases in the iADC measured at short diffusion times are interpreted to be a result of a decrease in the intrinsic diffusivity of intracellular water due to energy failure. Increases in iADC measured at long diffusion times, are interpreted to result from cell swelling.
