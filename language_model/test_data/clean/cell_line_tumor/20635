Adenovirus vectors have been utilized for cancer gene therapies. The present study examined the oncolytic effects of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) and fiber-substituted conditionally replicating adenovirus (CRAD) Ad5/F35 vectors on the human malignant mesothelioma cells MSTO-211H, NCI-H28, NCI-H2052, and NCI-H2452 cells.

For the adenovirus, the first mRNA/protein to be made (~1 h after infection) is E1A. Ad5F35 and Ad5 CRAD vectors containing the E1 gene controlled by the human midkine promoter (Ad5F35/MKp-E1 and Ad5/MKp-E1, respectively) were constructed. Western blotting and cell viability assays were carried out in cells transfected with Ad5/MKp-E1 and Ad5F35/MKp-E1.

Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), a cell surface target of Ad5, and CD46, a cell surface target of Ad35, were expressed in all the malignant mesothelioma cell lines examined here, as much as in HEK293 cells, with no significant differences in the expression levels among cells. Both Ad5/MKp-E1 and Ad5F35/MKp-E1 induced oncolysis of malignant mesothelioma cells in a viral particle-dependent manner, with similar efficacy.

The results of the present study suggest that both Ad5/MKp-E1 and Ad5F35/MKp-E1 are useful for the gene therapy of human malignant mesothelioma.
