Lonicera japonica Thunb.(Caprifoliaceae) has long been known as an anti-inflammatory. In the present study, the effect of water fraction of Lonicera japonica (LJ) on trypsin-induced mast cell activation was examined. HMC-1 cells were stimulated with trypsin (100 nM) in the presence or absence of LJ (10, 100, and 1000 microg/mL). TNF-alpha and tryptase production were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription-PCR. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation was assessed by Western blot. Trypsin activity was measured by using Bz-DL-Arg-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) as substrate. LJ (10, 100, and 1000 microg/mL) inhibited TNF-alpha secretion in a dose-dependent manner. LJ (10, 100, and 1000 microg/mL) also inhibited TNF-alpha and tryptase mRNA expression in trypsin-stimulated HMC-1. Furthermore, LJ inhibited trypsin-induced ERK phosphorylation. However, LJ did not affect the trypsin activity even 1000 microg/mL. These results indicate that LJ may inhibit trypsin-induced mast cell activation through the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation than the inhibition of trypsin activity.
