In this study, the light chain (κ) and heavy chain (γ) sequences of the monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were sub-cloned into the eukaryotic pcDNA3.1 (+) (Hygro) and the pcDNA3.1 (+) (Neo) expression vectors using the traditional and homologous recombination methods. To express the antibody, the recombinant plasmids were transfected into the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and the K562 cell lines. The recombinant antibody was then purified using the protein A affinity chromatography. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the inhibition of VEGF-induced mitogenesis of the recombinant antibody, the bovine aorta endothelial like cells were employed. The results showed specialization and conjunction of the recombinant antibody to the VEGF. It was also indicated that the antibody expression in the K562 cell lines was higher than the CHO cell lines. Furthermore, the in vitro VEGF inhabitation of the recombinant antibodies which were produced from the K562 cell line, and the CHO cell line, were similar. This proved that the K562 cell line is a good substitute for the CHO cell line in the production of the recombinant antibodies.
