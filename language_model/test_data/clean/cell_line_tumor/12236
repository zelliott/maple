The synthesis of a series of 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-[1,2-c]pyrazol(in)es substituted with benzenesulfonamide, N1,N3-disubstituted sulfonylurea, sulfonylthiourea pharmacophores, and some derived thiazolidinone and thiazoline ring systems is described. All the newly synthesized target compounds were subjected to the NCI-in vitro disease-oriented antitumor screening to be evaluated for their antitumor activity. Eight compounds namely; 2-4, 7, 8, 10, 13, and 16; showed promising broad spectrum antitumor activity against most of the tested subpanel tumor cell lines (GI50 < 100 microM). Compound 3, 4-(3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4H-indeno[1,2-c]pyrazol- 2-yl)-benzenesulfonamide; although it did not show the highest growth inhibitory value (GI50 (MG-MID) 13.2 microM), it proved to be the most active analog in this study with the highest cytostatic and cytotoxic potentials (TGI and LC50 (MG-MID) concentrations of 33.1 and 66.1 microM, respectively). In general, the oxidized pyrazoles displayed better antitumor activity than their parent pyrazoline analogs, whereas the benzenesulfonamides and the N1, N3-disubstituted sulfonylureas showed significant better antitumor spectrum than the sulfonylthioureido and the derived thiazole analogs.
