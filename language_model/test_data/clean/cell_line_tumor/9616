The effects of echovirus 11 infection on RD human cell line (derived from rhabdomyosarcoma) were studied using (1)H NMR spectroscopy and optical microscopy. Both uninfected and infected cells consumed glucose and produced lactate, acetate and formate as extracellular metabolites. In infected whole cells, phosphocholine and uridine-sugar were observed in addition to the metabolites observed in uninfected cells. Water-soluble intracellular metabolites of infected cells showed glutamine, phosphocholine and glycine which were not observed in uninfected cells. Cellular metabolites except lipid components gradually decreased and disappeared during 24-48 h of viral infection. The quantity of lipid components in infected cells was comparable with that in uninfected cells, indicating that echovirus 11 does not utilize cell lipid molecules. Unlike optical microscopy, (1)H NMR spectroscopy identified early stages of infection through metabolic changes. These results may have potential implications in probing virus-cell interactions using NMR-based metabolomics.
