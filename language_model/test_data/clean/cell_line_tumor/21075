Two new triterpene glycosides, argusides D and E (1 and 2, resp.), have been isolated from the sea cucumber Bohadschia argus Jaeger collected in the South China Sea. Their structures have been established by spectral analysis (ESI-MS, and 1D- and 2D-NMR) and chemical evidence. Compounds 1 and 2 both possess an holostane-type triterpene aglycone with a C(9)=C(11) bond, an OH group at C(12), and tetrasaccharide moieties, but differ in the side chains. The two glycosides exhibited significant cytotoxicities against four human tumor cell lines, A549, HCT-116, HepG2, and MCF-7.
