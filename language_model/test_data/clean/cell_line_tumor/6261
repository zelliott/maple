Ipomoea obscura (L.) Ker-Gawl, is a medicinal herb with indole alkaloids as an active constituent. In this study, we investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of I. obscura extract and one of its major compounds Ipobscurine-A (IPO-A).

In vivo angiogenesis was induced by injecting B16F10 melanoma cells intradermally on the shaven ventral skin of C57BL/6 mice. In vitro experiments were conducted using human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

I. obscura and IPO-A significantly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation in vitro. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced sprouting of endothelial cells from rat aorta ex vivo was also inhibited. A marked decrease in the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the expressions of VEGF, cyclooxygenase-2, and nitric oxide synthase by B16F10 cells were observed after the treatment with the extract or IPO-A. Intraperitoneal administration of the extract significantly inhibited B16F10 melanoma cell line-induced neo-vessel formation in C57BL/6 mice in vivo. Analysis of serum cytokine profile clearly showed that extract significantly reduced the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor and the most potent angiogenic factor VEGF in animals. Serum NO level was also found to be significantly lowered by the administration of the extract. Anti-angiogenic factors such as TIMP-1 and IL-2 level were elevated in the extract-treated animals.

These data clearly demonstrate that I. obscura extract and IPO-A inhibit the tumor-specific angiogenesis by downregulating pro-angiogenic factors such as MMP, VEGF, and pro-inflammatory mediators and upregulating anti-angiogenic factors such as IL-2 and TIMP-1.
