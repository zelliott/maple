Type I interferons (IFN-alpha/-beta) are capable of suppressing c-myc mRNA expression by modulating post-transcriptional processing. However, the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon is poorly understood. We previously established that human polynucleotide phosphorylase (hPNPase(old-35)), a type I IFN-inducible 3',5' exoribonuclease involved in mRNA degradation, induces G1 cell cycle arrest and eventually apoptosis by specifically degrading c-myc mRNA. We now demonstrate a close association between IFN-beta-induced hPNPase(old-35) upregulation and c-myc downregulation in human melanoma cells. Employing stable melanoma cell clones expressing hPNPase(old-35) small inhibitory RNA, we demonstrate that hPNPase(old-35) is a key molecule coupled with IFN-beta-mediated downregulation of c-myc mRNA. Inhibition of hPNPase(old-35) or overexpression of c-myc protects melanoma cells from IFN-beta-mediated growth inhibition, emphasizing the importance of hPNPase(old-35) upregulation and consequent c-myc downregulation in IFN-beta-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. In these contexts, targeted overexpression of hPNPase(old-35) might be a novel therapeutic strategy for c-myc-overexpressing and IFN-resistant tumors, such as melanomas.
