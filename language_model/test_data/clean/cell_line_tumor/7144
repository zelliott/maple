2-(8-Hydroxy-6-methoxy-1-oxo-1Eta-2-benzopyran-3-yl)propionic acid (NM-3) is a small molecule isocoumarin derivative that has recently entered clinical trials as an orally bioavailable anticancer agent. NM-3 induces lethality of human carcinoma cells by both apoptotic and nonapoptotic mechanisms and potentiates the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. The present studies have evaluated the effects of NM-3 on human multiple myeloma (MM) cells. The results demonstrate that NM-3 potentiates dexamethasone-induced killing of both dexamethasone-sensitive MM1.S and dexamethasone-resistant RPMI8226 and U266 MM cells. We show that NM-3 enhances dexamethasone-induced release of the mitochondrial apoptogenic factors cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO. The results also demonstrate that NM-3 enhances dexamethasone-induced activation of the intrinsic caspase-9->caspase-3 apoptotic pathway. In concert with these results, NM-3 potentiates dexamethasone-induced apoptosis of MM1.S cells. Moreover, NM-3 acts synergistically with dexamethasone in inducing apoptosis of the dexamethasone-resistant RPMI8226 and U266 MM cells. These findings indicate that NM-3 may be effective in combination with dexamethasone in the treatment of MM.
