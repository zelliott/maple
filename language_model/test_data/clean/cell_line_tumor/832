To study the mechanism of topotecan (TPT) resistance in ovarian cancer cell line.

A TPT-resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780/TPT established in this laboratory was used in this study. Intracellular rhodamine fluorescence intensity of the TPT-resistant cells and parental cells were measured by flow cytometry. The gene expression of membrane protein transporter such as transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) was evaluated by RT-PCR. The antisense-phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (ASODN) including a translation initiation site of BCRP mRNA was transferred into resistant cells by liposome.

Intracellular rhodamine fluorescence intensity of the resistant cells was 31.19% of that in the parental cells (P < 0.01). No expression of P-gp was demonstrated, and that of MRP was very weak in the TPT-resistant cells (relative expression value = 0.057). BCRP was overexpressed in the TPT-resistant cells (relative expression = 0.66), but not in the parental cells. Transfer of ASODN into resistant cells resulted in a 59.42% reduction of BCRP gene expression (P < 0.05) and an obviously increased intracellular rhodamine fluorescence intensity from 5.42 to 16.63 (P < 0.05).

The overexpression of BCRP which mediated drug efflux may play an important role in the induction of TPT-resistance in ovarian cancer.
