We have isolated a new prenylated chalcone from the roots of Sophora flavescens (Leguminosae). We determined that structure of this compound is 7,9,2',4'-tetrahydroxy-8-isopentenyl-5-methoxychalcone (1) on the basis of spectroscopic analysis (1D and 2D NMR data). Compound 1 exhibited potent cytotoxicity against human acute promyelocytic (HL60), mouse lymphocytic (L1210) and human histiocytic (U937) leukemia cells.
