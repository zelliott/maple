Ovarian cancer is potentially well suited for local monoclonal antibody (mAb) immunotherapy, because it remains within the peritoneal cavity for a long period of time before giving rise to distant metastases. At the stage of minimal residual disease, the cells appear to be in a state of dormancy (G(0)) or at least have lower rates of tumour cell proliferation. They should be a promising target for immunotherapy. Here we first examined the cell-cycle expression of CD59 and decay-accelerating factor (DAF; CD55) on four different ovarian carcinoma cell lines, using simultaneous flow cytometric analysis of DNA content or the cell-cycle-specific nuclear proliferation protein Ki67 and CD59 or DAF surface expression. We found that CD59 and DAF are stably expressed throughout the cell cycle. The polyvalent approach to target-independent antigens to improve the efficiency of mAb complement (C)-mediated damages was promising, and tumour cells become sensitive to C damage, when incubated with cross-linked mAb against different tumour-associated antigens. Although, such immune complex-mediated C activation was rather ineffective in killing the cells, it could be potentiated by the addition of blocking mAb against CD59 and DAF. Our results suggest that the activities of intrinsic C regulators must be neutralized to make minimal residual disease a promising target for antibody therapy.
