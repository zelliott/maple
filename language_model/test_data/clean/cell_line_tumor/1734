Selenium analogues (4b-4h, and 4j) of two known sulfur compounds were synthesized and tested their anticancer activities. The selenium compound 4b had comparable activity with its sulfur analogue 4a, while DNA-binding study showed these two compounds had similar interaction with ct-DNA, the K(b) was 8.23 and 2.36, respectively. The primary results showed that most compounds had moderate anticancer activities with IC(50) values between 10(-6) and 10(-5) M. Another selenium analogue 4j showed the highest activity with the IC(50) values around 5.3 Î¼M against K562 and MCF-7 cell lines. More importantly, the organochalcogen compounds exhibited stronger anticancer activities against K562 cell line than the other cell lines tested.
