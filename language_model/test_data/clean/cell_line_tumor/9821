A series of novel 3beta, 7alpha, 11alpha-trihydroxy-pregn-21-benzylidene-5-en-20-one derivatives were synthesized and characterized by NMR, HRMS. The pregnenolone (1) was first biotransformed by Mucor circinelloides var lusitanicus to 3beta, 7alpha, 11alpha-trihydroxy-pregn-5-en-20-one (3), then 3 was treated with various benzaldehydes to produce 3beta, 7alpha, 11alpha-trihydroxy-pregn-21-benzylidene-5-en-20-one derivatives. These derivatives showed remarkable activity against EC109 cells. The absolute configuration of 3 was also confirmed by signal-crystal X-ray analysis.
