The high expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) belongs to one of the most important factors causing multidrug-resistant (MDR) of cancer cells. P-gp is primarily associated with plasma membrane; however, small fraction of that protein is present in the nuclear envelope. Such phenomenon is observed in cancer cells and may result in the selection of MDR cells as the secondary tumor and/or resistant metastasis that significantly shorten patient survival rate. Here, we confirmed nuclear localization of P-gp in resistant LoVo cells and demonstrated its impact on doxorubicin efflux from the nucleus to cytoplasm. Furthermore, we showed that P-gp located at the nuclear envelope might have a different glycoside chain when compared to the form located in the cytoplasm. It suggests that the glycoside chain plays a role in the intracellular trafficking of P-gp and may decide about the destination place in the cell.
