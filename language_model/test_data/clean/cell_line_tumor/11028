In vivo administration of alcoholic extract of medicinal plant Tinospora cordifolia (TC) to mice bearing a spontaneous T cell lymphoma designated as Dalton's lymphoma prevented tumor growth-dependent regression of thymus. TC was found to augment proliferation of thymocytes with a concomitant decrease in thymocyte apoptosis. It also resulted in a decrease in the number of Hassal's corpuscles. Restoration of thymus homeostasis was caused by TC-dependent augmentation in production of thymocyte growth promoting cytokines Interleukin-2 and Interferon-gamma from thymocytes. TC was found to downregulate thymocyte apoptosis by modulation of Caspase pathway. TC administration retarded tumor growth and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. The possible mechanisms are discussed.
