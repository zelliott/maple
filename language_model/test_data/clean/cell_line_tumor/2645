The objectives of this study were to determine the antiproliferation effect of prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 as affected by 4 isoflavone fractions prepared from soybean cake and isoflavone standards genistein and daidzein. With the MTT test, most treatments were effective in inhibiting prostate cancer cell growth at a low dose of 5 and 10 mug/mL. In cell cycle analysis, the fractions of aglycon, a mixture of acetylglucoside and aglycon, as well as genistein and a combination of genistein and daidzein standards exhibited a high G2/M ratio for LNCaP, as did the acetylglucoside, genistein and a combination of genistein and daidzein standards for PC-3. Results of Western blotting revealed an increase in p53 protein expression of LNCaP following treatments of the aglycon fraction, genistein and a combination of genistein and daidzein standards. However, all the treatments did not affect Bcl-2 protein expression significantly in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells. A decline in cyclin B1 expression of LNCaP was observed for all the treatments, with the mixture of acetylglucoside and aglycon possessing the most pronounced effect. But for PC-3, a decrease in cyclin B1 expression was shown for all the isoflavones, with the exception of malonylglucoside, glucoside and acetylglucoside fractions. The outcome of this study may provide a basis for possible production of functional food in the future with soybean cake as raw material.
