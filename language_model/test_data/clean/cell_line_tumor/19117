Activity-directed isolation of the methylene chloride fraction of the roots of Rubia cordifolia L. resulted in the identification of a new epoxymollugin (3) and eight known compounds (1, 2, 4-9). The structures of the compounds were elucidated from chemical and spectroscopic evidence. In addition, their topoisomerase I and II inhibitory activities and cytotoxicities were measured.
