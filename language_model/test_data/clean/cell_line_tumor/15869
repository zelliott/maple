Three triterpenic acids, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and maslinic acid, at 2 or 4 μmol/L were used to study their antiangiogenic potential in human liver cancer Hep3B, Huh7 and HA22T cell lines. The effects of these compounds upon the level and/or expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-8, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) and cell invasion and migration were examined. Results showed that these triterpenic acids at 4 μmol/L significantly suppressed HIF-1α expression in three cell lines (P < 0.05); and these compounds at test doses failed to affect bFGF expression (P > 0.05). Three triterpenic acids dose-dependently decreased production and expression of VEGF and IL-8, retained glutathione level, lowered ROS and NO levels, and declined cell invasion and migration in test cell lines (P < 0.05). These compounds also dose-dependently reduced uPA production and expression in Hep3B and Huh7 cell lines (P < 0.05); but these agents only at 4 μmol/L significantly suppressed uPA production and expression in HA22T cells (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that these triterpenic acids are potent antiangiogenic agents to retard invasion and migration in liver cancer cells.
