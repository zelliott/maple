The objective of this study was to develop and statistically optimize chitosan nanospheres. For this purpose chitosan powder was turned into nanospheres using tripolyphosphate as a crosslinker and through ionic gelation. D-optimal response surface design was applied to optimize the nanospheres. Their size and polydispersity index (PDI) were measured as the dependant variables. Then the inactivated influenza virus and/or CpG ODN or Quillaja saponin (QS) were incorporated into the chitosan nanospheres. The release profiles of the antigen and both adjuvants were obtained. The toxicity of the formulations was tested by XTT using Calu 6 cell lines. The size distribution and PDI of plain chitosan nanospheres was 581.1 ± 32.6 and 0.478 ± 0.04. After 4 h the release of antigen, QS and CpG from the chitosan matrix were 33, 36 and 62%, respectively. The inactivated virus remained intact during preparation, as revealed by the SDS-PAGE method. Differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy indicated no serious structural changes in the chitosan carrier in the presence of either the antigen or the immunoadjuvants. Although the antigen loaded into chitosan nanospheres showed slight cytotoxicity on lung-cancer cells, co-encapsulation of the adjuvant (especially CpG) lowered this effect. The results demonstrated that chitosan as a carrier and immunostimulator, along with CpG or QS adjuvants, creates a potential influenza vaccine delivery system which can be administered nasally.
