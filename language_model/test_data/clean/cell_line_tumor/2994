A heterozygous genomic deletion removing exons 6 to 9 of the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene, predicting to result into a truncated protein lacking the first microtubule binding domain, was detected in a patient with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Cell culture experiments showed that the truncated tau isoforms had a dramatic decrease in the normal binding to microtubules but acquired the ability to bind microtubule associated protein-1B (MAP-1B). This indicates that this tauopathy likely results both from a loss of function mechanism and from a deleterious gain of function by which cytoplasmic deleted forms of tau sequester another MAP. Both mechanisms could contribute to impair microtubule dynamics.
