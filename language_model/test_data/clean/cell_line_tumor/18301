The human LoVo and WI-38 cells were exposed to high power non-invasive microwaves. The apoptotic effect of the microwaves on the cells was examined with TUNEL, DNA fragmentation and flow cytometry. The human colon cancer LoVo cells showed pathological change of apoptosis but the normal human WI-38 cells showed no detectable apoptotic response. Exposure of the mice bearing tumor tissue to microwave resulted in a significant regression of the tumor tissue in the animal models. We demonstrate that the LoVo cells can be induced into apoptosis by microwave treatment both in in vitro and in vivo. The data described in this communication implies the possibility that microwave therapy may become a novel approach in human colorectal cancer treatment.
