The syntheses of new conformationally locked North- and South-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexene nucleosides is reported. The North analogues were synthesized by a convergent approach from the known (1S,2R,5R)-5-[(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)methyl]bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-3-en-2-ol by Mitsunobu coupling with the nucleobases. The South analogues were synthesized from their bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane nucleoside precursors by the selective protection of the primary hydroxy group, conversion of the secondary alcohol into a good leaving group, and base-catalyzed elimination to generate the olefin. The transformation of a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane nucleoside into a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexene nucleoside flattens the five-membered ring of the bicyclic system and rescues anti-HIV activity for North-D4T, North-D4A, and South-D4C. The relationship between planarity and the anti/syn disposition of the nucleobase that is favored by a particular pseudosugar platform are proposed as key parameters in controlling biological activity.
