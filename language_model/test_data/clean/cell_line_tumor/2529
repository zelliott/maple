Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) has been implicated in tumor cell proliferation and survival and in tumor angiogenesis. We sought to evaluate the effects of curcumin, an inhibitor of NF-κB, on a xenograft model of disseminated neuroblastoma.

For in vitro studies, neuroblastoma cell lines NB1691, CHLA-20, and SK-N-AS were treated with various doses of liposomal curcumin. Disseminated neuroblastoma was established in vivo by tail vein injection of NB1691-luc cells into SCID mice, which were then treated with 50 mg/kg/day of liposomal curcumin 5 days/week intraperitoneally.

Curcumin suppressed NF-κB activation and proliferation of all neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro. In vivo, curcumin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in disseminated tumor burden. Curcumin-treated tumors had decreased NF-κB activity and an associated significant decrease in tumor cell proliferation and an increase in tumor cell apoptosis, as well as a decrease in tumor vascular endothelial growth factor levels and microvessel density.

Liposomal curcumin suppressed neuroblastoma growth, with treated tumors showing a decrease in NF-κB activity. Our results suggest that liposomal curcumin may be a viable option for the treatment of neuroblastoma that works via inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.
