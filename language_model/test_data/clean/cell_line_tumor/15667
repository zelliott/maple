The serine/threonine Pim kinases are overexpressed in solid cancers and hematologic malignancies and promote cell growth and survival. Here, we find that a novel Pim kinase inhibitor, SMI-4a, or Pim-1 siRNA blocked the rapamycin-sensitive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) activity by stimulating the phosphorylation and thus activating the mTORC1 negative regulator AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for all three Pim kinases [triple knockout (TKO) MEFs] demonstrated activated AMPK driven by elevated ratios of AMPATP relative to wild-type MEFs. Consistent with these findings, TKO MEFs were found to grow slowly in culture and have decreased rates of protein synthesis secondary to a diminished amount of 5'-cap-dependent translation. Pim-3 expression alone in TKO MEFs was sufficient to reverse AMPK activation, increase protein synthesis, and drive MEF growth similar to wild type. Pim-3 expression was found to markedly increase the protein levels of both c-Myc and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), enzymes capable of regulating glycolysis and mitochondrial biogenesis, which were diminished in TKO MEFs. Overexpression of PGC-1α in TKO MEFs elevated ATP levels and inhibited the activation of AMPK. These results demonstrate the Pim kinase-mediated control of energy metabolism and thus regulation of AMPK activity. We identify an important role for Pim-3 in modulating c-Myc and PGC-1α protein levels and cell growth.
