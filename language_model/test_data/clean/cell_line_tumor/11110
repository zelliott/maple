To compare the alterations in proteomes between cisplatin-treated and -untreated human ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells, and to explore the feasibility of proteomics in research about antitumor mechanisms of agents, SKOV3 cells were exposed to cisplatin (6 microg/mL) for 6 h. Then, the cells were collected and solubilized and global proteins were extracted by lysis buffer; two-dimensional electrophoresis was conducted with the IPG readystrips as carriers; the gels were stained with Coomassie blue and alterations between gels were compared by PDQuest. Eventually, 11 spots with significant differences were selected and excised and the proteins were identified by PMF and MS/MS analysis. The results revealed that exposure to cisplatin could notably increase expressions of some proteins, such as tropomyosin family, actin family, triosephosphate isomerase family, and HSP60, etc.; while expressions of some other proteins decreased, such as enolase family, etc. Those proteins were involved in cellular energy metabolism, transformation, apoptosis and morphologic maintenance, which suggested that alterations of those physiological processes might be involved in anti-tumor mechanism of cisplatin.
