Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive malignant tumour of mesothelial origin associated with asbestos exposure. Because MPM has limited response to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the prognosis is very poor. Several researchers have reported that cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 play an important role in the growth of MPM. Previously, it was reported that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) inhibited the production and function of IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in experiments using lung fibroblasts. We investigated whether ATRA had an inhibitory effect on the cell growth of MPM, the origin of which was mesenchymal cells similar to lung fibroblasts, using a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. We estimated the tumour growth and performed quantitative measurements of IL-6, TGF-beta1 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR)-beta mRNA levels both of cultured MPM cells and cells grown in mice with or without the administration of ATRA. ATRA significantly inhibited MPM tumour growth. In vitro studies disclosed that the administration of ATRA reduced 1) mRNA levels of TGF-beta1, TGF-beta1 receptors and PDGFR-beta, and 2) TGF-beta1-dependent proliferation and PDGF-BB-dependent migration of MPM cells. These data may provide a rationale to explore the clinical use of ATRA for the treatment of MPM.
