The oncogenic nature ascribed to the PIM-2 kinase relies mostly on phosphorylation of substrates that act as pro-survival/anti-apoptotic factors. Nevertheless, pro-survival effects can also result from activating DNA repair mechanisms following damage. In this study, we addressed the possibility that PIM-2 plays a role in the cellular response to UV damage, an issue that has never been addressed before. We found that in U2OS cells, PIM-2 expression and activity increased upon exposure to UVC radiation (2-50 mJ/cm(2)), and Pim-2-silenced cells were significantly more sensitive to UV radiation. Overexpression of PIM-2 accelerated removal of UV-induced DNA lesions over time, reduced Î³H2AX accumulation in damaged cells, and rendered these cells significantly more viable following UV radiation. The protective effect of PIM-2 was mediated by increased E2F-1 and activated ATM levels. Silencing E2F-1 reduced the protective effect of PIM-2, whereas inhibiting ATM activity abrogated this protective effect, irrespective of E2F-1 levels. The results obtained in this study place PIM-2 upstream to E2F-1 and ATM in the UV-induced DNA damage response.
