Acute leukemia is a malignant clonal hematopoietic stem cell disease. In the current study, we examined the effects of bryostatin 5 on acute monocytic leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. We also explored the mechanisms and pathways underlying the increase in apoptosis induced by bryostatin 5. Bryostatin 5 inhibited the growth of primary acute monocytic leukemia cells and U937 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manners. Bryostatin 5 also induced an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in U937 cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that bryostatin 5-treated cells displayed typical apoptotic characteristics (chromatin condensation, karyopyknosis and formation of crescents and apoptotic bodies). In addition, bryostatin 5 increased the expression of P53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and slightly increased P53 expression. Bryostatin 5 also significantly decreased Bcl-XL expression and significantly increased the expression levels of Bak, Bax, cleaved caspase 9 and cleaved caspase 3. The pro-apoptotic activity of bryostatin 5 in U937 cells was inhibited by PUMA siRNA and z-LEHD-fmk (a specific caspase 9 inhibitor). In addition, the PUMA siRNA significantly affected the expression of cleaved caspase 9, whereas z-LEHD-fmk had little effect on the expression of PUMA. The results suggest that PUMA is located upstream of caspase 9 in this apoptotic signaling pathway. These novel findings provide mechanistic insight into the induction of apoptosis by bryostatin 5 and might facilitate the development of clinical strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of treatments for acute monocytic leukemia.
