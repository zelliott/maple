To investigate the effect of methylated oligonucleotide (MON) targeting Ki-67 promoter on the expression of Ki-67 gene and the proliferation and apoptosis of the human 786-0 renal carcinoma cells, human 786-0 cells were transfected with MON. The activity of Ki-67 promoter was detected by dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Among the five methylated oligonucleotides (MON(1)-MON(5)), MON(4) is the best excellent one in the inhibition of the Ki-67 promoter activity. The activity of Ki-67 promoter is decreased to 77.88% in 40-nM group, 50.07% in 80-nM group, 35.63% in 120-nM group, 26.09% in 160-nM group, and 16.98% in 200-nM group compared with 0-nM group. The activity of Ki-67 promoter in MON group is decreased to 61.96% at 8 h, 48.93% at 12 h, 15.97% at 24 h, 26.00% at 36 h, 35.01% at 48 h, 46.08% at 72 h, and 66.12% at 96 h compared with pGLBK235 group. These results show that the effect of MON is time- and dose-dependent. The activity of Ki-67 in MON group is decreased to 16.73% compared with pGLBK235 group, while the control groups have no significant difference. The expression of Ki-67 gene in 786-0 cells was detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The expression of Ki-67 mRNA is decreased to 61.04% and that of Ki-67 protein is decreased to 32.07% in MON group compared with the blank group. The proliferation of 786-0 cells was determined by WST-8. The cell proliferation in MON group is decreased to 61.02% at 24 h, 73.78% at 48 h, 79.72% at 72 h, and 91.53% at 96 h compared with the blank group. The cell apoptosis was measured by annexin V and propidium iodide. The number of apoptosis cells in MON group is 2.42 times of that in the blank group at earlier period and 2.57 times at mid-anaphase. We detected the effect of MON on the expression of bax and p53 by Western blot. Compared with the blank group, the expression of bax protein in MON group is increased by 66.12%, while the expression of p53 is decreased to 67.31%. Our study demonstrates that the methylated oligonucleotide targeting Ki-67 promoter has a remarkable effect on the inhibition of Ki-67 expression and the proliferation of the human 786-0 renal carcinoma cells and can induce apoptosis of the 786-0 cells.
