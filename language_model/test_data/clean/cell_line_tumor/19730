Altered signaling pathways are key regulators of cellular functions in tumor cells. Constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and -5 may be involved in tumor formation and progression. We have investigated the role of STAT5 in cutaneous melanoma metastases using various RNA and protein techniques. In melanoma specimens, Stat5b transcripts were upregulated approximately 3.8-fold. In 13 of 21 (62%) human melanoma metastases, STAT5 was phosphorylated in comparison to normal human melanocytes and benign nevi. The STAT5 target gene Bcl-2 was frequently upregulated. The investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed specific STAT5 activation by recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rEGF). rEGF-induced activation of STAT5 occurred in vitro through the non-receptor tyrosine kinases transforming gene (src) of Rous Sarcoma virus and Janus kinase 1. Inhibition of Stat5b expression by small interfering RNA strongly reduced the expression of Bcl-2 and led to decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in the melanoma cell lines A375 and BLM. Transfection with dominant-negative Stat5b caused enhanced cell death and G1 arrest in A375 cells. Our study identifies phosphorylated STAT5 in melanoma and shows regulation through rEGF; STAT5 may thus act as a survival factor for growth of human melanoma and may represent a potential target for molecular therapy.
