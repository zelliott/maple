Chromosomal rearrangements involving telomeric bands have been frequently detected in many malignancies and congenital diseases. To develop a useful tool to study chromosomal rearrangements within the telomeric band effectively and accurately, a whole set of telomeric band painting probes (TBP) has been generated by chromosome microdissection. The intensity and specificity of these TBPs have been tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization and all TBPs showed strong and specific signals to target regions. TBPs of 6q and 17p were successfully used to detect the loss of the terminal band of 6q in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and a complex translocation involving the 17p terminal band in a melanoma cell line. Meanwhile, the TBP of 21q was used to detect a de novo translocation, t(12;21), and the breakpoint at 21q was located at 21q22.2. Further application of these TBPs should greatly facilitate the cytogenetic analysis of complex chromosome rearrangements involving telomeric bands.
