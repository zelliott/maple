The platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin displays a wide range of antitumor activities. To date, no detailed data are available about the effects of oxaliplatin on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Herein, the anti-proliferation effects of oxaliplatin on HCCLM3 and Hep3B cells in vitro and in vivo are studied.

Cell viability was assessed by an MTT assay and apoptosis by flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy. Apoptosis-related proteins in HCCLM3 cells were evaluated by microarray analysis, quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR assay and western blotting. The effect of oxaliplatin was also studied in vivo using a xenograft model.

Oxaliplatin inhibited the growth of HCCLM3 and Hep3B cells. Using flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay, we found that apoptosis was the main mechanism by which oxaliplatin inhibited tumor progression. Microarray analysis, quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and western blot analysis further demonstrated downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax during oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis.

The anti-proliferation effect of oxaliplatin in HCC cells is due to induction of apoptosis. Therefore, oxaliplatin may be an effective treatment for HCC and its use merits further in-depth investigation.
