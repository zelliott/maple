Folate appended sterically-stabilized liposomes (FA-SL) were investigated for tumor targeting. Liposomes were prepared using HSPC, cholesterol and FA-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-SA. The liposomes with polyethylene glycol (PEG) without folic acid which has similar lipid composition were used for comparison. Liposomal preparations were characterized for shape, size and percent entrapment. The average size of liposomes was found to be in range 124-163 nm and maximum drug entrapment was found to be 34.2-40.3%. In vitro drug release from the formulations is obeying fickian release kinetics. Cellular uptake and IC(50) values of the FR-targeted formulation were determined in vitro in FR (+) B16F10 melanoma cells. In vitro cell binding of FA-SL exhibits 11-folds higher binding to B16F10 melanoma cells in comparison to SL. In vivo cytotoxicy assay on FR targeted liposomes gave IC(50) of 1.87 microM and non-targeted liposomes gave IC(50) of 4.02 microM. In therapeutic experiments 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), SL and FA-SL were administered at the dose of 10 mg 5-FU/kg body weight to B16F10 tumor bearing Balb/c mice. Administration of FA-SL formulation results in effective reduction in tumor growth as compared with free 5-FU and SL. Results indicate that folic acid appended SL bearing 5-FU are significantly (P < 0.01) active against primary tumor and metastasis than non-targeted sterically-SL. Thus, it could be concluded that folate coupled liposomal formulations enhanced drug uptake by tumor cells.
