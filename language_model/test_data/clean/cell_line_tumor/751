Antineoplastic properties of cyclopentenone 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) involve peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) dependent and independent mechanisms. We recently reported that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) partly independent of PPARgamma activation. Given the importance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a therapeutic target in head and neck SCC, we addressed the effects of 15d-PGJ2 on EGFR expression. 15d-PGJ2, but not other PPARgamma ligands, abrogated EGFR protein expression in oral SCC cells. 15d-PGJ2 also decreased EGFR mRNA, indicating downmodulation at the transcriptional level. Moreover, treatment with 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ2, a 15d-PGJ2 analog lacking the reactive carbonyl group, failed to effect EGFR expression. These findings provide evidence for EGFR downregulation in oral SCC cells through a novel anticancer effect of 15d-PGJ2 that is attributed to the reactive cyclopentenone ring system.
