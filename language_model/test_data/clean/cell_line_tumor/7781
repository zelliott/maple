The taxane diterpneoid 2-deacetoxytaxinine J (2-DAT-J) 1 has been isolated from the bark of Himalayan yew, Taxus baccata L. spp. wallichiana in a reasonably good yield (0.1%) and its anticancer activity against breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and normal human kidney epithelial cell line (HEK-293) has been studied. 2-DAT-J (1) showed significant in vitro activity against breast cancer cell line at a concentration of 20 microM and 10 microM in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 respectively. Few novel taxoids were derived (7, 8 and 10-13) from the naturally occurring 2-DAT-J (1) and screened for their anticancer activity. The structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the cinnamoyl group on C-5 and acetyl group on C-10 are essential for the anticancer activity. 2-DAT-J (1) was also tested for its in vivo activity on DMBA-induced mammary tumors in virgin female Sprague Dawley rats at a dose of 10mg/kg body weight orally for 30 days and showed significant regression in mammary tumors as compared to vehicle treated group ( p<0.05).
