The mouse histone H2AX has unique COOH-terminal serine residues that are phosphorylated in response to double-strand DNA breaks introduced by ionizing radiation. This suggests that H2AX acts to maintain genomic stability. We constructed a tetracycline (tet)-directed turn-off vector and integrated it into F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells by homologous recombination. In homozygously recombined cells, expression of the histone H2AX gene was repressed to 0.02% of the expression observed in wild-type cells by the addition of doxycycline, an analog of tet. Sensitivity of cells with repressed H2AX expression to X-irradiation was increased 1.95x, indicating that DNA repair was impaired by repression of H2AX. When we s.c. injected tet-regulated F9 cells into the flanks of mice, tumor growth was slightly suppressed by X-irradiation in H2AX-repressed tumors, whereas without X-irradiation, tumor growth did not differ by H2AX status. Thus, H2AX might be a potential molecular target for sensitizing cancer cells to radiotherapy to minimize required irradiation doses.
