Mucin 16 (cancer antigen 125) is a cell surface glycoprotein that plays a role in promoting cancer cell growth in ovarian cancer. The aims of this study were to examine mucin 16 expression in a large number of digestive tract adenocarcinomas and precursors and to determine whether mucin 16 up-regulation is correlated with patient outcome. Tissue microarrays were constructed using surgical resection tissues and included pancreatic (115 normal, 29 precursors, 200 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas), esophageal (86 normal, 104 precursors, 95 esophageal adenocarcinomas, 35 lymph node metastases), gastric (211 normal, 8 precursors, 119 gastric adenocarcinomas, 62 lymph node metastases), and colorectal (34 normal, 17 precursors, 39 colorectal adenocarcinomas) tissues. Mucin 16 was detected in 81.5%, 69.9%, 41.2%, and 64.1% of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, esophageal adenocarcinomas, gastric adenocarcinomas, and colorectal adenocarcinomas, respectively. Mucin 16 was seen in a subset of the precursors. On multivariate analysis, moderate/diffuse mucin 16 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas was strongly associated with poor survival (P < .001), independent of other prognosis predictors. A similar trend was observed for esophageal adenocarcinomas (P = .160) and gastric adenocarcinomas (P = .080). Focal mucin 16 in colorectal adenocarcinomas was significantly correlated (P = .044) with a better patient outcome, when compared with mucin 16-negative cases. Using Western blot analysis, we found mucin 16 expression in 3 of 6 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 1 of 2 esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines. We conclude that most of the digestive tract adenocarcinomas and a subset of their precursors express mucin 16. Mucin 16 expression is an independent predictor of poor outcome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and potentially in esophageal adenocarcinomas and gastric adenocarcinomas. We propose that mucin 16 may function as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in the future.
