Tumor multidrug-resistance (MDR) is a major factor in chemotherapeutic failure. In recent years, the development of anti-MDR has become an important focus in research. The mechanisms of MDR relate to P-glycoprotein, MRP1, apoptosis, the unusual DNA repair, the organic micro-environment, and so on. This review summarized the advances in MDR mechanism research. At the same time, it summarized the recent research of traditional Chinese medicine in reversing MDR. Furthermore, their mechanisms and major features of actions were also discussed.
