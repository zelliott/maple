A simple pyridinium-based tripodal chemosensor, 1, effectively recognizes AMP over ATP and ADP through indicator displacement assay (IDA) technique in water at pH 6.4. The good recognition of 1 is due to the better accommodation of AMP at the core of 1 as well as functional interaction involving hydrogen bonding and charge-charge interaction. The sensor 1 also recognizes intracellular AMP.
