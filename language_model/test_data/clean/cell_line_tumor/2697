Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is among the most aggressive malignancies known and is characterized with rapid growth, early invasion, and complete refractoriness to current therapies. Here we report that triptolide, a small molecule from a Chinese herb, could potently inhibit proliferation in vitro, angiogenesis in vivo, and invasion in a Matrigel model in human ATC cell line TA-K cells at nanomolar concentrations. We further elucidate that triptolide inhibits the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcriptional activity via blocking the association of p65 subunit with CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 in the early stage and via decreasing the protein level of p65 in the late stage. Expression of the NF-kappaB targeting genes cyclin D1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator is significantly reduced by triptolide in both TA-K and 8505C human ATC cell lines, which are well known to be critical for proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion in solid tumors. Our findings suggest that triptolide may function as a small molecule inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and invasion and may provide novel mechanistic insights into the potential therapy for human ATC.
