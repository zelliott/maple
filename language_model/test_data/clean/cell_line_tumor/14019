To evaluate the inhibitory effect of p53 gene on salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) cells.

Adenoviral vector pDeltaE1-p53 was constructed and transfected into SACC-83 cells. The enhanced p53 expression was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the effects of transfected p53 on SACC-83 cells were analyzed by TRAP-PCR-ELISA, luciferase reporter, flow cytometry (FCM), soft agar assay and tumorigenicity test.

The expression of p53 gene in SACC-83 cells was increased after introduction of pDeltaE1-p53. The telomerase activity and the transcriptional activity of hTERT promoter were inhibited. The cells cycles of transfected SACC-83 were arrested in G(1) phase and the rate of colony-formation was decreased, and similarly the tumorigenicity in nude mice was also decreased.

The introduction of wild-type p53 by adenoviral vector could suppress the telomerase activity and malignant phenotypes of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cells.
