Recent published reports on clinical trials of CPT-11 indicate the effectiveness of this compound, a prodrug of SN-38, against malignant glioma in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody. Here, we determined if NK012, and SN-38 incorporating micelle, can be an appropriate formulation for glioblastoma treatment compared with CPT-11. In vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated against several glioma lines with NK012, CPT-11, SN-38, ACNU, CDDP and etoposide. For the in vivo test, a human glioma line (U87MG) transfected with the luciferase gene was inoculated into nude mice brain for pharmacokinetic analysis by fluorescence microscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography after intravenous injection of NK012 and CPT-11. In vivo antitumor activity of NK012 and CPT-11 was evaluated by bioluminescence image and Kaplan-Meier analyses. The growth-inhibitory effects of NK012 were 34- to 444-fold more potent than those of CPT-11. Markedly enhanced and prolonged distribution of free SN-38 in the xenografts was observed after NK012 injection compared with CPT-11. NK012 showed significantly potent antitumor activity against an orthotopic glioblastoma multiforme xenograft and significantly longer survival rate than CPT-11 (p = 0.0014). This implies that NK012 can pass through the blood brain tumor barrier effectively. NK012, which combines enhanced distribution with prolonged sustained release, may be ideal for glioma treatment. Currently, a phase I study of NK012 is almost complete in Japan and the US. The present translational study warrants the clinical phase II study of NK012 in patients with malignant glioma.
