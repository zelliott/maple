The synthesis and biological activity of novel CD-ring modified analogues of 22-oxa-1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), lacking the D-ring and featuring a connection between C-12 and C-21 (cis-perhydrindane CE-ring analogues), is described. The synthesis of the CE-ring system follows Meyers' methodology for the preparation of enantiomerically pure hydrinden-2-ones. The analogues show a complete lack of binding affinity for the vitamin D receptor (pig nVDR) and of antiproliferative activity (MCF-7 cells), as compared to calcitriol.
