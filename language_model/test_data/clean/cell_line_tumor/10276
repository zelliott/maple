In our previous study, we found that several tumor cell lines displayed high receptor-specific binding affinity, one of which, the human pancreatic carcinoid BON cell line, demonstrates high affinity binding of the bombesin (BN) and somatostatin (SST) receptor-specific ligands. In the present study, BON cells, as a representative model, were further applied to evaluate various peptide analogs and cytotoxic receptor-targeted peptide conjugates. We observed quick ligand-receptor internalization in BON cells as well as high binding affinity. Furthermore, BON cells have high expression of multidrug resistance-associated genes (MDR1) and show camptothecin (CPT) resistance. Various receptor-specific cytotoxic conjugates were synthesized and evaluated in the BON cell model via in vitro and in vivo studies. We found that all the tested conjugates displayed potent antitumor ability in xenografts. Especially, the CPT conjugates, CPT-SST, and CPT-BN, are most likely to increase sensitivity to CPT-resistant BON cells. Our findings suggest that appropriately defined tumor cell lines may provide physiologically relevant cell-based evaluations of novel peptide analogs and receptor-targeted chemotherapeutics.
