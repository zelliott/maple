In order to get a clearer view on the active geometry of anti-invasive chalcones, we have prepared a number of isoxazoles and related substances as conformationally restrained mimics of 1,3-diarylpropenones, and also of (Z)-stilbenes. In vitro anti-invasive activity data for 3,5-isoxazoles and 4,5-isoxazoles, together with an in silico geometrical comparison, point towards an active conformation for chalcones more resembling their s-trans geometry than the s-cis counterpart.
