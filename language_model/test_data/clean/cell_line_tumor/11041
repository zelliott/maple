The influence of ripe dendrite cells (DC) on the proliferative activity of mononuclear leukocytes and the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes of syngenic mice was studied. As inducers of DC ripening, the combination of antigenic components incorporated into the vaccine "lmmunovac Bh-4", (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus), as well as K. pneumoniae LPS and TNF-alpha, were used. This study demonstrated that DC activated with these preparations enhanced the proliferative activity of mononuclear leukocytes, the activity of Bh-4 being higher than that of K. pneumoniae LPS. The increase of proliferative activity was accompanied by a rise in the cytotovicity of mouse lymphocytes with respect to the NK-sensitive tumor line YAC-1 or Ehrlich tumor cells. The incubation of the lymphocytes with ripe DC (with the use of the preparations under study as ripening inducers), loaded with tumor antigens, made it possible to obtain cytotoxic lymphocytes having high cytotoxic activity with respect, mainly, to those tumor lines from which lysates for the treatment of DC had been produced. The activation of DC with bacterial immunomodulators led to an increase in the antigen-presenting function of these cells, to their higher capacity for regulating the differentiation of mononuclear leukocytes and for activating the cytotoxicity of natural killers.
