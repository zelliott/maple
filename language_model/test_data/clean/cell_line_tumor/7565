The incidence of most solid tumors is remarkably reduced in individuals with Down syndrome. Using mouse models of Down syndrome, we have previously shown that this decrease in tumor incidence is due, in part, to suppression of tumor angiogenesis as a consequence of attenuated calcineurin signaling in endothelial cells. Our prior studies utilized xenografted tumors in a transgenic mouse model with three copies of the Down syndrome critical region-1 (Dscr1) gene, a chromosome 21-encoded endogenous calcineurin inhibitor. These data indicate that upregulated Dscr1 contributes to broad cancer protection by suppressing tumor angiogenesis through inhibiting the calcineurin pathway in the vascular endothelium. However, it still remains to be confirmed whether a single extra copy of Dscr1 is also sufficient to suppress tumor angiogenesis in slow growing spontaneous tumors that more accurately recapitulate molecular features of human malignancies. In this study, utilizing LSL-Kras(G12D) mice, an inducible and autochthonous model of human lung adenocarcinoma, on a Dscr1 transgenic mouse background, we show that a single extra transgenic copy of Dscr1 provides a survival advantage in these mice developing spontaneous lung tumors driven by oncogenic Kras(G12D) without affecting either initiation or progression of spontaneous lung tumors. Furthermore, we show that Dscr1 trisomy significantly reduces microvessel density in lung tumors and thus limits the growth of lung tumors through decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of lung tumor cells. These data provide evidence that a single extra copy of Dscr1 is sufficient to suppress tumor angiogenesis during spontaneous lung tumorigenesis and further support our hypothesis that suppression of tumor angiogenesis by an additional copy of Dscr1 contributes to the reduced cancer incidence in individuals with Down syndrome and the calcineurin pathway in the tumor vasculature is a potential target for cancer treatment.
