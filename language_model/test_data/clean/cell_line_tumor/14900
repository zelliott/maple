A straightforward access to pyrrolidine-based analogues of jaspine B was developed. Five stereoisomers were prepared including the all-cis derivatives presenting the configuration of the natural anhydrophytosphingosine. The synthesis of the latter relied on an original Staudinger-type cyclization process. The compounds were evaluated regarding their ability to alter tumor cells' viability and to interfere with the metabolism of sphingolipids.
