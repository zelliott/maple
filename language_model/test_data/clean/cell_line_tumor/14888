In dendritic cells (DCs), the induction of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by tumor-derived factors (TDFs) renders DCs tolerogenic and suppresses their antitumor activity. Therefore, silencing STAT3 in DCs is beneficial for cancer immunotherapy. We have shown that STAT3 knockdown in B16 murine melanoma by siRNA polyplexes of polyethylenimine (PEI) or its stearic acid derivative (PEI-StA) induces B16 cell death in vitro and in vivo. Here, we investigated the physical encapsulation of siRNA/PEI and PEI-StA polyplexes in poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) for STAT3 knockdown in DCs. PLGA NPs containing siRNA polyplexes of PEI (PLGA-P) and PEI-StA (PLGA-PS) had an average diameter of ~350 to 390 nm and a zeta potential of ∼-13 to -19 mV, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency (E.E.) of siRNA in PLGA-P and PLGA-PS was 26% and 43%, respectively. In both NP types, siRNA release followed a triphasic pattern, but it was faster in PLGA-PS. Our uptake study by fluorescence microscopy confirmed DC uptake and endosomal localization of both NP types. After exposure to B16.F10 conditioned medium, DCs showed high STAT3 and low CD86 expression indicating impaired function. STAT3 silencing by PLGA-P and PLGA-PS of STAT3 siRNA restored DC maturation and functionality as evidenced by the upregulation of CD86 expression, high secretion of TNF-α and significant allogenic T cell proliferation. Moreover, encapsulation in PLGA NPs significantly reduced PEI-associated toxicity on DCs. We propose this formulation as a strategy for targeted siRNA delivery to DCs. The potential of this approach is not limited to STAT3 downregulation in DCs but can be used to target the expression of other proteins as well. Moreover, it can be combined with other means for cancer immunotherapy like cancer vaccine strategies.
