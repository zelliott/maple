Many studies have highlighted the tumoricidal properties of some natural peptides known to have antimicrobial virtues. Also, the increasingly higher resistance to conventional antibiotics has become a global public health issue, and the need for new antibiotics has stimulated interest in finding and synthesizing new antimicrobial peptides, which may also be used as chemotherapeutic agents. Relying on the literature, the purpose of our in vitro research was to assess the tumoricidal potential of magainin II on a series of tumour cell lines, namely, MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma) and M14K (human mesothelioma). The experimental results of our study revealed that the cytotoxic effects of magainin II depend on its concentration. Its efficiency is significant at 120 μM concentrations, and, although it is much lower, it persists even at 60 μM concentrations. The effects were insignificant at 30 μM concentrations. In our experimental research, the tumoricidal effect of magainin II was not significantly dependent on the type of tumour cell line used.
