Triethylene tetramine (TETA) is a novel ligand for G-quadruplex and has been reported to have many kinds of biological activities, including telomerase inhibition, inducing the senescence of tumor cells, etc. In this study, tumor inhibiting activity of TETA and its mechanism were investigated in HeLa cells, MCF-7 cells and mice transplanted with S180 tumor. Results indicated that TETA inhibited telomerase activity involved in decreasing the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). We also observed that a low concentration of TETA had limited ability to inhibit the growth of tumor cells in short-term culture, but it could significantly enhance antitumor activity of traditional antitumor drugs in vitro and in vivo.
