Overexpression of CD44, especially its variant isoforms, occurs consistently in colon cancer, as compared to autologous normal colon, and this change occurs also in most other types of cancer. One of the basic features of malignant transformation is the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis. In this study, we asked whether the expression of CD44 and some of its variant isoforms commonly found in colon cancer participate in resistance to apoptosis and what are the mechanisms involved. A human colon cancer cell line, SW620, which does not express CD44 was stably transfected with standard, v3-10, and v8-10 containing isoforms of CD44. Mock-transfected and CD44-transfected cells were exposed to etoposide to induce apoptosis. Apoptotic and concomitant changes relevant to the mechanisms of apoptosis were monitored by flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation, and immunoblot analyses. It was observed that resistance to apoptosis induced by etoposide is promoted by CD44 expression in SW620, and this resistance is better sustained by the full variant isoform, v3-10. Concomitant alterations in caspase 9, caspase 3, Bcl-xl, and Bak indicated that the resistance to apoptosis in this model involved the mitochondrial pathway. The differential response of CD44 transfectants was associated with a downregulation of pRb and phosphorylated AKT. The results of this study are consistent with the conclusion that expression of variant CD44 isoforms which is characteristic of colon cancer, and most other types of cancer, confers a selective advantage to resist apoptosis, thereby promoting cell transformation into a malignant phenotype, in conjunction with other anti-apoptotic factors.
