Immunotoxins are promising targeted therapeutic agents comprising an antibody-based ligand that specifically binds to diseased cells, and a pro-apoptotic protein. Toxic components from bacteria or plants can trigger a neutralizing immune response, so that human effector molecules are more suitable. In this context, the protease granzyme B has been successfully tested in cytotoxicity assays against different cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our aim here was to introduce granzyme M as an alternative and novel component of human cytolytic fusion proteins. We fused it to the humanized single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) H22 which specifically binds to CD64, an FcÎ³RI receptor overexpressed on activated myeloid cells and leukemic cells. We show that the humanized cytolytic fusion protein Gm-H22(scFv) specifically targets the acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL60 in vitro and is cytotoxic with an IC50 between 1.2 and 6.4 nM. These findings were confirmed ex vivo using leukemic primary cells from patients, which were killed by granzyme M despite the presence of the granzyme B inhibitor serpin B9. In conclusion, granzyme M is a promising new cell-death inducing component for hCFPs because it specifically and efficiently kills target cells when fused to a targeting component.
