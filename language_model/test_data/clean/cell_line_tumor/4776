Because the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is a key factor in the metastatic process, compounds with the ability to inhibit MMP activity have a potential in the treatment of tumor. From the examination of 2000 plant extracts, obovatal isolated from the extract of the leaves of Magnolia obovata THUNB was a potent inhibitor of MMP-2 enzyme in vitro. In human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) activated with MMP-2, obovatal inhibited MMP-2 enzyme activity and expression. In addition, the compound blocked migration and invasion of the cells. This study demonstrates that obovatal exerts its anticancer effects through blocking migration and invasion by inhibition of MMP-2 expression and activity, and also will be a good lead molecule for the development of anti-tumor drug.
