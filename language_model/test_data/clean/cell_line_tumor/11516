The tumor protein p63/microRNA functional network appears to play a decisive role in chemoresistance of human epithelial cancers. The cisplatin- and phosphorylated-ΔNp63α-dependent microRNAs, whose expression was varied in sensitive and resistant squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCC, which were derived from larynx and tongue tumors), were shown to modulate the expression of multiple members of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy pathways. The specific microRNAs were further shown to modulate the resistant phenotype of SCC cells in vitro, thereby providing groundwork for novel chemotherapeutic venues for head and neck cancer.
