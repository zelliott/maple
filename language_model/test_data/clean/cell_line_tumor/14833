Human primary microRNA-155/B-cell integration cluster (BIC) transcript is the precursor of microRNA-155. The overexpression of them has been widely observed in the progression of various types of tumors. Our objective was to investigate the effect of anticancer agents on the expression of BIC and possible signal pathways that involved in.

Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expression of BIC. Chemical inhibitors against c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2, protein kinase C, checkpoint kinase 1, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) were used for the evaluation of involved signal pathways. RNA interference was used to knock down the expression of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated, ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related, and suppressor of morphogenesis in genitalia-1 (SMG-1), and Western blot was carried out to evaluate the knockdown effect.

B-cell integration cluster expression was induced by a representative anti-pancreatic cancer drug, gemcitabine, in human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells. The mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitors, but not the checkpoint kinase 1 and protein kinase C inhibitors, suppressed the up-regulation of BIC. B-cell integration cluster up-regulation was also significantly inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. RNA interference studies showed that wortmannin-sensitive SMG-1 but not ataxia-telangiectasia mutated or ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related was involved in the up-regulation.

Our results show that multiple pathways can be involved in the up-regulation of BIC. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that PI3K SMG-1 is required for gemcitabine-induced up-regulation of BIC transcript.
