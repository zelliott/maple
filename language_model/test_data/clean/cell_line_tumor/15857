Pralatrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor with high affinity for reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC-1) and folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), resulting in extensive internalization and accumulation in tumour cells. Pralatrexate is approved in the US for the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma and is being investigated in various malignancies. Here, we evaluated molecular correlates of sensitivity to pralatrexate and explored combinations with a variety of anticancer agents.

Antiproliferative effects of pralatrexate were evaluated in 15 human-cancer cell lines using the MTT assay. Gene expression was evaluated using qRT-PCR.

Pralatrexate and methotrexate had a similar pattern of cytotoxicity, pralatrexate being more potent. Pralatrexate potentiated the effects of platinum drugs, antimetabolites and EGFR inhibitors. Dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity of pralatrexate correlated with high mRNA expression of FPGS. Acquired resistance to pralatrexate was associated with decreased RFC-1 expression, whereas methotrexate resistance correlated with increased DHFR expression, suggesting different mechanisms of acquired resistance.

Pralatrexate was more potent than methotrexate in a panel of solid tumour lines. Our findings support the further clinical development of pralatrexate in combination with certain cytotoxics and targeted therapies, and suggest that RFC-1, FPGS and DHFR may be potential biomarkers of outcome.
