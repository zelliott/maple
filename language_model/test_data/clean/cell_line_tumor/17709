Metastases of various malignancies have been shown to be inversely related to the abundance of nm23 protein expression. However, the downstream pathways involved in nm23-mediated suppression of metastasis have not been elucidated. In the present investigation, we used cDNA microarrays to identify novel genes and functional pathways in nm23-mediated spontaneous breast metastasis. Microarray experiments were performed in a pair of cell lines, namely, C-100 (only vector transfected; highly metastatic) and H1-177 (nm23 transfected; low metastatic), derived from human mammary carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-435. The cDNA microarray analysis using GeneSpring software revealed significant as well as consistent alterations in the expression (up- and downregulation) of 2158 genes in a total of 18889 genes between high and low metastatic cells. Some of these genes were grouped into 6 functional categories, namely, invasion and metastasis, apoptosis and senescence, signal transduction molecules and transcription factors, cell cycle and repair, adhesion, and angiogenesis to extrapolate an association between these genes and different functional pathways involved in nm23-regulated metastasis. The results suggest that nm23 gene plays a major role in metastasis and its mechanism of action of metastasis suppression may involve downregulation of genes associated with cell adhesion, motility (integrins alpha2, -8, -9, -L and -V, collagen type VIII alpha1, fibronectin 1, catenin, TGF-beta2, FGF7, MMP14 and 16, ErbB2) and possibly certain tumor/metastasis suppressors (2 members of SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated proteins 2 and 5 and PTEN).
