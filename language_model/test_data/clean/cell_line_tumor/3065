The aim of this study was to find a possible clinical use of the tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa (TIP47) and further document its expression in smear cytology, different cervical dysplasias, invasive cervical cancer and metastasis.

A new polyclonal anti-TIP47 antibody was developed and used on smears and histological cervix sections of sixty women with different cytological pathologies. Serum TIP47 level of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or carcinoma in stage IIb, IIIa, and IIIb was monitored during treatment.

TIP47 was expressed weakly in the dysplasias, stronger in invasive tumors and in lymph node metastasis. In patients with cervical carcinoma, the serum TIP47 level was found to be elevated; it decreased after therapy and elevated again in relapse.

According to our results, TIP47 could be a good clinical marker for the early detection in blood of the recurrence of cervical carcinoma.
