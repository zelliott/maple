Organotin compounds used in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe production are of concern to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) because they leach from supply pipes into drinking water and are reported multisystem toxicants. Immune function was assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to the mixture of organotins used in PVC pipe production. Although several of these organotins are reported immunotoxicants, their immunotoxicity as a mixture when given by drinking water has not been evaluated. Adult male rats were given drinking water for 28 d containing a mixture of dibutyltin dichloride (DBTC), dimethyltin dichloride (DMTC), monobutyltin trichloride (MBT), and monomethyltin trichloride (MMT) in a 2:2:1:1 ratio, respectively, at 3 different concentrations (5:5:2.5:2.5, 10:10:5:5, or 20:20:10:10 mg organotin/L), MMT alone (20 or 40 mg MMT/L), or plain water as a control. Delayed-type hypersensitivity, antibody synthesis, and natural killer cell cytotoxicity were evaluated in separate endpoint groups (n = 8/dose; 24/endpoint) immediately after exposure ended. The evaluated immune functions were not affected by the mixture or by MMT alone. Our data suggest that immunotoxicity is unlikely to result from the concentration of organotins present in drinking water delivered via PVC pipes, as the concentrations used were several orders of magnitude higher than those expected to leach from PVC pipes.
