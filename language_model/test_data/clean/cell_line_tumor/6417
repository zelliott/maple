Nine linear C23 and C21 acetogenins, named cananginones A-I (1-9), were isolated from stem bark of Cananga latifolia. Their structures were established by spectroscopic methods. These compounds showed cytotoxicity against three cancer cell lines (KB, MCF7 and NCI-H187) with IC₅₀ values in the range 16.6-129.7 μM. Only 5 showed weak antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum. In addition, 8 and 9 exhibited weak antifungal activity against Candida albicans.
