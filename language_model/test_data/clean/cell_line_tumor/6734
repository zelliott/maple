Resveratrol is a phytoalexin able to display an array of biological activities. We decided to replace the double bond with a triazole ring using the archetypical click reaction: the Huisgen [3 + 2] cycloaddition. Seventy-two triazole derivatives were synthesized via a parallel combinatorial approach. Preliminary data suggest that this procedure can lead to the synthesis of compounds that display some, but not all, of resveratrol's actions with increased potency.
