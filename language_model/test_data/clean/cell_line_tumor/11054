To study the effect of Parthenolide on the activity and expression of urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) on PGCL3 cells and to investigate the antitumor mechanisms of Parthenolide.

MTT assay was used to determine the growth inhibition by Parthenolide in PGCL3 cells; Effect of Parthenolide on the activity of uPA secreted by PGCL3 cells was measured by chromogenic substrate assay;The expression level of uPA protein was assessed by Western blot analysis.

Parthenolide could inhibit proliferation of PGCL3 cells after 24h treatment, the IC50 value was 17.60 micromol/L; Parthenolide reduced significantly the activity of uPA secreted by PGCL3 cells and down-regulated the expression level of uPA protein.

The antitumor activity of Parthenolide is involved in the activity and expression of urokinase type plasminogen activator.
