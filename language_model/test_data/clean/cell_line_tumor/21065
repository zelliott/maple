Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most frequent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) has recently been shown to be effective against leukemias, so we studied whether As(2)O(3) induces apoptosis of CTCL cells in vitro. We further investigated if As(2)O(3) is effective in a MF mouse model.

Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin-D stainings were carried out to investigate if As(2)O(3) induced apoptosis of CTCL cell lines. To study the underlying mechanisms, the effects of As(2)O(3) on various transcription factors and apoptosis regulating proteins were analyzed by western blots, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transcription factor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The ability of As(2)O(3) to induce tumor regression was investigated in a MF mouse model.

As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis was paralleled by a reduction of the DNA-binding activities of transcription factors of the NFkB and signal transducer and activator of transcription gene families and reduced expression of the antiapoptotic proteins bcl-1, bcl-xL and mcl-1. Local injections of 200 muM As(2)O(3) into tumors caused complete remissions in five of six mice and one partial remission.

As(2)O(3) induced apoptosis of CTCL cells by the down-regulation of transcription factors that stimulate the expression of antiapoptotic genes. Local injection of As(2)O(3) into MF tumor-bearing mice resulted in tumor regression.
