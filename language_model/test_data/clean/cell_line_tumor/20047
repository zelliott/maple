Osthole, a natural compound, may be extracted from Cnidium monnieri and             other medicinal plants. Previous studies have shown that osthole has anticancer             effects in various human cancer cell lines. There is, however, no available information             concerning the effects of osthole on the migration and invasion of human lung             cancer cells. In the current study, we used Transwell assays to demonstrate that             osthole inhibited the migration and invasion of A549 human lung cancer cells.             Western blot analysis revealed that osthole reduced the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2             (MMP-2) and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) in the A549 human lung cancer cells.             Our ﬁndings indicate that osthole may have a novel function as an inhibitor of             the metastasis of human lung cancer.
