We demonstrate that decursin induces apoptosis via regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and survivin in leukemic KBM-5 cells. By activating an apoptotic machinery, decursin is cytotoxic to KBM-5 cells. In this apoptotic process, decursin can activate caspase family members and triggers PARP cleavage. At the same time, the expression of COX-2 and survivin in the cells is downregulated. Furthermore, decursin is in synergy with COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib or NS398 for the induction of apoptosis. Overall, these results suggest that decursin, via inhibiting COX-2 and survivin, sensitizes human leukemia cells to apoptosis and is a potential chemotherapeutic agent to treat this disease.
