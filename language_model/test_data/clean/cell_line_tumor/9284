Prostate cancer is the most invasive and frequently occurred cancer in men. In the initial stages, it is androgen dependent and the androgen ablation therapy is effective at this stage. In the final stages, it becomes androgen-independent and is unresponsive to androgen ablation therapy. At this stage, induction of apoptosis is considered as a better strategy to control cancer. Histone acetylation and deacetylation are involved in transcriptional activation and transcriptional repression, respectively. Diallyl disulfide (DADS) induced histone hyperacetylation can be correlated with the expression of antiproliferative genes. Induction of apoptosis by DADS has been correlated with histone acetylation. In the present study, DADS, oil soluble organosulfur compound of garlic, has been studied for its effect on histone acetylation and induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells in vitro. The induction of apoptosis has been demonstrated by annexin V-FITC binding assay. Extent of apoptosis has been assessed measuring the activity of caspase-3. The results have shown that DADS induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells in a dose dependent manner. At both 25 and 40 microM concentrations, DADS increased the number of both early and late apoptotic cells. Histone hyperacetylation was also observed in DADS treated cells. It is concluded that DADS, induces apoptosis by influencing histone acetylation in prostate cancer cells.
