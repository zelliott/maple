With the combined goal of finding the best anti-parasitic and anti-cancer activities as well as isolating the bioactive agents and studying their structures and biological properties, we proceeded to perform a small-scale cultivation of Aspergillus sp. strain F1544 using Potato Dextrose, Malt Extract, Czapek Dox and Eight Vegetables media. From the more promising extracts (obtaining using potato dextrose and czapek dox media in large scale) of this fungus, we isolated the five compounds: pseurotin A (1), 14-norpseurotin A (2), FD-838 (3), and pseurotin D (4), and fumoquinone B (5). All compounds showed good antileishmanial and moderate anticancer activities.
