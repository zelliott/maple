Numerous immunotherapy treatments for cancer are undergoing clinical trials or are already approved for use. One particular area of interest is targeting mechanisms of immune tolerance. Using a murine model of mesothelioma, we investigated the roles of regulatory T-cells, intratumoural transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and the negative regulator molecule cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) in immune tolerance to tumours. It was found that treatments targeting a single negative regulator molecule mechanism were not as effective against tumours as targeting multiple mechanisms simultaneously. Most importantly, it was found that a combined triple treatment of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-CTLA-4 mAb and TGF-β soluble receptor resulted in long-term clearance of tumours and memory against tumour rechallenge. These data suggest that clinical application of immunotherapies against tumours may be improved by simultaneously targeting multiple mechanisms of immune suppression.
