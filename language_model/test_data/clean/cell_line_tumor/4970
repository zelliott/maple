M1 myeloid leukemic cells were used to dissect the molecular mechanisms of myeloid cell survival and apoptosis. A salient feature of M1 cells is that they respond to the physiological survival factor interleukin-6 (IL-6), yet lack the tumor suppressor gene p53. Functional wild-type activation of temperature-sensitive p53 protein (p53 val) at permissive temperature in M1-t-p53 cells results in rapid apoptosis, which is blocked by IL-6. How p53 induces M1 apoptosis and how IL-6 protects against p53-induced apoptosis are not fully understood. Here it is shown that p53-mediated apoptosis of M1 cells involves rapid activation of the proapoptotic Fas/CD95 death pathway, which activates caspases 8 and 10. Functional p53 also targets the mitochondria, causing upregulation of proapoptotic Bax, downregulation of prosurvival Bcl-2 and activation of caspase 9. IL-6 was found to protect against p53-induced apoptosis via activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, which in turn counters both the Fas/CD95 and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways and activates the prosurvival transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Taken together, this work supports a novel model for leukemic progression where cells that acquire the ability to produce an autocrine survival factor, such as IL-6, can bypass normal p53 surveillance function by targeting Akt, which in turn can exert effects on the regulators of apoptosis, such as the Fas/CD95 pathway, the mitochondria and NF-kappaB.
