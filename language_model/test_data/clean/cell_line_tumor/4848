We analysed the biologic properties of a small cell lung carcinoma cell line (designated KK0206) established from a patient with SCLC who had cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR). Morphological and immunohistochemical studies showed that KK0206 cells have features of the classic type of SCLC. KK0206 cells grew in suspension, forming relatively small clumps of cells with a doubling time of 72 h. On light microscopy, the cells were relatively small with little cytoplasm. On immunohistochemistry using anti-bovine recoverin rabbit antibody, the cells were intensely positive for recoverin. In addition, they were positive for NSE, Ki-67, and TP53. They also expressed human recoverin, a photoreceptor protein, whose presence was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis with cDNA sequencing and Western blot analysis. The point mutation of their TP53 gene (exon 156) was detected as well. The present study demonstrates that human recoverin is expressed in SCLC cells cultured from an anti-recoverin antibody-negative patient with CAR. KK0206 might be important for further research on SCLC related retinopathy.
