This paper describes modifications to a hyperspectral imaging microscope that extend its capabilities into the near-infrared (950-1300 nm). The major changes include installing a grating, charge-coupled device camera, and lenses and filters appropriate for infrared wavelengths. Calibration of the system and validation with lead sulfide quantum dots of known emission wavelength is reported. Cells from the breast carcinoma cell line SkBr3 were scanned with lead sulfide quantum dots that emit at 1100 nm as the background and an image which contains the integrated spectral data is presented. We also demonstrate that this instrument is capable of detecting the photoluminescence spectra of single-walled carbon nanotubes dispersed in aqueous solution.
