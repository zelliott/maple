To determine the signaling pathways leading from Met activation to metastasis and poor prognosis, we measured the kinetic gene alterations in breast cancer cell lines in response to HGF/SF. Using a network inference tool we analyzed the putative protein-protein interaction pathways leading from Met to these genes and studied their specificity to Met and prognostic potential. We identified a Met kinetic signature consisting of 131 genes. The signature correlates with Met activation and with response to anti-Met therapy ( p<0.005) in in-vitro models. It also identifies breast cancer patients who are at high risk to develop an aggressive disease in six large published breast cancer patient cohorts ( p<0.01, N>1000). Moreover, we have identified novel putative Met pathways, which correlate with Met activity and patient prognosis. This signature may facilitate personalized therapy by identifying patients who will respond to anti-Met therapy. Moreover, this novel approach may be applied for other tyrosine kinases and other malignancies.
