Here, we report the design of new analogues of spirooxoindolepyrrolidine nucleus as modulators of p53 activity. Compounds (3R,7aR)-6-(4-chlorobenzyl)-1H-spiro[imidazo[1,5-c]thiazole-3,3'-indoline]-2',5,7(6H,7aH)-trione (9c) and (3R,7aR)-5'-methyl-6-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-1H-spiro[imidazo[1,5-c]thiazole-3,3'-indoline]-2',5,7(6H,7aH)-trione (10d) are the most potent compounds of this series, inhibiting cell growth of different human tumor cells at submicromolar and micromolar concentrations, respectively. Compound 9c induces apoptotic cell death in human melanoma cell line M14 at 24 h, while in the same condition, treatment with 10d showes a clear arrest at G2/M phase inducing delay of cell cycle progression. Possibly, these activities may be due to inhibition of p53-MDM2 interaction and subsequent p53 release and activation.
