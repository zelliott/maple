Neuroblastoma (NBL), derived from the sympathetic precursor cells, is one of the most common pediatric solid tumors. The expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V and IX (GnT-V and GnT-IX) mRNA in 126 primary NBLs were quantitatively analyzed and higher expression levels of GnT-V were found to be associated with favorable stages (1, 2 and 4s). Conversely, the downregulation of GnT-V expression by small interfering RNA resulted in a decrease in the susceptibility to cell apoptosis induced by retinoic acid in NBL cells accompanied by morphological change. These results suggest that GnT-V is associated with prognosis by modulating the sensitivity of NBLs to apoptosis.
