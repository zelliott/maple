Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors and the leading             cause of mortality among women. In this study, we propose a human stem cell transplantation             strategy, an important method for treating various cancers, as a potential breast             cancer therapy. To this end, we used human amniotic membrane-derived epithelial             stem cells (hAECs) as a cell source for performing human stem cell transplantation.             hAECs have multipotent differentiation abilities and possess high proliferative             potential. We transplanted hAECs into female BALB/c nude mice bearing tumors originating             from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Co-culturred hAECs and MDA-MB-231 cells at             a ratio of 1:4 or 1:8 (tumor cells to stem cells) inhibited breast cancer cell             growth by 67.29 and 67.33%, respectively. In the xenograft mouse model, tumor             volumes were significantly decreased by 5-flurouracil (5-FU) treatment and two             different ratios of hAECs (1:4 and 1:8) by 84.33, 73.88 and 56.89%, respectively.             Treatment of nude mice with hAECs (1:4) produced remarkable antitumor effects             without any side-effects (e.g., weight loss, death and bruising) compared to the             mice that received only 5-FU treatment. Tumor progression was significantly reduced             by hAEC treatment compared to the xenograft model. On the other hand, breast tissues             (e.g., the epidermis, dermis and reticular layer) appeared to be well-maintained             following treatment with hAECs. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence             that hAECs can be used as a safe and effective cancer-targeting cytotherapy for             treating breast cancer.
