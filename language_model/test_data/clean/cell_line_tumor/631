Dasatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that has recently been shown to inhibit Src family kinases (SFK) and also has activity against CaP. Of importance to metastatic CaP, which frequently metastasises to bone, SFK are also vital to the regulation of bone remodelling. We sought to determine the ability of dasatinib to inhibit growth of CaP in bone.

C4-2B CaP cells were injected into tibiae of SCID mice and treated with dasatinib, alone or in combination with docetaxel. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels, bone mineral density, radiographs and histology were analysed.

Treatment with dasatinib alone significantly lowered sacrifice serum prostate-specific antigen levels compared to control, 2.3+/-0.4 vs 9.2+/-2.1 (P=0.004). Combination therapy improved efficacy over dasatinib alone (P=0.010). Dasatinib increased bone mineral density in tumoured tibiae by 25% over control tumoured tibiae ( p<0.001).

Dasatinib inhibits growth of C4-2B cells in bone with improved efficacy when combined with docetaxel. Additionally, dasatinib inhibits osteolysis associated with CaP. These data support further study of dasatinib in clinical trials for men with CaP bone metastases.
