Chlorosulfonation of 3-methyl[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrimidine with chlorosulfonic acid in the presence of thionyl chloride was studied. When triazolo[4,3-a]pyrimidines are used as substrates, the substitution occurs at C-6. Also the reactivity of the hydrazides (7) towards aldehydes, thioglycolic acid and amines were studies. The newly prepared compounds 10a,d and 11a,d demonstrated inhibitory effects on the growth of a wide range of cancer cell lines generally at 10(-5)M level and in some cases at 10(-7)M concentrations.
