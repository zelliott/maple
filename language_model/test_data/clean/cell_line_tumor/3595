Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a member of the secretin/glucagon/vasoactive intestinal peptide family, induces the expression of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes in adrenal medullary cells. In addition, PACAP and its receptor have been detected in human neuroblastoma tissues and cell lines, though it is not yet known whether PACAP enhances the expression of genes encoding catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes. To address this question, we analyzed PACAP, PACAP receptor and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNAs in neuroblastomas.

The levels of mRNA for PACAP and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), as well as their receptors and the mRNA for TH were measured by RT-PCR or real-time PCR analysis.

VPAC1R mRNA was detected in all of 16 tissues and 3 cell lines that were examined, while VPAC2R mRNA was detected in 5 of 16 (31%) tissue and 2 of 3 cell lines. PAC1R mRNA was detected in 6 out of 16 (38%) tissues and none of 3 cell lines. mRNA expression of PACAP and TH were detected in many tissues (10/16 and 16/16, respectively). However, neither in tissues nor cell lines did PACAP mRNA expression correlate with TH mRNA expression.

Our findings suggest that PACAP is not involved in the regulation of expression of TH in neuroblastomas.
