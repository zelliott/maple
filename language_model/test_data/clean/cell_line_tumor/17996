Three cationic cholesterol derivatives (CCDs), which differ in their types of amine and bear a hydroxyethyl group at the amine group, were synthesized and formulated into liposomes and nanoparticles as gene delivery vectors. In vitro transfection into A549 cells proved that liposomes formulated with CCDs and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) of 1/2 molar ratio were more effective than the corresponding nanoparticles with CCDs and Tween 80 at charge ratios (+/-) of 1/2, 3/1 and 5/1. Among the liposomal formulations, non-hydroxyethylated CCDs were more effective than hydroxyethylated ones in vitro. However, gene transfection in the lung through intratracheal injection showed opposite results to those in vitro, with liposomes containing hydroxyethylated CCDs being more potent than those containing non-hydroxyethylated CCDs. Transfection by liposomes with N,N-methyl hydroxyethyl aminopropane carbamoyl cholesterol iodide (MHAPC) showed the highest luciferase activity, resulting in 2- and 60-fold higher gene expression than jet-PEI and naked DNA, respectively. The distribution of MHAPC lipoplex after intratracheal injection was heterogeneous, and luciferase was expressed in epithelial cells lining the bronchi and bronchioles. All the lipoplexes led to higher TNF-alpha levels in the lung compared to the nanoplex and jet-PEI, but our findings suggested that modification of the cationic cholesterol with a hydroxyethyl group at the tertiary amine terminal, MHAPC, promoted gene expression in the lung without increasing the toxicity compared with other CCDs. This work firstly proved that liposomes containing hydroxyethylated CCDs could promote gene expression in the lung through intratracheal injection.
