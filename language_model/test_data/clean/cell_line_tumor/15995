The design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of hybrids and analogues of the microtubule-stabilizing anticancer agents dictyostatin, discodermolide, and taxol is described. A 22-membered macrolide scaffold was prepared by adapting earlier synthetic routes directed towards dictyostatin and discodermolide, taking advantage of the distinctive structural and stereochemical similarities between these two polyketide-derived marine natural products. Initial endeavors towards accessing novel discodermolide/dictyostatin hybrids led to the adoption of a late-stage diversification strategy and the construction of a small library of methyl-ether derivatives, along with the first triple hybrids bearing the side-chain of taxol or taxotere attached through an ester linkage. Biological assays of the anti-proliferative activity of these compounds in a series of human cancer cell lines, including the taxol-resistant NCI/ADR-Res cell line, allowed the proposal of various structure-activity relationships. This led to the identification of a potent macrocyclic discodermolide/dictyostatin hybrid 12 and its C9 methoxy derivative 38, accessible by an efficient total synthesis and with a similar biological profile to dictyostatin.
