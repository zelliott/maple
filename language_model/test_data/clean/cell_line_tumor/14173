The cytotoxic effects of seven constituents isolated from Duguetia glabriuscula were evaluated against Hep2 human larynx carcinoma cells. The cytotoxicity exhibited by beta-sitosterol was as strong as that of cis-platin. (+)-Alloaromadendran-10,14beta-diol caused inhibition of cellular growth with IC50 values lower than 25 microg/ml, a feature that was considered as revealing significant activity. Polycarpol showed borderline cytotoxicity, whereas the other compounds were inactive.
