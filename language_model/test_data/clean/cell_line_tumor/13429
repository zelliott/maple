The persistent xenobiotic agent 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) induces neurotoxic effects that alters neurodevelopment and behavior both during development and adulthood. There are many ongoing efforts to determine the molecular mechanisms of TCDD-mediated neurotoxicity, the signaling pathways involved and its molecular targets in neurons. In this work, we have used SHSY5Y human neuroblastoma cells to characterize the TCDD-induced toxicity. TCDD produces a loss of viability linked to an increased caspase-3 activity, PARP-1 fragmentation, DNA laddering, nuclear fragmentation and hypodiploid (apoptotic) DNA content, in a similar way than staurosporine, a prototypical molecule of apoptosis induction. In addition, TCDD produces a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase of intracellular calcium concentration (P < 0.05). Finally, based on the high lipophilic properties of the dioxin, we test the TCDD effect on the membrane integrity using sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles as a model. TCDD produces calcium efflux through the membrane and an anisotropy decrease (P < 0.05) that reflects an increase in membrane fluidity. Altogether these results support the hypothesis that TCDD toxicity in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells provokes the disruption of calcium homeostasis, probably affecting membrane structural integrity, leading to an apoptotic process.
