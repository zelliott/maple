Antitumor activity of molecules and cells of the innate immune system has been reported. Here we propose a method for targeting preferred innate immune cells and magnifying their tumoricidal effect at the tumor microenvironment, by modular multiple-component complexes (termed TILTAN). As a model, micro-scale complexes were assembled carrying monoclonal anti-HER2 antibodies, lipopolysaccharide and/or mannose. The complexes showed high binding capacity to HER2-positive cancer cells in vitro, high induction of interleukin-1 RNA transcription by the activated monocytes and ability to mediate monocytes' attachment to HER2-positive cells. TILTAN treatment was found safe in in vivo testing and induced change in interleukin-1 RNA transcription in tumors xenografts. We thus present a new vision of targeting a desired innate immune response to the tumor microenvironment.
