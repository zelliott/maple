Sphingosine kinases (SK) catalyse the formation of sphingosine 1-phosphate, which is a key lipid mediator regulating cell responses such as proliferation, survival and migration. Here we have investigated the effect of targeted inhibition of SK-1 on cell damage and elucidated the mechanisms involved.

Three human carcinoma cell lines (colon HCT-116, breast MDA-MB-231, lung NCI-H358) were used, which were either transduced with shRNA constructs to deplete SK-1, or treated with a SK-1 inhibitor. Cell growth and viability were assayed by [(3) H]thymidine incorporation and colony formation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by fluorescence and apoptosis by annexin V with flow cytometry. Proteins were analysed by Western blotting. DNA damage was induced by doxorubicin.

Knock-down of SK-1 by shRNA strongly inhibited DNA synthesis and colony formation of carcinoma cells. SK-1 knock-down (SK-1kd) cells revealed dysfunctional extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and PKB/Akt cascades, and contained increased levels of ROS. After SK-1kd, treatment with doxorubicin increased DNA damage, measured by histone-2AX phosphorylation. Similar effects were found in cells with a SK-1 inhibitor and doxorubicin. The increased damage response in SK-1kd cells was accompanied by greater reduction of DNA synthesis and colony formation, and by more pronounced apoptosis. Addition of a NADPH oxidase inhibitor reduced the increased apoptosis in doxorubicin-treated SK-1kd cells.

SK-1kd in carcinoma cells triggered oxidative stress by increasing intracellular Ros production. Targeted inhibition of SK-1 represents a promising approach to sensitize cells to DNA damage and facilitate apoptosis upon doxorubicin treatment.
