The virological characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) implicated in the reactivation of occult hepatitis B in patients who have received hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or chemotherapy for the hematological malignancy are not well defined. Twenty-eight HBsAg-negative patients who received hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and 138 HBsAg-negative patients treated for malignant lymphoma with chemotherapy including rituximab were enrolled. Three of the 28 patients (10.7%) received hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and one of the 138 (0.72%) patients treated for malignant lymphoma with chemotherapy developed de novo HBV hepatitis. Anti-HBc was detected in four and anti-HBs in two patients. Genotype Bj was detected in two and C in two of they all possessed wild-type sequences in the core promoter region. A precore stop mutation (A1896) was detected in a patient with genotype Bj who developed fulminant hepatic failure. HBV DNA was detected in pretreatment HBsAg-negative samples in two of four patients, and the HBV genome sequence identified from sera before chemotherapy and at the time of de novo HBV hepatitis showed 100% homology. In an in vitro replication model, genotype Bj with the A1896 clone obtained from a fulminant case had a replication level much higher than clones obtained from de novo hepatitis B patients with genotype Bj or C with G1896. In conclusion, this is the first report demonstrating de novo hepatitis B from the reactivation of occult HBV infection confirmed by molecular evolutional analysis. The fulminant outcome of HBV reactivation can be associated with genotype Bj exhibiting high replication due to the A1896 mutation.
