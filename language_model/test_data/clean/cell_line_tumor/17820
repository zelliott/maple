Prostate cancer PC3 cells expressed constitutive protein kinase C (PKC) activity that under basal conditions suppressed neurotensin (NT) receptor function. The endogenous PKC activity, assessed using a cell-based PKC substrate phosphorylation assay, was diminished by PKC inhibitors and enhanced by phorbol myristic acid (PMA). Accordingly, PKC inhibitors (staurosporine, Go-6976, Go-6983, Ro-318220, BIS-1, chelerythrine, rottlerin, quercetin) enhanced NT receptor binding and NT-induced inositol phosphate (IP) formation. In contrast, PMA inhibited these functions. The cells expressed conventional PKCs (alpha, betaI) and novel PKCs (delta, epsilon), and the effects of PKC inhibitors on NT binding were blocked by PKC downregulation. The inhibition of NT binding by PMA was enhanced by okadaic acid and blocked by PKC inhibitors. However, when some PKC inhibitors (rottlerin, BIS-1, Ro-318220, Go-69830, quercetin) were used at higher concentrations (>2 microM), they had a different effect characterized by a dramatic increase in NT binding and an inhibition of NT-induced IP formation. The specificity of the agents implicated novel PKCs in this response and indeed, the inhibition of NT-induced IP formation was reproduced by PKCdelta or PKCepsilon knockdown. The inhibition of IP formation appeared to be specific to NT since it was not observed in response to bombesin. Scatchard analyses indicated that the PKC-directed agents modulated NT receptor affinity, not receptor number or receptor internalization. These findings suggest that PKC participates in heterologous regulation of NT receptor function by two mechanisms: a)-- conventional PKCs inhibit NT receptor binding and signaling; and b)-- novel PKCs maintain the ability of NT to stimulate PLC. Since NT can activate PKC upon binding to its receptor, it is possible that NT receptor is also subject to homologous regulation by PKC.
