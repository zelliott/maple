Fifteen dihydroartemisinin derivatives containing a substituted chalcone linked by either ether or ester were synthesized and investigated for their cytotoxicity in human leukemia HL-60 and mouse lymphoma P388 cells. These derivatives have greater antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in both cell lines than dihydroartemisinin. Dihydroartemisinin chalcones linked by ether are more cytotoxic than dihydroartemisinin chalcones linked by ester with apoptosis induction abilities.
