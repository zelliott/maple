Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) may cause oxidative DNA damage, resulting in the formation of adducts such as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) and the cyclic pyrimidopurinone N-1, N(2) malondialdehyde-2'-deoxyguanosine (M(1)dG). These adducts have been associated with carcinogenesis, genomic instability and clonal evolution. We tested two hypotheses in human prostate cancer cells grown in vitro and in a xenograft model: (1) treatment of androgen-sensitive cells with DHT increases levels of oxidative DNA adduct levels; (2) flutamide, a competitive androgen receptor antagonist, prevents DHT-induced changes. Levels of M(1)dG and 8-oxo-dG adducts were determined by immunoslot blot and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. M(1)dG and 8-oxo-dG levels were significantly higher than control levels in LNCaP cells exposed to supra-physiological concentrations (25-100 nM) of DHT (both  p<0.05 by ANOVA). Flutamide pre-treatment completely prevented this increase. In the xenograft model, tumour levels of M(1)dG were decreased by 46% (P=0.001 by Mann-Whitney Test) in flutamide-treated animals compared to controls. The changes demonstrated suggest that oxidative DNA adducts may serve as biomarkers of the efficacy of androgen manipulation in chemoprevention trials.
