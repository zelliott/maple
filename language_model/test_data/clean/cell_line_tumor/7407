Some polypeptides have targeting selective anti-tumor effects act on cell membrane, but studies on this field were restricted by lack of peptide information. This study was to establish a tumor cell membrane model, and isolate specific anti-tumor peptides.

Pore-forming peptides Mast21 and MastoparanX were chosen as positive control peptides to optimize the artificially synthesized tumor liposome cell membrane model, ribosome display system was used to isolate specific anti-tumor peptides from a designed random DNA library with affinity to membrane model. Anti-tumor effects of the isolated peptides on non-small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 were analyzed with MTT assay.

After 6-round successive selection with improved membrane model (PE/PS, 3:7) and ribosome display system, some sequences of peptides were obtained. In vitro experiment confirmed that some of them showed anti-tumor effects on NCI-H460 cells, 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of peptides SeqA3, and SeqB3 of NCI-H460 cells were (22.5+/-1.2) micromol/L,and (11.3+/-0.7) micromol/L, while on normal human fibro cell line CCD-27SK were more than 100 micromol/L.

Specific anti-tumor peptides may be screened out by suitable tumor cell membrane model and ribosome display system, which will help to develop new anti-tumor drugs.
