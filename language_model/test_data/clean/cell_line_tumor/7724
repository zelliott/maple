Since cancer is a cellular disease, it is essential to identify the development stages and use the information in the prediction, prevention, early detection and design of drug targets. Colon cancer represents a malignancy with high incidence and mortality throughout the world, its etiology involving many genetic, immunological and biochemical factors. 5-fluorouracyl (5-FU) is one of the most effective anti-cancer agents used in the treatment of colorectal cancers, but tumor chemoresistance is a major limiting factor of its use. In order to choose the most effective chemotherapeutic doses of 5-FU, and thereby diminish the side-effects, we tried to modulate the anticancer properties of 5-FU by adding dietary natural compounds. The study focused on the role of natural compounds as resveratrol (RSV) in sensitization of LoVo human colon adenocarcinoma cell line to 5-FU action. Real-time cell analysis (RTCA) by xCELLigence System was used to continuously monitor the cytotoxic effects of drug treatments on LoVo cells. RTCA allowed us to choose the proper concentrations for further end-point assays, such as flow-cytometry techniques used for the evaluation of apoptotic events, progression through cell cycle phases or nuclear antigen expression of compound-treated LoVo cells. Data obtained showed additional effects of RSV to 5-FU treatments on the increase ofapoptotic events, and suggested alternative approaches to obtain a stronger antitumor response, and diminished side-effects when low concentrations of anti-cancer drugs are used. Modulation of the mechanisms of programmed cell death process seem to be of great importance for malignant transformation, and therefore for anti-cancer therapeutic approaches.
