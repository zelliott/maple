Particulate drug formulations are considered to be a means that may improve the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of active compounds. By using them, drug distribution is determined solely by the properties of the carrier. The surface properties of such supramolecular aggregates determine how they will interact with various biological structures. Among others, surface electrostatic charge and surface grafted polymers are considered to be among the major factors affecting its interaction with proteins and cells. In this article, we present experimental evidence that properly selected surface electrostatic charge and grafted polymers can alter the association of liposomes with colon cancer cells. The dependence of the adsorption of liposomes onto the cell surface on the quantity and length of surface grafted polymers for a certain surface charge density exhibits a distinct maximum. For example, when liposomes were formed with 20 mol% of DOTAP, PE-PEG350 increased liposome adsorption by up to 6 mol%. This adsorption maximum depends on both polymer length and charge type. Results presented in this article show that the interaction of liposomes with colon cancer cells can be tuned by a proper combination of liposome surface electrostatics and surface grafted polymers.
