Activation of the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor on neurons regulates the activity of neurons. Inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation induced by alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor activation is altered following exposure of the neuron SH-SY5Y cell line to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). Acute (5 and 15 min) exposure to TNF induces a transformation in alpha(2)-adrenergic regulation of cAMP accumulation from inhibition to facilitation. These findings support an autocrine role for the regulation of TNF production from neurons.
