Cathepsin V (L2), a lysosomal cysteine protease, is a member of cathepsin family, relating to cancer invasion and metastasis. Cathepsin V contains two predicted N-glycosylation sites, but it has not been reported whether cathepsin V is glycosylated or not. In this study, we clarified the role of N-glycosylation of cathepsin V for its functions. We demonstrated that cathepsin V is N-glycosylated at both Asn(221) and Asn(292) using mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis. N-glycosylation of cathepsin V was important for transportation to lysosome, secretion, and activity in HT1080 cells. These data demonstrated that functions of cathepsin V are controlled by N-glycosylation.
