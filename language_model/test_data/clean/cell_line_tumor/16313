GnRH-II enhances ovarian cancer cell invasion in an autocrine manner. We have now found that GnRH-II increases 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor (LRP) production in GnRH receptor (GnRHR)-positive OVCAR-3 and CaOV-3 ovarian cancer cells, while small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of GnRH-II or GnRHR mRNA abrogates this. The invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells is also reduced >85% by siRNA-mediated knockdown of LRP levels and >50% by pretreatment of Matrigel with a synthetic peptide that blocks interactions between laminin and the 67-kDa nonintegrin laminin receptor which comprises two LRP subunits. Conversely, overexpressing LRP in CaOV-3 cells increases their invasiveness 5-fold, while overexpressing LRP with a nonfunctional laminin-binding site does not. Depletion of LRP by siRNA treatment reduces CaOV-3 cell attachment to laminin-coated plates by ∼80% but only reduces their binding to Matrigel by ∼20%. Thus, while LRP influences CaOV-3 cell adhesion to laminin, LRP must act in other ways to enhance invasion. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are key mediators of invasion, and LRP siRNA treatment of OVCAR-3 and CaOV-3 cells inhibits MMP-2 but not MMP-9 mRNA levels. Overexpressing LRP in these cells increases MMP-2 production specifically, while a laminin-binding deficient LRP does not. Importantly, LRP siRNA treatment abolishes GnRH-II-induced MMP-2 production, and invasion in OVCAR-3 and CaOV-3 cells, which was also seen after MMP-2 siRNA treatment. These results suggest that GnRH-II-induced LRP expression increases the amount of the 67-kDa nonintegrin laminin receptor, which appears to interact with laminin in the extracellular matrix to promote MMP-2 expression and enhance ovarian cancer cell invasion.
