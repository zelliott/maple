Our goal was to clarify the involvement and clinical significance of S100P in pancreatic carcinogenesis.

We examined S100P expression in 45 bulk pancreatic tissues; in microdissected cells, including invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) cells (20 sections), pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) cells (12 sections), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) cells (19 sections), and normal epithelial cells (11 sections); and in pancreatic juice samples from 99 patients with pancreatic diseases (32 cancer, 35 IPMN, and 32 chronic pancreatitis samples). We used quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR with gene-specific priming to measure S100P in these various types of samples.

In bulk tissue analyses, pancreatic cancer and IPMN expressed significantly higher levels of S100P than did nonneoplastic pancreas ( p<0.017 and P=0.0013, respectively). Microdissection analyses revealed that IPMN expressed significantly higher levels of S100P than did IDC ( p<0.0001) and PanIN (P=0.0031), although S100P expression did not differ between IDC and PanIN (P=0.077). In pancreatic juice analyses, cancer and IPMN juice expressed significantly higher levels of S100P than did pancreatitis juice (both  p<0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses revealed that measurement of S100P in pancreatic juice was useful for discriminating neoplastic disease from chronic pancreatitis (area under the curve=0.837; 95% confidence interval, 0.749-0.903).

S100P may be an early developmental marker of pancreatic carcinogenesis, and measurement of S100P in pancreatic juice may be useful for early detection of pancreatic cancer or screening of early pancreatic carcinogenesis.
