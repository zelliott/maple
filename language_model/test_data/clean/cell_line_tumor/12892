Newer series of 9-ethyl-9H-purine derivatives (EPD) were synthesized and screened for their efficacy in inhibiting the proliferation of various tumor cells in vitro. We evaluated the effects of EPD against HeLa, SiHa, CaSki (human cervical cancer cells), LM8, LM8G7 (murine osteosarcoma cells), OVSAHO and SKOV-3 (human ovarian cancer cells). The chemical structures of the EPD were confirmed by (1)H NMR and LCMS analyses. The inhibitory effects of EPD were studied by using trypan blue exclusion, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and TetraColor One reagents. Furthermore, SAR studies revealed that the presence of trifluoromethoxy and trifluromethyl group in 4b and 4g, respectively are responsible for the significant activity of the EPD against cervical cancer cells and the presence of isopropoxy group in 4f has influence in inhibiting the proliferation of osteosarcoma and ovarian cancer cell types.
