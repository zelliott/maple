Cancer/testis (CT) antigens are considered target molecules for cancer immunotherapy.             To identify novel CT antigens, immunoscreening of a testicular cDNA library was             performed using serum obtained from a colon cancer patient who was immunized with             a new dendritic cell vaccine. We isolated 64 positive cDNA clones comprised of             40 different genes, designated KP-CoT-1 through KP-CoT-40. Three of these putative             antigens, including KP-CoT-23 (CCDC83), had testis-specific expression profiles             in the Unigene database. RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of 2 KP-Cot-23             variants was restricted to the testis in normal adult tissues. In addition, KP-CoT-23             variants were frequently expressed in a variety of tumors and cancer cell lines,             including colon cancer. A serological western blot assay showed IgG antibodies             to the KP-CoT-23 protein in 26 of 37 colon cancer patients and in 4 of 21 healthy             patients. These data suggest that KP-CoT-23 is a novel CT antigen that may be             useful for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of cancer.
