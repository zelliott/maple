Osteosarcoma is primary malignant tumour of bone. Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) is a tumor suppressor gene frequently inactivated in a number of human cancers and a ubiquitously expressed zinc-finger transcription factor. The present study aimed to first explore the relationship between the expression level of the KLF6 gene in osteosarcoma and the occurrence of bone tumours.

KLF6 mRNA and protein expression levels in osteosarcoma and normal bone tissue were assayed by real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. KLF6 mRNA and protein expression levels in osteosarcoma cells and normal osteoblasts were detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting, respectively.

Both the expression of KLF6 mRNA and protein in osteosarcoma cells and tissues were significantly lower than that in normal cells and tumour-adjacent tissues.

KLF6 is a putative tumor suppressor gene involved in osteosarcoma which can be used as a new therapeutic target and an important marker for early diagnosis and postoperative monitoring.
