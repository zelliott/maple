The cell fate determination factor Dachshund was cloned as a dominant inhibitor of the hyperactive epidermal growth factor receptor ellipse. The expression of Dachshund is lost in human breast cancer associated with poor prognosis. Breast tumor-initiating cells (TIC) may contribute to tumor progression and therapy resistance. Here, endogenous DACH1 was reduced in breast cancer cell lines with high expression of TIC markers and in patient samples of the basal breast cancer phenotype. Re-expression of DACH1 reduced new tumor formation in serial transplantations in vivo, reduced mammosphere formation, and reduced the proportion of CD44(high)/CD24(low) breast tumor cells. Conversely, lentiviral shRNA to DACH1 increased the breast (B)TIC population. Genome-wide expression studies of mammary tumors demonstrated DACH1 repressed a molecular signature associated with stem cells (SOX2, Nanog, and KLF4) and genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis identified DACH1 binding to the promoter of the Nanog, KLF4, and Lin28 genes. KLF4/c-Myc and Oct4/Sox2 antagonized DACH1 repression of BTIC. Mechanistic studies demonstrated DACH1 directly repressed the Nanog and Sox2 promoters via a conserved domain. Endogenous DACH1 regulates BTIC in vitro and in vivo.
