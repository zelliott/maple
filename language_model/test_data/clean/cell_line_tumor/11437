A novel class of (E)-3,4-dihydroxy styryl sulfonamides and their 3,4-diacetylated derivatives as caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) analogs was designed and prepared for improving stability and solubility of the lead compound. Their neuroprotective properties were assessed by several models. The results showed that target compounds displayed positive free radical quenching abilities, superior to that of CAPE. Compounds 6j-k and 7j-k demonstrated remarkable protection effects against damage induced by hydrogen peroxide which were apparently stronger than that of CAPE. Most of target compounds could inhibit nitric oxide production. Additionally, target compounds showed high blood-brain barrier permeability.
