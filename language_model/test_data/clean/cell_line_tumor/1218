Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is overexpressed in inflammatory bowel diseases. An antisense oligonucleotide with good hybridization properties for iNOS mRNA was selected using RT-PCR. The oligonucleotide was reliably labeled with fluorine-18 using N-(4-[(18)F]fluorobenzyl)-2-bromoacetamide. Cellular uptake and efflux of oligonucleotide complexed with FuGENE-6 were rapid, unlike naked oligonucleotide, which hardly accumulated. However, neither uptake nor efflux showed any selectivity for iNOS expressing cells. The oligonucleotide showed a high level of non-specific binding, which may have obscured its specific hybridization to iNOS mRNA.
