The polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-Ts) family of enzymes regulates the initial steps of mucin-type O-glycosylation. N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases might show novel patterns of GalNAc-T glycosylation on tumour-derived proteins, which could influence cancer biology, but its mechanisms are unclear. We investigated the association of GalNAc-T3 and -T6 expressions with clinicopathological features and prognoses of patients with renal cell carcinomas (RCCs).

Expressions of GalNAc-T3/6 and cell-adhesion molecules were analysed immunohistochemically in 254 paraffin-embedded tumour samples of patients with RCC.

Of 138 GalNAc-T3+ cases, 46 revealed significant co-expression with GalNAc-T6. N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases-3+ expression showed a close relationship to poor clinical performance and large tumour size, or pathologically high Fuhrman's grading, and presence of vascular invasion and necrosis. The GalNAc-T3-positivity potentially suppressed adhesive effects with a significantly low Î²-catenin expression. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed the GalNAc-T3+ group, but not the GalNAc-T6+ group, to have significantly worse survival rates.

N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases-3 expression independently predicts high-grade tumour and poor prognosis in patients with RCC, and may offer a therapeutic target against RCC.
