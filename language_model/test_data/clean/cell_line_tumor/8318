Seven new dibenzocyclooctane lignans, schisanwilsonins A-G (1-7), were isolated from the fruits of Schisandra wilsoniana, together with five known lignans (8-12). The structures of these new compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including 2D-NMR techniques. The 12 lignans were tested for anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity in vitro. Schisanwilsonin D (4), schisantherin C (9), deoxyschizandrin (10) and (+)-gomisin K(3) (11) showed anti-HBV activity. 9 exhibited the most potent anti-HBV activity with potency against HBsAg and HBeAg secretion by 59.7% and 34.7%, respectively, at 50 microg/mL.
