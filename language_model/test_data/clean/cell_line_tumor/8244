To study the effect of allicin on invasion and metastasis of human colon cancer cell line LoVo in vitro and furthermore elucidate its anticancer mechanisms.

MTT assay was used to test dynamically the effect of cell growth inhibition. The inhibitory effects of allicin on movement, adhesiveness and invasiveness of LoVo cells were evaluated by the migratory test, adhesion test and Transwell chamber experiment. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR) was performed to quantify the mRNA expression of MMP-2, TIMP-2, CD147, VEGF, nm23-H1, HPA and uPAR.

Allicin had inhibitive effects on growth of LoVo cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. Allicin at non-cytotoxic concentration (3 and 6 microg/ml) could obviously suppress the movement, adhesion and invasive capability of LoVo cells. In the allicin-treated group (3 and 6 microg/ml), after 24 hours, the inhibition rates of migratory time were 24% and 50% (t = 4.543, 12.348, P = 0.010, 0.001), the inhibition rates of adhesion were 19% and 28% (t = 6.145, 6.355, P = 0.004, 0.003), the inhibition rates of migration were 28% and 46% (t = 8.065, 28.435, both P < 0.01), and the inhibition rates of invasion were 44% and 65% respectively (t = 21.274, 26.288, both P < 0.01). Allicin at non-cytotoxic concentration could down-regulate the mRNA levels of VEGF, uPAR and HPA in a dose-dependent manner in LoVo cells (t = 7.129, 6.764, 8.497, P = 0.002, 0.002, 0.001) while the mRNA levels of TIMP-2, CD147 and nm23-H1 remained basically unchanged with the same treatment (t = 0.341, 1.889, 0.914, P = 0.059, 0.132, 0.412). The expression of MMP-2 had not been detected in LoVo cells.

Allicin in vitro inhibits invasion and metastasis of human colon carcinoma cell LoVo at non-cytotoxic concentration through down-regulating the expression of VEGF, uPAR and HPA mRNA.
