Human β-tryptase is stored in secretory granules of human mast cells as a heparin-stabilized tetramer. β-Protryptase in solution can be directly processed to the mature enzyme by cathepsin (CTS) L and CTSB, and sequentially processed by autocatalysis at R(-3), followed by CTSC proteolysis. However, it is uncertain which CTS is involved in protryptase processing inside human mast cells, because murine bone marrow-derived mast cells from CTSC-deficient mice convert protryptase (pro-mouse mast cell protease-6) to mature mouse mast cell protease-6. This finding suggests that other proteases are important for processing human β-protryptase. In the current study, reduction of either CTSB or CTSL activity inside HMC-1 cells by short hairpin RNA silencing or CTS-specific pharmacologic inhibitors substantially reduced mature β-tryptase formation. Similar reductions of tryptase levels in primary skin-derived mast cells were observed with these pharmacologic inhibitors. In contrast, protryptase processing was minimally reduced by short hairpin RNA silencing of CTSC. A putative pharmacologic inhibitor of CTSC markedly reduced tryptase levels, suggesting an off-target effect. Skin mast cells contain substantially greater amounts of CTSL and CTSB than do HMC-1 cells, the opposite being found for CTSC. Both CTSL and CTSB colocalize to the secretory granule compartment of skin mast cells. Thus, CTSL and CTSB are central to the processing of protryptase(s) in human mast cells and are potential targets for attenuating production of mature tryptase in vivo.
