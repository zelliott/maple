A novel, general method of synthesis of 4-methylideneisoxazolidin-5-ones 10 is described. The target compounds were synthesized starting from ethyl 2-diethoxyphosphoryl-2-alkenoates 6 or dicyclohexylammonium 4-diethoxyphosphoryl-2-alkenoates 7. Addition of N-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride to these Michael acceptors, lactonization to 4-diethoxyphosphorylisoxazolidin-5-ones 9, and Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons olefination of formaldehyde using 9 gave the title isoxazolidinones 10. All obtained compounds were tested against L-1210, HL-60, and NALM-6 leukemia cell lines. Several isoxazolidinones 10 were found to be very potent with IC(50)<1 microM. The highest cytostatic activity against HL-60 was observed for 10a and against NALM-6 for 10b with IC(50) values of 0.74 and 0.34 microM, respectively.
