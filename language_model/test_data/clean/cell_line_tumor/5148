This study was designed to investigate the molecular changes that may develop during exposure of breast cancer cells to anticancer agents and that may lead to acquired resistance. We used two breast cancer cell lines, a parental (MCF7/WT) and a doxorubicin-resistant (MCF7/DOX) one. Cell survival, cell cycle distribution and RT-PCR expression level of genes involved in DNA damage response, MDR1, GST and TOPOIIalpha were measured. MCF7/DOX cells were five-fold more resistant to doxorubicin (DOX) than the MCF7/WT cells. DOX treatment causes arrest of MCF7/DOX cells in G1 and G2 phases of cell cycle whereas MCF7/WT cells were arrested in S-phase. The molecular changes in both cell lines due to DOX treatment could be classified into: (1) the basal level of p53, p21, BRCA1, GST and TOPOIIalpha mRNA was higher in MCF7/DOX than MCF7/WT. During DOX treatment, the expression level of these genes decreased in both cell lines but the rate of down-regulation was faster in MCF7/WT than MCF7/DOX cells. (2) The expression level of MDR1 was the same in both cell lines but 48 and 72 h of drug treatment, MDR1 disappeared in MCF7/WT but still expressed in MCF7/DOX. (3) There was no change in the expression level of BAX, FAS and BRCA2 in both cell lines. Conclusively, after validation in clinical samples, overexpression of genes like BRCA1, p53, p21, GST, MDR1 and TOPOIIalpha could be used as a prognostic biomarker for detection of acquired resistance in breast cancer and as therapeutic targets for the improvement of breast cancer treatment strategies.
