The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a member of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) gene family, binds a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and mediates their toxic effects. GAC63 has been shown to act as a coactivator in nuclear receptor-mediated gene transcription. In this report, we demonstrate that GAC63 interacts with AHR through its bHLH-PAS domain. Overexpression of GAC63 greatly enhanced AHR-regulated reporter gene activity in a ligand-dependent manner in transient transfection assays. Upon ligand treatment, endogenous GAC63 was recruited to the xenobiotic response element of the mouse CYP1A1 gene, an AHR-responsive gene. Reduction of the endogenous GAC63 level by small interfering RNA inhibited transcriptional activation by AHR. These findings reveal a new function of GAC63 in AHR-mediated gene transcription.
