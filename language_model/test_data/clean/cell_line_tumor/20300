The conventional chemotherapy agent, doxorubicin, is of limited clinical use because of its systemic toxicity toward normal healthy tissue. A new doxorubicin conjugate with α-linolenic acid showed good anti-tumor activity with lower toxicity than free doxorubicin and exhibited an active tumor-targeting profile due to the introduction of α-linolenic acid which might be an effective tumor-targeting moiety for the modification of chemotherapeutics.
