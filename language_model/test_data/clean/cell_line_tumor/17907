Alpha-lipoic acid (LA) has recently been reported to afford protective effects in neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying LA-mediated neuroprotection remain to be investigated. This study was undertaken to determine whether LA treatment could increase endogenous antioxidants and phase 2 enzymes in cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, and whether such increased cellular defenses could afford protection against cytotoxicity induced by neurotoxicants. Incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with micromolar concentrations of LA for 24 h resulted in a significant increase in the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQQ1) in a concentration-dependent fashion. Treatment of the cells with LA also led to an increased mRNA expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and NQO1. To determine the protective effects of the LA-induced cellular defenses on neurotoxicant-elicitedl cell injury, SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with LA for 24 h and then exposed to acrolein, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), H(2)O(2) and the peroxynitrite generator, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1). We observed that LA pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells led to a marked protection against acrolein, HNE, H(2)O(2 )and SIN-1-mediated cytotoxicity, as detected by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium reduction assay. Taken together, this study demonstrates for the first time that LA can induce GSH and NQO1 in cultured human neuroblastoma cells and LA-upregulated cellular defenses are accompanied by a markedly increased resistance to cytotoxicity induced by various neurotoxicants. The results of this study may have important implications for the neuroprotective effects of LA.
