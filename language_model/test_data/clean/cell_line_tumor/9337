To investigate the apoptosis effect of SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein on cultured cell lines and to explore the possible pathway of apoptosis. pCDNA3.1(-)/his-myc vector containing the SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid gene (N), matric gene (M), spike gene (S) were transfected into COS-1, Huh-7 and HepG2 cells. Apoptosis induced by SARS coronavirus N protein under starvation of serum of COS-1 cells was monitored by Annexin V and electron microscopy assays. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) were determined by flow cytometric assay. Cytochrome C, cleaved caspase (cysteine aspartic acid protease)-3, 9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were detected by Western blot. After removal of serum in COS-1 cells, we observed the loss of DeltaPsim, the increase of ROS and cytochrome C release into cytosol and subsequent activation of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. The pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk can block the activation of caspase 3, 9 and PARP cleavage. In conclusion, SARS coronavirus N protein can induce apoptosis of COS-1 cells by activating mitochondrial pathway. SARS coronavirus M, S protein can not induce apoptosis in COS-1, HepG2 and Huh-7 and SARS coronavirus N protein can not induce apoptosis in HepG2 and Huh-7 by methods used in this study.
