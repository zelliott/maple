MDM2, Pirh2 and COP1 are important E3 ubiquitin ligases, which directly interact with p53 and target p53 for proteasome-mediated degradation. MDMX, the MDM2 homologous protein, inhibits p53-mediated transcription activity. The interplay between MDM2, MDMX, Pirh2 and COP1 has not been reported, except the interaction between MDM2 and MDMX. Here, we reported that there were interactions between these four proteins independently of p53. The protein levels of MDM2, MDMX, Pirh2 and COP1 changed when any two of them were co-transfected. Our data also showed that the integrity of MDM2 RING finger domain was crucial for its ability to elevate the protein levels of COP1 and Pirh2. Any two of these four proteins could inhibit p53-mediated transcriptional activity synergistically. Furthermore, COP1 inhibited MDM2 self-ubiquitination and interfered with MDMX ubiquitination by MDM2. Our results suggest that MDM2, MDMX, Pirh2 and COP1 might inhibit p53 activity synergistically in vivo.
