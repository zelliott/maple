To investigate the relationship between the alterations of complete blood counts and tumor shrinkage during tumor rejection induced by a high dose of 5-FU in C57BL/6 mice.

Wild type C57BL/6 tumor-bearing mice were treated with different doses of 5-FU intraperitoneally. 75 mg/kg 5-FU was the minimal effective dose of 5-FU that could cure the tumor-bearing mice. Then another 6 tumor-bearing mice were treated intraperitoneally with 5-FU (75 mg/kg). Blood samples were obtained from orbital venous sinus on different days before and after 5-FU treatment, and then complete blood counts were performed and the relationship between the alterations of blood counts and tumor shrinkage after 5-FU treatment was analyzed.

Tumor sizes decreased steadily and tumors disappeared within the first week after 5-FU treatment; and at the same time 75 mg/kg 5-FU also had side effects on peripherial blood cells. The number of WBC significantly decreased from the first day after 5-FU treatment ( p<0.001). But during the 7 th to 15 th day the number of WBC rebounced back to normal level (p>0.05). Later it decreased again and it couldn't recover back to normal level at the 28th day after 5-FU treatment ( p<0.01). The concentration of Hb decreased at the first day and lasted for 2 weeks ( p<0.01). It increased gradually back to normal in 2 weeks after 5-FU treatment. The inhibitory effect of 5-FU on platelets count was not obvious. The platelet count increased significantly at the first and at the 11th day after 5-FU treatment respectively ( p<0.01).

Tumor shrinkage after 5-FU treatment is not related to the decreased number of WBC or RBC, but correlated with the increased number of platelet at the first day after 5-FU treatment.
