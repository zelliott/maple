Activated EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling plays an instrumental role in glioblastoma (GBM) progression. However, how EGFR activation regulates the tumor microenvironment to promote GBM cell invasion remains to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of EGFR activation in tumor cells correlated with the levels of macrophage infiltration in human GBM specimens. This was supported by our observation that EGFR activation enhanced the interaction between macrophages and GBM cells. In addition, EGF treatment induced up-regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in a PKCε- and NF-κB-dependent manner. Depletion of VCAM-1 interrupted the binding of macrophages to GBM cells and inhibited EGF-induced and macrophage-promoted GBM cell invasion. These results demonstrate an instrumental role for EGF-induced up-regulation of VCAM-1 expression in EGFR activation-promoted macrophage-tumor cell interaction and tumor cell invasion and indicate that VCAM-1 is a potential molecular target for improving cancer therapy.
