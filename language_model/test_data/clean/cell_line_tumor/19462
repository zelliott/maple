To characterize the growth of human gastric cancer cells in collagen gel matrix and adhesive status of the cells in comparison with conventional monolayer cells. Three kinds of human gastric cancer cell lines (BGC823, SGC7901, and MKN28) were cultured alone or co-cultured with normal human fibroblasts in collagen gel matrix, and their cell cycle, metabolic function, and the expression of adhesive molecules (CD44s, CD54, and E-cadherin) were analyzed by flow cytometry or other methods. Two of three cell lines (BGC823 and SGC7901) and their co-cultures showed multilayer growth in collagen gel matrix, and their growth and metabolism rate became slow and the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) expression was down regulated. Gastric cancer cell alone or with fibroblasts in collagen gel matrix showed distinct growth feature when compared with monolayer cells, which represent two kinds of different experimental models. BGC823 and SGC7901 cells growing in three-dimension may recur some characteristics of their original solid tumor in vivo with the invasive or metastatic ability. According to different aims, it should pay great care in choice of experimental model to get more reasonable results.
