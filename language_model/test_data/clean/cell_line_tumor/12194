A fungal pigment, hypocrellin D (1), together with three known perylenequinone derivatives hypocrellin A (2), B (3) and C (4), was isolated from the fruiting bodies of Shiraia bambusicola. Its structure was elucidated on the basis of spectral data including 2D NMR experiments. Hypocrellin D (1) significantly inhibited the growth of tumor cell lines Bel-7721, A-549 and Anip-973 with IC50 values of 1.8, 8.8, 38.4 microg/ml, respectively.
