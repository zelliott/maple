Copper toxicity associated with Wilson's disease is known to cause neuronal damage and death in the basal ganglia and frontal cortex leading to Parkinson-like symptoms and cognitive deficits. Our previous work in cultured human NTERA-2-N neurons showed that copper-induced neuronal apoptosis is dependent on the induction and nuclear translocation of the tumor suppressor protein, p53. Because p53 acts as a DNA-binding transcription factor, this work used an oligonucleotide array to identify p53 target genes that are differentially regulated in copper-loaded neurons. Arrays representing 145 human genes expressed downstream of p53 were hybridized with labeled mRNA from control and copper-treated neurons. Differentially regulated mRNAs included those involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, cytoprotective mechanisms, and apoptotic mechanisms. Transfection of cells with a dominant-negative p53 construct enabled us to determine which molecular events were dependent on p53 expression. Copper treatment resulted in the upregulation of p21, reprimo, stathmin, and Tp53INP1, all known to participate in cell cycle arrest. Protective mechanisms included the upregulation of stat-3, and the heat-shock proteins, heat-shock protein (Hsp) 70 and Hsp 27. Both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms leading to apoptosis were identified including insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6, glutathione peroxidase, bcl-2, RB-1, PUMA, and several members of the redox active PIG family of proteins. Thus it appears that following copper-mediated neuronal DNA damage, the regulation of a variety of pro- and antiapoptotic genes are responsible for determining neuronal fate.
