Common ethanol detection methods are not applicable to cell culture media and microdialysates due to interference with medium constituents including amino acids and pH indicators. We present a novel GC-MS method for the accurate and precise analysis of ethanol in cell cultures and microdialysates. The method is based on the carbonate-catalyzed extractive pentafluorobenzoylation of ethanol and deuterium-labelled ethanol serving as the internal standard and on their GC-MS analysis in the electron-capture negative-ion chemical ionization mode. The method was used to optimize experimental conditions in a custom-made ethanol vapour system utilized for studies examining ethanol influences on neuronal cell lines and in microdialysis.
