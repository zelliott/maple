To develop new therapies for inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) we have compared the effects of two hydroxamic acid-based histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, CG-1521 and Trichostatin A (TSA) on the biology of two IBC cell lines: SUM149PT and SUM190PT. CG-1521 and TSA induce dose (0-10 µM) and time-dependent (0-96 h) increases in the proportion of cells undergoing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the presence or absence of 17β-estradiol. In SUM 149PT cells, both CG-1521 and TSA increase the levels of acetylated α-tubulin; however the morphological effects are different: CG-1521 blocks mitotic spindle formation and prevents abscission during cytokinesis while TSA results in an increase in cell size. In SUM190PT cells CG-1521 does not cause an increase in acetylated-α-tubulin and even though TSA significantly increases the levels of acetylated tubulin, neither inhibitor alters the morphology of the cells. Microarray analysis demonstrates that CG-1521 modulates the expression of 876 mRNAs and 63 miRNAs in SUM149PT cells, and 1227 mRNAs and 35 miRNAs in SUM190PT cells. Only 9% of the genes are commonly modulated in both cell lines, suggesting that CG-1521 and TSA target different biological processes in the two cell lines most likely though the inhibition of different HDACs in these cell lines. Gene ontology (GO) analysis reveals that CG-1521 affects the expression of mRNAs that encode proteins associated with the spindle assembly checkpoint, chromosome segregation, and microtubule-based processes in both cell lines and has cell-type specific effects on lipid biosynthesis, response to DNA damage, and cell death.
