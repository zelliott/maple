Current treatment of fibrosarcoma, an aggressive cancer of the connective tissue, is generally associated with poor prognosis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and constituents of the extracellular matrix (ECM), such as fibronectin, play a critical role in angiogenesis and underlie neoplastic invasion and metastasis. This and anticancer properties of lysine, proline, arginine, ascorbic acid, and green tea extract (NM) prompted us to investigate the effect of these nutrients in vitro on human fibrosarcoma cells HT-1080 by measuring cell proliferation, modulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and invasive potential. In vivo, we studied the growth of human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells in athymic nude mice and the expression of MMPs and VEGF. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay, MMP expression by gelatinase zymography, and invasion through Matrigel and migration by scratch assay. Tumors were excised, weighed, and processed for histology in both the control and nutrient-supplemented groups. Results showed NM inhibited the growth and reduced the size of tumors in nude mice; decreased MMP-9 and VEGF secretion was found in the supplemented group tissues. NM inhibited invasion through Matrigel and migration with total inhibition at 1,000 microg/mL. These results offer promise in the therapeutic use of the nutrient mixture of lysine, proline, arginine, ascorbic acid, and green tea extract tested in the treatment of fibrosarcoma.
