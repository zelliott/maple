The purpose of this study was to determine therapeutic effects and systemic             toxicity of 212Pb-trastuzumab in an orthotopic model of human prostate cancer             cells in nude mice. TCMC-Trastuzumab was radiolabeled with 212Pb. The 212Pb-trastuzumab             generated from the procedure was intact and had high binding affinity with a dissociation             constant (of 3.9Â±0.99 nM. PC-3MM2 cells, which expressed a lower level of HER2             both in culture and in tumors, were used in therapy studies. A single intravenous             injection of 212Pb-trastuzumab reduced tumor growth by 60-80%, reduced aortic             lymph node metastasis, and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Treatment             with 212Pb-trastuzumab did not cause significant changes in body weight, serum             glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hematological             profiles, and histological morphology of several major organs of tumor-bearing             mice. These findings suggest that a systemic delivery of 212Pb-trastuzumab could             be an effective modality for management of advanced human prostate cancer.
