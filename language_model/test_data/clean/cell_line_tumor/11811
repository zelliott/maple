Fucoxanthin (FX) and highly unsaturated monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) were isolated from the ethanol extract of brown alga Fucus evanescens. Their structures were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance, complemented by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS). MGDG was identified as 1-O-(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z-eicosapentanoyl)-2-O-(6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z-octadecatetraenoyl)-3-O-β-D-galactopiranosyl-sn-glycerol. Antitumor activity of these compounds was tested on human melanoma (SK-MEL-28) cells. MGDG and FX inhibited the growth of human melanoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. IC50 values for growth inhibition were 104 and 114 μM, correspondently.
