Malignant gliomas are common and aggressive brain tumors in adults. The rapid proliferation and diffuse brain migration are main obstacles to successful treatment. Here we show that pentobarbital, a central depressant introduced clinically a century ago, is capable of suppressing proliferation and migration of C6 malignant glioma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Pentobarbital also leads to a G1 phase cell cycle arrest accompanied by suppressed G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins Cyclin D1, Cyclin D3, CDK2 and phosphorylated Rb. In addition, noticeable morphological changes and interrupted alpha-tubulin microtubule assembly are induced by pentobarbital exposure. Intracellular signal pathways involved in the effect of pentobarbital is concerned with inactivation of ERK, c-Jun and Akt. Together, these findings suggest anti-proliferation and anti-migration effects of pentobarbital on malignant gliomas, most likely by arresting cell cycle and interfering microtubule. ERK, c-Jun MAPK and PI3K/Akt are possible signaling pathways involved.
