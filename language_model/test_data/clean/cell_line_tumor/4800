We have previously reported that the addition of interferon (IFN) to the culture medium of Vero cells (which cannot produce IFN) that were infected with the CPI- strain of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5, formally known as SV5), that fails to block IFN signaling, rapidly induces alterations in the relative levels of virus mRNA and protein synthesis. In addition, IFN treatment also caused a rapid redistribution of virus proteins and enhanced the formation of cytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies. The most studied IFN-induced genes with known anti-viral activity are MxA, PKR and the Oligo A synthetase/RNase L system. We therefore examined the effects of these proteins on the replication cycle of PIV5. These studies revealed that while these proteins had some anti-viral activity against PIV5 they were not primarily responsible for the very rapid alteration in virus protein synthesis observed following IFN treatment, nor for the IFN-induced formation of virus inclusion bodies, in CPI- infected cells.
