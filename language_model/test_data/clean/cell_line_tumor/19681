Two diterpenes, ent-erogorgiaene and (+)-1,5-cyclo-5,8,9,10-tetrahydroerogorgiaene, were isolated from the Russian Far-eastern population of the brown alga Dictyota dichotoma along with three previously known from this alga terpenoids. In addition, pentadecane was the first time isolated as natural product from this species. The structures of all compounds and their stereochemistry were determined using 1D and 2D NMR ((1)H-(1)H COSY, DEPT, HSQC, HMBC and NOESY), mass spectrometry, and optical rotation data.
