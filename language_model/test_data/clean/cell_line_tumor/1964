We previously showed that within primary tumors there exist subpopulations of cells expressing stem cell markers. Using immunofluorescence and western blotting, we examined the expression of stem cell markers tumor-rejection antigen 1-60 (TRA1-60) and octamer-binding transcription factor 3/ 4 (OCT3/4) to determine their relationship with cell invasiveness. Six human oral cancer cell lines were examined and a direct correlation was found between expression of these stem cell markers and invasion. Poor expression of E-cadherin and increased expression of N-cadherin was also found in TRA1-60- and OCT3/4- expressing cells. Phosphorylation of the major signaling molecule mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) was greatest in the TRA1-60- and OCT3/4- expressing cells. These results suggest that expression of specific stem cell markers in tumors may help guide a clinician's choice of treatment.
