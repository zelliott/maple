Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) could enhance the cytocidal effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on malignant tumor cell lines, but metastasis effects of PEMF on tumor cells have not been investigated. We investigated the effects of PEMF exposure on the expression levels of some metastasis-related molecules, including integrin α subunits (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, α6, αv), integrin β subunits (β1, β2, β3, β4), CD44, and matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 (MMP-2/9) in four human osteosarcoma cell lines (HOS, MG-63, SAOS-2, NY) and two mouse osteosarcoma cell lines (DOS, LM8) by using FACScan analysis, gelatin zymography, and Western blot analysis. Our results indicate that PEMF exposure has no effect on the expression of some molecules that are associated with tumor cell invasion and metastasis, and therefore suggest that PEMF exposure may be safely applied to chemotherapy for osteosarcoma.
