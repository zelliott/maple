Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (BMP-2) is highly overexpressed in the majority of patient-derived lung carcinomas. However, a mechanism revealing its role in cancer has not been established. Here we report that BMP-2 enhances the neovascularization of developing tumors. Recombinant BMP-2 stimulated blood vessel formation in tumors formed from A549 cells injected s.c. into thymic nude mice. Recombinant BMP-2 also enhanced angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs containing A549 cells in nude mice. The BMP-2 antagonist noggin abrogated BMP-2-induced angiogenic response. Furthermore, antisense transfection of BMP-2 cDNA resulted in a decrease in blood vessel formation in the Matrigel assays. BMP-2 induced tube formation in both human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and umbilical vein endothelial cells. BMP-2 also stimulated proliferation of HAEC. The ability of BMP-2 to activate endothelial cells was further demonstrated by its ability to phosphorylate Smad 1/5/8 and ERK-1/2 and to increase expression of Id1. This study reveals that BMP-2 enhanced the angiogenic response in developing tumors. Furthermore, these data suggest that BMP-2 stimulation of angiogenesis may involve the activation of endothelial cells.
