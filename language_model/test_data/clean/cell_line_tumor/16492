In mammals, the type II melanoma antigen (MAGE) protein family is constituted by at least ten closely related members, but our understanding of their function in the developing nervous system remains poor. To systematically study the expression pattern of type II MAGE genes during neurogenesis, we employed mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cells as an in vitro model for neural differentiation by retinoic acid (RA) induction. The expression of type II MAGE genes was investigated under distinct steps of differentiation by a comparative ΔΔC                         (T) paradigm of real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The relative levels of each gene expression at various steps of differentiation were expressed as a fold change compared with that in RA-untreated P19 cells. The results revealed that: (1) the expression of MAGE-E1, E2, and Necdin transcripts was steadily increased, and the relative levels of MAGE-D1, D2, D3, F1, G1, and H1 mRNA were fluctuantly elevated after the RA-treatment at embryoid body and neural stages; (2) during RA-treatment and subsequent differentiation, the expression of MAGE-L2 mRNA was decreased. Therefore, our results suggested that MAGE-D1, D2, D3, E1, E2, F1, G1, H1, and Necdin might be involved in the early process of neurogenesis, and MAGE-L2 connected with maintenance of pluripotency of stem cells. These studies may present some clues for a better understanding of the fundamental aspects of type II MAGE genes during neurogenesis.
