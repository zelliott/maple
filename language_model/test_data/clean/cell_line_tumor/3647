To study whether PC-407 [4-[5-naphthyl-3- (trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl] benzenesulfonamide] inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in human colon cancer SW-1116 cells.

Inhibition of SW-1116 proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Morphological assessment of apoptosis was performed with fluorescence microscope and electron microscope. DNA fragmentation was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. The amount of apoptotic cells was measured by flow cytometry.

PC-407 inhibited SW-1116 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner after 3 d of treatment, and the IC(50) for PC-407 inhibition of cell number was 16.67+/-0.17 micromol/L. After incubation of SW-1116 cells with PC-407 20 micromol/L for 24 h, morphological changes of typical apoptosis were observed by AO/EB staining or transmission electron microscopy. Flow cytometry analysis showed that PC-407 induced apoptosis in SW-1116 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA revealed a ladder pattern 48 h later.

PC-407 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in the human colon cancer SW-1116 cell line.
