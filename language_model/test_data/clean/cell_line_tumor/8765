Previous studies found that urea transporter UT-B is abundantly expressed in bladder urothelium. However, the dynamic role of UT-B in bladder urothelial cells remains unclear. The objective of this study is to evaluate the physiological roles of UT-B in bladder urothelium using UT-B knockout mouse model and T24 cell line.

Urea and NO measurement, mRNA expression micro-array analysis, light and transmission electron microscopy, apoptosis assays, DNA damage and repair determination, and intracellular signaling examination were performed in UT-B null bladders vs wild-type bladders and in vitro T24 epithelial cells. UT-B was highly expressed in mouse bladder urothelium. The genes, Dcaf11, MCM2-4, Uch-L1, Bnip3 and 45 S pre rRNA, related to DNA damage and apoptosis were significantly regulated in UT-B null urothelium. DNA damage and apoptosis highly occurred in UT-B null urothelium. Urea and NO levels were significantly higher in UT-B null urothelium than that in wild-type, which may affect L-arginine metabolism and the intracellular signals related to DNA damage and apoptosis. These findings were consistent with the in vitro study in T24 cells that, after urea loading, exhibited cell cycle delay and apoptosis.

UT-B may play an important role in protecting bladder urothelium by balancing intracellular urea concentration. Disruption of UT-B function induces DNA damage and apoptosis in bladder, which can result in bladder disorders.
