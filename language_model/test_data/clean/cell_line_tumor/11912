To explore the down-regulation of telomerase as well as its RNA and apoptosis induced by retinoid acid.

After HNE1 cell lines of NPC were incubated with 10(-5) mol of retinoid in 6 days, the expression of telomerase and its RNA and the apoptosis of HNE1 cell lines were detected respectively with TRAP PCR ELISA, RT-nested PCR, apoptosis indexes and trans-electron microscope.

After 6 days when RA was added to the HNE1 cell line, the morphological change and suspending of HNE1 cells were found and the HNE1 cells reduced. Meanwhile, the expression of telomerase and hTR was obviously inhibited and the telomerase activity was only the 1/2 of the control with the use of ELISA indirect quantitative assay. Apoptosis indexes and apoptosis cells in RA groups were higher than those in control (P < 0.05).

The expression of telomerase and hTR are obviously inhibited and the apoptosis of HNE1 cell lines is also induced by retinoid.
