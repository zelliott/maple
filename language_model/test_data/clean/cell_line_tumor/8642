Persistent activation of the transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) has been shown to mediate several oncogenic features in many types of cancers, including melanoma. In this study, we investigated whether lentiviral (LV) delivery of Stat3-targeting short hairpin RNA (shRNA; LV-shStat3) to K1735-C4 melanoma cells modulates antitumor immunity. Three shStat3 sequences, starting at the position 446, 830 and 1412, were cloned into a mir30 cassette. A shRNA with scrambled sequence served as a control. Transduction with LV-shStat3 resulted in downregulation of Stat3 in vitro. The latter coincided with low cell viability, a reduced expression of survivin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2. A single injection of LV-shStat3 in K1735-C4 tumors efficiently downregulated Stat3 in vivo and resulted in reduction of both vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and in myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) numbers. In contrast, we observed an increase in interleukin-6 and interferon-Î³ secretion, mature dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8(+) T cells. Both DCs and CD8(+) T cells displayed enhanced activity, whereas granulocytic MDSCs lost their suppressive capacity upon Stat3 downregulation. Importantly, a single injection of LV-shStat3 was sufficient to reduce tumor growth, hence prolong survival of tumor-bearing mice. These data demonstrate that Stat3 downregulation in melanoma reinvigorates existing antitumor immunity.
