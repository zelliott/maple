This study investigated the therapeutic effect of crocetin, a carotenoid derived from saffron, on gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells and 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced gastric cancer in rats. An MTT assay showed a significant dose- and time-dependent inhibition of AGS cell proliferation as a result of crocetin administration. Flow cytometry and caspases activity assays revealed apoptosis had been induced in these cells; RT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed the suppression of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax expression in AGS cells treated with crocetin. These changes were not observed in normal human fibroblast (HFSF-PI3) cells. Pathological study of the tumor tissue in MNNG-induced gastric cancer in rats indicated the dose-dependent inhibition of tumor progression. In addition, crocetin reversed some changed biochemical parameters, including serum antioxidant activity and lactate dehydrogenase in rat serum. The present study demonstrates the antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic activities of crocetin against gastric cancer that may benefit human stomach cancer treatment.
