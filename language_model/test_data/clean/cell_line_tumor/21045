We have previously reported that As(2)O(3) affected cell cycle progression and cyclins D1 and B1 expression in two glioma cell lines differing in p53 status (U87MG-wt; T98G-mutated). In the present study, we further demonstrated that As(2)O(3) affected proliferation, viability and apoptosis of the two cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and T98G cells were more sensitive than U87MG cells to As(2)O(3) -induced apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation and viability. We further investigated the expression profiles of genes related with apoptosis and cell cycle in the two cell lines with a human cDNA-microarray (SuperArray) spotted with 267 genes of apoptosis and cell cycle. Thirty five genes were upregulated and 15 genes downregulated at least 2-fold by As(2)O(3) in U87-MG cells; whereas, 38 genes were upregulated and 21 genes downregulated at least 2-fold in T98G cells by As(2)O(3). After As(2)O(3) treatment, p53 expression was upregulated 56.5-fold in T98G cells, but only 6.0-fold in U87MG cells. The results indicate that As(2)O(3) suppresses the growth of U87MG cells mainly by regulating expression of genes of cell cycle arrest, stress and toxicity; whereas As(2)O(3) affects T98G cells mainly by regulating expression of genes belonging to Bcl-2, tumor necrotic factor receptor and ligand families. The data may be helpful for optimizing As(2)O(3) as an anti-cancer drug in the treatment of gliomas.
