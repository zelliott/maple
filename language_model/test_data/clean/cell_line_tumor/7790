A series of 3,3'-dindolylmethane derivatives have been synthesized and their structures were characterized in solid state by (13)C CP/MAS NMR and two of them by X-ray diffraction measurements. They exhibited well expressed cytotoxicity against human melanoma cell lines. Derivatives bearing fluoro, bromo, iodo, and nitro substituents in indole or benzene rings caused 50% inhibition of the viability of ME18 and ME18/R cell lines at concentration ranging 9.7-17.3 microM.
