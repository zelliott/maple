Mouse embryonic cells are unable to support the replication of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV). The integrated viral DNA is transcriptionally silenced, largely due to binding of host transcriptional repressors to the primer binding site (PBS) of the provirus. We have previously shown that a PBS DNA-binding repressor complex contains ZFP809 and TRIM28. Here, we identified ErbB3-binding protein 1 (EBP1) to be a novel component of the ZFP809-TRIM28 silencing complex and show that EBP1 depletion reduces PBS-mediated retroviral silencing.
