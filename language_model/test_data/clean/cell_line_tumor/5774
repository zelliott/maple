Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) - specific carrier for sex steroids - regulates hormone bioavailable fraction and estrogen signaling system in breast cancer cells. This study was conducted to elucidate the effects of hydroxylated estrogen (E2) metabolites (2-OH-E2 and 4-OH-E2) on sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) mRNA and protein expression as well as on intracellular and extracellular SHBG levels.

MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were cultured with 2-OH-E2 or 4-OH-E2 in concentration of 1, 10 and 100 nM for 24 h, 17β-estradiol being used as a positive control. SHBG levels were measured in medium and cells by ELISA, SHBG mRNA expression was evaluated by real-time-PCR and protein expression by Western blot analysis.

4-OH-E2 in high doses and 2-OH-E2 in the highest dose, while 17β-estradiol in all doses used increased intracellular but not extracellular SHBG levels. Both metabolites increased SHBG mRNA expression, the rank order of potency being E2 > 4-OH-E2 > 2-OH-E2. Both E2 and its metabolites increased SHBG protein expression.

Although the metabolites showed a lower potency than 17β-estradiol, further studies are needed to clarify whether hydroxylated metabolites of E2 are potent ligands for SHBG.
