Genistein, due to its recognized chemopreventive and antitumor potential, is a molecule of interest as a lead compound in drug design. While multiple molecular targets for genistein have been identified, so far neither for this isoflavonoid nor for its natural or synthetic derivatives disruption of microtubules and mitotic spindles has been reported. Here we describe such properties of the synthetic glycosidic derivative of genistein significantly more cytotoxic than genistein, 7-O-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1-->4)-(6-O-acetyl-hex-2-ene-alpha-D-erythro-pyranosyl)genistein, shortly named G21. We found that G21 causes significant mitotic delay, frequent appearance of multipolar spindles, and alteration of the interphase microtubule array.
