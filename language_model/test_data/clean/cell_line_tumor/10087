To investigate the effects of ezrin targeting gene of RNA interference (RNAi) on human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 in vitro.

The highly metastatic human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 transfected with a small interfering (siRNA) lentivirus vector was selected for this research study. Expressions of ezrin mRNA and ezrin protein in the SGC-7901 cells were detected using RT-PCR and Western blot. Cell apoptosis was observed using flow cytometry. Transwell invasion and the cell adhesion test were used to verify the effect of RNAi on ezrin expression in the human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 in vitro.

Ezrin gene targeting via a RNAi-mediated lentivirus vector had obvious inhibitory effects on ezrin expression in the human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901. The results of the RT-PCR show the obvious inhibition of ezrin mRNA expression in Eai and Ebi groups (0.22 +/- 0.01 vs 0.95 +/- 0.04, P < 0.05; 0.31 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.04, P < 0.05). Western blot analysis revealed a 72.35 +/- 3.74% reduction of the ezrin protein level after interference with the ezrin targeting gene. Moreover, the inhibition of ezrin expression clearly inhibited SGC-7901 cell migration and invasion, and improved cell adhesion as well as increased sensitivity to camptothecin-induced apoptosis.

Ezrin gene targeting by RNAi can inhibit the metastatic growth and migration of SGC-7901 human gastric cancer cells.
