Tamoxifen (Tam) is widely used in chemotherapy of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells by estrogen receptor-dependent modulation of gene expression, but recent reports have shown that Tam (especially at pharmacological concentrations) has also rapid nongenomic effects. Here we studied the mechanisms by which Tam exerts rapid effects on breast cancer cell viability. In serum-free medium 5-7 microM Tam induced death of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a time-dependent manner in less than 60 min. This was associated with release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This suggests that disruption of mitochondrial function has a primary role in the acute death response of the cells. Accordingly, bongkrekic acid, an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition, was able to protect MCF-7 cells against Tam. Rapid cell death induction by Tam was not associated with immediate activation of caspase-9 or cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. It was not blocked by the caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone either. Diphenylene ionodium (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, was able to prevent Tam-induced cell death but not cytochrome c release, which suggests that ROS act distal to cytochrome c. The pure antiestrogen ICI 182780 (1 microM) could partly oppose the effect of Tam in estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 cells, but not in estrogen receptor negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Pre-culturing MCF-7 cells in the absence of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) or in the presence of a low Tam concentration (1 microM) made the cells even more susceptible to rapid death induction by 5 or 7 microM Tam. This effect was associated with decreased levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2. In conclusion, our results demonstrate induction of a rapid mitochondrial cell death program in breast cancer cells at pharmacological concentrations of Tam, which are achievable in tumor tissue of Tam-treated breast cancer patients. These mechanisms may contribute to the ability of Tam therapy to induce death of breast cancer cells.
