In this study, we aimed to explore the radio-sensitization of the SHG44 glioma cell line by Aidi injection and the possible mechanisms involved. The growth curve, cloning efficiency and divisional index of the SHG44 cell line were observed. The inhibition ratio was determined by MTT assay, the change in the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry and the expression of cyclin B1 and Wee1 was detected by western blot analysis. The reproductive activity of the group treated with irradiation (IR) and Aidi injection was suppressed significantly, and the cloning efficiency and divisional index also declined. Aidi injection (15 Âµg/ml) induced G2/M phase arrest efficiently in the cell line after 48 h. The expression of cyclin B1 decreased in the group treated with IR and Aidi injection compared with either of those with IR or Aidi injection alone. The expression of Wee1 increased in the group treated with IR and Aidi injection compared with that in the groups treated with either IR or Aidi injection alone. In conclusion, Aidi injection is effective in radio-sensitization. The possible mechanisms involved may be associated with G2/M phase cell arrest, the downregulation of cyclin B1 and upregulation of Wee1 expression.
