Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells are relatively resistant to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis during culture. We investigated the role of a proteaosome inhibitor in the survival and apoptosis of these cells. We found that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 markedly accelerated TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in OSCC cell lines HSC-2 and HSC-3. Addition of TRAIL to MG132-treated cells resulted in Bid cleavage. Furthermore, the inhibitors of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 reduced the accelerative effect of MG132 on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that the pro-apoptotic effect of a proteasome inhibitor on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis may contribute to both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. MG132 enhanced the expression of the TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5, and neutralization of DR5 receptors showed a marked reduction of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, whereas that of DR4 was a partial reduction. MG132 also markedly reduced cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP-1), X-linked IAP (XIAP) and survivin. Therefore, MG132 provides partial regulation of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in OSCC cells via modulation of DR5, c-FLIP, cIAP-1, XIAP and survivin. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 may therefore represent a novel strategy for overcoming resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in OSCC cells.
