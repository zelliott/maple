Thymosin beta4 is a 43-amino acid actin-binding protein that promotes cell migration and is important in angiogenesis, wound healing, and tumor metastasis. We searched for genes upregulated by thymosin beta4 and identified zyxin as increased in SiHa cells in the presence of exogenously added thymosin beta4 and when thymosin beta4 is overexpressed using adenoviral vectors. Both zyxin and thymosin beta4 show increased localization in the nucleus. We conclude that thymosin beta4 may exert some of its migration promoting activity via increased zyxin expression.
