We have reported the first effort towards directly using an anticancer prodrug (CPTssR5H5) as a carrier to co-deliver camptothecin (CPT) and small interfering RNA for multidrug resistant cancer chemotherapy. The results indicated that CPTssR5H5 is a promising co-delivery system for MDR cancer therapy.
