Based on an established 3D pharmacophore, a series of quinoline derivatives were synthesized. The opioidergic properties of these compounds were determined by a competitive binding assay using (125)I-Dynorphine, (3)H-DAMGO and (125)I-DADLE for kappa, mu, and delta receptors, respectively. Results showed varying degree of activities of the compounds to kappa and mu opioid receptors with negligible interactions at the delta receptor. The compound, S4 was the most successful in inhibiting the two most prominent quantitative features of naloxone precipitated withdrawal symptoms - stereotyped jumping and body weight loss. Determination of IC(50) of S4 revealed a greater affinity towards mu compared to kappa receptor. In conclusion, quinoline derivatives of S4 like structure offer potential tool for treatment of narcotic addictions.
