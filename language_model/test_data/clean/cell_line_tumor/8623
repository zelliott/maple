We evaluated the pharmacology of spinal selective cannabinoid (CB) receptor agonists and a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor on bone tumor pain. MRMT-1 tumor cells were injected into the tibia of female Sprague-Dawley rats. MRMT-1 tumor cells produced a bone tumor confirmed by radiologic and histological findings. Intrathecal CB1 (ACEA) and CB2 receptor (AM 1241) agonists and a COX-2 inhibitor (DuP 697) dose-dependently increased the withdrawal threshold. The calculated ED50 (nmol/l) values for ACEA, AM 1241 and DuP 697 were 0.007, 2.3 and 76.1, respectively. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot showed that COX-2 mRNA and protein, but not CB1 or CB2 receptor, were increased in the spinal cords of rats with bone tumors. Spinal CB1 receptor and CB2 receptor agonists and COX-2 inhibitor may be useful in the management of bone tumor pain. Furthermore, CB2 receptor agonist may be more potent than CB1 receptor agonist and COX-2 inhibitor.
