The JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cell line has been proposed as a model cell line of human placental trophoblast for induction studies via aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We examined whether glucocorticoid dexamethasone influences AHR-mediated induction of CYP1A1 enzyme in the JEG-3 cell line. We found that dexamethasone dose- and time-dependently suppresses CYP1A1 transactivation in gene reporter assays, CYP1A1 mRNA induction, and upregulation of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity by 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in JEG-3 cells. Co-transfection of JEG-3 cells with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression construct and treatment with dexamethasone abolished the effect of MC on CYP1A1 promoter construct in transient transfection gene reporter assays. RU486, a GR antagonist, suppressed the effect of dexamethasone on MC-induced transactivation of AHR responsive reporter constructs. We also found that dexamethasone stimulates both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent degradation of AHR but not of aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) protein in JEG-3 cells. In experiments with proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib, we found that the degradation is not sensitive to proteasome inhibition in JEG-3. We can conclude that dexamethasone suppresses AHR-mediated CYP1A1 induction in JEG-3 cells through the unique mechanism of AHR-GR crosstalk, which involves accelerated degradation of AHR.
