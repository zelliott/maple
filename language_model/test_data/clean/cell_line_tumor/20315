The methanolic extract and its 1-butanol-soluble fraction from the flower buds of Camellia japonica, cultivated in Yunnan Province, China, showed inhibitory effects on melanogenesis in theophylline-stimulated B16 melanoma 4A5 cells. From the 1-butanol-soluble fraction, a new 28-nor-oleanane-type and three new oleanane-type triterpene saponins, sanchakasaponins A-D, were isolated together with four known triterpene saponins. Their chemical structures were elucidated on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence. The inhibitory effects on melanogenesis in theophylline-stimulated B16 melanoma 4A5 cells and structure-activity relationships of the saponins were investigated.
