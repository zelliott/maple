Epigenetic alterations of DNA methylation play an important role in the regulation of gene expression associated with chemosensitivity of gastric carcinomas. With the aim of improving the chemotherapeutic efficacy of gastric carcinoma, the effect of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-CdR, on the chemosensitivity of five anticancer drugs was investigated. Human gastric cancer cell lines, OCUM-2M and MKN-74, and five anticancer drugs, 5-FU, PTX, OXA, SN38, and GEM, were used. In both gastric cancer cell lines, a synergistic antiproliferative effect by a combination of 5-aza-CdR at 5 microM was found in SN38 and GEM. 5-Aza-CdR at 5 microM increased apoptosis induced by SN38 and GEM in both cell lines. 5-Aza-CdR increases the expression of DAPK-2 and DAPK-3, RASSF1, and THBS1 genes in both OCUM-2M and MKN-74 cells, but not that of hMLH1, p16, MGMT, E-cadherin, and p53 genes. These findings suggest that 5-aza-CdR is a promising chemotherapeutical agent for gastric carcinomas, in combination with the anticancer drugs SN38 and GEM, in apoptosis signaling. The upregulation of DAPK-2 and DAPK-3, RASSF1, and THBS1 genes by 5-aza-CdR might be associated with the synergistic effect.
