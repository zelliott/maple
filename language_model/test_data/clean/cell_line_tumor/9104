To study on the antitumor effect of combining wt-p53 gene with suicide gene therapy (HSV-tk+GCV) for malignant gliomas.

AdCMV-p53 was transfected into C6 glioma cells at MOI of (Multiplicity of infection) 0(G100), 10(TPG1), 100(TPG2), then AdCMV-tk was transducted to C6 glioma cells of G100, TPG1 and TPG2, respectively, at MOI of 100. The C6 glioma cells tranfected with both AdCMV-p53 and AdCMV-tk were exposed to various concentration of GCV. The cell survival rate was measured by MTT assay in vitro. Rat glioma model was established by injecting 5 x 10(5) C6 glioma cells into right caudate nucleus of SD rats. AdCMV-p53 and AdCMV-tk were injected into glioma on day 5 and 6, respectively. On day 7, ganciclovir (GCV) was administrated intraperitoneally at 15 mg/kg/day for 14 days. The survival time of all rats was observed. The growth of intracerebral tumors was monitored dynamically by enhanced MRI. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL method. Expression of HSV-tk gene was identified by in situ hybridization and expression of exogenous p53 gene was detected with Western blotting.

In vitro, wt-p53 significantly enhanced antitumor effect of HSV-tk/GCV. The concentration of GCV for ID50 of TPG2 cells (0.001 microg/ml GCV) was 10 times lower than that for the cells of tk-GCV group (MOI = 100), while the concentration of GCV for ID100 of TPG2 (0.01 microg/ml GCV) and TPG1(0.1 microg/ml GCV) was 100 and 10 times lower than that for the cells of tk-GCV group (MOI = 100), respectively. Apoptosis of C6 glioma cells also could be induced by transfection with wt-p53 gene slightly. For in vivo study, the survival time of tumor-bearing rats treated with HSV-TK/GCV or wt-p53 combined with HSV-TK/GCV was significantly prolonged and the intracerebral tumors were regressed and disappeared earlier in the combined gene therapy group than those in the HSV-TK/GCV therapy group as shown in enhanced MRI. However, only half dose of GCV for the rats treated with both wt-p53 and HSV-TK/GCV was needed to obtain the same efficacy as those rats treated with HSV-TK/GCV alone. These results indicate that the transfection of wt-p53 potentiates the effect of HSV-TK/GCV therapy.

The combination of HSV-tk/GCV system with wt-p53 gene transduction is optimal for clinical therapeutic trials of suicide gene therapy for malignant gliomas.
