To investigate the oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by 2, 2', 4, 4'-polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE-47) in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, and to explore the involved role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on apoptosis.

The rate of cellular survivors, intracellular ROS level, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and percentage of apoptosis were measured respectively after the SH-SY5Y cell were exposed to 2, 4, 8 microg/ml PBDE-47 for 24 h in vitro.

The rate of cellular survivors in the low dose PBDE-47-treated group was higher than the control group (P < 0.05), but the moderate and high dose PBDE-47-treated groups were significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.05). The MDA contents in the moderate and high dose PBDE-47-treated groups were significantly higher than the control group (P < 0.05) and increased with increase of PBDE-47 exposure concentrations. Compared with the control group, the levels of ROS were significantly increased with increase of PBDE-47 concentrations (P < 0.05). In the moderate and high dose PBDE-47-treated groups, the percentages of apoptosis were significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05).

PBDE-47 can induce oxidative stress and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cell. ROS may play an important role in the apoptosis induced by PBDE-47.
