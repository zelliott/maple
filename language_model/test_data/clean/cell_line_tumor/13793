The organic ligand Hbpmc and the polymeric complex [Mn(bpmc)(2)(4,4'-bipy)(H(2)O)(2)](n)Â·3H(2)O (4,4'-bipy = 4,4'-bipyridine, Hbpmc = 2,2-bis(3-phenylpropyl) malonic acid), which have both a lipophilic group (aromatic ring) and a hydrophilic group (non-coordination carboxyl), were synthesized and characterized by IR spectra, elemental analysis and X-ray single-crystal diffraction. The interaction of the complexes with HC-DNA was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. Gel electrophoresis assay demonstrates the ability to cleave the extracted HC-DNA. The value of IC(50) is to understand the effect of cytotoxic activity which is lower than cisplatin and higher than the ligand Hbpmc. The apoptotic tests show that the complexes apparently have an apoptotic effect on Hela cells.
