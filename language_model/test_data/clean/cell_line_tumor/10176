Synthetic efforts toward the cytotoxic peptides lucentamycins A-D are described that resulted in the total synthesis and biological evaluation of 8-epi-lucentamycin A in 15 steps with 2.2% overall yield. The key epi-nonproteogenic 3-methyl-4-ethylideneproline was synthesized via a titanium-mediated cycloisomerization reaction.
