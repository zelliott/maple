We have previously identified several novel genes, which are differentially expressed among human normal liver and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). The full-length liver fibrinogen-related gene-1 (LFIRE-1) cDNA was cloned from the human normal liver cDNA library. LFIRE-1 is highly homologous to HFREP-1 with discrepancy at 5' untranslated region (UTR) and encodes the same fibrinogen-related protein, which suggest that these two sequences might be alternative splicing forms of the same gene, LFIRE-1/HFREP-1, located at human chromosome 8p22. The LFIRE-1 and HFREP-1 are specifically expressed in normal human liver tissue, but reduced or undetectable in most of HCC specimens at both RNA and protein level. Furthermore, the reduction or nonexpression of LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 is significantly associated with the degree of tumor differentiation. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis revealed allelic loss of LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 on chromosome 8p22 in 57.1% (24/42) of HCC specimens. We detected three inactivation mutations among 45 cases of HCC specimens examined, two of which lost the remaining allele and the third had a replacement of conserved cysteine residue with glycine residue. Notably, the downregulation of LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 expression is frequently associated with allelic loss. The reduction of LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 expression by antisense approach enhances cancer cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar. Moreover, restoration of exogenous wild-type LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 expression but not LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 missense mutations in human HCC cells inhibited their anchorage-dependent or -independent growth in vitro, and suppressed their tumorigenicity in nude mice. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that liver-specific gene LFIRE-1/HFREP-1 was frequently downregulated and might possess growth suppressor activity in HCC.
