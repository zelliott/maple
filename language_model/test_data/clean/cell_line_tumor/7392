The synthesis of adamantylated pyrimidines was based on the reaction of 3-(adamantan-1-yl)-3-oxopropionic acid ethyl ester with urea, thiourea, guanidine as well as acetamidine, respectively. Then the compounds obtained were converted into respective bromo-, thio- and S-alkyl derivatives. The molecular structures for some compounds were studied by X-ray methods. The significant anticancer and antimicrobial properties of [2-(6-adamantan-1-yl-2-methylpyrimidin-4-ylthio)ethyl]dimethylamine were found.
