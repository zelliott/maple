From the flowers of Chromolaena odorata (Eupatorium odoratum) four flavanones, isosakuranetin (5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavanone) (1), persicogenin (5,3'-dihydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxyflavanone) (2), 5,6,7,4'-tetramethoxyflavanone (3) and 4'-hydroxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavanone (4), two chalcones, 2'-hydroxy-4,4',5',6'-tetramethoxychalcone (5) and 4,2'-dihydroxy-4',5',6'-trimethoxychalcone (6), and two flavones, acacetin (5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone) (7) and luteolin (5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone) (8) were isolated and identified. Compound 1 exhibited moderate antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis with the MIC value of 174.8 microM, whereas compounds 4, 7, and 8 exhibited weak activity with the MIC values of 606.0, 704.2 and 699.3 microM respectively. Compound 7 showed moderate cytotoxicity against human small cell lung cancer (NCI-H187) cells with the MIC value of 24.6 microM, whereas compound 8 exhibited moderate toxicity against NCI-H187 cells and week toxicity against human breast cancer (BC) cells with the MIC values of 19.2 and 38.4 microM respectively.
