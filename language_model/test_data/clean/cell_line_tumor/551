The present study investigated the antimetastatic property of chitosan oligosaccharides (COS) by evaluating motility, invasion, and the amount and activity of MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with increasing concentrations of COS led to a concentration-dependent decrease in cell migration. COS significantly inhibited the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells through a Matrigel-coated membrane. The treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with COS reduced the amounts of secreted MMP-9. The activity and amount of MMP-9 protein in MDA-MB-231 cells were decreased by treatment with COS and occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. Our data indicated that COS can serve as a potential novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
