A program currently ongoing in our laboratory envisions natural macrolide radicicol-based inhibitors targeting the molecular chaperone Hsp90. Such inhibitors can be potential anticancer agents due to their ability to induce the breakdown of a variety of oncogenic proteins. In this account, we first concern ourselves with a vastly important total synthesis of such an inhibitor. We accomplished this via a new approach, which we term the "ynolide method", directed to the synthesis of resorcinylic macrolides, including cycloproparadicicol and aigialomycin D. The key features of the syntheses involve cobalt-complexation-promoted ring-closing metathesis (RCM) to generate ynolides, followed by Diels-Alder reaction with dimedone-derived bis-siloxy dienes to elaborate the benzo system. A number of interesting analogues were synthesized using this protocol. They were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against the growth of breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. The potency of their cytotoxicity was found to be consistent with their ability to degrade the oncogenic protein, Her2. From these assays, cycloproparadicicol was identified as a most promising candidate for further development.
