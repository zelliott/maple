To construct an eukaryotic coexpression vector containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock protein 70 (mtHSP70) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) controlled by cytomegalovirus promoter using pIRES-EGFP vector.

The mtHSP70 gene fragment was amplified by PCR from pVAX-mtHSP70-HSV2gD using specific primers. The PCR product was cloned into the vector pMD 18-T vector, and the correct clone was selected according to DNA sequence analysis. The interested mtHSP70 gene fragment was subcloned into pCMV-IRES-EGFP vector with XhoI and EcoR I digestion. The recombinant plasmid was transfected into mouse melanoma B16 cell line, and the green fluorescent cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy and mtHSP70 expression was detected by Western blotting.

The recombinant plasmid obtained was confirmed by enzyme digestion. The transfected mouse melanoma B16 cells exhibited green fluorescence under fluorescence microscopy and expressed mtHSP70 protein as demonstrated by Western blotting.

The eukaryotic coexpression vector PCMV-mtHSP70-IRES-EGFP has been established to allow further investigation of the role of mtHSP70 gene in tumor immunotherapy.
