Two approaches have been developed to construct plasmids that mediate RNA interference to inhibit the replication and expression of HBV in 2.2.15 cell. The overlapping PCR extension and restriction enzyme-digestion were used to generate DNA fragments encoding designed shRNA based on sequences of ORF C of HBV genome. The pU6 derived vectors were constructed to develop plasmid based shRNA delivery systems termed pU6/HBVi. There were significant reductions in the expression of HBsAg and HBeAg between cells transfected with pU6/HBVi and control groups (as to HBsAg: P < 0. 01; and HBeAg: P < 0. 01). Consistently, the HBV DNA copies were reduced from 2.71 x 10(7) to <5 x 10(2) copies with or without pU6/HBVi. These results suggested that shRNA delivery by recombinant plasmids harboring shRNA encoding DNA fragment of interest generated either by overlapping PCR extension or restriction enzyme-digestion, could inhibit expressions of viral proteins and reduce viral replications. The pU6 derived plasmids might be a useful shRNA delivery system in mammalian cells. In addition, we found siRNA based on stealth 2311 was a potent RNAi target of HBV genome.
