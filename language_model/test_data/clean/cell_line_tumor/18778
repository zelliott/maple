This work reports significant advances on the transport in hepatic cells of resveratrol, a natural polyphenol with potent protective properties. First, we describe a new simple technique to qualitatively follow resveratrol cell uptake and intracellular distribution, based on resveratrol fluorescent properties. Second, the time-course study and the quantification of (3)H-labelled resveratrol uptake have been performed using human hepatic derived cells (HepG2 tumor cells) and hepatocytes. The temperature-dependence of the kinetics of uptake as well as the cis-inhibition experiments agree with the involvement of a carrier-mediated transport in addition to passive diffusion. The decrease of passive uptake resulting from resveratrol binding to serum proteins brings to light a mediated mechanism in physiological situation.
