CpG oligodeoxynucleotides have been previously shown to enhance antimycobacterial response in human monocytes/macrophages. The present study reports evidences showing the capability of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides to induce (i) host phospholipase D (PLD) activation, (ii) PLD dependent reactive oxygen intermediate production, (iii) PLD dependent phagolysosome maturation and (iv) PLD dependent intracellular mycobacterial killing in type II alveolar epithelial cells. These are the first evidences showing that alveolar epithelial cells may represent efficient effecter cells during primary innate antimycobacterial immune response.
