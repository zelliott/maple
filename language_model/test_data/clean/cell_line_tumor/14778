Targeted ultrasound (US) contrast agents represent, because of their size (1 to 5 Î¼m), a unique class of diagnostic imaging agents enabling true vascular imaging of conditions like inflammation and tumor angiogenesis. The objective of this study was to develop technology for preparing targeted microbubbles with binding and acoustic properties compatible with diagnostic use. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) was shown to represent the most favorable wall material. Various thiolated peptide binders were effectively conjugated to PC-based microbubbles containing maleimide functionalized lipids (95:5) without the need for biotin-streptavidin or antibody technology. By optimizing the technology, specific targeting of the inflammatory target E-selectin and the angiogenic target VEGFR2 in the presence of 100% serum was achieved. Increased phospholipid chain length from 18 carbons to 22 carbons improved the stability of the microbubbles during US exposure, without compromising binding or acoustic properties.
