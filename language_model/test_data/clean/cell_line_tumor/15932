NK cell activation is negatively regulated by the expression of target cell MHC class I molecules. We show that this relationship is nonlinear due to an NK cell activation/inhibition threshold. Ewing's sarcoma family tumor cell monolayers, which were highly susceptible to NK cells in vitro, developed a highly resistant phenotype when cultured as three-dimensional multicellular tumor spheroid structures. This suggested that tumor architecture is likely to influence the susceptibility to NK cells in vivo. Resistance of the multicellular tumor spheroid was associated with the increased expression of MHC class I molecules and greatly reduced NK cell activation, implying that a threshold of NK cell activation/inhibition had been crossed. Reducing MHC class I expression on Ewing's sarcoma family tumor monolayers did not alter their susceptibility to NK cells, whereas increased expression of MHC class I rendered them resistant and allowed the threshold point to be identified. This threshold, as defined by MHC class I expression, was predictive of the number of NK-resistant target cells within a population. A threshold permits modest changes in the target cell surface phenotype to profoundly alter the susceptibility to NK cells. Whereas this allows for the efficient detection of target cells, it also provides a route for pathogens and tumors to evade NK cell attack.
