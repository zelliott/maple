CD28 signals contribute to either type 1 or type 2 T cell differentiation. Here, we show that administration of B7.2-Ig fusion proteins to tumor-bearing mice induces tumor regression by promoting the differentiation of antitumor type 2 CD8(+) effector T cells along with IL-4 production. B7.2-Ig-mediated regression was not induced in IL-4(-/-) and STAT6(-/-) mice. However, it was elicited in IFN-gamma(-/-) and STAT4(-/-) mice. By contrast, IL-12-induced tumor regression occurred in IL-4(-/-) and STAT6(-/-) mice, but not in IFN-gamma(-/-) and STAT4(-/-) mice. Moreover, B7.2-Ig treatment was effective in a tumor model not responsive to IL-12. B7.2-Ig administration elicited elevated levels of IL-4 production. Tumor regression was predominantly mediated by CD8(+) T cells, although the induction of these effector cells required CD4(+) T cells. Tumor regression induced by CD8(+) T cells alone was inhibited by neutralizing the IL-4 produced during B7.2-Ig treatment. Thus, these results indicate that stimulation in vivo of CD28 with B7.2-Ig in tumor-bearing mice results in enhanced induction of antitumor type 2 CD8(+) T cells (Tc2) leading to Tc2-mediated tumor regression.
