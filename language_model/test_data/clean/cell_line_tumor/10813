To compare the effect of R- and S-enantiomers of equol on the motility and invasion in human prostate cancer cells PC3 and DU145.

Wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay were performed to assess the cell motility and invasion. Gelatin zymography and RT-PCR assay were performed to assess the related protein activity and mRNA expression.

R-(+) equol and S-(-)equol inhibited motility and invasion in PC3 and DU145 cells, separately. The results were more obvious in PC3 cells, and effect of R-(+) equol was stronger than its enantiomer S-(-) equol. MMP-2, MMP-9, the crucial members in metastasis, were found down-regulated by R-(+)equol and S-(-)equol. Subsequently, the estrogen receptor-alpha was activated by R-(+) equol, while no such effect on estrogen receptor-beta was observed.

R-(+) equol and S-(-) equol inhibited motility and invasion in PC3 and DU145 cells, while the most strong effect was observed in PC3 cells by R-(+) equol, which might regulated by the activation of estrogen receptor-alpha.
