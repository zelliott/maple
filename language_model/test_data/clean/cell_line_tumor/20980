Oxazole-containing macrocycles, which include the natural product telomestatin, represent a promising class of anticancer agents that target G-quadruplex DNA. Two synthetic hexaoxazole-containing macrocyclic compounds (HXDV and HXLV-AC) have been characterized with regard to their cytotoxic activities versus human cancer cells, as well as the mode, thermodynamics, and specificity with which they bind to the intramolecular (3+1) G-quadruplex structural motif formed in the presence of K+ ions by human telomeric DNA. Both compounds exhibit cytotoxic activities versus human lymphoblast (RPMI 8402) and oral carcinoma (KB3-1) cells, with associated IC50 values ranging from 0.4 to 0.9microM. The compounds bind solely to the quadruplex nucleic acid form, but not to the duplex or triplex form. Binding to the quadruplex is associated with a stoichiometry of two ligand molecules per DNA molecule, with one ligand molecule binding to each end of the host quadruplex via a nonintercalative "terminal capping" mode of interaction. For both compounds, quadruplex binding is primarily entropy driven, while also being associated with a negative change in heat capacity. These thermodynamic properties reflect contributions from favorable ligand-induced alterations in the loop configurational entropies of the quadruplex, but not from changes in net hydration. The stoichiometry and mode of binding revealed by our studies have profound implications with regard to the number of ligand molecules that can potentially bind the 3-overhang region of human telomeric DNA.
