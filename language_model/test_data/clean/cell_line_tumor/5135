The transcriptional regulation of the major histocompatibility complex class (MHC) Ib gene HLA-G differs from the classical MHC class I genes. The cis-acting regulatory elements typical for classical MHC class I promoters are divergent in the promoter of HLA-G, rendering this gene unresponsive to NF-kappaB, IRF-1, and class II transactivator (CIITA)-mediated activation pathways. However, as we have previously shown, transactivation of HLA-G is regulated by CREB-1. Because CREB-1 is ubiquitously expressed, this observation does not explain the tissue-restricted expression of HLA-G in extravillous cytotrophoblasts. Using HLA-G-expressing JEG-3 cells and HLA-G-deficient JAR trophoblast-derived choriocarcinoma cells as a model, we have investigated the contribution of DNA methylation and histone acetylation in the transcriptional activation of HLA-G. Despite similar levels of DNA methylation both in JEG3 and JAR cells, we found the levels of histone acetylation in HLA-G promoter chromatin to be significantly enhanced in JEG3 cells coinciding with HLA-G expression.
