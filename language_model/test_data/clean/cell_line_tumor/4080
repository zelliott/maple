Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recently, accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play prominent roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here, we confirmed that miR-25 was significantly increased in human GC tissues and cell lines. Forced expression of miR-25 remarkably enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in GC cells, whereas inhibition of miR-25 by inhibitor caused significant suppression of proliferation and significant increase of apoptosis. Moreover, inhibition of miR-25 significantly decreased migration and invasion of GC cells. Finally, reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) was found to be a target of miR-25. Overexpression of RECK could significantly reverse the oncogenic effect of miR-25. Taken together, miR-25 might promote GC cells growth and motility partially by targeting RECK.
