Nitric oxide (NO) is a diatomic free radical molecule that has been implicated in tumour angiogenesis and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the mechanism underlying the effect of NO on tumour spread remains largely unknown. Tumour lymphangiogenesis has recently received considerable attention and there is increasing evidence that it is relevant for metastasis to lymph nodes in HNSCC. Here, we study the correlation between inducible NOS synthase (iNOS) activity and lymphangiogenesis in a series of 60 HNSCCs and the possible involvement of the lymphangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C. HNSCC presenting with lymph node metastasis had a significantly higher lymphatic vessel density in both the tumour mass and the peritumour area (p = 0.006 and p = 0.001, respectively). Similarly, tumours with lymph node metastasis showed greater lymphatic vessel area than tumours with no lymph node involvement (p = 0.001 for intratumour lymphatics and p < 0.001 for peritumour lymphatics). iNOS activity measured in specimens from the tumour periphery correlated strongly with both lymphatic vessel density and lymphatic vessel area (p = 0.01, rs = 0.45 and p < 0.001, rs = 0.725, respectively). Conversely, these correlations were not observed in specimens from the tumour core. In addition, VEGF-C mRNA expression was significantly elevated in tumours with high iNOS activity (p = 0.008, rs = 0.563), and VEGF-C expression correlated positively with the presence of lymph node metastases (p = 0.03). In vitro, in the A431 human squamous carcinoma cell line, exogenous and endogenous stimulation of the iNOS pathway led to up-regulation of VEGF-C, which was blocked by the NOS inhibitor L-NNA. Taken together, our results indicate that iNOS activity may promote lymphangiogenesis and spread to lymph nodes in HNSCC, with the possible involvement of VEGF-C.
