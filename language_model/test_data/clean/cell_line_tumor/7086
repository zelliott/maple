Gemcitabine is a deoxycytidine analog, which can be inactivated by deamination catalyzed by deoxycytidine deaminase (dCDA). Altered transport over the cell membrane is a mechanism of resistance to gemcitabine. To facilitate accumulation, the fatty acid derivative CP-4125 was synthesized. Since, the fatty acid is acylated at the site of action of dCDA, a decreased deamination was expected. CP-4125 was equally active as gemcitabine in a panel of rodent and human cell lines and in human melanoma xenografts bearing mice. In contrast to gemcitabine, CP-4125 was not deaminated but inhibited deamination of deoxycytidine and gemcitabine. Pools of the active triphosphate of gemcitabine increased for over 20 hr after CP-4125 exposure, while these pools decreased directly after removal of gemcitabine.

CP-4125 is an interesting new gemcitabine derivative.
