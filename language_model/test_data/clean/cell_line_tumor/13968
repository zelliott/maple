The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K is an ancient RNA/DNA-binding protein that is involved in multiple processes that compose gene expression. The pleiotropic action of K protein reflects its ability to interact with different classes of factors, interactions that are regulated by extracellular signals. We used affinity purification and MS to better define the repertoire of K protein partners. We identified a large number of new K protein partners, some typically found in subcellular compartments, such as plasma membrane, where K protein has not previously been seen. Electron microscopy showed K protein in the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, and in vicinity of plasma membrane. These observations greatly expanded the view of the landscape of K protein-protein interaction and provide new opportunities to explore signal transduction and gene expression in several subcellular compartments.
