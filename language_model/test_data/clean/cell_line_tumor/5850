Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), an intracellular serine/threonine kinase, is implicated in cell growth and survival, cell-cycle progression, tumor angiogenesis, and cell apoptosis. Recent studies showed that the expression and activity of ILK increased significantly in many types of solid tumors. However, the exact molecular mechanism of ILK underlie tumor has not been fully ascertained. The purpose of our study was to determine whether knockdown of ILK would inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in bladder cancer cells using a plasmid vector based small interfering RNA (siRNA). The experiments showed that knockdown of ILK could remarkably inhibit cell proliferation and growth, regulate cell cycle and induce apoptosis of bladder cancer BIU-87 and EJ cells. We demonstrated that knockdown of ILK inhibited phosphorylation of downstream signaling targets protein kinase B/Akt, glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3β), and reduced expression of β-catenin in BIU-87 as well as EJ cells by Western blot and Immunofluorescence analysis. In addition, down-regulation of ILK also could increase expression of Ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), an important acidic cytoplasmic protein with many functions. BALB/C nude mice injected with the BIU-87 cells transfected ILK siRNA showed a significant inhibition of the tumor growth with lighter tumor weight, lower microvessels density and higher apoptosis rate than those in the other two control groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that ILK might be involved in the development of bladder cancer, and could be served as a novel potential therapy target for human bladder cancer. Our study may be of biological and clinical importance.
