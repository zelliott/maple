Rat ortholog of human CRM1 has been found to be responsible for the poor activity of viral Rex protein, which is essential for RNA export of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Here, we examined the species-specific barrier of HTLV-1 by establishing rat cell lines, including both adherent and CD4(+) T cells, which express human CRM1 at physiological levels. We demonstrated that expression of human CRM1 in rat cells is not harmful to cell growth and is sufficient to restore the synthesis of the viral structural proteins, Gag and Env, at levels similar to those in human cells. Gag precursor proteins were efficiently processed to the mature forms in rat cells and released into the culture medium as sedimentable viral particles. An HTLV-1 pseudovirus infection system suggested that the released virus particles are fully infectious. Our newly developed reporter cell system revealed that Env proteins produced in rat cells are fully fusogenic, which is the basis for cell-cell HTLV-1 infection. Moreover, we show that the early steps in infection, from post-entry uncoating to integration into the host chromosomes, occur efficiently in rat cells. These results, in conjunction with reports describing efficient entry of HTLV-1 into rat cells, may indicate that HTLV-1 is unique in that its major species-specific barrier is determined by CRM1 at a viral RNA export step. These observations will enable us to construct a transgenic rat model expressing human CRM1 that is sensitive to HTLV-1 infection.
