As a rule, T cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia runs a chronic clinical course without need for therapy. Some cases, however, progress to an aggressive disease after the indolent clinical stage. The transformation mechanism into a high-grade malignancy has not been well studied. We have established 2 leukemia cell lines, MOTN-1 and PLT-2, derived from the same clone of CD56+ T-LGL leukemia in chronic and aggressive phases, respectively. The paired availability of such cell lines is valuable in biologic and genetic investigation of T-LGL leukemia. We used a microarray containing 406 cDNAs to elucidate alterations of gene expression between the 2 cell lines. We found a number of genes that were differentially expressed: 13 genes with increased expression and 3 genes with reduced expression in PLT-2 cells as compared to MOTN-1 cells. Increased expression of the dek, rac, Op18, CD6, CD58, CD106, Id2, ATF4, IRF5, ELL2 and D6 genes, and reduced expression of the GzmA and GzmK genes were confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, whose results paralleled the microarray data. These upregulated genes encode oncoproteins, cell surface antigens including molecules related to T cell proliferation, transcription factors, and a chemokine receptor. The two downregulated genes encode granzymes that play an important role for induction of cell death. These findings suggest that there is differential gene expression in different clinical phases of T-LGL leukemia and these differentially expressed genes would be potential targets for further studies to identify the genes involved in the transformation process of T-LGL leukemia.
