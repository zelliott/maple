C6 glioma cells and an intramedullary spinal cord tumor model were used to evaluate the effect of bevacizumab (Avastin) or temozolomide (TMZ).

In this study, we hypothesized that treatment with bevacizumab accelerates the therapeutic effect of TMZ on intramedullary gliomas in an animal model.

Recently therapies for the management of intramedullary malignant gliomas include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Concurrent or adjuvant TMZ has been considered an emerging new treatment for intramedullary malignant gliomas; however, high-dose application of TMZ has limitation of side effect.

C6 glioma cells were injected into the T5 level of the spinal cord, and TMZ and bevacizumab were administered 5 days after C6 inoculation (n = 7 for each group). Tumor size was analyzed using histology and magnetic resonance imaging at 13 days after tumor inoculation.

Histological analyses and magnetic resonance imaging findings showed that combined treatment with TMZ and bevacizumab reduced tumor mass. The tumor volume of control group was 2.8-fold higher than combined therapy (P < 0.05). Neurological outcomes demonstrated that combined therapy improved hind limb function more than TMZ-alone group or control group (P < 0.05).

This study shows that bevacizumab could be useful in combination with TMZ to increase the therapeutic benefits of TMZ for intramedullary spinal cord tumors.
