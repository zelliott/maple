Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 2 (APOBEC2) is a member of the nucleic-acid-editing enzymes. However, the physiological function of APOBEC2 remains unclear. We demonstrate that APOBEC2 expression is strongly enhanced in response to both tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation invariably blocks TNF-alpha-induced APOBEC2 expression. The promoter region of APOBEC2 contains functional NF-kappaB response elements in the 5' untranslated region of the gene at -625/-616. These results show that APOBEC2 expression is regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-kappaB activation and suggest a possible role of APOBEC2 in the pathophysiology of hepatic inflammation.
