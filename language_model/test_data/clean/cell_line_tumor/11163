A series of 5-(alkyl(1H-indol-3-yl))-2-(substituted)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were efficiently synthesized by oxidative cyclisation of N'-benzylidene-(1H-indol-3-yl)alkane hydrazides using di(acetoxy)iodobenzene. N'-Benzylidene-(1H-indol-3-yl)alkane hydrazides themselves were derived from simple indole-3-carboxylic acids. The 5-(alkyl(1H-indol-3-yl))-2-(substituted)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities. Based on the results obtained structure and activity relationship (SAR) was established and a correlation between the activities was observed. Compound 6i and 6t showed best activity against proliferation of human cancer cell lines and as well as inflammation of rat paw edema.
