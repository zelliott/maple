The radial position of a gene within its chromosome territory (CT) in the interphase nucleus is thought to depend on the transcriptional activity of the gene and on transcriptional activity, gene density, and conformation of the chromosomal surrounding. In this study we analyzed the position of the cell cycle regulator gene p21 within the CT of human chromosome 6 (HSA6) upon transcriptional activation. Whereas the majority of active p21 genes is located in the interior of the CT of HSA6, induction of p21 transcription correlates with increased variation of gene localization within the CT and with a higher percentage of p21 genes located at the periphery of the CT. Additionally it demonstrates once more that transcription can take place throughout CTs. Comparison of the p21 locus with two non-coding regions on HSA6 showed that both non-coding sequences are located more frequently in the interior of the CT than p21 genes although they are situated in chromosomal neighborhoods with widely differing gene density and regional transcriptional activity. Thus our data support models describing an influence of the transcriptional activity of a gene on the localization within its CT. However, our data also indicate that additional factors such as chromatin remodeling are implicated in the positioning of genes within the respective chromosome territory.
