Recent studies have revealed a second class of gap-junction-forming proteins in vertebrates. These genes are termed pannexins, and it has been suggested that they perform similar functions as connexins. Pannexin1 is expressed in diverse tissues including the central nervous system and seems to form gap junction channels in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Since protein interacting partners have frequently been described for connexins, the most prominent family of gap junction forming proteins, we thus started to search for candidate genes of pannexin interacting partners. Kvbeta3, a protein belonging to the family of regulatory beta-subunits of the voltage-dependent potassium channels, was identified as a binding partner of pannexin1 in an E. coli two-hybrid system. This result was verified by confocal laser scanning microscopy using double transfected Neuro2A cells. The colocalization of both proteins at the plasma membrane is suggestive of functional interaction.
