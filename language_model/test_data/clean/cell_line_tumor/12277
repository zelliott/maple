MILL (MHC class I-like located near the leukocyte receptor complex) is a family of MHC class I-like molecules encoded outside the MHC, which displays the highest sequence similarity to human MICA/B molecules among known class I molecules. In the present study, we show that the two members of the mouse MILL family, MILL1 and MILL2, are GPI-anchored glycoproteins associated with beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) and that cell surface expression of MILL1 or MILL2 does not require functional TAP molecules. MILL1 and MILL2 molecules expressed in bacteria could be refolded in the presence of beta2m, without adding any peptides. Hence, neither MILL1 nor MILL2 is likely to be involved in the presentation of peptides. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that MILL1 is expressed in a subpopulation of thymic medullary epithelial cells and a restricted region of inner root sheaths in hair follicles. The present study provides additional evidence that MILL is a class I family distinct from MICA/B.
