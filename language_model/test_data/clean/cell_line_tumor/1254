Synthesis of coumarin 3-(N-aryl) sulfonamides was accomplished either by Knoevenagel condensation of anilinosulfonylacetic acids with suitable salicylaldehydes or by the reaction of methyl anilinosulfonylacetates with substituted salicylaldehydes in presence of a catalytic amount of a base. All the compounds tested for antiproliferative activity in different cancer cell lines have shown GI(50) values less than 100 microM.
