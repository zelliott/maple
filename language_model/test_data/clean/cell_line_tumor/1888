CD147, which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, is a multifunctional             glycoprotein that has been shown to increase tumor invasion, metastasis and multidrug             resistance. To define the role of CD147 in invasion and metastasis more precisely,             we utilized gene silencing to inhibit the expression of CD147 in pancreatic cancer             cells. We observed that CD147 expression was significantly impeded at both the             mRNA and protein levels and resulted in a decrease of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities.             There was also a decrease of MCT1 expression in the invasion and metastasis potential             of pancreatic cancer cells, as well as increased chemosensitivity to gemcitabine             in Panc-1 cells. Overall, these results suggest that CD147 plays an important             role in the invasion, metastasis and chemosensitivity of the human pancreatic             cancer cell line Panc-1, indicating that CD147 may be a promising therapeutic             target for pancreatic cancer.
