Hyperthermia is used to treat intraperitoneal colorectal carcinomatosis. In this setting, the molecular effects of oxaliplatin and hyperthermia, in combination and alone, were deciphered in ovarian and colon cancer cells. The combined antiproliferative effects of hyperthermia and oxaliplatin (Eloxatine) on human IGROV-1 ovarian carcinoma, Caco-2 and HT-29 colon carcinoma cell lines were investigated by cell viability test, cell cycle analysis and modulation of expression of cell cycle-related proteins. Oxaliplatin inhibited growth of all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. The efficacy of the drug was markedly enhanced by concurrent exposure to mild heat shock (1 h, 42 degree C). In IGROV-1 cells, a low concentration (15 microg/ml) of oxaliplatin in combination with hyperthermia induced a transient G2/M arrest. In both colon carcinoma cell lines, a G1/S arrest with a reduction of the G0/G1 population occurred. In IGROV-1 and Caco-2 cells, growth arrest was accompanied by apoptosis as suggested by the appearance of sub-G1 population. Time-course changes of cell cycle regulatory proteins levels revealed accumulation of cyclins A and B as well as of cdc2 and cdk2 upon exposure of IGROV-1 cells to hyperthermia and oxaliplatin. In this cell line, p53 appeared to be implicated in both G2/M arrest and apoptosis. G1/S arrest of HT-29 cells was linked to up-regulation of cyclin E and p27(Kip1) and accumulation of the hypophosphorylated form of pRB, whereas in Caco-2 cells only the hyperphosphorylated form was detected as well as a down-regulation of the proto-oncogene c-myc. Taken together, the results of these in vitro studies suggest that hyperthermia and oxaliplatin might elicit antiproliferative effects by modulating the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins through different signalling pathways.
