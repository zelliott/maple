Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone in teenagers             and approximately 30% of patients develop lung metastasis, which is the leading             cause of mortality. Recent studies suggest that the Ezrin protein is correlated             with the metastatic potential of several malignant tumors. In our study, ectopic             overexpression of miR-183 repressed the expression levels of Ezrin and significantly             inhibited the motility and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. This suggests that             miR-183 may possibly play a tumor suppressor role in the metastasis of osteosarcoma             by downregulating Ezrin expression levels. These findings show that through inhibition             of Ezrin expression levels, miR-183 is significantly involved in cell migration             and invasion of osteosarcoma.
