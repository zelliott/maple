Simian virus 40 (SV40) virus-like particles (VLPs) are efficient nanocarriers for gene delivery. VLPs conjugated to human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) were prepared and the cell selectivity of the VLP was examined using human epithelial carcinoma A431 cells, which overexpress the EGF receptor. The endocytic efficiency was determined by the level of Gaussia luciferase activity from the encapsulated protein in hEGF-conjugated VLPs. EGF receptor-mediated endocytosis of hEGF-conjugated VLPs was significantly increased and was confirmed by fluorescence imaging using mCherry encapsulated in hEGF-conjugated VLPs. These results suggest that VLPs of SV40 conjugated to a specific ligand could be used for cell selective gene delivery.
