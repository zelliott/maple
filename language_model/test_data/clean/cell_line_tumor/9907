Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a large family of cation channels, many of which are predominantly localized to the plasma membrane, where they transduce the effects of diverse and often sensory stimuli. Two members of the TRP melastatin subfamily, TRPM1 and TRPM2, are localized in intracellular compartments and are involved in melanin synthesis and oxidative stress-induced cell death, respectively. These findings provide new insight into the location and function of TRP channels.
