Since bacterial invasion into host cells is an important step in the infection process, using the agents to interfere with bacterial internalization is an attractive approach to block the infection process. In this work, we describe a new, previously unrecognized role of the human cationic host defense peptide HMGN2 during Klebsiella pneumoniae infections. Our results revealed that the internalization of K. pneumoniae strain 03183 into cultured bladder epithelial cells (T24) was significantly reduced at HMGN2 concentrations that were unable to produce any bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect. Using microarrays and follow-up studies, we demonstrated that HMGN2 affected the internalization of K. pneumoniae strain 03183 by inhibiting the attachment of bacteria, and then decreasing bacteria-induced ERK1/2 activation and actin polymerization, which might contribute to bacterial internalization into T24 cells. This disruption of bacterial internalization implied that HMGN2 could provide protection against K. pneumoniae infections.
