The biologic/cytotoxic effects of dispersed nanographene platelets (NGPs) on human osteosarcoma cells (MG63 cell line) were first studied by examining cell viability, cycle, apoptosis, change in morphology, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and inflammation. The results shown that the cell cytotoxicity of the dispersed NGPs exhibited dose-dependent characters, which had no obvious cytotoxic effects to MG63 cells at the concentration less than 10 μg mL(-1), whereas could postpone cell cycle, promote cell apoptosis, damage cell microstructure, induce serious tumor necrosis factor-α expression and greatly reduce ALP activity of MG63 cells at higher concentration of NGPs (>10 µg mL(-1)). Besides, NGPs had little influence on the LDH leakage. The cytotoxic mechanism of NGPs to MG63 cells was speculated to be intracellular activity with no physical damage of plasma membrane.
