To extract and isolate the component from myrsinane-type diterpenes of Euphorbia prolifera.

Petroleum extraction and chromatography on the silica gel were used to extract and isolate the diterpenes of Euphorbia prolifera.

Eight components of myrsinol diterpenes were isolated, namely: Proliferin A(1), Proliferin B (2), Proliferin C(3), Proliferin D(4), Euphorprolitherin B(5), Euphorprolitherin D(6), SPr5(7) and 14-desoxo-3-O-prorionyl-5, 15-di-O-acetyl-7-O-nicotinoyl-myrsinol-14β-acetate(8). Their structures were identified with mass-spectroscopic methods and NMR techniques. The cytotoxicity of compounds 1, 2, and 4 against cancer cells was evaluated, with compound 1 being active against A2780 cancer cells (IC(50) 7.7 μmol/L).

Myrsinane-type diterpene Proliferin A from Euphorbia prolifera shows cytotoxic effect against human ovarian cancer cell line A2780.
