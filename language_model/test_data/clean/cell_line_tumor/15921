Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common endocrine and thyroid malignancy.  The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) plays an important role in cancer pathogenesis, including breakdown of the extracellular matrix, invasion, and metastasis.  Additionally, there is increasing evidence that uPAR also promotes tumorigenesis via the modulation of multiple signaling pathways.  BRAFV600E, the most common initial genetic mutation in PTC, leads to ERK1/2 hyperphosphorylation, which has been shown in numerous cancers to induce uPAR.  Treatment of the BRAFV600E-positive PTC cell line, BCPAP, with the MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 reduced uPAR RNA levels by 90%.  siRNA-mediated down-regulation of uPAR in BCPAP cells resulted in greatly decreased activity in the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway.  This phenomenon was concurrent with drastically reduced proliferation rates and decreased clonigenic survival, as well as demonstrated senescence-associated nuclear morphology and induction of b-galactosidase activity. uPAR-knockdown BCPAP cells also displayed greatly reduced migration and invasion rates, as well as a complete loss of the cells' ability to augment their invasiveness following plasminogen supplementation. Taken together, these data provide new evidence of a novel role for uPAR induction (as a consequence of constitutive ERK1/2 activation) as a central component in PTC pathogenesis, and highlight the potential of uPAR as a therapeutic target.
