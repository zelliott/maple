Two types of novel nanogels were prepared using shell cross-linking of Pluronic F127 micelles with polyethylenimine (PEI) (F127/PEI nanogel), and penetrating network of poly(butylcyanoacrylate) (PBCA) in Pluronic F127 micelles (F127/PBCA nanogel). Poorly soluble anticancer drug, paclitaxel (PTX) and 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT), were used as model drugs and incorporated into nanogels. The results obtained from FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed that the drugs were molecularly dispersed in the nanogels. DLS measurements demonstrated that the nanogel size distribution was narrow with average diameter less than 200 nm. TEM images indicated that the nanogels were spherical in shape and had smooth surfaces. The drug-loaded nanogels showed sustained release profiles compared with the free drugs as revealed by in vitro release experiments. Cytotoxicity tests showed that the cytotoxicity of drug-loaded nanogels against cancer cell in vitro was much higher than that of the free drug. The data demonstrate that these novel nanogels improved stability towards dilution, increased solubility and showed better cellular uptake by cells compared with free drug.
