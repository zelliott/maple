Study regulatory mechanism of EB1089 for hepatocarcinoma cell proliferation.

HHCC were incubated in culture media with 100 nmol/L, 10 nmol/L and 1 nmol/L EB1089 for 2 d, 4 d and 6 d respectively. The anti-proliferative effect were examined by MTT and the plate clone forming test. The apoptosis was detected by Electron Microscope and flow cell device. Westernblot were used to detect p27Kipl and PTEN expression.

EB1089 could inhibit the proliferation of hepatocellular cell line HHCC. EB1089 could induce apoptosis of hepatocarcinoma cells. Western blot showed that EB1089 could elevate the expression level of p27Kipl and PTEN protein.

EB1089's inhibition to hepatocarcinoma is probably realized through inducing apoptosis of hepatocarcinoma cells and elevating the expression level of p27Kipl and PTEN protein.
