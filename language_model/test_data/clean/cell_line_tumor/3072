MC-C fibrosarcoma and B16F0 melanoma tumors were implanted intradermally in the dorsal region of the foot of mice. Tumor progression was compared to standard implantation in the flank. Although foot tumors only reached 13% (MC-C) and 25% (B16F0) of the mean volume of flank tumors, a more malignant phenotype in terms of histology and survival rate was observed in this type of tumors. Moreover, lung metastases were only detected in hosts bearing foot tumors, in contrast to MC-C and B16F0 populations with tumors growing in the flank. In addition, cellular influx and local immune reaction were higher in the dorsal region of the foot. According to our results, the dermis of the flank allows excessive tumor growth due to its low reactivity. Thus, differences in innate and adaptive immune effectors between the evaluated tumor microenvironments would account for the differences in tumor malignancy. Due to its striking differences with the standard flank inoculation, the tumor implantation model herein introduced could be a valuable tool to study the metastatic potential of different cell lines and the microenvironment components affecting tumor growth.
