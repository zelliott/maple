To identify the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) during gamma-ionizing radiation (gamma-IR) treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer cells.

Wild-type PTEN or mutant forms of PTEN plasmids were transfected to construct stable transfectants of the NCI-H1299 non-small-cell lung cancer cell line. Combined effects of PTEN expression and IR treatment were tested using immunoblot, clonogenic, and cell-counting assays. Related signaling pathways were studied with immunoblot and kinase assays.

At steady state, stable transfectants showed almost the same proliferation rate but had different AKT phosphorylation patterns. When treated with gamma-IR, wild-type PTEN transfectants showed higher levels of cell death compared with mock vector or mutant transfectants, and showed increased G(2)/M cell-cycle arrest accompanied by p21 induction and CDK1 inactivation. NCI-H1299 cells were treated with phosphosinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway inhibitor (LY29002), resulting in reduced AKT phosphorylation levels. Treatment of NCI-H1299 cells with LY29002 and gamma-IR resulted in increased cell-cycle arrest and p21 induction. Endogenous wild-type PTEN-containing NCI-H460 cells were treated with PTEN-specific siRNA and then irradiated with gamma-IR: however reduced PTEN levels did not induce cell-cycle arrest or p21 expression.

Taken together, these findings indicate that PTEN may modulate cell death or the cell cycle via AKT inactivation by PTEN and gamma-IR treatment. We also propose that a PTEN-PI3K/AKT-p21-CDK1 pathway could regulate cell death and the cell cycle by gamma-IR treatment.
