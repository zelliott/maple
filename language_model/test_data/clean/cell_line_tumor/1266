The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) CXCR4 is involved in bone marrow tropism and survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. The function of the GPCRs cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1) and CysLT2 remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that in CLL and normal B lymphocytes, CysLT1 mRNA is consistently expressed, in contrast to low CysLT2 levels. Similar to the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12, the cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) LTD(4) induces calcium fluxes, actin polymerization, and chemotaxis. These effects are blocked by specific CysLT1 antagonists. Their inhibition by pertussis toxin suggests Giα/o protein involvement. Furthermore, CysLT1 mediates MAP-kinase phosphorylation, which implicates contribution of cysLT to survival. Indeed, CysLT1 antagonists induce apoptosis and reduce viability independent of Gαi/o protein signaling. Considering the production of cysLTs in the bone marrow, our data suggest that CysLT1 induces chemokine-like effects, supports accumulation and survival of CLL cells in the bone marrow and thus represents a potential treatment target.
