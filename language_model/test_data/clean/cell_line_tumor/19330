Two new cycloartane glycosides were isolated from the whole herbs of Camptosorus sibiricus Rupr. By means of chemical and spectroscopic methods (IR, 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, ESI MS), the structures were established as (24R)-3beta, 7beta, 24, 25-tetrahydroxycycloartane 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-24-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1) and (24R)-3beta, 7beta, 24, 25-tetrahydroxycycloartane 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-24-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2). At the same time, two new compounds were tested for their cytotoxicities in vitro against human tumor cell lines (A375-S2, Hela).
