To investigate the reversal effect of Celecoxib and Taxol on multidrug resistance (MDR) human breast cancer cells (MCF-7/Taxol) and its underlying mechanism.

After establishing the resistance cell lines of human breast cancer on Taxol (MCF-7/Taxol), the effects of the drugs on the toxicity of MCF-7/Taxol cells and the reversal effect of Celecoxib on MDR were determined by CCK-8 assay. The cells were divided into seven groups (A: MCF-7; B: MCF-7/Taxol; C: MCF-7/Taxol + 0.03 microg/mL Taxol; D: MCF-7/ Taxol + 0 .03 microg/mL Taxol + 3 microg/mL Celecoxib; E: MCF-7/Taxol + 0.03 microg/mL Taxol-6 /g/mL Celecoxib; F: MCF-7/Taxol + 3 microg/mL Celecoxib; G: MCF-7/Taxol + 6 microg/mL Celecoxib). The mRNA levels of MDR1 and BCRP in these treated cells were also determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the protein levels of P-gp and BCRP in these treated cells were also determined by Western blot method.

Compared with the Taxol control, the cytotoxicity effects was obviously increased by combination of Taxol and Celecoxib (P < 0.05). Compared with the vehicle control, Taxol up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of P-gp, whereas Celecoxib down-regulated mRNA and protein levels of P-gp and BCRP (P < 0.05).

Celecoxib has reversal effect on MDR in MCF-7/Taxol cells, it's possible mechanism might be related to reduce the protein expression of COX-2, the inhibition of P-gp, BCRP mRNA and protein overexpression.
