Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) exhibit physical properties that render them ideal candidates for application as noninvasive mediators of photothermal cancer ablation. Here, we demonstrate that use of MWCNTs to generate heat in response to near-infrared radiation (NIR) results in thermal destruction of kidney cancer in vitro and in vivo. We document the thermal effects of the therapy through magnetic resonance temperature-mapping and heat shock protein-reactive immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrate that use of MWCNTs enables ablation of tumors with low laser powers (3 W/cm(2)) and very short treatment times (a single 30-sec treatment) with minimal local toxicity and no evident systemic toxicity. These treatment parameters resulted in complete ablation of tumors and a >3.5-month durable remission in 80% of mice treated with 100 microg of MWCNT. Use of MWCNTs with NIR may be effective in anticancer therapy.
