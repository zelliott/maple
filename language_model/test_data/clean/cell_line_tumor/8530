Alfa-calendic acid and β-calendic acid, geometric and positional isomers of linolenic acid were previously shown to possess potent anticancer properties. In this study, we found that α-calendic acid and β-calendic acid could induce apoptosis and suppress invasion of human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells in vitro. Treatment with α-calendic acid and β-calendic acid significantly increased oxidative stress in human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells detected by the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation production malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and the effects of antioxidants NAC and α-tocopherol. Furthermore, oxidative stress activated the phosphorylation of p38MAPK. SB203580, a selective p38MAPK inhibitor, blocked the apoptosis induced by α-calendic acid and β-calendic acid by upregulating Bcl-2/Bax ratio and inhibition of the activation of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9. SB20350 also partially abrogated the cell invasion effects of α-calendic acid and β-calendic acid. These results suggested that α-calendic acid and β-calendic acid induced apoptosis and inhibited invasion in JEG-3 cells by activation of oxidative stress pathways and subsequent activation of P38MAPK.
