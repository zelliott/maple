Biomaterial-based tissue-engineered tumor models are now widely used in cancer biology studies. However, specific methods for efficient and reliable cell seeding into these and tissue-engineering constructs used for regenerative medicine often remain poorly defined. Here, we describe a capillary force-based method for seeding the human prostate cancer cell lines M12 and LNCaP C4-2 into sphere-templated poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogels. The capillary force seeding method improved the cell number and distribution within the porous scaffolds compared to well-established protocols such as static and centrifugation seeding. Seeding efficiency was found to be strongly dependent on the rounded cell diameter relative to the pore diameter and pore interconnect size, parameters that can be controllably modulated during scaffold fabrication. Cell seeding efficiency was evaluated quantitatively using a PicoGreen DNA assay, which demonstrated some variation in cell retention using the capillary force method. When cultured within the porous hydrogels, both cell lines attached and proliferated within the network, but histology showed the formation of a necrotic zone by 7 days likely due to oxygen and nutrient diffusional limitations. The necrotic zone thickness was decreased by dynamically culturing cells in an orbital shaker. Proliferation analysis showed that despite a variable seeding efficiency, by 7 days in culture, scaffolds contained a roughly consistent number of cells as they proliferated to fill the pores of the scaffold. These studies demonstrate that sphere-templated polymeric scaffolds have the potential to serve as an adaptable cell culture substrate for engineering a three-dimensional prostate cancer model.
