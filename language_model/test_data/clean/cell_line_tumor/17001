Lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1, also known as KDM1) is a histone modifying enzyme that regulates the expression of many genes important in cancer progression and proliferation. It is present in various transcriptional complexes including those containing the estrogen receptor (ER). Indeed, inhibition of LSD1 activity and or expression has been shown to attenuate estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells in vitro, implicating this protein in the pathogenesis of cancer. Herein we describe experiments that utilize small molecule inhibitors, phenylcyclopropylamines, along with small interfering RNA to probe the role of LSD1 in breast cancer proliferation and in estrogen-dependent gene transcription. Surprisingly, whereas we have confirmed that inhibition of LSD1 strongly inhibits proliferation of breast cancer cells, we have determined that the cytostatic actions of LSD1 inhibition are not impacted by ER status. These data suggest that LSD1 may be a useful therapeutic target in several types of breast cancer; most notably, inhibitors of LSD1 may have utility in the treatment of ER-negative cancers for which there are minimal therapeutic options.
