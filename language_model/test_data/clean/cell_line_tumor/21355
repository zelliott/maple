Diffusion-weighted MRI is commonly used in the diagnosis and evaluation of ischemic stroke because of the rapid decrease observed in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of tissue water following ischemia. Although this observation has been clinically useful for many years, the biophysical mechanisms underlying the reduction of tissue ADC are still unknown. To help elucidate these mechanisms, we have employed a novel three-dimensional (3D) hollow-fiber bioreactor (HFBR) perfused cell culture system that enables cells to be grown to high density and studied via MRI and MRS. By infusing contrast media into the HFBR, signals from intracellular water and extracellular water are spectroscopically resolved and can be investigated individually. Diffusion measurements carried out on C6 glioma HFBR cell cultures indicate that ischemia-induced cellular swelling results in an increase in the ADC of intracellular water from 0.35 microm(2)/ms to approximately 0.5 microm(2)/ms (diffusion time = 25 ms).
