To observe the effects of ethanol extract of Rhizome Pinelliae Preparata on the intracellular pH value of human gastric cancer SGC7901 cells.

After coculturing SGC7901 cells with ethanol extract of Rhizome Pinelliae Preparata (1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 mg/mL), cell viability was evaluated by chromatometry with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining. Intracellular pH value of SGC7901 cells was measured in the monolayer by using the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe 2,7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester. The extracellular pH value of culture medium was measured by a pH211 Calibration Check Microprocessor pH Meter. Half-inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of ethanol extract culture to SGC7901 cells was decided by the MTT method and expressions of vacuolar-H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) and Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) mRNAs were examined by the method of fluorescence quantitative-polymerase chain reaction after 72 h of drug treatment.

Ethanol extract of Rhizome Pinelliae Preparata at different concentrations significantly inhibited the proliferation of SGC7901 cells, lowered the intracellular pH values and heightened the extracellular pH values. The IC(50) of 72 h culture was 0.5mg/mL and it inhibited the expressions of V-ATPase and NHE1 mRNAs.

Ethanol extract of Rhizome Pinelliae Preparata can lower down the intracellular pH value of SGC7901 cells. The mechanism may be related to inhibiting the expressions of V-ATPase and NHE1 mRNAs.
