Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection exhibits a very narrow host range and shows a strong tropism for liver parenchymal cells, however none of the previously established experimental models can reproduce the natural process of HBV infection. In the present study, primary human hepatocytes were fused with HepG2 cells to establish the hybrid HepCHLine-4 cell line with high susceptibility to HBV. The HepCHLine-4 cells expressed HBV-specific antigen when co-incubated with HBV-positive serum from a hepatitis B patient. Post-infection, HBV relaxed circular DNA and covalently closed circular DNA were detected in HepCHLine-4 cells using a nested polymerase chain reaction, and HBV-specific particles were visualized by electron microscopy of the culture media of HepCHLine-4 cells. HepG2 cells were not susceptible to HBV infection under the same conditions. The HepCHLine-4 cells can be sub-cultured for > 12 months while maintaining susceptibility to HBV and may, therefore, be useful for studying HBV infection and the viral life cycle in human hepatocytes.
