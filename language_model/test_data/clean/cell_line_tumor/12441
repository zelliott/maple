Single-chain ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) are cytotoxic components of macromolecular pharmaceutics for immunotherapy of cancer and other human diseases. Saporin belongs to a family of single-chain RIPs sharing sequence and structure homology. In a preliminary attempt to define an active saporin polypeptide of minimum size we have generated proteins with deletions at the N-terminus and at the C-terminus. An N-terminal (sapDelta1-20) deletion mutant of saporin displayed defective catalytic activity, drastically reduced cytotoxicity but increased ability to interact with liposomes inducing their permeabilization at low pH. A C-terminal (sapDelta239-253) deletion mutant showed instead a moderate reduction in cytotoxic activity. A substantial alteration of secondary structure was evidenced by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in the sapDelta1-20 mutant. It can be hypothesized that the defective functions of sapDelta1-20 are due to alterations of its spatial configuration.
