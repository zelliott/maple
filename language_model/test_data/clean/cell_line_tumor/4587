Evaluation of selective killing of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) expressing tumors by radiolabeled (131)I-fialuridine (FIAU), and of synergy between (131)I-FIAU and Ganciclovir (GCV).

HSV1-tk-expressing cell lines and parental cell lines were exposed to (131)I-FIAU alone, GCV alone, or combinations. Activity and concentration were varied widely, concurrent and sequential administrations tested, and dose rate effects were studied.

HSV1-tk-expressing cells accumulated up to 15.7-fold more (131)I-FIAU, were growth inhibited by 2 muCi/ml, or 5 muCi/ml (131)I-FIAU, and were inhibited by two log orders lower concentrations of GCV than parental cells. However, no synergy or additive effect was observed. Dose rate variations, or sequential treatment, did not alter outcome.

Radioisotope therapy of HSV1-tk-expressing tumor cells with (131)I-FIAU is reported for the first time. Lack of synergy between (131)I-FIAU and GCV does not warrant further investigation of combination treatment with the two agents.
