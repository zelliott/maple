The androgen receptor (AR) plays a pivotal role in the progression of prostate cancer from the androgen-dependent to the castration-resistant state, making it a potential target for therapy. In this chapter, we describe the preparation and use of sublines of LNCaP and C4-2 human prostate cancer cells which have been engineered to stably express a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible AR shRNA in order to study the in vitro and in vivo effects of AR knockdown.
