Going against tradition: although most kinase inhibitors are ATP competitive, lariat peptides inhibit Abl kinase activity in an ATP-uncompetitive manner. Further, lariat peptides discriminated Src family kinases, and recognize the allosteric region that lies adjacent to the ATP binding pocket in the Abl kinase catalytic cleft.
