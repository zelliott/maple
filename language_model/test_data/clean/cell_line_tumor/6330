Strategies using carbon-based nanomaterials as carriers for delivering chemotherapeutic drugs to cancers have been described well. Here a novel magnetic lymphatic-targeting drug-delivery system, based on functionalised carbon nanotubes (fCNTs), is presented with the aim of improving the outcome of cancer with lymph node involvement. The potential therapeutic effect of gemcitabine (GEM) loading magnetic multiwalled carbon nanotubes (mMWNTs) was compared with that of GEM loading magnetic-activated carbon particles (mACs) in vitro and in vivo. mMWNTs-GEM and mACs-GEM both had high anti-tumour activity in vitro similar to free drug. Subcutaneous administration of GEM loading magnetic nanoparticles resulted in successful regression and inhibition of lymph node metastasis under the magnetic field, with mMWNTs-GEM superior to mACs-GEM, and more effectively in the high-dose versus low-dose groups. The successful application of intra-lymphatic delivery of chemotherapeutics using mMWNTs highlights the clinical potential of fCNTs for future cancer metastasis treatment with high efficacy and minimum side-effects.
