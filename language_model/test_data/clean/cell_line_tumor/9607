Approximately 25% of patients with colorectal cancer will develop metastatic disease exclusively or largely confined to the liver, and the vast majority of these cases are not amenable to surgical resection. These unresectable cases of liver metastatic disease can be treated with isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP), which involves a method of complete vascular isolation of the liver to allow treatment of liver tumors with toxic systemic doses of chemotherapeutic agents. To improve the efficacy of IHP, hyperthermia and biological agents have been applied along with the chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated whether hyperthermia in combination with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) enhances mortality in human colorectal carcinoma CX-1 cells. Cells were treated with various concentrations of TRAIL (0-200 ng/ml) at various temperatures (40-46 degrees C) for 1 h and further incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence of TRAIL. We observed that hyperthermia at 42-43 degrees C effectively promoted TRAIL-induced apoptosis, as indicated by cell death, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3. In contrast, hyperthermia at 45-46 degrees C suppressed TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We also observed that mild hyperthermia, but not acute hyperthermia, promoted cytochrome c release during treatment with TRAIL. Our data suggest that promotion of cytochrome c release during mild hyperthermia is responsible for the enhancement of TRAIL cytotoxicity.
