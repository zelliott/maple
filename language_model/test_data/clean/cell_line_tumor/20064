Frequent somatic hotspot mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) have been identified in gliomas, acute myeloid leukemias, chondrosarcomas, and other cancers, providing a likely avenue for targeted cancer therapy. However, whether mutant IDH1 protein is required for maintaining IDH1 mutated tumor cell growth remains unknown. Here, using a genetically engineered inducible system, we report that selective suppression of endogenous mutant IDH1 expression in HT1080, a fibrosarcoma cell line with a native IDH1(R132C) heterozygous mutation, significantly inhibits cell proliferation and decreases clonogenic potential. Our findings offer insights into changes that may contribute to the inhibition of cell proliferation and offer a strong preclinical rationale for utilizing mutant IDH1 as a valid therapeutic target.
