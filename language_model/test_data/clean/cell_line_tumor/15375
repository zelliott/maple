Simultaneous suppression of multiple oncogenes is an attractive strategy to treat cancers. Herein we present a series of long double-stranded multiplex small interfering RNAs (multi-siRNAs) that is suitable for dual genes silencing through a sequence-specific RNA interference process without inducing significant immune responses. A gap feature structurally designed in either of the nucleotide strands of the multi-siRNAs was proved to be essential toward silencing target genes and avoiding immune responses. Furthermore, the silencing effect of multi-siRNAs against SURVIVIN and BCL-2 genes was shown to be effective and resulted in up-regulation of caspase-3 related apoptosis and, in turn, inhibition of bladder cancer cell proliferation. Our observation suggested that the rationally designed multi-siRNAs would have great potential for therapeutic siRNA design.
