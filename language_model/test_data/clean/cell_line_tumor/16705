Estrogens exert their effect through ERα and ERβ intracellular transcription factors and rapid, usually membrane-initiated receptors, influencing cytosolic signaling and transcription. The nature of extranuclear estrogen elements has not been elucidated so far; classical or alternatively transcribed ER isoforms (ERα36, ERα46) anchored to the plasma membrane and GPR30 (GPER1) have been reported to exert early estrogen actions. Here, we used E2-BSA, an impermeable estradiol analog for a transcriptome analysis in four GREP1 positive breast cancer cell lines with different estrogen receptor profiles (T47D, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3) in order to evaluate GPER1 transcriptional effects. Early effects of E2-BSA were assayed after 3h of incubation, in the absence/presence of ICI182,780 (ER-inhibitor) or G15 (GREP1-specific inhibitor). E2-BSA specifically modified 277-549 transcripts in the different cell lines. Two different clusters of transcripts could be identified: (1) the majority of transcripts were inhibited by both ICI182,780 and G15, suggesting an interaction of E2-BSA with a common ER-related element, or a direct ER-GPER1 interaction; (2) a small number of G15-only modified transcripts, in two cell lines (T47D and SKBR3 cells), indicative of specific GPER1-related effects. The latter transcripts were significantly related to pathways including FOXA2/FOXA3 transcription factor networks, RNA-Polymerases Transcription Regulation and lipid metabolism, while ICI/G15 inhibited transcripts affected pathways related to apoptosis, erythropoietin signaling, metabolic effects through the citric acid cycle, IL-4 and IL-5 mediated events and homologous DNA recombination. Finally, we review the current literature of GPER1 actions, in view of our results of ER-dependent and independent GPER1-modified pathways.
