A series of new 3,5-diaryl isoxazoline/isoxazole linked 2,3-dihydro quinazolinone hybrids with different linker architectures have been designed and synthesized. These compounds have been evaluated for their anticancer activity. One of the compounds 4c amongst this series has shown promising anticancer activity. Further some detailed biological assays relating to the cell cycle aspects and tubulin depolymerization activity have been examined with a view to understand the mechanism of action of this conjugate.
