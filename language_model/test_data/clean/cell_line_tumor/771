Previous studies indicated that treatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced phosphorylation of Ser-985 at the juxtamembrane of c-Met, the receptor tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and this was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met. However, the regulatory mechanisms and the biological significance of the Ser-985 phosphorylation in c-Met remain unknown. When A549 human lung cancer cells were exposed to oxidative stress with H(2)O(2), H(2)O(2) treatment induced phosphorylation of Ser-985, but this was abrogated by an inhibitor for protein kinase C (PKC). Likewise, treatment of cells with NaF (an inhibitor of protein phosphatases) allowed for phosphorylation of Ser-985, and a protein phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of Ser-985 was identified to be protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The effects of PKC inhibitors revealed that PKCdelta and -epsilon were responsible for the Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met, and pull-down analysis indicated that associations of PKCdelta and -epsilon with c-Met may be involved in the regulation of Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met. Instead, PP2A was constitutively associated with c-Met, whereas its activity to dephosphorylate Ser-985 of c-Met was decreased when cells were exposed to H(2)O(2). Addition of HGF to A549 cells in culture induced c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation, the result being mitogenic response and cell scattering. In contrast, in the presence of H(2)O(2) stress, HGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met was largely suppressed with a reciprocal relationship to Ser-985 phosphorylation, and this event was associated with abrogation of cellular responsiveness to HGF. These results indicate that Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met is bi-directionally regulated through PKC and PP2A, and the Ser-985 phosphorylation status may provide a unique mechanism that confers cellular responsiveness/unresponsivenss to HGF, depending on extracellular conditions.
