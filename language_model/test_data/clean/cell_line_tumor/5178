Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men. As cancer progresses from an androgen-sensitive stage to hormone-refractory stage, it turns resistant to androgen ablation therapy. At this stage, effective newer therapies that induce apoptosis are needed for treatment of prostate cancer. DNA oligonucleotides homologous to the telomere 3' overhang (T-oligo) induce apoptosis in several human cancer cells. In the present study, we studied the effect of T-oligo on prostate cancer cells. Our studies showed that androgen-independent DU-145 cells are sensitive to T-oligo in terms of inhibition of proliferation. Moreover, T-oligo induced DU-145 cells to undergo apoptosis. Therefore, our results are encouraging for further investigation in the potential application of T-oligo as a novel therapeutic approach for prostate cancer, especially the androgen-independent.
