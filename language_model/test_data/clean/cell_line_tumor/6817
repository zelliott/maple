Lung epithelial cells are the primary cellular targets for respiratory virus pathogens such as influenza and parainfluenza viruses. Here, we have analyzed influenza A, influenza B and Sendai virus-induced chemokine response in human A549 lung epithelial cells. Influenza virus infection resulted in low CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL8/IL-8 and CXCL10/IP-10 production at late times of infection. However, when cells were pretreated with TNF-alpha or IFN-alpha, influenza-A-virus-induced chemokine production was greatly enhanced. Cytokine pretreatment resulted in enhanced expression of RIG-I, IKKepsilon, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)1, IRF7 and p50 proteins. Most importantly, influenza-A-virus-induced DNA binding of IRF1, IRF3, IRF7 and NF-kappaB onto CXCL10 ISRE and NF-kappaB elements, respectively, was markedly enhanced in cytokine-pretreated cells. Our results suggest that IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha have a significant role in priming epithelial cells for higher cytokine and chemokine production in influenza A virus infection.
