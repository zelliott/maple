The primary aim of the study was to correlate pain development during bone cancer growth with objectively obtained tumor-induced changes in bone morphology. Additionally morphine sensitivity of this bone pain was evaluated. Mice were injected into the femur with osteolytic NCTC2472 cells, and behaviorally followed during a 3-week period. During the observation period increasing pain behavior was observed in tumor-bearing animals. Tumor mice exhibited spontaneous and movement-evoked lifting, the latter evoked through non-noxious palpation of the tumor. Limb use during forced ambulation on a rotarod decreased to substantial non-use of the affected limb by day 23. On day 23, micro-computer tomography scans of the tumor-bearing bones were evaluated for bone destruction. Different bone parameters indicative of osteolysis or fragmentation were significantly correlated with pain behavior. In a separate group of mice the effects of different morphine doses on pain behavior were evaluated on days 17 and 21 of tumor growth. Spontaneous lifting and movement-evoked lifting were sensitive to morphine treatment, although stress-induced analgesia due to repeated restraint might minimize movement-evoked lifting in mice. Limb use during forced ambulation was only slightly ameliorated by high morphine doses.
