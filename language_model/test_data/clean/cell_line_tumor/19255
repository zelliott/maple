Transduction and activation of an inducible form of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) sufficed to increase VIP (vasoactive intestinal protein) mRNA concentrations in neuroblastoma cells. Overexpression of SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling) inhibited and mutant SOCS3 (with an inactivating point mutation in amino acid 25) enhanced the induction of VIP mRNA by CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor). Because mutant SOCS3 did not augment the increase in STAT transcriptional activity following CNTF stimulation, the enhancement by mutant SOCS3 of the actions of CNTF cannot be attributed to changes in STAT3 signaling. Mutant SOCS3 increased AP-1 (activator protein) transcriptional activity and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activity and SOCS3 bound to the scaffolding protein, JNK-interacting protein-1: these observations provide a plausible explanation for the enhancement by mutant SOCS3 of the actions of CNTF. We conclude that endogenous SOCS3 inhibits AP-1 activity through blocking of JNK phosphorylation.
