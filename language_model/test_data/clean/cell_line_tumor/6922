6-Chloro-2-pyrrolidino-/morpholino-/piperidino-/N-methylpiperazino-3-formyl-chromones (13-16) and 6-fluoro-2,7-di-morpholino-/piperidino-/N-methylpiperazino-3-formylchromones (17-19) have been synthesized as potential topoisomerase inhibitor anticancer agents, and evaluated, in vitro, against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells, and also in vivo on EAC bearing mice. The compounds displayed promising anticancer activity under these test systems and shall serve as useful 'leads' for further design.
