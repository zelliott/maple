Studies have shown that microRNA-148a (miR-148a) was proved to be silenced while DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was over-expressed in gastric cancer. But the mechanism of aberrant expression of miR-148a and DNMT1 and their relationships in gastric cancer are still unknown. The aims of this study were to investigate the expression profile of miR-148a and DNMT1 and reveal whether they have any relationships. We used reverse-transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR, methylation-specific PCR and Western blot to measure the level of miR-148a expression, DNA methylation level and DNMT1 expression, respectively. Gastric cancer cells were transfected with plasmid or siRNA or treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by cell counting and flow cytometric analysis. In this study, we demonstrated that gastric cancer tissues and cell lines displayed a consistent down-regulation of miR-148a and hypermethylation of promoter region. DNMT1 was over-expressed in primary tumors and cell lines, while knockdown of DNMT1 using siRNA could decrease methylation level of miR-148a promoter and restore its expression. Furthermore, ectopic over-expression of miR-148a in cancer cell lines caused reduction in DNMT1 expression and inhibited cell proliferation, but no obvious change was found in apoptosis rate. These results suggest that miR-148a is inactivated by DNA hypermethylation of promoter region in gastric cancer, which is mediated through DNMT1 over-expression. Additionally, the silence of miR-148a reduces its suppression to DNMT1 in gastric cancer, and this may in turn result in over-expression of DNMT1 and promote DNA hypermethylation.
