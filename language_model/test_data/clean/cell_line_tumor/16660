The purpose of this inÂ vitro study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of a new bioceramic root repair material, EndoSequence Root Repair Material (ESRRM; Brasseler USA, Savannah, GA), and to compare these characteristics with those of ProRoot MTA (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK) and Geristore (GR; Den-Mat LLC, Santa Maria, CA).

Human Saos-2 osteoblast-like cells were exposed to 1-, 3-, and 7-day elutes of the materials (100% and 50% strength) for 24 hours after which the bioactivity and ALP activity of the cells were evaluated using a methylthiazol sulfophenyl (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay and para-Nitrophenylphosphate colorimetric assay, respectively. In the positive control group, Triton X-100 (Boehringer Mannheim Corp, Indianapolis, IN) was used to lyse the cells, representing 100% cytotoxicity, and in the negative control group cells received fresh culture medium only. Data were statistically analyzed using the unpaired t test and 1-way analysis of variance.

The results revealed that the bioactivity of the cells as well as ALP activity were significantly decreased after exposure to ESRRM elutes in almost all time periods, both in 100% and 50% concentrations, with the exception of ALP activity of day 1 elutes of ESRRM at 50% concentration. MTA did not change the bioactivity or ALP activity of the cells. GR elutes of 100% concentration reduced the bioactivity on days 1 and 3, whereas GR elutes of 50% concentration affected the cells only on day 1. None of the GR elutes had any effect on ALP activity of the cells.

It was concluded that ESRRM elutes of all time periods in general reduced the bioactivity and ALP activity of osteoblast-like cells. GR reduced bioactivity only, whereas MTA had no effect on the cells.
