A series of potential DNA-binding antitumor agents, 2-[omega-(alkylamino)alkyl]-9-methoxy-5-nitro-2,6-dihydroindazolo[4,3-bc][1,5]naphthyridines (2a-f), 10-aza derivatives of PZA, has been prepared by condensation of 9-chloro-2-methoxy-6-nitro-5,10-dihydrobenzo[b][1,5]naphthyridin-10-one (6) with the appropriate (omega-aminoalkyl)hydrazine in tetrahydrofuran/methanol. Compound 6 was obtained by heating at 100 degrees C in H(2)SO(4)5, yielded by the condensation of 2,6-dichloro-3-nitrobenzoic acid (4) and 6-methoxy-3-pyridinamine (3). The non-covalent DNA-binding properties of 2 have been examined using a fluorometric technique. In vitro cytotoxic potencies of these derivatives against human hormone-refractory prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (PC-3) are described and compared to that of parent drug PZA. We selected the most cytotoxic target derivatives 2c,d, the in vitro inactive 2f, and reference compound PZA to investigate whether in vitro treatment with these drugs was able to induce necrotic and/or apoptotic cell death. To this purpose, we evaluated the percentage of apoptotic cells in PC-3 treated with the target compounds 2c,d,f and reference compound PZA, by Annexin V staining and Propidium iodide (PI)/Annexin V, biparametric flow cytometric analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis.
