Epi-C3-cryptophycin-24, epi-C3-m-chlorobenzyl-cryptophycin-24, and the corresponding styrenes were synthesized and tested in vitro against the MCF-7 and multidrug-resistant MCF-7/ADR breast cancer cell lines and in an in vitro tubulin assembly assay. The results demonstrate that the S configuration at the C3 stereocenter is not required to induce potent cytotoxicity and the m-Cl substituent present on the C10 side chain did not induce any large change in activity.
