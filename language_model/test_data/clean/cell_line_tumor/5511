To investigate the effect of ginsenoside Rg3 on the apoptosis and survivin expression in human lung squamous cell carcinoma cell line SK-MES-1.

SK-MES-1 cells were divided into Rg3 treatment group, blank control group and positive control (arsenic trioxide) group. The apoptotic rate of the cells in each group was determined using flow cytometry, and the expression of survivin protein and mRNA was detected by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR, respectively.

A 48-h treatment with Ginsenoside Rg3 induced increased apoptotic rate of SK-MES-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Ginsenoside Rg3 significantly downregulated the expressions of survivin protein and mRNA as compared with the expression levels in the blank control group ( p<0.05).

Ginsenoside Rg3 can induce the apoptosis of SK-MES-1 cells, the mechanism of which may involve inhibited survivin expression.
