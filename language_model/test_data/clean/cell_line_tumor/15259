Cisplatin-(DDP)-based adjuvant chemotherapy is widely used for the treatment of esophageal cancer. However, DDP-based combinatorial treatments can eventually result in tumor resistance response. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies and/or new adjuvant drugs still need to be explored. In this study, we aimed to understand the role of autophagy in ESCC cells resistance to Cisplatin and discuss its potential therapeutic implication. We found that exposure to Cisplatin induced a significant increase in LC3 formation. While the proliferation of ESCC cells was inhibited upon Cisplatin exposure, inhibition of autophagy by ATG7 interference further increased the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Meanwhile, the Cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death was significantly enhanced. These results suggest that autophagy may function importantly in ESCC cells resistance to Cisplatin. Intriguingly, the resistance could be recovered by autophagy inhibition. This also points to potential therapy for ESCC by perturbing autophagy.
