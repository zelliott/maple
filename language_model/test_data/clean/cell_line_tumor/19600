The Kr√ºppel-like transcription factor KLF6 is a novel tumor-suppressor gene. It was inactivated in human prostate cancer and other tumors tissue, as the result of frequent mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). However, there is no data reporting the levels of KLF6 both mRNA and protein in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). We therefore detected mutations and expression of KLF6 in HCC tissues and further observed the effect of it on cell growth in HCC cell lines.

We analyzed the exon-2 of KLF6 gene by direct DNA sequencing, and detected the expression of KLF6 by RT-PCR and Western blot in 23 HCC tissues and corresponding nontumorous tissues. Loss of growth suppressive effect of the HCC-derived KLF6 mutant was characterized by in vitro growth curves plotted, flow cytometry and Western blotting.

KLF6 mutations were found in 2 of 23 HCC tissues and one of mutations was missense. Expression of KLF6 mRNA or protein was down-regulated in 8 (34.7%) or 9 (39.1%) of 23 HCC tissues. Wild-type KLF6 (wtKLF6) inhibited cellular proliferation and prolonged G1-S transition by inducing the expression of p21WAF1 following stable transfection into cultured HepG2 cells, but tumor-derived KLF6 mutant (mKLF6) had no effects.

Our findings suggest that KLF6 may be involved in pathogenesis of HCC.
