We evaluated the anti-tumor effect of adenoviral vector-mediated p53 gene therapy on the growth of canine osteosarcoma xenografts formed in nude mice. Nude mice were subcutaneously transplanted with cells of 2 P53 mutant canine osteosarcoma cell lines, POS and CHOS. The osteosarcoma xenografts were injected with either an adenoviral vector that expresses canine wild-type P53 (AxCA-cp53) or LacZ (AxCA-LacZ). Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in the xenografts injected with AxCA-cp53 in comparison to those injected with AxCA-LacZ or PBS during the observation period of 27 days. An increase of the amount of p21(WAF1/CDKN1A) mRNA, and the number of apoptotic cells was shown in the tumors injected with AxCA-cp53 in comparison to those injected with AxCA-LacZ or PBS. The present study revealed that the adenoviral vector-mediated p53 gene transfer had an anti-tumor effect in canine osteosarcoma xenografts formed in nude mice.
