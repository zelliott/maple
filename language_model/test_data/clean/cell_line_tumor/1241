Two new metabolites, the cyclo-(L-Phe-L-Leu1-L-Leu2-L-Leu3-L-Ile) (1) and (3S,4R)-dihydroxy-(6S)-undecyl-alpha-pyranone (2) have been produced by the endophytic fungus no. 2524 isolated from a seed of mangrove Avicennia marina in Hong Kong. The structures have been elucidated by spectra including two-dimensional NMR, ESI tandem mass spectrometry and CD. These compounds show no activity toward human cancer cell lines Bel-7402, NCI-4460 and the normal human cell lines L-02.
