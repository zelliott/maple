To investigate the effect of Astragalus mongholicus injection on proliferation and apoptosis in hormone sensitive breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) with physiological dose E2.

Cell control group, TAM control group and five different dose Astragalus mongholicus injection groups with physiological dose E2 were set in the study. Proliferation of MCF-7 cells were evaluated with MTT assay, cell apoptotic rate were measured with flow cytometry, DNA ladder and cell cycle were observed.

In physiological dose E2, Astragalus mongholicus injection inhibited MCF-7 cells proliferation at all concentration groups. As time lasting, Astragalus mongholicus injection showed better inhibitory effect than TAM ( p<0.05). Among 2 x 10(-1) g/mL-2 x 10(-4) g/mL concentration, Astragalus mongholicus injection significantly increased the proliferative percent of G0/G1 and S-phase cell, decreased percent of G2-M phase cell ( p<0.05) at 24 hours. After cocultured 72 hours, Astragalus mongholicus injection increased the rate of apoptosis to 16.7% at 2 x 10(-1) g/mL concentration.

In some dose limit, Astragalus mongholicus injection may inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis and interrupt caryocinesia at G0-G1 phase or S phase in hormone sensitive (MCF-7) breast cancer cell lines with physiological dose E2.
