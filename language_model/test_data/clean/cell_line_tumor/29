Ampelopsis cantoniensis (AC) has been used as a folk medicine for reducing pain in the Taiwanese population. Our previous studies have shown that the crude extract of AC induced apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. In this study, the in vivo effects of AC on leukemia WEHI-3 cells and immune responses such as phagocytosis and natural killer (NK) cell activity were investigated. The weights of the livers and spleens were decreased in the AC-treated groups compared to the control groups. The AC treatment increased the percentage of CD3 and CD19 marker cells in WEHI-3-injected mice, indicating that the precursors of T and B cells were inhibited. The AC treatment promoted the activity of macrophage phagocytosis in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and peritoneal cells. It was found that the NK cells from mice after treatment with AC can kill the YAC-1 target cells. Therefore, the AC treatment increased NK cell activity. In conclusion, AC can affect WEHI-3 cells in vivo and promote macrophage and NK cell activities.
