Extended studies on the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of (RS)-6-substituted-7 or 9-(2,3-dihydro-5H-1,4-benzodioxepin-3-yl)-7H- or -9H-purines are presented. The microwave-assisted organic synthesis has provided faster access to the target compounds with the advantage of selective obtaining the N-7' or N-9' regioisomers simplifying their isolation. To test the behaviour of the products (including the purine bases) on cellular systems, cytotoxic activity against the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line was determined, and the three most active compounds were used to study the cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in the MCF-7 cell line.
