Human xylosyltransferase I catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans. Furthermore, this enzyme has been shown to play a major role in the physiological development of bone and cartilage as well as in pathophysiological processes such as systemic sclerosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, or fibrosis. Here, we report for the first time the identification and characterization of the XYLT1 gene promoter region and important transcription factors involved in its regulation. Members of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1) family of transcription factors are necessary for the transcriptional regulation of the XYLT1 gene, which was proven by curcumin, tanshinone IIA, mithramycin A, and short interference RNA treatment. A stepwise 5' and 3' deletion of the predicted GC-rich promoter region, which lacks a TATA and/or CAAT box, revealed that a 531-bp core promoter element is able to drive the transcription on a basal level. A binding site for transcription factors of the AP-1 family, which is essential for full promoter activity, was identified by site-directed mutagenesis located 730 bp 5' of the translation initiation site. The ability of this site to bind members of the AP-1 family was further verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A promoter element containing this binding site was able to drive the transcription to about 79-fold above control in SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells. Our findings provide a first insight into the regulation of the XYLT1 gene and may contribute to understanding the processes taking place during extracellular matrix formation and remodeling in health and disease.
