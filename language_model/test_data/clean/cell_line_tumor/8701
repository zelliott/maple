It is controversial whether persistent signaling by the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor (TSHR) is cell-type specific. We reported persistent TSHR signaling in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells expressing human TSHRs (HEK-TSHRs), whereas another group reported persistent signaling in mouse thyroid follicles but not in HEK293 cells. Herein, we test this hypothesis directly.

We used two methods to measure persistent signaling in HEK-TSHRs and confirm our previous observations. In Method 1, we used a chemiluminescent immunoassay to measure intracellular cAMP accumulation over 30-60 min by adding a phosphodiesterase inhibitor to the incubation medium. In Method 2, we used an intracellular biosensor to record cAMP levels continuously.

Using Method 1, we show that TSHR signals persistently in human thyrocytes and human osteosarcoma U2OS-TSHR cells. Using Method 1 in HEK-TSHRs, we show that after 5 min, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) increases cAMP to 2.5 pmol/well, TSH increases cAMP to 1.6 pmol/well, but IBMX added 30 min after TSH withdrawal increases cAMP to 105 pmol/well. Using Method 2 in HEK-TSHRs, we confirm that without IBMX, TSH causes a transient increase in cAMP and 30 min after TSH withdrawal, IBMX increases cAMP in cells pretreated with TSH more rapidly and to a higher level than IBMX added to cells not pre-exposed to TSH. Lastly, using Method 2, we show that in HEK-TSHRs phosphodiesterases types 3 and 4 are involved in degrading cAMP as the specific inhibitors Rolipram and Milrinone expose persistent TSHR signaling.

We conclude that persistent TSHR activation occurs in human thyrocytes, U2OS-TSHR cells and HEK-TSHRs; it is not cell-type specific but is revealed by inhibiting phosphodiesterases.
