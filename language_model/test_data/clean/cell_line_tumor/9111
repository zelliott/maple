Cyclooxygenase-2 functions as a survival factor by protecting cells from apoptosis. We analyzed cyclooxygenase-2 expression in LNCaP-COX-2 and LNCaP-Neo cell lines treated with irradiation.

LNCaP-COX-2 and LNCaP-Neo cells were treated with 0 to 500 microM celecoxib and a dose response curve was generated. A clonogenic assay was performed in which cells were subjected to irradiation (0 to 6 Gy) with or without celecoxib. Cyclooxygenase-2 protein and other relevant proteins were measured by immunohistochemistry Western blot analysis after irradiation and celecoxib treatment.

The 2 studied cell lines experienced cytotoxic effects of celecoxib in a dose related manner. Clonogenic assays demonstrated that LNCaP-COX-2 cells were significantly more resistant to radiation therapy than LNCaP-Neo cells. Furthermore, the addition of celecoxib sensitized LNCaP-Neo and LNCaP-COX-2 cells to the cytocidal effects of radiation. Moreover, cyclooxygenase-2 over expression was associated with the over expression of pAkt and carbonic anhydrase. In this cell line irradiation alone was associated with increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and carbonic anhydrase. Combination therapy with irradiation and celecoxib down-regulated cyclooxygenase-2, pAKT and carbonic anhydrase. LNCaP-Neo cells expressed carbonic anhydrase and pAkt. Irradiation of these cells increased carbonic anhydrase and pAkt expression. Combination therapy with irradiation and celecoxib down-regulated carbonic anhydrase and pAkt.

Cyclooxygenase-2 expression is also associated with pAkt and carbonic anhydrase expression. Down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 by celecoxib is associated with decreased expression of cyclooxygenase-2, pAkt and carbonic anhydrase, and eventual radiation sensitization, which is a phenomenon that may have clinical usefulness.
