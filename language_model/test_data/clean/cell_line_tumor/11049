To investigate the effect of gene Af116609 on gastric cancer multi-drug resistance (MDR) by introducing it into gastric cancer multi-drug resistant (MDR) cell line SGC7901/VCR.

Gene Af116609 was cloned from SGC7901/VCR by RT-PCR and its differential expression between gastric cancer MDR cells and its parental cells was displayed by Northern blot. The gene was introduced to gastric cancer cells by transfection of recombinant eukaryotic expression vector by electroporation. MTT assay in vitro was applied to investigate its effect on multi-drug resistance phenotype of gastric cancer cells.

The full length CDS of gene Af116609, as long as 327 bp, was cloned from gastric cancer MDR cell line SGC7901/VCR and its sequence was coincident with the hypothetical gene Af116609 in GenBank. It was overexpressed in MDR cells than its parental cells at mRNA level. In the MTT assay in vitro, the drug sensitive cells transfected with sense eukaryotic expression vector showed upregulated targeted gene, with increased resistance to vincristine, 5-fliorouracil and arabinoside, and decreased resistance to adriamycin, but no influence on resistance to methotrexate. However, the drug resistant cells transfected with anti-sense eukaryotic expression vector, showed down regulated targeted gene, with less resistance to all the five anticancer drugs to different degrees.

Gene Af116609 is related to MDR phenotype of gastric cancer cells and may become a candidate molecular target to reverse the MDR of gastric cancer.
