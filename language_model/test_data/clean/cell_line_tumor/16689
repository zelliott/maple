Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphataseÂ 5 (MKP-5)/DUSP10 acts as a             phosphatase of stress-activated kinases (JNK and p38), but its activity towards             ERK has not been demonstrated. In the present study we observed that MKP-5 interacts             with ERK, retains it in the cytoplasm, suppresses its activation and downregulates             ERK-dependent transcription. These data suggested a novel MKP-5 function as a             scaffold protein for the ERK pathway. We analyzed MKP-5 gene expression in several             tumors, and found that it is frequently upregulated in colorectal but not in lung             and breast cancer, suggesting its association with the malignant phenotype of             colon cancer.
