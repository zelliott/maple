The next-generation sequencing technology allows identification and cataloging of almost all mRNAs, even those with only one or a few transcripts per cell. To understand the chemotherapy response program in ovarian cancer cells at deep transcript sequencing levels, we applied two next-generation sequencing technologies to study two ovarian chemotherapy response models: the in vitro acquired cisplatin-resistant cell line model (IGROV-1-CP and IGROV1) and the in vivo ovarian cancer tissue resistant model. We identified 3,422 signatures (2,957 genes) that are significantly differentially expressed between IGROV1 and IGROV-1-CP cells (P < .001). Our database offers the first comprehensive view of the digital transcriptomes of ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues with different chemotherapy response phenotypes.
