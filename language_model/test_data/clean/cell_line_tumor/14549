Molecular imaging of cancers has been characterized based on the sensitivity and selectivity of a single cancer probe targeting a cancer biomarker of a specific cancer cell line. Here, we designed a multimodal nanoparticle-based Simultaneously Multiple Aptamers and RGD Targeting (SMART) cancer probe targeting multiple cancer biomarkers to enhance the specificity and signal sensitivity for various cancers. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the multimodal SMART cancer probe was spheric and well dispersed. Fluorescence, radioisotope, and magnetic resonance analysis demonstrated that the SMART cancer probe simultaneously targeting the nucleolin, integrin α(v)β(3) and Tnc proteins had dramatically enhanced specificity and signal intensity when used to target cancers from C6, NPA, DU145, HeLa and A549 cells when compared with single cancer probes conjugated with AS1411, RGD or TTA1 targeting a single cancer biomarker. The results demonstrated that the SMART cancer probe will be useful for the diagnosis of different cancers as a cancer master probe.
