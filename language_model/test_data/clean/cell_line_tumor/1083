Pyocin typing of 82 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, collected from different Iranian clinical sources, revealed that one isolate, P. aeruginosa 42A, produced pyocin S2, a protease-sensitive bacteriocin. Pyocin S2 production was induced by mitomycin C (2 micro g/mL) in the pyocin S2 producer P. aeruginosa 42A. Pyocin S2 was purified using ion exchange chromatography with CM-Sepharose CL-6B and sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8) from an 80% ammonium sulfate precipitate of whole-cell lysates. Pyocin activity of the fractions was detected using the Govan spot testing method. The purity of the active fraction was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, where a single band with a molecular mass of 74 kDa was detected. Cytotoxic effects of purified pyocin S2 and partially purified pyocin from P. aeruginosa 42A on the human tumor cell lines HepG2 and Im9 and the normal human cell line HFFF (Human Foetal Foreskin Fibroblast) were studied by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The results demonstrated that partially purified pyocin and pyocin S2 exhibited substantial inhibitory effects on the growth of the tumor cell lines HepG2 and Im9, while no inhibitory effects were observed on the normal cell line HFFF. Pure lipopolysaccharide was used as a control and was found to have no inhibitory effect on any of the cell lines tested.
