ISG15 has recently been reported to possess antiviral properties against viruses, both in vivo and in vitro. Knock-down of ISG15 gene expression by small interfering RNA followed by alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) treatment in Huh-7 cells resulted in an increased phenotypic sensitivity to IFN-alpha, as determined by measuring hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication inhibition in stably transfected HCV replicon cells and in cells infected with genotype 1a HCVcc (infectious HCV). This IFN-alpha-specific effect, which was not observed with IFN-gamma, correlated with an increase in expression of the IFN-alpha-inducible genes IFI6, IFITM3, OAS1 and MX1, whereas the expression of the non-IFN-alpha-inducible genes PTBP-1 and JAK1 remained unchanged. It has previously been reported that, unlike ISG15 knock-down, increased sensitivity to IFN-alpha after knock-down of USP18 occurs through the prolonged phosphorylation of STAT-1. Combination knock-down of ISG15 and USP18 resulted in a moderate increase in IFN-alpha-inducible gene expression compared with single ISG15 or USP18 knock-down. Furthermore, the phenotype of increased gene expression after ISG15 knock-down and IFN-alpha treatment was also observed in non-hepatic cell lines A549 and HeLa. Taken together, these results reveal a novel function for ISG15 in the regulation of the IFN-alpha pathway and its antiviral effect.
