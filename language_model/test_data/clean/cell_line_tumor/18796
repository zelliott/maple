In the present work it was investigated if a spontaneous alteration of the native melanotic transplantable melanoma form into amelanotic form, connected with the tumor progression, is accompanied by changes of CD44 surface glycoprotein expression. We also tried to find out if there exists any correlation between changes in CD44 expression and IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 secretion. Cells of two hamster transplantable melanoma lines: melanotic and amelanotic were used. The levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 in supernatants were determined by the ELISA test. For the detection of CD44 expression by flow cytometry, isolated melanoma cells were stained with the rat anti-mouse CD44 monoclonal antibody. The stained cells were also examined using a fluorescence microscope and a confocal microscopy system. The obtained results indicate that a spontaneous alteration of the native melanotic form into amelanotic form and the associated tumor progression was accompanied by a decrease in CD44 glycoprotein expression on the cell surface and a decrease in IL-6, TNF-alpha and especially IL-10 secretion by amelanotic melanoma cells. Our observations suggest a relationship between CD44 expression and locally secreted cytokines in the course of transplantable melanoma progression.
