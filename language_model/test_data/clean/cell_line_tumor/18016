To investigate the expression and significance of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) in human glioma.

Immunohistochemical staining for PPAR gamma was performed using biopsy specimens of human glioma of various histological types. Expression of PPAR gamma and GFAP in glioma cell lines SWO-38, U251 and SHG-44 were analyzed using Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Immunohistochemical study showed that PPAR gamma was expressed in glioma tissues with positive rate of 37.5%. Western blotting and RT-PCR showed that PPAR gamma was expressed in both glioma cell lines SWO-38 and U251, but not in SHG-44 cells. However, high expression of GFAP was detected in SHG-44 cells.

PPAR gamma is associated with carcinogens of glioma. Actived PPAR gamma by agonist may be a novel approach to the treatment of glioma.
