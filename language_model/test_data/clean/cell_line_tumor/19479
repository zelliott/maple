Bioassay-guided fractionation of the methanolic extract of Viburnum awabuki afforded two new lupane triterpene derivatives; 6 beta-hydroxyl-3,20-dioxo-30 norlupane-28-oic acid (1) and 3,4-secolup-4,20-dihydroxy-3,28-dioic acid-3-oic acid methyl ester (2), along with seven known lupane and oleanane-type triterpenes (3-9). The structure of the isolated compounds was assigned using different spectroscopic techniques including 1D and 2D NMR. The 13CNMR data of compounds 5 and 9 is reported for the first time. Triterpenes 1, 2, and 7-9 showed in vitro cytotoxic activity against several tumor cell lines.
