Previously, we and other groups reported that liver X receptor (LXR) agonists T0901317, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol suppressed the proliferation of prostate and breast cancer cells. In this study, we report that T0901317 and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol treatment inhibited the proliferation of different progression stages of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells, as well as different commonly used human cancer cell lines. Cancer cell lines with higher LXRÎ± mRNA expression were more sensitive to 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol-induced inhibition. T0901317 treatment decreased the percentage of the cell population in S-phase and caused G(1) cell cycle arrest. Overexpression of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) partially blocked the suppressive effect of T0901317 treatment. Modulating LXR signaling is therefore a potential adjuvant therapy for advanced prostate cancer and other types of cancer.
