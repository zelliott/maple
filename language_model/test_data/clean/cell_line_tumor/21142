Although many tools of cellular and molecular biology have been used to characterize single intracellular cycles of virus growth, few culture methods exist to study the dynamics of spatially spreading viruses over multiple generations. We have previously developed a method that addresses this need by tracking the spread of focal infections using immunocytochemical labeling and digital imaging. Here, we build reaction-diffusion models to account for spatio-temporal patterns formed by the spreading viral infection front as well as data from a single cycle of virus growth (one-step growth). Systems with and without the interferon-mediated antiviral response of the host cells are considered. Dynamic images of the spreading infections guide iterative model refinement steps that lead to reproduction of all of the salient features contained in the images, not just the velocity of the infection front. The optimal fits provide estimates for key parameters such as virus-host binding and the production rate of interferon. For the examined data, highly-lumped infection models that ignore the one-step growth dynamics provide a comparable fit to models that more accurately account for these dynamics, highlighting the fact that increased model complexity does not necessarily translate to improved fit. This work demonstrates how model building can facilitate the interpretation of experiments by highlighting contributions from both biological and methodological factors.
