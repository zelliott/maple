Resistance to two cultured lines of murine embryonal carcinoma was studied in F1 hybrids constructed between the tumor-syngeneic mouse strain 129/J and several allogeneic strains. Three of four such hybrid strains were significantly more resistant to the multipotent embryonal carcinoma line PCC3 than the tumor-syngeneic 129/J parent strain. All hybrid strains tested showed significantly higher resistance to the nullipotent embryonal carcinoma line F9 than the syngeneic strain. Hybrid resistance to embryonal carcinoma lines does not require a hybrid H-2 complex. Several kinds of evidence indicate that this hybrid resistance has an immunological basis.
