The effect of pretreatment with various low doses of total-body irradiation (TBI) on tumor cell transplantability in syngeneic mice was investigated. Two cell lines, EMT6 and SCCVII, and two strains of mice, were used. First, Balb/c mice were sham-irradiated or irradiated at 200 mGy, and 6-48 h later, 1000 EMT6 cells were inoculated in the hind legs. Based on the results, 0-1500 mGy of TBI was given 6 h before inoculation of 100 or 1000 cells in the subsequent experiments. All mice were observed for 50 days after transplantation. Tumors were judged as grown when the volume of palpable nodules exceeded 200 mm(3). Tumor transplantability rate was significantly higher in the groups irradiated at 1500 mGy than in the sham-irradiated groups in both Balb/c and C3H/He mice. There were no differences in transplantability rates between the control group and the groups irradiated at various doses of 50-500 mGy. However, the mean time to tumor appearance was significantly elongated in Balb/c mice receiving TBI at 200 mGy and inoculated with 100 or 1000 EMT6 cells 6 h later. This phenomenon was also observed in Balb/c mice receiving 100 mGy TBI and inoculated with 1000 EMT6 cells. The present study might suggest that low-dose TBI to mice may delay tumor growth under certain conditions.
