Bystin, Trophinin, and Tastin are component proteins of an adhesion molecule complex that plays a crucial role in the initial attachment of the embryo to the uterus.

Profiling of genes differentially expressed in the perineural invasion (PNI) in vitro model by gene microarray analysis showed overexpression of bystin in prostate cancer cells co-cultured with nerves. Validation was performed at the RNA levels using quantitative PCR.

Bystin is overexpressed in cells co-cultured with nerves. Bystin is also present in human prostatic carcinoma (PCa) cells in PNI location in increasing gradient. Bystin is present in the supernatant of the PNI co-culture.

Their adhesive and invasive functions in the trophoblast suggest that they might also play a role in perineural adhesion. Bystin is, therefore, an important therapeutic target for neurotropic cancers.
