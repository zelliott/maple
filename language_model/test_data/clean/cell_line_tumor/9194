Malignant cells are often resistant to complement activation through the enhanced expression of complement inhibitors. In this work, we examined the protective role of factor H, CD46, CD55, and CD59 in two non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, H1264 and A549, upon activation of the classical pathway of complement. Complement was activated with polyclonal Abs raised against each cell line. After blocking factor H activity with a neutralizing Ab, C3 deposition and C5a release were more efficient. Besides, a combined inhibition of factor H and CD59 significantly increased complement-mediated lysis. CD46 and CD55 did not show any effect in the control of complement activation. Factor H expression was knockdown on A549 cells using small interfering RNA. In vivo growth of factor H-deficient cells in athymic mice was significantly reduced. C3 immunocytochemistry on explanted xenografts showed an enhanced activation of complement in these cells. Besides, when mice were depleted of complement with cobra venom factor, growth was recovered, providing further evidence that complement was important in the reduction of in vivo growth. In conclusion, we show that expression of the complement inhibitor factor H by lung cancer cells can prevent complement activation and improve tumor development in vivo. This may have important consequences in the efficiency of complement-mediated immunotherapies.
