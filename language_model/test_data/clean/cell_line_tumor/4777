Agelasine and agelasimine derivatives with substantially less complicated terpenoid side chains compared to the naturally occurring compounds have been synthesized and their ability to inhibit growth of microorganisms and cancer cells has been studied. Compounds with excellent activity against cancer cell lines (MIC ca. 1 microM for the most potent compounds), including a drug resistant renal cell line, have been identified. Most compounds studied also exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity including activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
