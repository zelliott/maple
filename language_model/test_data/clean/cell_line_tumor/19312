To investigate the differential expression of genes encoding multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), MRP3 and MRP5 in human normal liver cell line L-02, hepatocarcinoma cell line BEL and its adriamycin-resistant counterpart BEL/ADM cell line.

The total RNA was extracted from L-02, BEL and BEL/ADM cells, respectively, and the mRNAs were reversely transcribed into cDNA. The expression levels of MRP2, MRP3, MRP5 mRNAs were detected according to the standard curve using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR.

The expression of MRP2 mRNA in BEL/ADM cell line was significantly higher than that in L-02 and BEL cells (P=0.000), and the latter two cells showed similar expression levels of MRP2 mRNA (P=0.468). The expressions of MRP3 and MRP5 mRNA showed statistically significant difference between the 3 cell lines (P=0.000).

MRP2 might play a role in the intrinsic drug resistance, and MRP3 and MRP5 are related to the acquired drug resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma.
