To evaluate the effect of HPV16 E6/E7 on drug sensitivity, primary human OSE cells were infected with HPV16 E6/E7 expressing retrovirus and then exposed to chemotherapeutic agents. Apoptosis induced by mitomycin C was dose-dependent in both primary OSE and E6E7/OSE cells. E6E7/OSE cells were more sensitive to mitomycin C than parental OSE cells. HPV16 E6/E7 also sensitized OSE cells to 5-FU and its derivative 5-FUdR, but only at low doses. This phenomenon was also observed in cervical cancer cells and was independent of thymidylate synthase, a target of thymine and thymidine analogues. We conclude that HPV16 E6/E7 specifically modulates the activity of 5-FU and 5-FUdR, and confers OSE cells hypersensitivity to low-dose but not high-dose 5-FU and 5-FUdR. Molecular analysis indicates that induction of p53 and p21, and suppression of pRB are associated with apoptosis induced by 5-FUdR and may partly explain the hypersensitivity of E6E7/OSE cells to low-dose 5-FUdR.
