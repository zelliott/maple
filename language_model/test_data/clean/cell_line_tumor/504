Unlike the preparation of other purine nucleosides, transglycosylation from a pyrimidine nucleoside and guanine is difficult because of the low solubility of this base. Thus, another strategy, based on the coupled action of two whole cell biocatalyzed reactions, transglycosylation and deamination, was used. Enterobacter gergoviae and Arthrobacter oxydans were employed to synthesize 9-beta-d-arabinofuranosylguanine (AraG), an efficient anti leukemic drug.
