Luciferases are widely used to monitor biological processes. Here we describe the naturally secreted Gaussia princeps luciferase (Gluc) as a highly sensitive reporter for quantitative assessment of cells in vivo by measuring its concentration in blood. The Gluc blood assay complements in vivo bioluminescence imaging, which has the ability to localize the signal and provides a multifaceted assessment of cell viability, proliferation and location in experimental disease and therapy models.
