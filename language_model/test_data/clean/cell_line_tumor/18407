Phospholipase D (PLD) activity in mammalian cells has been associated with cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we investigated the expression of PLD during differentiation of pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells (P19) into astrocytes and neurons. Retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation increased PLD1 and PLD2 mRNA levels and PLD activity that was responsive to phorbol myristate acetate. Various agonists of membrane receptors activated PLD in RA-differentiated cells. Glutamate was a potent activator of PLD in neurons but not in astrocytes, whereas noradrenaline and carbachol increased PLD activity only in astrocytes. P19 neurons but not astrocytes released glutamate in response to a depolarizing stimulus, confirming the glutamatergic phenotype of these neurons. These results indicate upregulation of PLD gene expression associated with RA-induced neural differentiation.
