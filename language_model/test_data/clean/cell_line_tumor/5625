In the present study we investigated the in vitro apoptosis inducing effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) ligand ciglitazone (CGZ) on acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) NB4 cells and its mechanisms of action. The results revealed that CGZ (10-50 micromol/l) inhibited the growth of leukemia NB4 cells and caused apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis was observed clearly by flow cytometry (FCM) and DNA fragmentation analysis. After treatment by CGZ for 48 h, the percentage of disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting demonstrated the cleavage of caspase-3 zymogen protein and a time-dependent cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The results also demonstrated that PPAR-gamma expression was increased concomitantly when apoptosis occurred, and that CGZ-induced apoptosis was inhibited by the PPAR-gamma antagonist GW9662, suggesting a PPAR-gamma dependent signaling pathway in CZG-induced cell death. Moreover, CGZ treatment remarkably downregulated the expression of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), which was inhibited by GW9662. Of note, a small-molecule XIAP antagonist (1396-12) mimicked the effect of CGZ-induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-3, 7 and 9. The apoptosis-inducing effects by CGZ on fresh APL cells were also found to be remarkable by using FCM and Wright's staining observation. Taken together, our results suggest that downregulation of XIAP and activation of capase-3 play an important role in mediating the PPAR-gamma-dependent cell death induced by CGZ in APL cells. These data provide a novel insight into potential therapeutic strategies for treatment of leukemia.
