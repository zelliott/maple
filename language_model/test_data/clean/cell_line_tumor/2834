One secobutanolide, two butanolides and six drimane sesquiterpenoids were isolated from the bark and leaves of Zygogynum pancheri and Zygogynum acsmithii (Winteraceae) along with six known drimanes, isodrimanial, 1beta-O-p-methoxy-E-cinnamoyl-bemadienolide, 7-ketoisodrimenin, drimenin, polygodial and 1beta-E-cinnamoyl-6alpha-hydroxypolygodial. Their structures were elucidated through analysis of spectroscopic data. Drimane sesquiterpenoids with a dialdehyde function exhibited significant inhibitory activities in the in vitro cytotoxic assays against KB, HL60 and HCT116 cancer cell lines.
