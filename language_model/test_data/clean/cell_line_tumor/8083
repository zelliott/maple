Several epidemiological studies have provided evidence that administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could have a prophylactic effect against some cancers such as sporadic colorectal cancer and leukemia. Indeed, various NSAIDs have been shown to induce apoptosis in malignant cells. We evaluated the effect of racemic Etodolac on proliferation and cell survival in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells. Etodolac decreased survival of Nalm-16 and Nalm-6 BCP-ALL cell lines and also decreased cell proliferation in Nalm-16 cell line. Ours findings indicate, for the first time to our knowledge, that Etodolac is cytotoxic and cytostatic for BCP-ALL cells.
