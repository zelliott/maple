In the last years, photodynamic therapy, performed with hematoporphyrin derivatives, gained in importance for the treatment of superficially situated malignomas. The use of hematoporphyrin as photosensitizer is limited especially by the low depth of penetration and its side effects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy with anthracyclin derivates in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.

The photodynamic effects of the anthracyclin derivates adriamycin and epirubicin as well as the effects of the hematoporphyrin derivatives photofrin-II and photosan-3 were examined and compared in 10 squamous cell carcinoma cell lines derived from head and neck tumors.

Beside their cytostatic effect, the applied cytostatics revealed a marked photodynamic effect. A statistically significant difference for photodynamic effects of both cytostatic agents and the hematoporphyrin derivates could not be shown.

These results revealed that the above mentioned cytostatics could be considered as possible alternative photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy.
