A wireless sensing device was developed for the in-situ monitoring of the growth of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and evaluation of the cytotoxicity of the anticancer drugs fluorouracil and cisplatin. The sensor is fabricated by coating a magnetoelastic ribbon-like sensor with a layer of polyurethane that protects the iron-rich sensor from oxidation and provides a cell-compatible surface. In response to a time-varying magnetic field, the magnetoelastic sensor longitudinally vibrates, emitting magnetic flux that can be remotely detected by a pick-up coil. No physical connections between the sensor and the detection system are required. The wireless property facilitates aseptic biological operation, especially in cell culture as illustrated in this work. The adhesion of cells on the sensor surface results in a decrease in the resonance amplitude, which is proportional to the cell concentration. A linear response was obtained in cell concentrations of 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(6)cells ml(-1), with a detection limit of 1.2 x 10(4) cells ml(-1). The adhesion strength of cells on the sensor is qualitatively evaluated by increasing the amplitude of the magnetic excitation field. And the cytotoxicity of the anticancer drugs fluorouracil and cisplatin is evaluated by the magnetoelastic biosensor. The cytostatic curve is related with the quantity of cytostatic drug. The lethal concentration (LC50) for cells incubated in the presence of drugs for 20 h is calculated to be 19.9 microM for fluorouracil and 13.1 microM for cisplatin.
