The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 (p27) is a major gatekeeper of the mammalian cell cycle progression known to be regulated by both, its subcellular localization and its degradation. To allow entrance into S phase and thereby mammalian cell cycle progression p27 must be degraded by a skp2-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase whose task is to target p27 for degradation by the proteasome. The tumor suppressor gene product tuberin directly binds to p27 and protects it from degradation via skp2. Whereas, p27 and tuberin are known to be localized to both, the cytoplasm and the nucleus, the localization of skp2 remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that skp2 is a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein. In addition we found an inverse correlation of the endogenous protein levels of skp2 with p27 and tuberin in different transformed cells and under different growth conditions. These data allow new important insights into this molecular network of cell cycle control.
