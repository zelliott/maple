Effective cell-mediated antitumor immunity requires the activation of tumor-reactive T cells and the trafficking of activated T cells to tumor sites. These processes involve the extravasation of lymphocytes from the blood and lymphatics, and their homing to lymph nodes and tumors. L-selectin (CD62L) is an important molecule in these processes. It directs naive lymphocytes to peripheral lymph nodes where they become activated and it traffics naive lymphocytes to inflammatory environments, such as tumors. Individuals with advanced cancer are immune suppressed due to myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), a population of immature myeloid cells that accumulate to high levels in response to tumor-secreted and proinflammatory factors. We now demonstrate that the reduction in T cell levels of L-selectin that is commonly seen in individuals with cancer inversely correlates with MDSC levels. Three lines of evidence demonstrate that MDSC directly down-regulate L-selectin on naive T cells: 1) naive T cells cocultured with tumor-induced MDSC have reduced L-selectin; 2) T cells in tumor-free aged mice with elevated levels of MDSC have reduced L-selectin, and 3) peritoneal exudate T cells of tumor-free mice treated with plasminogen activator urokinase to elevate MDSC have reduced levels of L-selectin. MDSC are likely to down-regulate L-selectin through their plasma membrane expression of ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 17), an enzyme that cleaves the ectodomain of L-selectin. Therefore, MDSC down-regulate L-selectin levels on naive T cells, decreasing their ability to home to sites where they would be activated. This is another mechanism by which MDSC inhibit antitumor immunity.
