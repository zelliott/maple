Four new cembranoids, lobophylins A-D (1-4), and one novel secocembrane, lobophylin E (5) were isolated from a soft coral Lobophytum sp. The structures of new metabolites were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic methods. Among these metabolites, 1-4 are rarely found cembranoids possessing a tetrahydrofuran moiety with a 3,14-ether linkage. In addition, 5 is the first secocembrane possessing two tetrahydrofuran moieties with 3,14- and 4,7-ether linkages.
