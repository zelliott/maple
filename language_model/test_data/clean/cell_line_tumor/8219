Sindbis virus (SIN) infection causes no or only mild symptoms (fever, rash, and arthralgia) in humans. However, SIN has a strong cytopathic effect (CPE) on various cancer cells. This study focuses on the oncolytic activity of SIN AR399 on oral cancer cells compared with reovirus, a well-known oncolytic virus that targets cancer cells.

We analysed the cytotoxicity and growth of SIN in 13 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines (HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4, Ca9-22, H-1, Sa-3, KON, KOSC-2, OK-92, HO-1-N1, SCC-4, SAT, SKN-3) and normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOKs).

Sindbis virus infection induced CPE in 12 OSCC cell lines at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, but not in the OSCC cell line, HSC-4 or NHOKs. Sindbis viral growth was not observed in NHOKs, whereas high SIN growth was observed in all OSCC cell lines, including HCS-4. The cytotoxicity and growth of SIN was the same as reovirus at an MOI of 20 in 12 OSCC cell lines. The CPE was shown, by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling assays, to be apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR of mRNA in HSC-3 and HSC-4 cells after SIN infection showed that activation of caspases, cytochrome c, and IkappaBalpha was associated with SIN-induced apoptosis.

As a replication-competent oncolytic virus, SIN may be a useful therapeutic modality for oral cancers.
