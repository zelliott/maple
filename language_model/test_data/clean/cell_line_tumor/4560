L612, a human IgM monoclonal antibody produced by an EBV-transformed human B-cell line, binds to ganglioside GM3 and kills GM3-positive human melanoma cells in the presence of complement. It has been shown to be effective in some patients with late-stage melanoma. L612 consists of hexameric IgM (about 20%), pentameric IgM (about 74%), and other minor IgM molecules. Because hexameric IgM activates complement more effectively than pentameric IgM, we developed and evaluated a hexamer-dominant recombinant IgM for clinical applications.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with heavy- and light-chain genes of L612, with or without the joining-chain gene. Antitumor effects of the recombinant IgM secreted from CHO cells were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

Recombinant IgM secreted from CHO cells without the joining chain (designated CA19) was approximately 80% hexameric, whereas recombinant IgM from CHO cells transfected with heavy-, light-, and joining-chain genes (designated CJ45) was about 90% pentameric. Both CA19 and CJ45 recombinant IgMs caused complement-dependent cytotoxicity against human and mouse melanoma cell lines, but the amount of CA19 required for 50% specific cytotoxicity was 5 to 10 times smaller. I.v. injection of CA19 compared with CJ45 or native L612 elicited more profound antitumor activity in nude rats bearing a GM3-positive mouse melanoma xenograft.

A hexamer-dominant human IgM against GM3 may provide a more potent treatment option for patients with GM3-positive melanoma.
