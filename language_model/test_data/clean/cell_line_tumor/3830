Peniciketals A-C (1-3), three new spiroketals with a benzo-fused 2,8-dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane moiety, were isolated from the saline soil derived fungus Penicillium raistrichii. Their structures including absolute configurations were established by NMR, X-ray diffraction, and ECD calculations. Their cytotoxicities were tested against A549, HL-60, and K562 cell lines, and 1-3 showed the selective effects on HL-60 cells with IC50 values of 3.2, 6.7, and 4.5 Î¼M, respectively.
