The Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase Phosphodiesterasel (ENPP1) polymorphisms have been associated with metabolic traits. There is no data on the effect of ENPP1 in South African children or adults.

To investigate the role of K121Q (rs1044498), rs997509 and rs9402349 in obesity and other components of the metabolic syndrome.

A case-control study.

Sixty four obese and 64 lean mixed ancestry learners.

Western Cape, South Africa.

The ENPP1 rs997509T allele is independently associated with obesity in children of mixed ancestry from South Africa.

The T allele frequency of the rs997509 differed significantly between obese and controls, p=0.0100 and increased the risk of being obese, p = 0.0238. Furthermore, the estimated effect of the T allele was an increase of 8.6 cm in waist circumference, 10.2 kg in weight and a corresponding 4.9 kg/m2 in BMI. Individuals carrying both the 121Q and the T allele of rs997509 were more associated with obesity (odds ratio = 3.85, 95% CI: 1.13 to 13.09) whilst those carrying the C allele of rs997509 in the presence of 121Q were likely to be lean with odds ratio of obesity 0.41 (95% CI: 0.19 to 0.87).

Our findings suggest that ENPP1 polymorphisms may contribute to different metabolic characteristics, all of which are associated with insulin resistance in mixed ancestry children of South Africa. However, a larger study is required to confirm findings of this study.
