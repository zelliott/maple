Childhood adiposity is increasingly recognized as a significant predictor of cardiometabolic risks in later life. The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with longitudinal changes in weight during childhood and the development of metabolic disease risk factors. Four hundred twenty-four children from DaQing city, China, were recruited at 5 y old and followed up for 5 y. Birth weight, television (TV) viewing time at 5 y old, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, fasting plasma insulin (FI), and triglycerides (TG) levels were measured at 5 and 10 y old. Both birth weight and TV viewing time at 5 y old significantly correlated with percentage of ideal weight for height (WFH) at 5 y old (WFH5; p = 0.0032 and p = 0.01), but only TV time was significantly correlated with WFH at 10 y old (WFH10; p &<0.0001). Blood pressures, FI, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and TG at 10 y old were significantly greater in those children who had greater change in WFH from 5 to 10 y old (ΔWFH). We concluded that TV viewing time was the stronger determinant of later childhood adiposity. A greater ΔWFH was associated with increased cardiometabolic risk factors at 10 y old.
