During the last several years the role of adipose tissue in contributing to obesity-associated cardiovascular and metabolic risk has gained much attention.

To examine the expression of TNF-alpha protein in omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue in correlation with plasma PAI-1 and other clinical parameters in obesity subjects.

Paired biopsies of omental and subcutaneous fat were collected during surgery in 32 obesity subjects. The expression of TNF-alpha protein in omental and subcutaneous fat was quantified by using Western blot method, and correlations with plasma PAI-1, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and lipid were investigated.

TNF-alpha protein expression was higher in omental than in subcutaneous adipose tissue (P&<.01). Significant positive linear correlations were found between TNF-alpha protein in omental adipose tissue and plasma PAI-1 in obesity subjects. TNF-alpha protein in omental fat was positively associated with HOMA-IR, triglycerides and negatively with HDL-cholesterol.

TNF-alpha expression in omental adipose tissue could play a key role in contributing to cardiovascular risk in central obesity subjects.
