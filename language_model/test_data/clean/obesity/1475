Considerable evidence indicates that obesity, and in particular abdominal obesity, is a risk factor for both heart disease and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. In spite of this, little is known of the regulation of triacylglycerol synthesis in adipose tissue other than by insulin. Acylation stimulating protein (ASP), a human plasma protein, stimulates triacylglycerol synthesis in adipose tissue and is also produced by human adipocytes. ASP may play a physiological role in the regulation of efficiency of adipose tissue fat storage and affect clearance of triglycerides from plasma.
