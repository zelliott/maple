Four women with phenotypic features of Turner's syndrome and with poly  cystic ovaries (PCO) are describe. In addition to  the phenotypic features, Case 1 had primary amenorrhea and small PCO, Case 2  had a 46, XX/45, X karyotype (lumphocytes), Case 3 had enlarged PCO  which contained a  decreased number of oocytes, and Case 4 had enlarged PCO and was short in statute. These cases support the concept of a relation between PCO and the X chromosome. Some PCO may represent an intermediate condition in a spectrum that extends from the streak gonad of Turners syndrome to the normal ovary. Evidience for X chromosome involvement in PCO is summarized. The concept is advanced that at least some cases of OCO may be due to X chromosomal factors causing an abnormal follicular appartus.
