To evaluate the changes of serum leptin levels after weight reduction in diabetic subjects with and without microalbuminuria, we studied 10 obese healthy subjects, 12 obese diabetics with persistent microalbuminuria and 10 obese diabetic subjects without microalbuminuria. Obese diabetic patients with microalbuminuria showed serum leptin levels significantly higher than normoalbuminuric diabetics, while no difference was found between obese diabetics without microalbuminuria and healthy controls. All obese subjects followed a 12-month intensive weight reduction program during which the mean change in body mass index was similar between obese diabetic and obese healthy subjects (obese diabetics without microalbuminuria: 35.2+/-4.3 vs 29.9+/-4.1, p&<.05; obese diabetics with microalbuminuria: 35.7+/-3.9 vs 30.3+/-4.0, p&<.05; obese healthy subjects: 35.5+/-4.0 vs 30.1+/-3.9, p&<.05). The mean changes in serum leptin levels tended to be similar in two groups of subjects studied (obese diabetics without microalbuminuria: 37.6+/-4.1 vs 19.7+/-4.9, p&<.001; obese healthy subjects: 37.1+/-4.3 vs 20.1+/-5.1, p&<.001); obese microalbuminuric subjects showed higher leptin levels (42.4+/-4.0 vs 30.3+/-4.2, p&<.001) than normoalbuminuric diabetic and obese healthy subjects. In conclusion, during weight loss, independently from the quality of metabolic control, serum leptin concentrations declined in both groups of obese diabetics. The changes of leptin in diabetics seem to be similar to those observed in healthy obese subjects.
