Analysis of biological fluids using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS) (metabonomics) can allow new insights to be gained into disease processes, with advances in chromatographic techniques enabling the detection of thousands of metabolites. In this work metabonomics has been used to investigate the metabolic processes involved in type II diabetes in the Zucker obese rat. Plasma was analyzed from three different strains, the Zucker (fa/fa) obese, Zucker lean and the lean/(fa) obese cross. Using UPLC/MS, ca. 10,000 ions were detected due to the narrow peak widths and excellent peak shapes achieved with this technology. Confidence in the chromatographic performance was demonstrated by the use of quality control standards. The positive and negative ion total ion chromatograms obtained from the three strains were readily distinguishable using multivariate statistical analysis. The greatest difference was observed between the Zucker lean and Zucker lean/(fa) rats compared to the Zucker (fa/fa) obese rats. Positive ions m/z 220 (4.36 min), 282(3.78 min), 359 (5.33 min) and 405 (7.77 min) were elevated in the plasma derived from Zucker lean rats whilst ions m/z 385 (6.80 min) and 646 (4.36 min) were at a lower concentration compared to the plasma from the Zucker (fa/fa) obese animals. Negative ions elevated in the Zucker lean rats included m/z 212 (2.30 min), 514 (2.85 min), 295 (4.39 min), 329 (3.11 min), 343 (2.86 min) and 512 (2.86 min) with ions m/z 538 (4.18 min), 568 (4.18 min), 568 (5.09 min) and 612 (4.30 min) being raised in the samples derived from Zucker (fa/fa) obese animals. The ion m/z 514 (3.85 min) was found to correspond to taurocholate, providing further support for an involvement of taurine metabolism in diabetes.
