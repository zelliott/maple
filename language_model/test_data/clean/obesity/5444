Elderly persons after myocardial infarction should have their modifiable coronary artery risk factors intensively treated. Hypertension should be treated with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The blood pressure should be reduced to &<40/85 mmHg and to&> or = 130/80 mmHg in persons with diabetes or renal insufficiency. The serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be reduced to &<00 mg/dl with statins if necessary. Aspirin or clopidogrel, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be given indefinitely unless contraindications exist to the use of these drugs. Long-acting nitrates are effective antianginal and antiischemic drugs. There are no Class I indications for the use of calcium channel blockers after myocardial infarction. Postinfarction patients should not receive Class I antiarrhythmic drugs, sotalol, or amiodarone. An automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator should be implanted in postinfarction patients at very high risk for sudden cardiac death. Hormonal therapy should not be used in postmenopausal women after myocardial infarction. The two indications for coronary revascularization are prolongation of life and relief of unacceptable symptoms despite optimal medical management.
