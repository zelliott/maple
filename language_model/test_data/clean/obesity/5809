The aim of this study was to measure serum adiponectin concentrations in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and to assess possible correlations between adiponectin and the hormonal or metabolic parameters of this syndrome.

Serum adiponectin levels were evaluated in 20 women with PCOS and 22 women without PCOS whose age and body mass index (BMI) matched the patients. The levels of fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, gonadotropin, and sex steroid hormones were evaluated in both groups. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) score was also calculated. The serum adiponectin levels were assayed by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA).

Serum adiponectin levels were significantly lower in obese women than in normal-weight women, and they were also significantly lower in PCOS patients with HOMA scores greater than 1.7 compared with those with HOMA scores lower than 1.7. When the subjects were divided in two groups based on serum adiponectin levels &> 40 microg/ml, &<40 microg/ml), 65% of patients with PCOS were included in the lower adiponectin group (p &<0.05). In addition, gonadotropin levels were increased, dependent on the adiponectin levels in women with PCOS.

Adiponectin is regarded as a possible link between adiposity and insulin resistance (IR). From this data, the secretions of gonadotropin are implicated in the levels of adiponectin in women with PCOS. It is suggested that adiponectin may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PCOS.
