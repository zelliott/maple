To determine whether obesity associated with "primary empty sella" (PES) had a characteristic hormonal pattern, we evaluated the hormonal profile in 24 simple obese and 19 obese-PES women. The latter group showed a significant delta-GH and LH impaired levels as well as plasma beta-EP significantly higher. Hence, the beta-EP measurement could be used to predict the hormonal response in these women.
