Rosiglitazone (RSG) is an insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinedione (TZD) that exerts peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma)-dependent and -independent effects. We tested the hypothesis that part of the insulin-sensitizing effect of RSG is mediated through the action of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). First, we determined the effect of acute (30-60 min) incubation of L6 myotubes with RSG on AMPK regulation and palmitate oxidation. Compared with control (DMSO), 200 microM RSG increased (P &<0.05) AMPKalpha1 activity and phosphorylation of AMPK (Thr172). In addition, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser218) phosphorylation and palmitate oxidation were increased (P &<0.05) in these cells. To investigate the effects of chronic RSG treatment on AMPK regulation in skeletal muscle in vivo, obese Zucker rats were randomly allocated into two experimental groups: control and RSG. Lean Zucker rats were treated with vehicle and acted as a control group for obese Zucker rats. Rats were dosed daily for 6 wk with either vehicle (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose, 100 microl/100 g body mass), or 3 mg/kg RSG. AMPKalpha1 activity was similar in muscle from lean and obese animals and was unaffected by RSG treatment. AMPKalpha2 activity was approximately 25% lower in obese vs. lean animals (P &<0.05) but was normalized to control values after RSG treatment. ACC phosphorylation was decreased with obesity (P &<0.05) but restored to the level of lean controls with RSG treatment. Our data demonstrate that RSG restores AMPK signaling in skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant obese Zucker rats.
