In two independent experiments, complete subdiaphragmatic vagotomy did not prevent the development of the obesity that results from the addition of highly palatable foods to the diet of rats. The vagotomized animals exhibited only a 1-day delay in the onset of overeating, and this only when first exposed to the tasty diet. In independent tests of the functional completeness of the vagotomies, the vagotomized animals failed to overeat or gain excessive weight on a standard laboratory diet following bilaterally parasagittal hypothalamic knife cuts. Thus, hypothalamic knife-cut obesity requires the integrity of the vagus for its full expression, whereas dietary obesity does not.
