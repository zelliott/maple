The aim of this study was to assess physical fitness in 6- to 7-yr-old children and determine if there is any relationship between children's physical fitness, their urine iodine status, and their body-mass index (BMI). The studied population included 121 children from southern Poland. Physical fitness was measured using a physical fitness test for children age 3-7 yr. Urinary iodine concentrations were measured in the children's first urine output on waking using the modified PAMM (Program Against Micronutrient Malnutrition) method. Body height and weight were measured and BMI was calculated. The subjects were characterized by low physical fitness. Boys obtained better results in agility, power, and strength exercises (p â‰¤ .05). In girls, 11 correlation coefficients between the scores obtained in the physical fitness test, urinary iodine, and anthropometric measures were statistically significant, and in boys, only 2. BMI correlated positively with agility in girls and with strength in girls and boys. Our study revealed low physical fitness in Polish 6- to 7-yr-old children, which shows the need to implement programs aimed at increasing their physical activity. The relationship found between physical fitness and urine iodine status in girls indicates that future research in this area is needed.
