This study investigated changes in the quality of life of men and women who participated in a primary care-based weight loss intervention program.

Participants were enrolled in a 2-year randomized clinical trial (POWER-UP) conducted at the University of Pennsylvania and in six affiliated primary care practices. Inclusion criteria included the presence of obesity (body mass index of 30-50 kg m(-2)) and at least two components of the metabolic syndrome.

Quality of life was assessed by three measures: the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12); the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite; and the EuroQol-5D.

Six months after the onset of treatment, and with a mean weight loss of 3.9 Â± 0.3 kg, participants reported significant improvements on all measures of interest with the exception of the Mental Component Score of the SF-12. These changes remained significantly improved from baseline to month 24, with the exception of the EuroQol-5D. Many of these improvements were correlated with the magnitude of weight loss and, for the most part, were consistent across gender and ethnic group.

Individuals with obesity and components of the metabolic syndrome reported significant improvements in most domains of the quality of life with a modest weight loss of 3.7% of initial weight, which was achieved within the first 6 months of treatment. The majority of these improvements were maintained at month 24, when participants had lost 3.0% of their weight.
