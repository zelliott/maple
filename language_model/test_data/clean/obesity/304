The global epidemic of obesity has not spared children. Although prevention of obesity is commendable, we cannot hide from the pressing need to identify, assess, and actively manage children seriously afflicted by obesity and its associated conditions. Sustained weight loss (or, for children, lowering of body mass index standard deviation score) delivers major health benefit, but in children has been difficult to achieve. In adults, the success of the diabetes prevention programs using practical lifestyle interventions is indisputable. Medical therapy, although currently limited in it scope, provides some promise for older children. There is now accumulating evidence, generally of poor quality that surgical interventions (laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) provide excellent sustained weight loss and improvement in comorbidity and quality of life in selected older children. Their benefits in adults are well demonstrated. Surgery comes with risk, both immediate and in the future, as does severe obesity. Carefully weighing risk and benefit is challenging for the individual and for health service providers. Careful health outcomes research with registries and well-conducted trials will provide better direction in the future. In the meantime, we should move forward ethically and cautiously in providing more intensive obesity management in children.
