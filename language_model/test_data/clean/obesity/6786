The obesity-induced hypertriglyceridemia commonly appear. As the primary hypertriglyceridemia, lipoprotein lipase deficiency and familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) are important. As the secondary one, diabetic dyslipidemia is of importance. Basically, children with hypertriglyceridemia are treated just by diet and exercise therapy. Only the case who is a patient with high risk of pancreatitis or with poor control of diabetes mellitus may need drug therapy. Drug therapy should be actually started with the pediatric specialist.
