Recent findings on fat metabolism open new prospective for developing effective drugs that would focus on white adipose tissue as therapeutic target. The aim of our study was establishment of features of oxidative metabolism in adipose tissue in diet-inducible obesity (DIO) model in rats and under influence of citrus. By the result of our investigations it may be concluded, that adipose tissue plays important role in development of oxidative stress during obesity. In DIO model in adipose tissue it was revealed disorders of mitochondria electron transport chain, excess generation of reactive oxygen species and lipoperoxides, inactivation of superoqsiddismutasa, intensification of lipid peroxidation and development of oxidative stress. Citruses by the normalization of body lipid metabolism promotes normalization of mitochondrial electron transport, decrease of oxidative stress, restoration of adipocytes' metabolism.
