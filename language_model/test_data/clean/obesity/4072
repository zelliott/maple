Using an electrical stimulation in 20 obese, 20 normal and 8 lean women, the pain threshold was observed to be higher in the obese than in the normal and lean subjects. The hypothesis is suggested that the diminution of the susceptibility to pain in obese subjects may be induced by the increase in endogenous opiate activity.
