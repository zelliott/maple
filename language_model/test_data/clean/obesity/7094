In the current review we summarize the available data concerning the gastric hormone ghrelin and its receptor. Ghrelin stimulates short-term food intake and long-term body weight regulation via its adipogenic and diabetogenic effects. Ghrelin stimulates gastric emptying, and these effects could be explored from a therapeutic point of view. Ghrelin levels change profoundly in anorexia, in states of insulin resistance, in obesity, and after bariatric surgery, suggesting that this is an important hormone in body weight regulation.
