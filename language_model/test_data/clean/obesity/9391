To evaluate female sexual dysfunction (FSD) in obese women in comparison with age-matched control group, emphasising their hormonal and psychological status.

Sixty-four sexually active obese premenauposal women were compared with a control group of 27 age-matched healthy volunteers with a normal body mass index (BMI). The obese group was evaluated in three categories according to BMI (kg/m(2)), as group 1 (30-34.9), group 2 (35-39.9) and group 3 &> 40). All women were evaluated with Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). In addition, serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, dehydroepiandrosterone-SO(4) , free testosterone, 17Î±-hydroxyprogestrone, androstenedione, oestradiol, free thyroxine and thyrotropin were determined.

The mean FSFI scores were not statistically significant between control and obese patients (P = 0.29). FSD was diagnosed in 50% (32/64) and 41% (11/27) of the patients in the obese and control groups, respectively (P = 0.34). There were no differences between total FSFI and FSFI domain scores among BMI categories. BDI scores were significantly higher in the obese groups than in healthy controls, and negatively correlated with total FSFI and all FSFI domain scores. Among hormonal analyses, only free testosterone levels were negatively correlated with total FSFI scores.

This study showed that obesity has no significant relationship with FSD, but obese patients were found to be in a more depressive mood than age-matched normal counterparts.
