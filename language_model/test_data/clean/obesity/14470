The distribution of cholesterol (C), triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL) and proteins in the different lipoproteins was studied in lean and obese Zucker rats under 2 conditions: non-operated and after portacaval anastomosis (PCA). All lipoproteins, but mainly the d less than 1.006 g/ml (chylomicrons + VLDL) fraction, were increased in obese rats. They were hypertriglyceridemic (+ 675%) and hypercholesterolemic (+ 207%). PCA decreased cholesterolemia by about 50% and triglyceridemia by 50-70% in both lean and obese rats. Except for VLDL, enriched in TG in obese rats, proportions of C, TG, PL and proteins in lipoproteins were about the same in obese and lean Zucker rats and were nearly unchanged by PCA, suggesting an increased number of particles in obese rats and a decreased number after PCA. Lipoproteins of obese rats were enriched in apo C and proportions of apo E and apo B were decreased in the d less than 1.006 g/ml fraction. PCA decreased the proportion of apo C in all lipoproteins.
