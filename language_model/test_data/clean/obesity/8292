Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) plays a key role in obesity-related insulin resistance and inflammation which may be involved in the pathogenesis of sarcopenic obesity (SO). This study examined the association of SO with serum A-FABP levels in Korean adults.

Two hundred ninety eight adults aged 20-70 years were examined using dual X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography and measuring serum A-FABP levels. Sarcopenia was defined as the appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) divided by weight (%) of &< SD below the mean values of young adults in both sexes. Obesity was defined as visceral fat area (VFA) â‰¥ 100 cm(2).

Serum A-FABP levels were higher in groups with SO compared to non-SO groups in both men and women. In the unadjusted model, serum A-FABP levels were positively associated with VFA and negatively associated with ASM/weight. Even after adjusting for possible confounding factors, ASM/weight was found to be independently and negatively associated with serum A-FABP levels. In addition, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that increased serum levels of A-FABP were independently associated with the presence of SO.

The present findings indicate that serum A-FABP levels may be valuable markers of the presence of SO.
