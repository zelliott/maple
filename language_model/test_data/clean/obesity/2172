As well as improving diagnostic and clinical outcomes for affected patients, understanding the genetic basis of rare human metabolic disorders has resulted in several fundamental biological insights. In some cases understanding extreme phenotypes has also informed thinking about more prevalent metabolic diseases. Insulin resistance underpins the twin epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes as well as accounting for many of the metabolic problems encompassed by the term metabolic syndrome. This review provides a brief update on current understanding of human severe insulin resistance syndromes, before highlighting recent insights provided by studies in these rare syndromes into the molecular pathogenesis of elements of the metabolic syndrome.
