To evaluate whether the inhibitory control of TSH and the stimulatory control of prolactin (PRL) secretion exerted by endogenous serotonin was altered in obesity, 22 obese men and 10 normal controls were tested with TRH (200 micrograms IV bolus) in the presence (experimental test) and absence (control test) of the serotonergic agonist fenfluramine (60 mg PO 90 min before TRH). Control and experimental tests were also performed in seven male patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and were repeated in the same obese subjects after substantial weight loss. Basal TSH levels were similar in control and obese men. Normal TSH responses to TRH (peak less than or equal to 14 mU/L) were observed in all normal controls (mean peak +/- SE 9.8 +/- 0.6 mU/L). In contrast, obese men were divided into two groups: nine in whom the TRH-induced TSH rise was higher than normal (group I: mean peak = 16.5 +/- 0.5 mU/L) and 13 in whom it was normal (group II: mean peak = 10.6 +/- 0.7 mU/L). The hypothyroid men all had elevated basal and TRH-stimulated TSH levels. Basal PRL concentrations were similar in the normal controls and both groups of obese subjects. The PRL response to TRH was lower in both group I and group II obese men than in normal controls and was similar between group I and group II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
