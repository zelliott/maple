Insulin secretion was studied in comparison with the glucose level in persons with disturbed glucose tolerance and in patients with type II diabetes mellitus using a glucose tolerance test and with regard for an obesity degree (the body weight index). The hyperinsulinism incidence in these groups was determined versus that of the controls. The correlation between a high insulin response and the glucose level was absent. Insulin-red blood cell binding was studied in patients with hyperinsulinism and disorder of this process was demonstrated. The hyperinsulinism rate decreased after the body weight index and the glucose level returned to normal.
