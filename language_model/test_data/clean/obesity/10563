Gynecologic oncology involves the study of preinvasive disease and cancers of the vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, ovaries, and gestational trophoblastic disease. Endometrial cancer is the most common of the pelvic malignancies however, ovarian cancer is the most lethal. The other gynecologic cancers have not been studied in relation to physical activity (PA) and prognosis, and therefore are not included. Research addressing the relationship between PA and ovarian and endometrial cancer is sparse nevertheless, there are some emerging concepts. Studies suggest that overweight/obesity is associated with reduced survival from ovarian cancer, but the role that PA plays in these results, and whether survival can be altered by changes in body weight and/or PA following diagnosis is unknown. Limited research reveals that increased PA in older ovarian cancer patients is feasible and safe. The majority of endometrial cancer patients are overweight or obese. Obesity is associated with higher mortality, probably from cardiovascular disease and not cancer. Research reveals that increasing PA in overweight/obese endometrial cancers is feasible and successful. The effects of increased PA on recurrence or survival in gynecological cancers are not yet established, and randomized controlled trials are needed for definitive data.
