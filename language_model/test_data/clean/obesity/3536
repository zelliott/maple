Metabolic syndrome describes a group of clinical features that together increase the incidence of coronary artery disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is a major risk factor for developing metabolic syndrome. A chronic state of inflammation accompanies the accumulation of surplus lipids in adipose and liver tissue, frequently involved in insulin resistance. 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-Oxo-dG) is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that inactivates both Rac1 and Rac2 which are critical to initiating the inflammatory responses in various cell types, including macrophages. In this study, we explored whether 8-Oxo-dG suppressed a series of systemic inflammatory cascades, resulting in the amelioration of typical features of metabolic syndrome in obese mice. The results demonstrate that 8-Oxo-dG effectively improved hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and fatty liver changes in obese mice. The level of biochemical markers indicative of systemic inflammation were reduced in 8-Oxo-dG treated mice, whereas serum levels of adiponectin, a crucial factor associated with improved metabolic syndrome, were enhanced. Our results demonstrate that 8-Oxo-dG effectively disrupts the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and obesity-associated metabolic syndrome.
