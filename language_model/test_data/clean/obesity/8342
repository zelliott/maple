The present study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics and etiology of overweight and obese (OO) individuals with diarrhea attending an urban Dhaka Hospital, International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research (icddr,b), Bangladesh.

Total of 508 under-5 children, 96 individuals of 5-19 years and 1331 of&>19 years were identified as OO from the Diarrheal Disease Surveillance System (DDSS) between 1993-2011. Two comparison groups such as well-nourished and malnourished individuals from respective age stratums were selected.

Isolation rate of rotavirus was higher among OO under-5 children compared to malnourished group (46% vs. 28%). Rotavirus infection among OO individuals aged 5-19 years (9% vs. 3%) (9% vs. 3%) and&>19 years (6% vs. 4%) (6% vs. 3%) was higher compared to well-nourished and malnourished children. Conversely, Vibrio cholerae was lower among all OO age groups compared to well-nourished and malnourished ones. Shigella (4% vs. 6%) (4% vs. 8%), and Campylobacter (3% vs. 5%) (3% vs. 5%) were lower only among OO in&>19 years individuals compared to their counterparts of the same age stratum. Salmonella was similarly isolated in all age strata and nutritional groups. In multinomial logistic regression among under-5 children, significant association was observed only with use of antimicrobials at home [OR-1.97] and duration of hospital stay [OR-0.68]. For individuals aged 5-19 years, use of antimicrobials at home (OR-1.83), some or severe dehydration (OR-3.12), having received intravenous saline (OR-0.46) and rotavirus diarrhea (OR-2.96) were found to be associated with OO respectively. Moreover, significant associations were also found for duration of diarrhea before coming to hospital &>24 hours) (OR-1.24), Shigella (OR-0.46), and Campylobacter (OR-0.58) among&>19 years OO individuals along with other associated co-variates in 5-19 years group (all p&<.05).

Higher proportion of OO were infected with rotavirus and a greater proportion of them used antimicrobials before coming to the hospital.
