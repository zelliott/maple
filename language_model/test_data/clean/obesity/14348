I have devised a nomogram [corrected] that allows easy determination of a person's body mass index (BMI), i.e., by simply drawing a single line on the graph to connect the height and weight. Conversely, the body weight corresponding to an arbitrary BMI may be determined similarly. This nomogram [corrected] is a useful and convenient tool in that it can be printed on a sheet of paper.
