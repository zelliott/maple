Both obesity and the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are commonly seen in women of reproductive age. Fifty percent of all patients with PCOS are obese, and the presence of obesity affects the clinical manifestations of PCOS. The underlying pathogenetic mechanisms appear to involve insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, the magnitude of which is greater in obese than in non-obese women with PCOS. Specific effects of obesity on the manifestations of PCOS, underlying mechanisms of the interactions between obesity and PCOS, and therapeutic implications of these interactions are discussed in this article.
