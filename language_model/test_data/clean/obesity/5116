The causative factors of atherosclerosis are not exhaustively known as yet. Atherosclerosis may be induced or supported by several environmental risk factors. The disease begins already in childhood or adolescence; consequently, preventive measures have to commence in these periods. In the paediatric consultative care, special attention should be paid mainly to hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and obesity. Standard examination procedures at a paediatric consulting station as well as at preventive examinations in the nursery, primary, and secondary schools should include blood pressure measurement, commencing in children aged 4 years. Fat metabolism should be examined mainly in children with familial history of cardiovascular diseases. Education concerning a healthy life regimen with rational nutrition and sufficient physical activity should not be neglected, either.
