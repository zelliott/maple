Adipose tissue (AT) plays a major role in the low-grade inflammatory state associated with obesity. The aim of the present study was to characterize the human AT lymphocytes (ATLs) and to analyze their interactions with adipocytes.

Human ATL subsets were characterized by flow cytometry in subcutaneous ATs from 92 individuals with body mass index (BMI) ranging from 19 to 43 kg/m(2) and in paired biopsies of subcutaneous and visceral AT from 45 class II/III obese patients. CD3(+) ATLs were composed of effector and memory CD4(+) helper and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells. The number of ATLs correlated positively with BMI and was higher in visceral than subcutaneous AT. Mature adipocytes stimulated the migration of ATLs and released the chemokine CCL20, the receptor of which (CCR6) was expressed in ATLs. The expression of adipocyte CCL20 was positively correlated with BMI and increased in visceral compared to subcutaneous adipocytes. ATLs expressed inflammatory markers and released interferon gamma (IFN gamma). Progenitor and adipocyte treatment with ATL-conditioned media reduced the insulin-mediated upregulation of lipogenic enzymes, an effect involving IFN gamma.

Therefore, crosstalk occurs between adipocytes and lymphocytes within human AT involving T cell chemoattraction by adipocytes and modulation of lipogenesis by ATLs.
