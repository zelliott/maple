The Department of Agriculture's MyPyramid is presented as food guidance for the US general public and not "a therapeutic diet for any specific health condition," although many adults in this country are overweight or obese and many experience diet-related disorders. This paper shows the recommendations in MyPyramid are remarkably consistent with the various recommendations to control obesity and diabetes, heart disease and stroke, hypertension, cancer, and osteoporosis. Specifically, the food intake recommendations are similar to those recommended by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Eating Plan, the American Heart Association, and the American Cancer Society; plus, the calculated nutrient intakes associated with following the guide are generally within the ranges of nutrient recommendations from the Clinical Guidelines on Overweight and Obesity, the American Diabetes Association, the National Cholesterol Education Program, the American Heart Association, the National Committee on High Blood Pressure, and the American Institute for Cancer Research. However, for actual nutrient levels to conform to dietary guidance, key assumptions regarding how closely individuals will follow the MyPyramid patterns must be made: an appropriate energy level must be selected and adhered to, and an appropriate profile of foods must be selected. These issues must be understood by food and nutrition professionals and disseminated to the public for MyPyramid to reach its potential.
