1. The feeding pattern, growth rate and energetic metabolism were studied in obese Zucker rats of 5-12 weeks of age kept at ambient temperatures of 22 or 10 degrees C. 2. During this period, the increment in obesity of the 22 degrees C-exposed animal was found to be due to diurnal hyperphagia and not to a lowered resting metabolism. 3. In the 10 degrees C-exposed rat the development of non-shivering thermogenesis associated with a lack of enhancement of food intake leads to prevent the obesity.
