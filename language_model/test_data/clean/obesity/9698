Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease may be evident in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), both conditions being associated with obesity and insulin resistance. However, few studies have accounted for the high prevalence of obesity in PCOS.

The aim of this study was to determine whether PCOS is independently associated with hepatic steatosis, compared with healthy controls of similar age and body mass index (BMI), and whether steatosis is associated with hyperandrogenemia.

We conducted a cross-sectional, case-control study at two tertiary referral centers.

Twenty-nine women with PCOS diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria [aged 28 yr; 95% confidence interval (CI), 26-31; BMI, 33 kg/m2; 95% CI, 31-36] and 22 healthy controls (aged 29 yr; 95% CI, 28-31; BMI, 30 kg/m2; 95% CI, 28-33) were studied.

Proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy quantified hepatic and skeletal muscle fat; whole body magnetic resonance imaging quantified internal, visceral, and sc adipose tissue volumes. Differences were assessed between PCOS and controls using t tests, and between hyperandrogenic (HA) PCOS, PCOS with normal androgens (NA), and controls using analysis of covariance.

After statistical adjustment for BMI, HA-PCOS had significantly higher liver fat vs. NA-PCOS (3.7%; 95% CI, 0.6-13.1) and vs. controls (2.1%; 95% CI, 0.3-6.6). Similarly, after adjustment for homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, internal and visceral adipose tissue volumes, liver fat remained significantly greater in HA-PCOS compared to NA-PCOS and controls.

These data suggest that HA-PCOS is associated with hepatic steatosis, independent of obesity and insulin resistance.
