We enrolled 5,451 patients with ultrasound-confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), including 2,892 women and 2,559 men, from 183 United States sites in our prospective registry. The 5 most frequent co-morbidities were hypertension (50%), surgery within 3 months (38%), immobility within 30 days (34%), cancer (32%), and obesity (27%). Of the 2,726 patients who had their DVT diagnosed while in the hospital, only 1,147 (42%) received prophylaxis within 30 days before diagnosis.
