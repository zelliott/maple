Most physicians do not consider peritoneal dialysis (PD) to be the treatment of choice in obese patients with end-stage renal failure. In some but not all studies the incidence of infectious complications (catheter-associated infections and peritonitis) is higher than in patients with normal body mass index (BMI). Although mathematical models show that even continuous ambulatory PD with a daily dialysate treatment volume of 12 litres does not provide sufficient clearances in patients weighing 80 kg, adequate dialysis has been achieved in clinical studies in patients with BMI up to 46 kg/m2. Residual renal function is a very important factor for survival in patients undergoing PD and might be influenced by body weight; however, data are controversial, showing either a negative influence of high BMI on renal clearance or no association. The incidence of peritoneal leaks in PD is higher in obese patients than in other patients, because of the raised intra-abdominal pressure. In contrast, hernias do not occur more frequently in overweight PD patients and the risk of hernias seems to be greater in patients with lower BMI. It is well known that mortality rates of overweight patients on hemodialysis are lower than in those with normal body weight, but data on the influence of BMI on survival in PD patients are more controversial. In conclusion, there is no evidence that PD is absolutely contraindicated in patients with high BMI, especially if patients have a strong preference for this type of treatment.
