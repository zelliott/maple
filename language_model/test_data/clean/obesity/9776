Alterations in the phenotypes of macrophages in adipose tissue play a key role in inflammation and insulin resistance (IR). The phenotypes of macrophages in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and the relationship between proinflammation markers and IR in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remain unclear. The objectives of this study are to characterize the gene expression of macrophage markers and cytokines in the SAT of PCOS women and to estimate their relationships with circulating levels of cytokines and IR.

The cross-sectional study involves 16 PCOS women and 18 normal control women. Cytokines and macrophage markers in the circulation and SAT were determined using ELISA, quantitative PCR, or immunofluorescence staining. IR was estimated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR).

The gene expression levels of CD11c along with TNF α and leptin in SAT remained significantly higher in PCOS women than in normal women (P&<.05). However, no significant differences were found in CD68 mRNA expression in SAT between women with and without PCOS (&>0.05). Furthermore, CD11c mRNA abundance provided a stronger contribution to models predicting serum levels of TNFα (sTNFα) than did CD68 mRNA abundance. Lastly, increased sTNFα was associated with increased HOMA-IR in PCOS women, and this association was independent of both overall and visceral adiposity.

The high expression level of CD11c mRNA in SAT was proved to be an important feature in PCOS women. Furthermore, CD11c mRNA abundance made a stronger contribution to models predicting sTNFα in which existing proinflammatory properties might significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of IR in PCOS women.
