Controversy prevails regarding the existence of a correlation between the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the extent and distribution of obesity.

To assess the correlation between total fat, truncal fat (TF), and lean mass, obtained with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and standard anthropomorphic indices (body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) and to verify whether DEXA indices can predict the extent and severity of CAD.

Fifty-eight patients (19 females) consecutively referred for coronary angiography underwent physical examination and DEXA assessment of body composition.

Of the 58 patients enrolled, 22 were overweight and 13 were obese. Significant CAD was found in 39 (67%) patients. DEXA-derived total mass and fat mass enabled us to distinguish overweight from obese patients (P&<.005), whereas just TF mass correlated with the number of diseased vessels after adjusting for body mass index, sex, age, and smoking habit (odds ratio, 8.68; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-74.10).

TF determined by DEXA is independently related with CAD extension.
