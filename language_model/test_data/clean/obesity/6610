Obesity is an emerging risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the developed world. Orlistat, an intestinal lipase inhibitor, used in the treatment of obesity is available as an over-the-counter medication across the European union and in many countries worldwide. It is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). We present three adults, followed up from 1 to 6 years, who developed de novo or worsening renal impairment while on orlistat. Stopping the drug halted progression, but did not reverse the degree of renal impairment at presentation.
