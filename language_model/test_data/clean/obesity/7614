Black soybean seed coat extract (BE) is a polyphenol-rich food material consisting of 9.2% cyanidin 3-glucoside, 6.2% catechins, 39.8% procyanidins, and others. This study demonstrated that BE ameliorated obesity and glucose intolerance by up-regulating uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and down-regulating inflammatory cytokines in C57BL/6 mice fed a control or high-fat diet containing BE for 14 weeks. BE suppressed fat accumulation in mesenteric adipose tissue, reduced the plasma glucose level, and enhanced insulin sensitivity in the high-fat diet-fed mice. The gene and protein expression levels of UCP-1 in brown adipose tissue and UCP-2 in white adipose tissue were up-regulated by BE. Moreover, the gene expression levels of major inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-Î± and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were remarkably decreased by BE in white adipose tissue. BE is a beneficial food material for the prevention of obesity and diabetes by enhancing energy expenditure and suppressing inflammation.
