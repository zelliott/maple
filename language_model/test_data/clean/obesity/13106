Dietary fat has been reported to influence insulin sensitivity.

The objective of the study was to determine how identical weight loss (target: loss of 8% of body weight over 3-6 mo) in women taking orlistat or placebo combined with a hypocaloric diet influences body composition and insulin sensitivity.

Forty-seven obese women [body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 32.1 +/- 0.4] were randomly assigned to receive either orlistat (120 mg 3 times daily; n = 23) or placebo (n = 24) with a hypocaloric diet. Whole-body insulin sensitivity (insulin clamp technique), serum fatty acids, and body composition (magnetic resonance imaging) were measured before and after weight loss.

The groups did not differ significantly at baseline with respect to age, body weight, intraabdominal and subcutaneous fat volumes, or insulin sensitivity. Weight loss did not differ significantly between the orlistat (7.3 +/- 0.2 kg, or 8.3 +/- 0.1%) and placebo (7.4 +/- 0.2 kg, or 8.2 +/- 0.1%) groups. Insulin sensitivity improved significantly (P &<0.001) and similarly after weight loss in the orlistat (from 4.0 +/- 0.3 to 5.1 +/- 0.3 mg x kg fat-free mass(-1) x min(-1)) and placebo (from 4.4 +/- 0.4 to 5.4 +/- 0.4 mg x kg fat-free mass(-1) x min(-1)) groups. Intraabdominal fat and subcutaneous fat decreased significantly in both groups, but the ratio of the 2 decreased significantly only in the orlistat group. The proportion of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3n-6) in serum phospholipids was inversely related to insulin sensitivity both before (r = -0.48, P &<0.001) and after (r = -0.46, P &<0.001) weight loss, but it did not change significantly in either group.

Weight loss rather than inhibition of fat absorption enhances insulin sensitivity. A decrease in fat absorption by orlistat appears to favorably influence the ratio between intraabdominal and subcutaneous fat, which suggests that exogenous fat or its composition influences fat distribution.
