Study of overweight and obesity among women from modest neighborhoods in Casablanca and the related factors influencing this phenomenon.

A survey was conducted in 6 neighborhoods of Casablanca using multistage cluster sampling. Anthropometric parameters and body composition were measured, and information about food habits, sociodemographic situation and body image perception were collected using a questionnaire.

425 adult women from popular neighborhoods in Casablanca.

We found a prevalence of 47% obesity and 36% overweight. Obesity and overweight exceeded 80% in all age categories except among women &<25 years, where we found a prevalence of 44% overweight. Furthermore, abdominal obesity prevalence was high in all age categories with an overall prevalence of 67%. Body image perception data showed that 62% women perceived their weight as being either normal or insufficient, 46% of those women were, in fact, either overweight or obese. Fattening products were used by 12% of the population at least once, especially by women &<35 years, 68% of these women were overweight or obese at the time of the study.

The problem of obesity in this society is amplified by its perception of a regular weight and by the use of fattening substances even among young and educated women.
