Studies were conducted to evaluate the role of water-sodium metabolism on the hypertensive mechanisms in obese patients with essential hypertension (EHT). The obesity index correlated positively with the mean arterial pressure, plasma volume, extracellular fluid volume or total exchangeable sodium, and negatively with plasma noradrenaline concentration or plasma renin activity in EHT. Hypotensive effects of sodium restriction (Na 35 mEq, K 75 mEq) or the natriuretic response to infused dopamine (3 micrograms/kg/min) was remarkable in obese EHT. Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), which reflects the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, was significantly lower in obese EHT than that in non-obese or mildly obese EHT. Urinary excretion of free dopamine (UDA) had a positive relationship with simultaneously measured urinary excretion of sodium or FENa. In addition, UDA correlated positively with the obesity index in patients whose weight was under 115% of the ideal weight. On the contrary, the relation between the two parameters was significantly negative in patients whose weight was over 115% of the ideal weight. These findings suggest that the expansion of body fluid volume and sodium, which might result from the blunted natriuretic ability, at least in part, due to an attenuation of the renal dopaminergic activity, play an important role of the hypertensive mechanisms in obese EHT.
