Insulin resistance has a central role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease. Adipose tissue is of capital importance in view of its production of adipokines. The present study aims to determine the association of metabolic syndrome components, which constitute risk factors for cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease, and leptin and adiponectin with insulin resistance in prepubertal children.

We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 197 children. Of these, 112 children were obese, 36 were overweight and 49 had normal weight. The association of sex, waist circumference, Acanthosis nigricans, age, BMI Z-score, serum lipids, leptin and adipocytokines with insulin resistance [defined as the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index higher than or equal to 2.5] was investigated using logistic regression.

There was positive association of sex (female), age, BMI Z-score, triglycerides and leptin with insulin resistance (p&<.05).

Among the conventional components of metabolic syndrome, the role of BMI Z-score and triglycerides stands out in insulin resistance of prepubertal children. Sex (female), age and leptin also showed to be of major importance.
