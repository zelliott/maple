In 1961, 1971 and 1983 additional medical parameters, among them body length and body weight, were established during the mass radiographies in the district of Wurzen. From the data of 7,670 males from the year 1983 for two 10-year age groups regression equations between body weight and body length were determined. The calculation of relative weights was performed on the basis of the optimum weights after Ott. The longitudinal comparison from 1961 to 1971 resulted in an increase of the number of persons with overweight by 17.7% during 10 years. The results of the examinations of the year 1983 showed that the trend to the increase of body weight continues in the male inhabitants of the district of Wurzen.
