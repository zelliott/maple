One of the factors of the reproductive status which affects bone mass of women in the generative period is duration of lactation. The aim of this study was to establish if duration of lactation affects bone mass of postmenopausal women. 81 women up to 5 years of menopause were examined. They were divided into two groups in regard to lactation duration. The first group consisted of those who breast-fed for up to 12 months, while the second group consisted of those who had breast-fed longer than 12 months. In all examined women lumbar bone mineral density was measured using photon absorptiometry. No statistically significant difference was established in the lumbar bone mineral density in the examined groups (0.902 +/- 0.104 g/cm2 to 0.915 +/- 0.127 g/cm2; p &<0.30). In order to eliminate the protective effects of obesity on bone mass all examinees were divided into 4 subgroups: a) nonobese women with up to 12 months of lactation; b) nonobese women with lactation longer than 12 months. c) obese women with up to 12 months of lactation and d) obese women with lactation longer than 12 months. Lumbar bone mineral density of nonobese women, no matter the duration of lactation, did not statistically significantly differ (0.892 +/- 0.107 g/cm2 to 0.900 +/- 0.116 g/cm2; p &<0.40). No statistically significant difference in regard to lumbar bone mineral density was established in the group of obese women, no matter the duration of lactation (0.912 +/- 0.103 g/cm2 to 0.930 +/- 0.139 g/cm2; p &<0.30). The obtained results reveal that bone mass reduction is reversible in the postpartal period and that duration of lactation does not affect bone mass in the postmenopausal period.
