To investigate the association between obesity and peri- or postoperative complications after hysterectomy for nonmalignant bleeding disorders.

Data from 444 vaginal hysterectomies and 503 abdominal hysterectomies indicated by benign bleeding disorders were drawn from a regional database. Data on peri- or postoperative complications and postoperative stay were related to preoperative body mass index (BMI).

Obesity was related to longer operation time for vaginal as well as abdominal hysterectomy and to large perioperative blood loss for vaginal hysterectomy only. No association was found between BMI and serious complications such as ileus, infection or hematomas except for a higher prevalence of wound hematoma after abdominal hysterectomy in underweight and normal weight patients. Neither was any association found between BMI and use of blood transfusion, reoperation or prolonged postoperative stay.

Vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy have a significant risk of complications, but obese patients did not experience an increased risk of serious morbidity compared to normal weight women. Obesity per se is not a contraindication of vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy in otherwise healthy women.
