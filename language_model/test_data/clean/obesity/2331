The presence of obesity and the features of metabolic syndrome plays a predictive role in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in adults. It seems reasonable to seek new risk factors in the development of CVD. Defining the genetic background of obesity could help to select patients from a high risk group and help to introduce prevention and treatment, which, in consequence, lead to the lowering of morbidity and mortality. One of the genes probably related to the body weight is the Fat Mass and Obesity Associated Gene (FTO).

of the study was an attempt to assess the relationship between the FTO polymorphism rs9939609 and body mass index in children from Podlaskie voievodship.

405 children aged 4-18 were selected for the study. The examination included body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure and lipid profile analysis. FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was assessed using a discrimination allele method with the application of ABI 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System.

FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was related to the standarized body mass index and the AA genotype carriers had a higher risk of obesity. This polymorphism was also associated with waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and triglycerides concentration. It was not correlated with diastolic blood pressure and total HDL- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations.

Our results demonstrate that rs9939609 FTO gene polymorphism is related to the body mass index in children. Our results should be confirmed in studies on a large cohort of healthy Polish children.
