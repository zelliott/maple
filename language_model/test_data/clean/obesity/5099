The metabolic response to exercise in obese postabsorptive noninsulin-dependent diabetics was compared to that of obese nondiabetics. Exercise consisted of 45 min on a cycle ergometer at 60% maximum oxygen consumption. Six diabetic subjects were studied during oral hypoglycemic therapy and four on diet alone. The sulfonylurea therapy had no effect on the response. Glycemia was elevated at rest in both diabetic subgroups (192 +/- 24 mg/dl for diet alone, 226 +/- 36 mg/dl for sulfonylurea treatment) and a similar fall (35 and 37 mg/dl, respectively) occurred with exercise. In control subjects, glycemia was 86 +/- 4 mg/dl and did not change with exercise. In the diabetics at rest, glucose production was elevated (220 +/- 25 mg/min), whereas the metabolic clearance of glucose was suppressed. During exercise the increase in glucose utilization was similar to that in controls, but glucose production failed to increase significantly, thus accounting for the decline in plasma glucose. At rest, plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI) was elevated to 0.90 ng/ml in the controls and decreased to 0.65 ng/ml with exercise. In the diabetics IRI was similarly elevated (0.89 ng/ml) but failed to decrease normally with exercise. Lactate, pyruvate, alanine, and free fatty acids increased similarly in diabetics and controls, whereas the increase in 3-hydroxybutyrate during recovery was less in diabetics. The sustained insulinemia, the basal overproduction of glucose, and hyperglycemia itself may all contribute to the observed differences in glucose flux during exercise in noninsulin-dependent diabetics.
