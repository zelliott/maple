Obesity is a well-known risk factor for arterial hypertension. The aim of this study was to analyze which surrogate marker of adiposity, i.e., body mass index (BMI) or fat mass (FM), as measured by bioimpedance analysis (BIA), best correlated with blood pressure in healthy children. Body weight, height, and casual blood pressure (BP) were measured in 193 healthy children (103 boys), aged 8-16 years. Body composition was determined by BIA. The correlation between BMI and age was linear, whereas the correlation between percentage of FM and age was nonlinear and it was different in boys and girls. Blood pressure standard deviation scores (SDS) correlated with FM SDS (BIA) over the entire normal range (systolic: r = 0.26, p = 0.002; diastolic: r = 0.33, p &<0.01). An evaluation of the children based on BP (three groups: BP &<50th percentile, 50th &<BP&> 95th percentile; BP&> 95th percentile) revealed that hypertensive children had a higher BMI (17.6 vs. 19.4 vs. 26.2 kg/m(2), respectively) and a greater FM (14.0 vs. 16.8 vs. 30.2%, respectively). In conclusion, the divergence in FM in healthy boys and girls can be determined by BIA but not by BMI. In healthy children, BP within the entire normal range correlated with FM, children with established hypertension presented with a significantly higher FM. The study points to FM as an important determinant of BP pressure in obese and non-obese children.
