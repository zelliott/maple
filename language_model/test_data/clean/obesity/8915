The aim was to determine in what areas the therapeutic application of soy predominates in clinical trials and to assess the emerging fields of its use by means of an analysis of bibliographic resources. A search was performed in the MEDLINE database up to 31 december 2004, limited to the Title/Abstract field, and Clinical Trials as the type of publication. The abstracts from the publications selected (n=86) were reviewed and different variables were assessed. A total of 3280 subjects were included: 15% men and 59% women (71% postmenopausal). The studies were performed basically in healthy individuals (71%). Twenty five percent of the studies investigated plasma levels of different metabolites and 21% determined hormone or lipid profiles. After the year 2000 a new population focus was detected, with the publication of two studies in elite gymnasts and judoists, with positive results. The present observations indicate that soy supplementation in the competitive sports elite may be an emerging application.
