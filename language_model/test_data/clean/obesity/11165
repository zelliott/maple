Serum retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) has been proposed as a metabolic risk factor in obesity. We found that RBP4 levels also were associated with liver enzymes and cystatin C. Oxidant stress is a significant feature in obese children with greater values of RBP4 that can mediate the development of comorbidities.
