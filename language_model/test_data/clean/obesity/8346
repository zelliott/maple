(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) is the preferred technique for noninvasive quantification of hepatic triglyceride in humans. Domestic cats are subject to liver lipid accumulation, but MRS has not been investigated for quantification of liver fat in cats. The purpose of this project was to explore a technique for (1)H MRS measurement of hepatic triglyceride in lean and obese cats. Hepatic (1)H MRS was performed, using a 3T imaging unit and a single-voxel spin-echo spectroscopy sequence, on 6 lean (3.3-4.6 kg) and 12 obese cats (5.2-9.8 kg). Median liver fat percentages in lean and obese cats were 1.3% and 6.8%, respectively. Results are biologically plausible, based on chemical assay in a separate group of cats; however, full validation of the method is necessary before other conclusions can be drawn. This report should provide a foundation for the further development of spectroscopic techniques for studying hepatic lipid accumulation in cats.
