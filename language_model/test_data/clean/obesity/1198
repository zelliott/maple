To assess the level of serum lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in nonobese and obese NIDDM subjects with android body distribution.

Serum Lp(a) levels were measured in 30 long-standing NIDDM patients (duration of diabetes 12.5 +/- 3 years, mean +/- SD), with 15 of the patients being obese of android distribution (BMI&> 30 kg/m2 and waist-to-hip ratio&> 0.8). In addition, there were 15 android obese nondiabetic subjects and 10 healthy subjects serving as the control group.

All groups of patients in this study (diabetic, obese, and obese diabetic) showed significantly higher levels of Lp(a) than the healthy control group. Lp(a) concentrations were significantly higher in NIDDM patients with android type of obesity than in nondiabetic androids (24.1 +/- 5.6 vs. 14.8 +/- 2.4 mg/dl, P &<0.001). Significantly greater levels of Lp(a) were found in nonobese subjects with diabetes when compared with obese subjects without diabetes (22.3 +/- 4.1 vs. 14.8 +/- 2.4 mg/dl, P &<0.001). Furthermore, Lp(a) serum concentrations were not dependent on the degree of glycemic control (controlled NIDDM 23.6 +/- 5.0 vs. uncontrolled NIDDM 21.4 +/- 2.7 mg/dl, NS), but were much greater in subjects with diabetes complicated by vascular disease (complicated 26.3 +/- 5.0 vs. uncomplicated 20.5 +/- 2.7 mg/dl, P &<0.001). No correlation was found between Lp(a) and other lipid parameters in this study.

Lp(a) levels are significantly elevated in both android-obese and nonobese NIDDM patients regardless of the degree of glycemic control. Lp(a) is an independent risk factor showing greater elevations in those subjects complicated with diabetic vascular diseases.
