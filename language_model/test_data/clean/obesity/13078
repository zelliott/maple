To compare the validity of a careful clinical examination with venous Doppler studies in the management of patients presenting with varicose veins.

Ninety-five consecutive patients presenting with varicose veins from September 1998 to August 1999 were included in this study. Of the 95 patients, 52 were males and 43 females. Eighty-four were expatriate laborers and 11 Kuwaiti nationals. Seventy-one were active workers under the age of 30. All of the patients underwent a full clinical examination for varicose veins, and a management plan was developed for each patient prior to Doppler venous study. The results of the Doppler studies were then compared with the clinical examination results, and the management plan was changed, if necessary, based on the Doppler results.

Both clinical and Doppler examinations were equally effective in diagnosing primary varicose vein and identifying sites of venous incompetence. A family history for varicose veins was found in 21% and standing for a long period of time was a risk factor in 51% patients. The most common symptoms were pain and heaviness. Doppler study findings were useful in changing the management plan of 14 (15%) patients, 6 with recurrent varicose vein and 8 obese patients with chronic venous insufficiency. The majority of the patients (n = 82) benefited from surgery and were free of symptoms.

This prospective study demonstrated that detailed clinical examination was sufficient to diagnose most patients suffering from primary varicose veins. Doppler vascular studies were useful in changing the treatment modality for those presenting with recurrent varicose vein or obese patients with signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency with no clinically clear varicosity.
