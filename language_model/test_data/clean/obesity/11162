Maternal anemia and several complications of pregnancy can affect fetal iron acquisition.

Because it is unknown whether the effects of demographic and maternal risk factors (RF) are summative, we examined cord iron status in newborns with multiple RF for acquiring iron deficiency.

Cord blood indices from healthy control newborns with and without RF for newborn or infant iron deficiency were studied.

Newborns with greater RF had poorer erythrocyte and storage iron status. Poorest status was seen if mothers with comorbid obesity and diabetes delivered large-for-gestation newborns. Findings highlight the importance of identifying RF.
