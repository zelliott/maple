To test the hypotheses that obese adolescents have a lower resting metabolic rate and less aerobic endurance than their nonobese siblings.

Case-referent study of obese and nonobese siblings from the same kindred.

Tertiary referral center.

Telephone screening of community volunteers resulted in a consecutive sample of 16 kindreds. Obese and nonobese siblings were similar in age, height, and pubertal status. Significantly more female subjects were in the obese group (p less than 0.01).

Body composition studies revealed that the obese siblings had higher body fat (p less than 0.001) but that fat-free mass was similar to that of the lean siblings. Resting metabolic rates determined by indirect calorimetry for the obese and nonobese pairs did not differ. Although the obese siblings appeared less fit when maximal oxygen consumption was measured in relation to total weight, maximal oxygen consumption did not differ when values were standardized for fat-free mass.

The obese adolescents did not have a reduced resting metabolic rate. As in adults, the relationship between resting metabolic rate and fat-free mass was similar for obese and nonobese children and adolescents. Any decreased sport participation by the obese siblings was not due to inherent reductions in aerobic capacity.
