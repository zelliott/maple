Acute superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS) following a major surgical procedure is extremely rare, and represents an iatrogenic cause of postoperative upper gastrointestinal obstruction. In this report, the first documented case of acute SMAS following a left hemicolectomy is presented in an obese patient. Upper gastrointestinal roentgenographic series and conservative management remain to be the first line diagnostic and therapeutic modalities and were successful in our patient. Up to date no patient with SMAS reported to be obese but apparently obesity per se, can not be considered as an insurance. A postoperative acute SMAS is impossible to predict depending on the previous history, predisposing factors and the physique of the patient. Therefore, the surgeon should be aware of the SMAS and it is his task to secure all the precautions in order to preclude excessive traction on the mesenteric vasculature and vascular compression of the duodenum during surgery. In cases in which SMAS is suspected during extended colonic resections with lymph node dissection, duodenal mobilization seems to be selectively justifiable.
