The purpose of this study was to evaluate the serum chemistry profiles and the degree of protein binding of six sulfonamides in the sera of genetically obese Zucker rats and their lean litter mates. Free fatty acid concentrations were significantly elevated in the serum of obese rats. Obese rat serum had a mean fraction unbound for sulfanilamide, sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine, sulfamerazine, sulfisomidine, and sulfisoxazole which was significantly higher than that found in the lean rat serum. Altered serum chemistry and/or pathological states may play a significant role in altering drug protein interactions.
