A series of pentapeptides, based on hMC4R pentapeptide agonist (Bu-His(6)-DPhe(7)-Arg(8)-Trp(9)-Gly(10)-NH(2)), was prepared in which either DPhe(7) or Trp(9) residue was systematically substituted. A number of interesting DPhe surrogates (D-Thi, D-3-CF(3)Phe, D-2-Nal and D-3,4-diClPhe) as well as Trp surrogates (2-Nal and Bta) were identified in this study.
