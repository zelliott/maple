Over the past two decades, adiponectin has been studied in more than eleven thousand publications. A classical adipokine, adiponectin was among the first factors secreted from adipose tissue that were found to promote metabolic function. Circulating levels of adiponectin consistently decline with increasing body mass index. Clinical and basic science studies have identified adiponectin's cardiovascular-protective actions, providing a mechanistic link to the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in obese individuals. While progress has been made in identifying receptors essential for the metabolic actions of adiponectin (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2), few studies have examined the receptor-mediated signaling pathways in cardiovascular tissues. T-cadherin, a GPI-anchored adiponectin-binding protein, was recently identified as critical for the cardiac-protective and revascularization actions of adiponectin. Adiponectin is abundantly present on the surfaces of vascular and muscle tissues through a direct interaction with T-cadherin. Consistent with this observation, adiponectin is absent from T-cadherin-deficient tissues. Since T-cadherin lacks an intracellular domain, additional studies would further our understanding of this signaling pathway. Here, we review the diverse cardiometabolic actions of adiponectin.
