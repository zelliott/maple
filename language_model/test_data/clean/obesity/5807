Obesity has become a major chronic disorder affecting a large population more than any other disease in the world. To study the prevalence of overweight and obesity among bus drivers and conductors of North-West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) in Belgaum, and to compare the prevalence of overweight and obesity among them the study had been undertaken in Belgaum. Randomly selected 365 drivers and 370 conductors were personally interviewed using predesigned, pretested structured questionnaire. Physical examination was done to measure height, weight, waist circumference and hip circumference. Body mass index was measured to assess overweight and obesity. Waist circumference and waist hip ratio were used to assess central obesity. Summary figures like rates were calculated. Chi- square test was used to test the difference of prevalence between drivers and conductors. The study showed that in drivers 43.3% were overweight, 22.2% were obese and 23.8% were having a waist circumference&> or = 102 cm. Among conductors 28.1% were overweight, 16.2% were obese and 18.1% were having a waist circumference of&> or = 102cm.The prevalence of over-weight and obesity was high among drivers compared to conductors. Drivers were also more centrally obese than conductors.These differences were found to be statistically significant. Considering the high prevalence of overweight and obesity among drivers and conductors, necessary preventive measures need to be promoted.
