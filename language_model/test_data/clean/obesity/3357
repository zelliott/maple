A study of the prevalence of arterial hypertension and obesity has been performed in the community of Hospitalet de Llobregat which is an industrial town of 289,000 inhabitants in the vicinity of Barcelona. We have studied a population sample of 801 individuals over the age of 19 years, randomly chosen from the elections lists from 1986, and who were classified according to age and sex. Four hundred and thirty two subjects (54%) had a Quetelet index (QI) of 25 or above. Out of these, 300 (38%) had a QI between 25-30 and 124 (16%) had a QI of 30 or above. Obesity prevalence defined as an QI greater than or = 25 was lower in the youngest group (20-39 years), both in males as in females, with a significant difference p less than 0.05). Arterial hypertension prevalence (SAP greater than 160 and/or DAP greater than 95 mmHg) was 19.8%. When individuals with DAP of 90-94 were included, prevalence was 25.7%. A positive correlation between QI and arterial blood pressure was found in the sample studied as a whole, both for systolic arterial pressure (r = 0.23; p less than 0.001; R2 = 0.053) as for diastolic arterial pressure (r = 0.23; p less than 0.001; R2 = 0.053). Arterial hypertension prevalence (SAP greater than 160 and or DAP greater than 90 mmHg plus those individuals with lower values but were on hypotensive treatment) was higher in obese individuals (QI greater than 25). The difference was statistically significant in males below 60. In females a tendency was observed in women below 40. (p = 0.054).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
