To investigate the effects of obesity on the lipid and glucose metabolism in female rats.

The litter size was adjusted to 4 pups per litter for the small litter (SL, treatment group) and 12 neonates per dam in the normal litter (NL, controls) at postnatal day 0. Body weights were measured weekly. At the age of 6 weeks, bilateral ovariectomy was performed. The blood levels of free fat acid, triglyceride, total cholesterol, free blood glucose and free insulin were evaluated. The muscular expression of AMP-activated protein kinase was detected by immune staining.

As compared to normal litters, the levels of fat acid, triglyceride, total cholesterol, free blood glucose and free insulin significantly increased. The muscular activity of AMP-activated protein kinase decreased. All difference were statistically significant (P &<0.05).

Obesity in early life has obvious effects on the lipid and glucose metabolism in female rats.
