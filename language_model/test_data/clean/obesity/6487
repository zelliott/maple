An attempt was made to associate the insertion-deletion (Ins/Del) polymorphism of the apolipoprotein B gene (apoB) with obesity and to identify alleles and genotypes predisposing to this disorder. The apoB Ins/Del allele frequencies observed in the Russian population were similar to those in West European populations and significantly differed from frequencies reported for Asian populations. Patients with obesity did not differ from healthy individuals in allele and genotype frequencies regardless of whether total or sex-stratified samples were compared. Estimation of relative risk for individuals with genotype Ins/Ins did not reveal a significant association between obesity and this genotype. Thus, constitutional exogenous obesity did not prove to be associated with the Ins/Del polymorphism of the apoB gene in the Russian population.
