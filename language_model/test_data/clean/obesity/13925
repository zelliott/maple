Obese individuals tend to be both insulin resistant and at increased risk to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD). Given the increased prevalence of obesity in the US population, we thought it important to define the relationship between degree of obesity and insulin-mediated glucose disposal in the population at large, as well as the relationship between obesity, insulin resistance, and CVD risk in these individuals. To do this we quantified insulin-mediated glucose disposal in 465 healthy volunteers by determining the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentrations at the end of a 180-minute infusion of somatostatin, insulin, and glucose. Adiposity was estimated by body mass index (BMI) and the relationship between BMI and SSPG defined. In addition, a series of CVD risk factors were measured, including blood pressure, plasma glucose, and insulin concentrations, before and after 75 g of oral glucose, and fasting plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations. The results indicated that SSPG concentration and BMI were significantly correlated (r = 0.54, P&>.001), and 36% of individuals in the most insulin-resistant tertile were obese (BMI&>/= 30.0 kg/m(2)). However, 16% of those in the most insulin-resistant tertile were of normal weight (BMI &<25.0 kg/m(2)). Although CVD risk factors were accentuated in general with progressive increases in either BMI or SSPG concentration, important differences were noted. Thus, the higher the SSPG concentration, the more the increase in plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride (TG) concentrations, whereas the greater the BMI, the higher the low-density lipoprotein concentration. Furthermore, while CVD risk factors increased significantly with each tertile of insulin resistance, significant differences in CVD risk were only apparent when the lowest BMI tertile was compared with the other 2, with the values in the middle and upper BMI differing from each other. These results show that while BMI and insulin resistance are related, they are not synonymous, and that they make independent and different contributions to increasing CVD risk.
