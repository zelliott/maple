I investigated the association between depression and percent body fat, two major global problems. Participants are 1,704 American women, ages 39-49, who responded to a detailed self-administered mailed questionnaire. My results showed a positive correlation; the adjusted OR = 1.70, 95% CI (1.20, 2.39), pÂ = .002. Percent body fat was estimated from age, height, and weight, a cost-free method that may be useful in areas in which dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, or other procedures are too costly or unavailable. My findings may aid health and mental health care providers in the management and treatment of patients seen in settings with limited resources.
