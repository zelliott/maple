To identify longitudinal variables related to children's body mass index (BMI) (kg/m(2)) at age 8 y.

A longitudinal design, with nine interviews per child from ages 2 to 8 y.

In all, 70 white children (37 males, 33 females) who were continuous participants since infancy in the longitudinal study. Families were primarily middle and upper socioeconomic status.

At each interview, children's height and weight were measured, and mothers provided 3 days of the child's intake data (a 24-h recall and 2 days of food records).

Analyses used were means+/-s.d., correlations, repeated measures analysis of variance, and forward stepwise regression. BMI at each interview was calculated and age of adiposity rebound was determined.

Children's BMI at 8 y was negatively predicted by age of adiposity rebound and positively predicted by their BMI at 2 y. Additionally, each model included one longitudinal dietary variable; mean protein and fat intakes recorded between 2 and 8 y were positive predictors of BMI at 8 y; mean carbohydrate intake over the same time period was negatively related to BMI at 8 y. R(2) values indicated that these three-variable models predicted 41-43% of the variability in BMI among children. BMI of 23% of the children exceeded the 85th CDC percentile.

The results of this study show that factors in early life are associated with children's BMI at age 8 y.
