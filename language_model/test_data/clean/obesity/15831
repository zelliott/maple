To define the prevalence of overweight and obesity among school-aged children resident in mountain areas, rural areas and urban areas.

The sample (n = 12832; 50.7% boys) included 9- and 11-year-old children of the Veneto Region of north-east Italy. Overweight and obesity status were determined using the International Obesity Task Force cut-off points for body mass index. The prevalence of overweight and obese subjects was calculated with a confidence interval of 95%. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to compare the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity among children resident in mountain areas, rural areas and urban areas.

Among boys the prevalence of overweight was 21.06%, while obesity prevalence was 5.92%; among girls overweight prevalence was 21.30%, while obesity prevalence was 5.15%. The prevalence was higher among 11-year-old boys (odds ratio (OR) = 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.33) and 9-year-old girls (OR = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01-1.26). Children resident in rural areas presented a higher risk of overweight and obesity compared with children resident in mountain areas (Mantel-Haenszel OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.13-1.42; chi2 = 17.55; P &<0.0001) and in urban areas (Mantel-Haenszel OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.07-1.31; chi2 = 10.39; P &<0.001).

A relevant prevalence of overweight and obesity was found; the excess weight concerns one child in four. There are differences linked to different geographical areas that must be further investigated.
