Association of maternal angiopoietin-like protein 6 (Angptl6) levels with subsequent development of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH).

At 24 and 32 weeks of gestation in 47 relatively overweight (BMI ≥ 24 kg/m(2)), nulliparous pregnant women serum concentrations of Angptl6 were quantified prospectively. Insulin sensitivity and lipids were measured at 24 weeks.

Angptl6 levels at 24 weeks, but not at 32 weeks, were significantly higher in women with subsequent PIH. Metabolic factors at 24 weeks did not correlate with Angptl6 levels.

This preliminary study suggests that in the second trimester, Angptl6 levels are higher in women with subsequent PIH.
