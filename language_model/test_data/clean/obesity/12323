We aimed to analyze lipid parameters and determine the need for a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for the identification of IR and impaired glucose tolerance test (IGT) in subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). 20 patients with PCOS and SCH consisted of Group I and 39 patients with PCOS and normal thyroid function consisted of Group II and 53 healthy women with normal thyroid function consisted of Group III. Triglyceride levels were 143.26 ± 99.86 mg/dL in group 1 and 88.56 ± 37.56 mg/dL in group 2 and 83.71 ± 31.94 mg/dL in group 3 which were statistically significant. Total cholesterol, HDL- cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol were found similar between the groups. Fasting insulin levels were 12.45 ± 8.62 µU/mL in group 1 and 8.60 ± 5.35 µU/mL in group 2 and 7.04 ± 3.55 µU/mL in group 3 which were statistically significant (P = 0.027). HOMA-IR were 2.92 ± 2.34 in group 1 and 1.95 ± 1.52 in group 2 and 1.60 ± 0.86 in group 3 which were statistically significant (P = 0.046). This study showed that women with PCOS and subclinical hypothyroidism should be evaluated for dyslipidemia and insulin resistance.
