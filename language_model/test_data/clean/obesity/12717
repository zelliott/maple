Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is generally considered to be a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, but little is known about the possible influence of obesity on the circulating levels of this lipoprotein. The present study was undertaken to examine this aspect in 136 menstrually active women by comparing the serum concentrations of Lp(a) between 72 obese and 64 age-matched nonobese women. Since an adverse effect of androgens and a protective effect of estrogens have been described for plasma lipoprotein profiles in obese women, the relation between the circulating levels of Lp(a) and those of these other hormones was also investigated in obese patients. In addition, other lipoproteins, anthropometric parameters (body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio), and insulin were evaluated. The levels of Lp(a) were not significantly different (Mann-Whitney U test chi 2, 3.59; p = 0.0582 [NS]) between obese (rank sum, 5,367) and control (rank sum, 3,949) women; in addition, the percentage of patients with high Lp(a) levels (cutoff defined at 30 mg/dL) did not differ between the two groups (obese women, 30%; control, 21.8%; chi 2, 0.90; two-sided p = 0.341 [NS]). Moreover, no correlation was found between Lp(a) and body mass index. Lastly, when the Lp(a) prevalence odds ratio for obesity was examined by adjusting the levels of this lipoprotein for age, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, the probability value (0.88) was far from significant. In obese women, no correlation was found between the logarithmically transformed Lp(a) concentrations and all the other variables evaluated in the study. In conclusion, the present study shows that the circulating levels of Lp(a) are not influenced by body weight and cardiovascular risk factors commonly associated with obesity, such as enhanced androgenic activity, hyperinsulinemia, adverse lipoprotein profile, and abdominal fat accumulation.
