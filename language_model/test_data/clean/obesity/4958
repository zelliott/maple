Single institution series have demonstrated that obese patients have higher rates of wound infection and delayed graft function (DGF), but similar rates of graft survival. We used UNOS data to determine whether obesity affects outcome following renal transplantation. From the UNOS database, we identified patients who underwent primary kidney-only transplantation between 1997 and 1999. Recipient and donor body mass index (BMI) was categorized as underweight (BMI &<18.5), normal (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), obese (BMI 30-34.9) or morbidly obese (BMI&> or = 35). We correlated BMI with intermediate measures of graft outcome and overall graft survival, and created multivariate models to evaluate the independent effect of BMI on graft outcome, adjusting for factors known to affect graft success. The study sample comprised 27,377 recipients. Older age, female sex, African American race and increased comorbidity were associated with obesity (p &<0.001). Compared with normal weight patients, morbid obesity was independently associated with an increased risk of DGF (p &<0.001), prolonged hospitalization (p &<0.001), acute rejection (p = 0.006) and decreased overall graft survival (p = 0.001). Donor BMI did not affect overall graft survival (p&> or = 0.07). Recipient obesity is associated with an increased risk of DGF and decreased graft survival following renal transplantation.
