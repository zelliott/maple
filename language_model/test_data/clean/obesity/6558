The authors have studied the body composition in a group of 36 boys from 7 to 10 years old, through densitometry and anthropometry. They have found significant correlations between the percentage of fat, got by densitometry and some anthropometric indices: Quetelet index (r = 0.79), sum of 4 skinfolds (r = 0.78) and logarithm of the sum of 4 skinfolds (r = 0.80). After a multiple regression analysis, they got equations which permit you to calculate the percentage of fat, using several anthropometric parameters with a 10% of error. They bring two nomograms which facilitate the estimation of body fat. They compare the results obtained with the ones described by others authors and suggest the need to extend this study to boys with other ages as well as to girls.
