This contribution describes recent advances in our knowledge of the regulatory interactions between the two major oxidative fuels glucose and lipid. It also addresses how the metabolic abnormalities associated with insulin resistance and ischemic diseases impair the ability of skeletal muscle to switch between the use of alternative metabolic fuels and the ability of adipose tissue to function appropriately in relation to the body's requirements for triglyceride mobilisation or storage, as appropriate to nutritional status. We discuss how targeting PPARs might ameliorate metabolic inflexibility in muscle through altered expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoforms and impact the functions of the adipocyte in lipid buffering and energy homeostasis. Focus has been placed on the participation of the regulatory pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases, PPAR targets, both in the beneficial and the potentially adverse actions of the PPARs in metabolic control.
