This pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of a comprehensive mind body intervention for weight loss in overweight and obesity and the maintenance of weight loss at 6-month follow-up.

Thirty-one overweight and obese employees (Body Mass Index (BMI) 28.6-47.9 kg/mÂ²) from a large corporation participated in a 20-week comprehensive mind body intervention targeting weight loss.

Weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference, rate pressure product (RPP), blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and psychological variables were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up.

Using linear mixed model analyses, the intervention resulted in significant mean weight loss (-4.3 kg, 95% CI -5.8 to -2.8), decreases in BMI (-1.51, 95% CI -2.1 to -1.0), hip circumference measurement (-4.3 cm, 95% CI -6.9 to -1.5), and triglyceride levels (95% CI -33.1 to -4.8). In 6-month follow-up after intervention, statistically significant improvements in weight, BMI and waist measurement were sustained. Participants also showed positive changes in self-reported psychological indices: food-related disinhibition, and hunger both decreased significantly (p&<.01); general self-efficacy increased (p&<.05); positive affect increased (p&<.001); physical function and self-esteem increased (p&<.01); and measures of health-promoting behaviors on 4 subscales (health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, and stress management) also showed statistically significant improvements (p&<.001) at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up.

This comprehensive mind body intervention showed modest effects on physical, laboratory, and psychological outcomes, both immediately following treatment and at 6-month follow-up, in overweight and obese individuals.
