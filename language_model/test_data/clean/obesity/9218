The 2009 World Health Organization report on global health risks identifies hypertension, smoking, raised glucose, physical inactivity, obesity and dyslipidaemia, in that order, as being the top six modifiable global mortality risk factors. Patients with schizophrenia have high levels of all these risk factors. There are a small number of studies showing that interventions can improve these, but prospective long-term studies are not available to show their impact on mortality. A number of studies are now supporting the view that patients with schizophrenia may be dying prematurely as they are not gaining access to or receiving the same medical care as the general population. The literature now suggests that low cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength are among the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality in the general population. Smoking is still one of the largest risk factors for premature all-cause mortality. The literature supports the thesis that lifestyle intervention programmes addressing exercise, smoking cessation and compliance with medication are likely to have significant impact on mortality in schizophrenia. It will be important to ensure that all patients with schizophrenia have advocates to ensure appropriate treatment and avoid prejudice, and to establish fitness standards in schizophrenia.
