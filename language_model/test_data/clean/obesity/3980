Improving the nation's health depends on changing lifestyles that are detrimental to health. The school nurse can bring about significant changes in the lifestyles of obese children through the formation of a Health Club. Through participation in the club, children learn to make informed decisions about health. The club aides in health promotion through behavior modification techniques that offer incentives to adopt healthy lifestyles, with the goals of improved health status, quality of life and life expectancy.
