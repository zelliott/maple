It is known that obese subjects have a blunted GH secretory response to stimulation, but little is known about the inhibition of GH secretion in obesity. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of obesity on the suppression of GH by hyperglycemia and/or somatostatin. Plasma GH concentrations were measured in eight nondiabetic obese subjects and eight nonobese healthy controls during a 4-h hyperglycemic clamp. During the third hour synthetic cyclic somatostatin-14 was infused at the rate of 2.5 nmol/min. Baseline plasma GH levels were similar in obese and nonobese subjects (0.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.2 micrograms/L; mean +/- SEM). In the last 20 min of the glucose infusion period preceding somatostatin administration (100-120 min of the study) plasma GH averaged 0.8 +/- 0.1 micrograms/L in obese patients and 0.4 +/- 0.1 micrograms/L in control subjects (P less than 0.01), with a reduction of 6 +/- 5% in the former and 35 +/- 10% in the latter (P less than 0.01). In both groups somatostatin infusion did not result in a further decrease in plasma GH. Discontinuation of the somatostatin infusion resulted in a rise in both groups; the increase was higher in nonobese subjects (8.1 +/- 3.8 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.9 micrograms/L in the period 220-240 min; P = NS). These results suggest that in human obesity, hyperglycemia has a diminished inhibitory effect on GH secretion, and somatostatin administration has no additional effect in either obese or nonobese nondiabetic subjects.
