It is known that green tea has the ability to prevent obesity, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood to date. A preventive mechanism of green tea on obesity in C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet was investigated by evaluating the expression levels of obesity-related proteins in mesenteric white adipose tissue by using protein array. An increase in the expression level of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-1 by green tea was found in the white adipose tissues of both control and HF diet-fed mice by protein array and confirmed by Western blot. Moreover, the expression level was negatively correlated with adipose tissue weight. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, treatment with green tea and its major polyphenol, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, induced the expression of IGFBP-1 in a dose-dependent manner by Western blot. In conclusion, IGFBP-1 in adipose tissue is a novel molecule target for the prevention of obesity by green tea.
