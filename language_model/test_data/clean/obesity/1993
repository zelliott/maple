Numerous endocrine abnormalities of the growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor axis have been described in patients with both anorexia nervosa and obesity during childhood and adolescence. These alterations include changes in the levels of 24-hour spontaneous GH secretion, high-affinity, low-capacity GH binding protein (GHBP), IGF-I, IGF-II and the IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). However, the existing information is sometimes confusing and contradictory. Furthermore, little or no data in these pathologies are available concerning IGFBP-2 or free IGF-I. We have analysed the GH-IGF axis in large populations of adolescents with anorexia nervosa and prepubertal children with exogenous obesity. These patients were studied at the time of diagnosis and at two timepoints during nutritional therapy and normal weight recovery. The results of these studies using age- and sex-matched controls are described here.
