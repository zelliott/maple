Seven types of rat were fed either stock diet, wheat diet, or a high-fat diet for 98 days. Little difference was found for any parameter between rats fed the wheat and stock diets, but compared to rats fed the stock diet, body weight was 9 per cent higher in the rats fed the high-fat diet, and body-fat proportion was 31 per cent higher. The adipocytes contained 32 per cent more fat and were present in 42 per cent greater number. The extent of dietary-induced difference depended on the strain, but in any case was a much less important determinant of adipocyte number than the genetic differences already existing in the rats. When the extreme groups of Zucker-obese and wild rats were excluded, the diet assumed greater importance in determining adipocyte size and number.
