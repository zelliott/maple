Rumination and suppression are 2 maladaptive emotion regulation strategies known to be involved in pathological behaviors such as overeating and uncontrolled drinking. Until now, no short screening scale has been available focusing on both strategies. The RS-8 questionnaire includes 8 items assessing both dimensions: rumination and suppression. Psychometric properties were investigated in 2 clinical (alcohol-dependent [n = 79] and obese patients [n = 53]), and one non-clinical population (n = 133). Findings reveal the RS-8 to be a reliable and valid instrument. Both dimensions (rumination and suppression) showed good internal consistency and excellent factorial validity. The RS-8 is a short instrument, which can be used as a screening instrument in clinical and non-clinical samples.
