Although the association between gallstones and obesity is well known, no attempt has been made to quantitate the increased risk for gallstone formation associated with moderate obesity commonly seen in clinical practice. To determine the prevalence of both asymptomatic and symptomatic gallstones, screening oral cholecystograms were combined with prior documented history in 249 consecutive obese Caucasian women aged 20-59 yr who were seeking treatment for obesity in an out-patient clinic. To ascertain the relative risk of moderate obesity for gallstone formation, the results were compared with a control group of 60 consecutive women who were undergoing screening health examinations in the same clinic. Both groups were without gastrointestinal symptoms. Gallstone prevalence averaged 31 percent among obese women compared to 10 percent in the control group. Sixty percent of gallstones in the combined 20-29 yr age group were asymptomatic. However, among all patients with gallstone disease 59 percent had symptomatic disease evidence by prior cholecystectomy. Moderate obesity imposes at least a three-fold risk of gallstone disease in Caucasian women.
