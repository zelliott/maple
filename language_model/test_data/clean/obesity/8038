To study pattern of osteoarthrosis (OA) morbidity, OA age and gender characteristics; to analyse affection of the para-articular tissues in gonarthrosis (GA), GA concomitant diseases in outpatient settings.

OA detection and concomitant diseases were studied in the outpatient department with computer informative system. ICD (10 revision) was used in classification. Results. OA morbidity was 6.2%. Male to female ratio was 1:2.6. Incidence rate of paraarticular tissue lesions in exacerbation of GA rose 2.5 times. In GA patients concomitant diseases were registered 1.7 times more frequently than in other outpatients, while obesity, hypertension, ischemic heart disease occurred 2 times more frequently.

OA as disease of accumulation was confirmed in older patients. Old age conditioned more frequent concomitant diseases. This determines polymorbidity of clinical manifestations and requires an individual approach to the patients.
