A case of an 80 years old woman with II-degree obesity is presented. The patient showed no hemodynamic disturbances prior to her death despite bilateral cardiac overload causes by chronic pulmonary inflammatory processes and arterial hypertension. The rupture of the right ventricular cardiac wall with cardiac tamponade was due to the massive fatty infiltration of the cardiac wall and to the sharp increase of the hydrostatic pressure in the right ventricle in the course of pulmonary embolism.
