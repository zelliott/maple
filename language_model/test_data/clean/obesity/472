Ligand-based virtual screening with a 3D pharmacophore led to the discovery of 30 novel, diverse and drug-like ligands of the human cannabinoid receptor 1 (hCB(1)). The pharmacophore was validated with a hit rate of 16%, binding selectivity versus hCB(2), and expected functional profiles. The discovered compounds provide new tools for exploring cannabinoid pharmacology.
