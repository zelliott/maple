Physical activity in the elderly contributes to maintain muscle function and tone, mobility of joints and fosters social relationships when practised in a social setting, thus contributing to physical, psychological and social well-being.

To assess objective and perceived health of elderly people involved in the physical activity programme of Bilbao.

Community-based cross-sectional study. Study protocol considered length of involvement in the programme; age, gender, perceived health, remarkable facts in personal and family disease history, as well as consumption of pharmaceutical drugs, tobacco, alcohol and physical activity (n=1500). In a subsample, (n=596; 122 men and 474 women), age range 60 to 89 years, anthropometrical measurements were collected.

A considerable proportion (69%) had an active lifestyle and practised other physical exercise or sports, apart from the programme gymnastic sessions. Improvement in physical well-being, entertainment and social contacts were key motivations to participate in the programme. About 70% of the sample had been involved in the programme at least for three years. Mean weight was 75.8 +/-10 kg for men and 66 +/- 9.14 kg for women; mean height was 164.6 +/- 6.5 cm for men and 153 +/- 5.5 cm in the female subgroup. Body Mass Index was (BMI) 27.8 +/-2.8 kg/m2 in the male group and 28.1 +/- 3.6 kg/m2 among females. Prevalence of obesity (BMI&> or = 30) was 22.7% for men and 28.9 % for women.

Community interventions targeted to the elderly with a focus in physical activity, particularly when they are based in group physical exercise and implemented through existing networks are rewarding for old people and highly accepted. They are perceived as a positive influence in their health. Such interventions provide a forum which facilitates implementation of other community health initiatives addressed to this population group.
