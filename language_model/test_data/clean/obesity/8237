Wound healing is a known complication associated with sirolimus therapy. Previous studies have demonstrated that obesity is a risk factor for wound-healing complications (WHC) in patients receiving sirolimus therapy; however, the incidence has not been defined.

This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study of de novo kidney transplant recipients (KTR) transplanted with a body mass index (BMI) of â‰¥ 30 kg/m(2) between January 2002 and April 2011 receiving sirolimus vs. sirolimus-free maintenance immunosuppression.

A total of 317 KTR, 71 sirolimus-free patients and 246 sirolimus patients, were eligible for inclusion. There was no difference in the primary outcome of WHC within six months of transplant (sirolimus 32.1% vs. sirolimus-free 29.6%, p = 0.107). Sirolimus exposure was not found to influence WHC (OR 2.906, 95% CI 0.922-9.160); however, BMI Class II (OR 1.830, 95% CI 1.051-3.186) and Class III (OR 3.154, 95% CI 1.484-6.705) were significant predictors of WHC. There was no difference in WHC between the sirolimus group and sirolimus-free group among patients in obesity Class I (27.3% vs. 15.1%, p = 0.064), Class II (36.6% vs. 34.8%, p = 0.195), or Class III (48.0% vs. 53.3%, p = 0.243).

In our experience, sirolimus does not increase WHC in obese KTR and can be safely used as maintenance immunosuppression immediately following transplant.
