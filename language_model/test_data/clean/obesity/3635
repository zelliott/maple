Hypertension and obesity deteriorate patient health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). This study assessed the impact of overweight and obesity on HRQoL and blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive participants, according to sex.

HRQoL was assessed using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey in 11,498 white patients treated for hypertension for at least 12 months. Nutritional status was diagnosed according to WHO criteria.

Overweight and obesity were associated with worse BP control, regardless of sex. In women, overweight and especially obesity were inversely associated with all analyzed HRQoL dimensions. Among men, obesity decreased all HRQoL dimensions, and overweight influenced only physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, vitality, general health, and Physical Component Score (PCS) but not Mental Component Score (MCS). Overweight in men did not influence social functioning, or emotional and mental health. The BMI values associated with optimal PCS and MCS scores were higher for men than for women. Age-adjusted multivariate regression analysis revealed that PCS score was associated with obesity, higher education level, comorbidities, and antihypertensive therapy duration, whereas MCS score was associated with female sex. Polydrug BP control diminished PCS and MCS.

Overweight and obesity deteriorate BP control, regardless of age and polytherapy. BMI values associated with optimal HRQoL are higher for men than women treated for hypertension. Obesity more strongly diminishes the physical versus mental HRQoL component, regardless of sex. Overweight worsens HRQoL physical components in both sexes and mental component-only in women.
