Information on obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in Japan has been limited. The purposes of this clinical study were to evaluate the demographic characteristics of Japanese OSAHS patients and to assess how demographic factors are associated with OSAHS severity. We analyzed 3,659 OSAHS patients who underwent polysomnographic evaluation between January 2000 and December 2004 at 11 hospitals in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. Data consisted of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and demographic characteristics, including sex, age, and body-mass index, for statistical analysis. Levels of obesity were classified according to the WHO criteria. The male-to-female patient ratio for OSAHS was 4.6, and male patients presented more severe OSAHS than female patients. High AHI and a high proportion of moderate to serious OSAHS (AHI&> or = 15) were found among the patients in their 30s, as well as female patients in their 70s and male patients in their 80s. The AHI and the proportion of moderate-to-serious OSAHS (AHI&> or = 15) were greater in patients classified as underweight than in normal weight patients. In conclusion, there is a higher male predominance in the prevalence of OSAHS, and in both sexes, the results suggest different pathophysiological mechanisms of deteriorating OSAHS between adults under age 55 and adults 55 years or over. In addition, underweight patients exhibit more severe OSAHS than normal weight patients.
