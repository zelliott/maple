To test the effect of low calorie diet (LCD) on body weight, lipid profile, and glycemic control in obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients.

Dietary intervention.

Department of Human Nutrition, Copenhagen.

Outpatients: 11 type 2 DM patients (three males/eight females) (10 completed), four on oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA). Body mass index (BMI) 36.8 +/- 5.5 kg/m2 and age 62 +/- 5.7 y.

In all, 8 weeks full meal-replacement diet: eight sachets of a nutrition powder (Nutrilett, 850 kcal/day). Lipid profile assessed by NMR spectroscopy.

Mean body weight fell by 10.9 kg (approximately 11%, P&<.001). Fasting insulin, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol fell significantly. There were large positive changes (statistically insignificant) in LDL subclass distribution and a similar shift in high-density lipoprotein subclass distribution. Medication was discontinued in all four subjects taking OHA for 2 weeks prior to the intervention and throughout the whole 8-week intervention period.

LCD is effective in improving glycemic control and blood lipids through weight loss in overweight type 2 DM patients.
