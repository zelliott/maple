The primary aim of this study was to compare the incidence of catheter-associated bacteriuria with a noble metal alloy-coated latex catheter or a non-coated silicone catheter in patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery with short-term catheterization. Secondary objectives included identifying risk factors for bacteriuria and catheter-associated urinary tract symptoms.

The study compared 217 patients randomized to and receiving a silicone catheter with 222 patients treated with a coated latex catheter. Before removal of the catheter a sample for urinary culture was obtained. Bacteriuria was defined as the growth of â‰¥100 000 cfu/ml. A logistic regression model was used to identify risk groups for bacteriuria. Patients were interviewed about urinary tract symptoms during and after catheterization.

The incidence of bacteriuria was 1.5% with the coated latex catheter and 5.5% with the silicone catheter (p = 0.027) after a mean period of 2 days' catheterization time. Female gender (odds ratio 6.02) and obesity (odds ratio 5.08) were significant risk factors for bacteriuria. A quarter of the patients reported at least one symptom from the urinary tract during and after catheterization. Most patients defined the symptoms as "yes, a little" and a few consulted a healthcare professional because of the symptoms.

This study confirmed previous results that the noble metal alloy coating significantly reduces the risk of catheter-associated bacteriuria in short-term catheterization (1-3 days). Female gender and obesity were significant risk factors for developing bacteriuria, while the use of an open drainage system and insertion of the catheter on the ward were not.
