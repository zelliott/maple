The authors elaborated the main principles of diet therapy in diabetics with adipostiy: their weight was normalized with the aid of a low caloric diet with limited amount of carbohydrates and fats, but with the normal protein content.  Two groups should be distinguished among the adipose patients: those without diabetic ketoaoidosis in the anamnesis or during the observation period; their diet differed by the extent of limiting of carbohydrates.  As a result of the treatment carbohydrate metabolism was compensated with normalization of the glycemic curve; a tendency to normalization of lipid metabolism was noted; immunoreactive properties of the organism were increased.
