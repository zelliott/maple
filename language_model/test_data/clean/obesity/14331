Diet, exercise and behavioral therapy are the basics for every treatment of obesity. If lifestyle intervention does not result in a weight loss of 5% within 3 to 6 months, an additional pharmacotherapy can be considered. Treated patients should have a BMI&>/=30 kg/m(2) or at least a BMI&>/=27 kg/m(2) plus accompanying comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia or hypertension. Current guidelines list orlistat, sibutramine and rimonabant as possible options for the pharmacotherapy of obesity. These compounds result in moderate weight reduction and improvement of cardiovascular risk profile. Especially the improvement of glucose metabolism can be considered as clinically relevant. Different side effects of the various compounds need to be considered before their use. Additional options for the pharmacotherapy of obesity are currently developed, their approval, however, is unlikely to happen within the next couple of years.
