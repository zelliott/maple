To investigate the relationship between leptin concentrations, various metabolic indices and body composition in six different groups.

Anthropometric measurements, fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin, C-peptide, FFA and leptin levels were performed. In the obese and diabetic subjects, body composition was analysed with bio-impedance equipment and as a 5 level CT scan.

Five lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus (LDM) patients, five normal subjects (N), nine white and nine black obese women (WW, BW), and nine white and nine black diabetic women (DWW, DBW) were investigated after an overnight fast.

In both ethnic groups there was a positive correlation between leptin and BMI (black group: r=0.8; P&<.0001, white group: r=0.7, P&<.002) and leptin and SC fat mass (black group: r=0.6; P&<.005, white group: r=0.6; P&<.004).

Across the groups, there were positive linear correlations between leptin concentrations, BMI, SC fat mass and FFA levels. Leptin and FFA concentrations are higher and insulin levels lower in both groups of black women compared to the two groups of white women, despite a similar BMI and body fat mass. In the DBW the large increase in visceral fat mass may be indicative of a more complex relationship between compensatory insulin resistance, elevated FFA levels and leptin secretion.
