This study compared the liver histology of patients with NASH and patients with ASH.

Subjects consisted of 79 patients (41 in the NASH group and 38 in the ASH group). We performed physical and laboratory examinations as well as liver biopsy in all subjects, and we evaluated the differences between the NASH and ASH groups. In addition, we compared the liver histology of patients with obesity, diabetes or hyperlipidemia within the NASH group.

BMI was significantly higher in the NASH group than in the ASH group. Steatosis and nuclear vacuoles were more prevalent in the NASH group than in the ASH group. On the other hand, ballooning hepatocytes, lipogranuloma, focal necrosis, acidophilic bodies and fibrosis were more remarkable in the ASH group than in the NASH group. The degrees of steatosis and lipogranuloma gradually decreased as the stage of liver fibrosis progressed. Necro-inflammation and fibrosis tended to be more remarkable in the ASH group than in the NASH group. In the NASH group, ballooning hepatocytes and acidophilic bodies were significantly higher in the group with diabetes than in that without diabetes. Perivenular fibrosis, pericellular fibrosis and portal fibrosis were also higher in the NASH group with diabetes than in the NASH group without diabetes. These findings suggested that diabetes is deeply involved in the development and progression of NASH.
