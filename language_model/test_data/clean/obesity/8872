Nutritional and metabolic exposure during critical periods of early human development can have a long-term programming effect on health in adulthood. This is supported by evidence from epidemiological studies, numerous animal models and clinical intervention trials. An improved understanding of the mechanisms and effects of metabolic programming has the potential to contribute significantly to the prevention of some major health risks. Obesity and the metabolic syndrome, whose prevalences increase in almost all countries of the world, may have partly developmental origins. Collaboration of clinicians, epidemiologists and basic scientists in an EU funded research project on the relationship between early nutrition and later health (The EU Early Nutrition Programming Project, www.metabolic-programming.org) should provide further insights into metabolic programming and help to transfer scientific progress into clinical practice.
