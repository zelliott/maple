1. Skeletal muscle strength, contractile properties and radiological composition have been studied in seven morbidly obese adults (six female) before and 1 year after gastroplasty operations. The mean body weight fell from 138.3 kg (SD 25.2) to 99.7 kg (SD 23.0) (P less than 0.001). 2. The strength and contractile properties (force/frequency, relaxation rate and fatiguability) of both the adductor pollicis and quadriceps muscles were unaffected by the weight loss. 3. Computerized axial tomography scans obtained 1 year after surgery showed that the quadriceps contained an abnormally high proportion of fat. The mean fat content was 10.8% (range 3.0-30.1%) compared with 1.6% (range 0-5%) for normal muscle. Two individuals were scanned before and after surgery and the fat content of their quadriceps fell from 12.6% and 6.9% to 3.1% and 3.0%, respectively. 4. It is concluded that in obese individuals large amounts of weight can be lost, from both subcutaneous and intramuscular fat stores, without compromising either the strength or contractile properties of skeletal muscles. These results do not support the claim that skeletal muscle contractility is a sensitive indicator of changes in nutritional status.
