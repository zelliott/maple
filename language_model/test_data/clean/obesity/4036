In order to construct a colorectal anastomosis with the EEA or the Russian stapler, one must tie the colonic and the rectal stump on the instrument with two pursestring sutures. A modified circular stapler equipped with hooks eliminates the need to insert sutures. The instrument constructs a double row anastomosis at a minimal cost because it operates with cheap staples that are inserted manually. Its preliminary evaluation in clinical practice showed that it facilitates considerably low anterior resection.
