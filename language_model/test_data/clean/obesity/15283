Evaluation of obese children and adolescents in the pediatric office or clinic should include baseline assessment of weight for height, and body fatness; should rule out endocrine and genetic causes of obesity; and should evaluate other cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment of obesity is most successful if realistic goals are set; if a safe rate of weight loss of one to two pounds per week can be achieved through a reduction of caloric intake that amounts to 500 calories less per day; if increased physical activity is stressed as much as diet; if parental support is strong; and if behavior therapy is provided during the course of treatment to help both child and parent achieve the diet, exercise, and behavior goals.
