During the last decade white adipose tissue was recognized as an active endocrine organ and a source of many proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and complement proteins called 'adipokines' or 'adipocytokines'. The contribution of different cell types which compose the adipose tissue: adipocytes, preadipocytes, stromal/vascular cells and macrophages in secretion of above-mentioned adipokines varies remarkably. These adipokines seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity-related comorbidities. In this review, we have summarized the present knowledge on the most important adipokines in patients with obesity, arterial hypertension and chronic kidney diseases.
