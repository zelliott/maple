Obesity is recently known as a risk factor for endoscopic gastritis. Adiponectin is an anti-inflammatory cytokine secreted from fat tissue, and its serum concentrations are reduced in obesity. The relation between adiponectin and gastritis remains unclear.

The aim of this study was to determine whether lower serum adiponectin level is associated with the risk of endoscopic gastritis.

We analyzed medical records of participants of a routine health check-up examination. Association among endoscopic findings, serum adiponectin level, and other clinical factors including age, sex, alcohol habit, smoking habit, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and insulin were investigated. Endoscopic erosive gastritis was defined as a flat or minimally depressed white spot surrounded by a reddish area or small elevation with central umbilications mimicking octopus' suckers.

A total of 2,400 participants were enrolled. BMI was significantly higher in gastritis-positive participants than in gastritis-negative participants. Serum adiponectin levels were significantly lower in gastritis-positive participants than in gastritis-negative participants. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lower serum adiponectin level (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99), smoking (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.30-0.80), higher blood pressure (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.03), and duodenitis (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.00-3.09) were significantly associated with endoscopic erosive gastritis.

Lower serum level of adiponectin may increase the risk of endoscopic erosive gastritis, independently of BMI. Our findings facilitate further study to clarify the role of hypoadiponectinemia in erosive gastritis.
