The aim of this study was to analyze lamin A/C mRNA levels in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue in two conditions-obesity and type 2 diabetes-that share common inflammatory and metabolic features, and to assess their relationship with selected inflammatory and adipogenic genes.

This is a cross-sectional study involving 52 nondiabetic and 54 type 2 diabetes patients. Anthropometrical and analytical measurements (glycemic, lipidic, and inflammatory profiles) were performed, and mRNA expression was determined using real-time PCR.

Lamin A and C isoforms are expressed differentially. Lamin A/C mRNA levels were increased in obese and in type 2 diabetes patients. We also observed a strong relationship between both isoforms (B = 2.218, P &<0.001) and among lamin C mRNA expression and adipogenic (sterol-responsive element binding protein-1 (SREBP1c)) and inflammatory (interleukin-6 (IL-6)) markers (B = 0.854, P = 0.001, and B = 0.557, P &<0.001, respectively).

These data suggest that lamin A/C may be involved in the adipocyte gene profile observed in obesity and type 2 diabetes.
