High levels of plasma triglycerides and very-low-density lipoproteins and low levels of high-density lipoproteins are consistently found in the metabolic cardiovascular syndrome. These changes are exaggerated postprandially. In the liver, synthesis and secretion of triglyceride-rich particles are increased. In addition, the removal capacity of plasma triglycerides is decreased, due to downregulation of lipoprotein lipase in skeletal muscles by hyperinsulinemia. Resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is believed to be the main pathogenetic factor. However, increased flux of free fatty acids from abdominally localized adipose tissue must also be considered when discussing pathogenesis. Treatment is primarily nonpharmacological, with diet and increased physical activity.
