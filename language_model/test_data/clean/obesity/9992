Polycystic ovaries (PCO) were detected using ultrasound imaging in a series of 173 women who presented with significant hirsutism and in some cases with irregular menstruation. Patients were divided into 3 groups. Those with hirsutism and regular menstruation (cycles&> 8 per year, Group 1, n = 96); those with hirsutism and oligomenorrhoea (cycles &<8 per year, Group 2, n = 44) and those with hirsutism and amenorrhoea (cycles &<2 per year, group 3, n = 33). These 3 groups were compared with subjects with normal ovaries and regular cycles of 26-34 days and without hirsutism (n = 29) and also with a group of women with PCO and regular cycles who had no sign of hirsutism (n = 90). PCO were found in 86% of Group 1, 97% of Group 2 and 94% of women within Group 3. The results suggest that the term 'idiopathic hirsutism' may not be appropriate. An abnormal biochemical test consisting of a luteinizing hormone level&> 9 U/L, testosterone level&> 2.2 nmol/L, sex hormone binding globulin &<32 nmol/L or free androgen index&> 4.5 was 100%, 91% and 76% sensitive for detecting PCO amongst women with amenorrhoea, oligomenorrhoea and idiopathic hirsutism respectively.
