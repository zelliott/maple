Little evidence exists concerning the effects of trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) under energy restriction. Thus, the effects of this CLA isomer on adipose tissue size, liver composition, as well as on expression and activity of carnitine-palmitoyl transferase I (CPT-I) and acyl CoA oxidase (ACO), in hamsters fed an energy-restricted diet were analyzed.

Hamsters were fed a high-fat diet for 7 wk and then subjected to 25% energy-restricted diets supplemented with 0.5% linoleic acid or 0.5% trans-10,cis-12 CLA for 3 wk. Serum insulin, free-triiodothyronine and non-esterified fatty acid levels, liver triacylglycerol, protein and water contents, and CPT-I, ACO, and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARÎ±) expressions and enzyme activities were assessed.

Energy restriction reduced liver size, serum levels of insulin, free-triiodothyronine, and non-esterified fatty acid and increased CPT-I activity. Liver composition was not modified. No differences were found between both restricted groups, with the exception of CPT-I and ACO oxidative enzyme activities, which were greater in hamsters fed the CLA diet.

Energy restriction does not cause trans-10,cis-12 CLA to induce liver hyperplasia. Although this CLA isomer increases liver CPT-I and ACO activities, this effect does not result in reduced hepatic triacylglyerol content or decreased adipose tissue size. Consequently, this CLA isomer seems not to be a useful tool for inclusion in body weight loss strategies followed during obesity treatment.
