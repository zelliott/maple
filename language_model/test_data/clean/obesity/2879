Transamination of branched-chain amino acids to (alpha-oxoglutarate, catalyzed by leucine aminotransferase coupled to the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction, is used in an enzymic assay for determination of branched-chain amino acids in serum and tissue homogenates. The coefficients of variation of the method within-day and day-to-day are 2.4 and 6.5%, respectively. Analytical recovery of physiological concentrations of branched-chain amino acids added to serum is near 100%. Measurements in serum of healthy subjects revealed normal values similar to those found by use of other methods. During prolonged fasting the concentration of these amino acids in serum first increases, reaching a maximum by three days, followed by a successive decline.
