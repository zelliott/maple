Mathematical modeling of human energy regulation and body weight change has recently reached the level of sophistication required for accurate predictions. Mathematical models are beginning to provide a quantitative framework for integrating experimental data in humans and thereby help us better understand the dynamic imbalances of energy and macronutrients that give rise to changes in body weight and composition. This review provides an overview of the various approaches that have been used to model body weight dynamics and energy regulation in humans, highlights several insights that these models have provided, and suggests how mathematical models can serve as a guide for future experimental research.
