Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic factor with angiogenic and mitogenic effects and has been linked to vascular diseases. It is elevated in obese adults.

To investigate whether HGF levels are altered in obese adolescents and whether they correlate with anthropometric measurements of obesity.

Seventy-nine male adolescents were enrolled. Forty-eight percent were overweight. Various parameters were recorded at one visit, including BMI and waist circumference, and blood samples were taken. HGF was determined by ELISA.

Overweight adolescents have higher plasma levels of HGF (1,099.8 +/- 416.7 pg/ml) than controls (883.2 +/- 218.7 pg/ml) (p = 0.008). HGF levels correlated with BMI and waist circumference. HGF correlated closely with high sensitive C-reactive protein.

We demonstrated elevated HGF levels in obese adolescents. We speculate that HGF is a possible link between obesity in early life and related comorbidities.
