A 42-year-old male with visceral obesity and a fatty liver presented with hepatopathy accompanied by jaundice and was diagnosed to have early syphilis based on the results of standard serologic tests and clinical findings. Both the subjective and objective findings including hepatopathy were rapidly alleviated by anti-syphilitic therapy. Severe hepatopathy accompanied by jaundice used to be considered a rare complication. However, due to contemporary unhealthy lifestyle patterns characterized by hypernutrition and a lack of exercise the occurrence of fatty liver is now dramatically increasing. Our findings suggest that the occurrence of fatty liver can exacerbate the damage to the hepatic parenchyma due to a Treponema pallidum infection.
