Leptin is believed to play a role in the regulation of energy balance, but little is known about factors influencing plasma leptin concentrations. To determine the effect of short-term changes in energy balance, we measured plasma leptin concentrations as well as plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride, nonesterified fatty acid concentrations, and metabolic rate in response to a standard test meal followed by a 24-h fast in 21 healthy Pima Indians. Plasma leptin concentrations decreased by 8% (P &<0.05) 2-4 h after the test meal. They returned to baseline 6-12 h after the subjects ate, then subsequently decreased, and, by the end of the fast, were an average of 37% below baseline (P &<0.0001). Changes in plasma leptin concentrations did not correlate with changes in plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride, or nonesterified fatty acid concentrations or with changes in metabolic rate. The results of this study indicate that plasma leptin concentrations decrease in response to short-term energy restriction. These changes were not due to changes in glucose, insulin, triglycerides, or nonesterified fatty acids, nor did they relate to changes in metabolic rate. The decrease in plasma leptin concentrations with fasting may be an important homeostatic response to an energy deficit, stimulating food intake and thus restoring energy balance.
