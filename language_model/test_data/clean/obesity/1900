To determine if underleptinization of islets of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats is the proximal cause of their inability to compensate for obesity, we compared the proinsulin/beta-actin mRNA ratio in heterozygous (fa/+) ZDF rats with that of wild-type (+/+) and homozygous (fa/fa) ZDF rats. In +/+ islets cultured with 2 mM free fatty acids (FFA) the proinsulin mRNA ratio rose 2.4-fold at 12 h. In fa/+ islets, the ratio rose only 65% above normal. There was no change in fa/fa islets. The presence of leptin (20 ng/ml) in the culture medium increased the FFA-induced response of proinsulin mRNA of fa/+ islets to that of +/+ islets while reducing FFA incorporation into triglycerides. The leptin-induced improvement in the proinsulin mRNA response was independent of any changes in glucose usage. These findings support a causal relationship between diminished leptin action on islets and the impaired beta-cell response to FFA in ZDF rats.
