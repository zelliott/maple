Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess relations between cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and age in OSA subjects.

Consecutive OSA subjects (AHI/RDI&> 10, Epworth score&> 9 points) were evaluated. The chest X-ray, spirometry, arterial blood gases, ECG, blood morphology and biochemistry were performed during trial treatment with autoCPAP.

We studied 533 consecutive OSA patients, mean age 55.6 +/- 10.3 years (range 24-81), with obesity (BMI 34.4 +/- 6.6 kg/m(2)) and severe OSA (AHI/RDI 37.8 +/- 21.8). To evaluate relations between CVD and age, patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 &<50 years (123 subjects, 23.1%), Group 2 aged 50-60 years (250 subjects, 46.9%) and Group 3&> 60 years (160 subjects, 30%). Subjects &<50 years were more obese and had higher AHI/RDI when compared to older groups. Incidence of arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and stroke increased with age (higher in subjects&> 60 years).

Cardiovascular diseases were prevalent in OSA patients&> 60 years. However the youngest group presented with more severe obesity and higher AHI/RDI.
