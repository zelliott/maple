The preparation of a pure 125I-labeled monoiododerivative of mouse leptin is described. This radiolabeled analog has been used to characterize and localize central and peripheral leptin binding sites (Ob-R) of the mouse at different stages of its development. The affinity values found in membrane homogenates of various mouse tissues are similar and range between 0.1 and 0.3 nM, indicating that all the Ob-R isoforms have a similar affinity. Leptin binding sites are highly expressed at the membrane level in lung, intestine, kidney, liver, and skin and to a lesser degree in stomach, heart, and spleen. Brain, thymus, and pancreas homogenates are devoid of any specific binding. The distribution of mouse Ob-R has also been explored by autoradiography and dipping techniques on whole mouse sections. In lung, leptin binding sites are located at the pulmonary parenchyma and at the bronchiolar epithelial level. Binding sites are expressed all along the digestive tract from the tongue to the rectum (esophagus, stomach, intestine, colon, and rectum). In muscular visceral structures (stomach, intestine, and bladder) the binding is mainly present in the lamina propria. During development, leptin receptors are early expressed in the liver, kidney, and bone. In the lung, the Ob-R level increased gradually from birth to adulthood where the expression is maximal. By contrast, leptin receptors located in the medulla of the kidney remain remarkably constant all along the development. A broad signal is present in cartilage and bone particularly in vertebrae, limb, and ribs. Interestingly, leptin receptors are barely detectable in the mouse brain except in the choroid plexus and leptomeninges, whereas in the rat brain leptin binding sites are located in the thalamus, the piriform cortex, the cerebellum (at the granular and molecular cell layer), and the pineal gland.
