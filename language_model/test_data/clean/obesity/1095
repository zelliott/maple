Obesity is a state of relative leptin resistance, and obesity in childhood is associated with an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes in later life. Offspring of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at increased risk of obesity. A cohort consisting of 64 mothers, 33 GDM and 31 controls screened for diabetes during the index pregnancy together with their 9-year-old offspring were studied. Our hypotheses were: 1) an elevated child leptin is associated with elevated maternal leptin in GDM mothers 9 years post delivery; and 2) child leptin at 9 years serves as a marker for incipient insulin resistance. By univariate analyses, child leptins were only significantly correlated with maternal leptins among the offspring of GDMs (OGDM) (r = 0.59; p = 0.001). By multivariate analyses, child leptin for the total study group was significantly associated with child body mass index (BMI) (R(2) = 0.65; p &<0.0001), child fasting insulin (R(2) = 0.08; p = 0.03), and female gender (R(2) = 0.28; p = 0.001). In addition, among OGDM child leptin was associated with maternal leptin (R(2) = 0.14; p = 0.005). Our results suggest that there is an association between maternal and child leptin levels 9 years after a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes.
