The density and affinity states of imidazoline I2 binding sites as well as the density of alpha 2-adrenoceptors were quantitated in the brain of lean and obese Zucker rats. No significant differences were obtained between Zucker phenotypes for these receptors in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. Moreover, chronic treatment with the anorexic imidazoline derivative, mazindol, did not alter the density of brain imidazoline I2 binding sites. It is concluded that this genetic model of obesity is not associated with abnormal imidazoline I2 binding sites.
