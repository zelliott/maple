Long-term maintenance of a dietary-induced weight loss continues to be a major health problem and warrants research on innovative approaches to understand weight stability. We investigated the role of the proinflammatory status on weight changes in obese subjects receiving a low-calorie diet (LCD) and during the subsequent 6-month weight maintenance period.

Eighty-four subjects (age: 34.2 +/- 0.53 years; body mass index, BMI: 30.4 +/- 1.8 kg/m(2)) followed an 8-week LCD intervention and were contacted again 6 months later. Body composition, circulating proinflammatory markers [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and leptin] and mRNA levels of inflammation-related genes [TNFalpha and nuclear factor (NF) kappaB transcription subunits] in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were evaluated.

The 6-month weight regain was predicted by high concentrations of TNFalpha at LCD completion (OR = 4.21, p = 0.036) along with the baseline amount of fat mass (OR = 7.23, p = 0.029). In addition, baseline leptin concentrations (p = 0.028) as well as mRNA levels of TNFalpha and NFkappaB subunits were higher at the end of the dietary intervention (p &<0.05) in PBMC of subjects who regained&>or=10% of the dietary-induced weight loss.

These findings demonstrate a role for the proinflammatory state and body adiposity in the prediction of weight-loss regain. This relationship could contribute to the design of more personalized nutritional treatments in obese patients and favor the weight maintenance process.
