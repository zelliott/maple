Prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 in Asturias is 10%. The associations between age, family history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and development of type 2 diabetes are well established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM).

We retrospectively studied 500 patients who had received a cadaveric renal transplant. Subjects with pretransplantation diabetes (5.6% type 1 and 7% type 2) and nondiabetics (78.2%) were excluded. We only evaluated 46 (9.2%) patients with PTDM. The follow-up period was 6 months to 15 years. We reviewed gender, age, family history of diabetes, body weight, hypertension, cardiovascular events, serum creatinine, hepatitis C virus infection, triglycerides, hyperuricemia, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and immunosuppressive therapies.

The median time to diagnosis of PTDM was 3 months (range 1-56 months) after transplantation, a period in which 47% patients developed this complication. Compared with nondiabetics, PTDM patients were significantly older (P = .000), more obese (P = .002), received tacrolimus (P = .027), and had hypertension (P = .014) or cardiovascular events (P = .000). Serum creatinine and hepatitis C virus infection rated were similar in both groups. On multivariate analyses, the risk factors significantly associated with the development of PTDM were greater age (P = .0024), obesity (P = .0032), and hypertension (P = .0516).

Half of the patients with PTDM developed new-onset diabetes within the first 3 months. Age, obesity, and hypertension were among the risk factors for diabetes posttransplantation. After the transplantation, the modifiable risk factors are control of body weight and control of hypertension.
