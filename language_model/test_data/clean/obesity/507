Pharmacokinetics are typically dependent on a variety of physiological variables (e.g., age, ethnicity, or pregnancy) or pathological conditions (e.g., renal and hepatic insufficiency, cardiac dysfunction, obesity, etc.). The influence of some of these conditions has not always been thoroughly assessed in the clinical studies of antiallergic drugs. However, the knowledge of the physiological grounds of the pharmacokinetics can provide some insight for predicting the potential alterations and guiding the initial prescription strategies. It is important to recognize that both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between populations should be considered. The available information on drugs used for the therapy of allergic diseases is reviewed in this chapter.
