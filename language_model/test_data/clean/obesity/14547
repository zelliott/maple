Some studies have found different distribution patterns for the lipid profile of high altitude populations, having found the majority of them a more favorable one in these subjects. The objective of this study is to describe the lipid profile of a high altitude population and relate it to the waist circumference, body mass index, gender, and age. A descriptive study was done in an adult population, 30 yr old and above, of the town of San Pedro de Cajas (SPC), Peru, located at 4100 m (13,450 ft) above sea level. One hundred and two representative individuals (38 males and 64 females) were included. HDL cholesterol and triglyceride means were elevated, whereas total cholesterol means were average, and LDL cholesterol means were low. The BMI mean was 25.4 +/- 3.7. We observed a high prevalence of hypercholesterolemia (34.3%) and hypertriglyceridemia (53.9%) in both genders. Higher prevalences of low HDL (45.3%), abnormal waist circumference (64%), and obesity (14.1%) were found in women (p &<0.001). A higher prevalence of low HDL in overweight/obese (74.2%) and abnormal waist circumference (77.4%) subjects was evident (p &<0.001). We found high prevalences of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia for both genders and important prevalences of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease, such as hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, abnormal waist circumference, and obesity, in high altitude natives, especially in women.
