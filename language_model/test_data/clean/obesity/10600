to examine the effects of the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) telemedicine intervention and pedometer use on physical activity (PA) and impairment in older adults with diabetes.

randomised clinical trial. Subjects ethnically diverse medically underserved Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes (n= 1,650).

participants received home videovisits with a diabetes educator every 4-6 weeks or usual care. All received a pedometer. Annual measurements included hemoglobin A1c, Comprehensive Assessment and Referral Evaluation Activities of Daily Living, Diabetes Self-Care Activities, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Luben Social Support and pedometer use. Mixed model analyses were performed using random effects to adjust for clustering within primary care physicians.

in the telemedicine group compared with the usual care group, the rate of decline in PA (P= 0.0128) and physical impairment (PI) (P= 0.0370) was significantly less over time. Significant mean endpoint differences were observed for PA (P= 0.003). Pedometer use was significantly associated with PA (P= 0.0006) and PI (P&<0.0001). Baseline characteristics associated with greater PA included having fewer comorbid conditions (P= 0.0054), less depression (P&<0.0001), more social networking (P&<0.0001), lower BMI (P&<0.0001), male gender (P&<0.0001) and lower hemoglobin A1c level (P= 0.0045). Similar predictors were observed for PI, except duration of diabetes also predicted increased impairment (P&<0.0001). Significant indirect effects were observed through use of the pedometer on reduced decline in PA (P= 0.0024, 0.0013) and PI (P= 0.0024, P&<0.0001).

this telemedicine intervention reduced rates of decline in PA and impairment in older adults with diabetes. Pedometers may be a helpful inexpensive adjunct to diabetes initiatives delivered remotely with emerging technologies. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT 00271739.
