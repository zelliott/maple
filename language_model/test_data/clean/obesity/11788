To study the contributions of body mass, body fat distribution and family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus to hyperinsulinaemia, insulin secretion and resistance in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), 17 lean (LC) and 17 obese (OC) healthy control subjects, and 15 lean (LPCOS) and 28 obese (OPCOS) women with PCOS were investigated. Waist:hip ratio (WHR), serum concentrations of sex steroids, glucose and insulin during a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and insulin and C-peptide early phase secretion, and insulin sensitivity index using a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp were assessed. The PCOS subjects had a higher mean WHR than the controls. A trend towards hyperinsulinaemia and impairment of insulin sensitivity (including the rates of both glucose oxidation and non-oxidation) was observed in LPCOS subjects, but only in OPCOS subjects were these changes significant. Early phase insulin secretion but not the early phase C-peptide secretion was increased in PCOS subjects compared to controls, suggesting that peripheral hyperinsulinaemia in PCOS women was mainly due to the observed lowered hepatic insulin extraction and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Moreover, the presence of a family history of type 2 diabetes did not affect early phase insulin or C-peptide secretion in the PCOS group. These results confirm and strengthen earlier contentions, that insulin resistance is a characteristic defect in PCOS and is worsened particularly by abdominal obesity.
