To investigate the characteristics and prevalence of binge eating among overweight Taiwanese and to determine the effect of binge eating on outcome of weight loss treatment.

One hundred and eighty-nine participants in a 12-week traditional weight-reduction program were classified on the basis of the Bulimic Investigation Test, Edinburgh (BITE) scores into binge eaters &>/=20), subthreshold binge eaters (10-19), and nonbinge eaters (0-9).

This study found a 15.9% prevalence of binge eating. The binge-eating groups (binge eaters and subthreshold binge eaters) were younger, had an earlier onset of obesity, and more psychological distress than nonbinge eaters. Differences in obesity treatment weight loss among binge eaters, subthreshold binge eaters, or nonbingers by last observation carried forward (LOCF) method were not significant. At the end of treatment, the subthreshold binge eaters had the greatest weight loss. Although their binge eating and mood significantly improved, binge eaters and subthreshold binge eaters still had significant pathology in eating behaviors at completion of the program.

Alternative treatment strategies focusing on disordered eating behaviors are needed to supplement standard dietary management of overweight treatment-seeking binge eaters.
