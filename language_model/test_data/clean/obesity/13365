A massively obese, amenorrheic young woman had elevated levels of plasma androgens which could be reduced either acutely by dexamethasone administration or chronically by weight loss. Normalization of plasma androgen levels in both instances led to resumption of ovulation, suggesting that weight-related hyperandrogenism is a cause of amenorrhea in obesity.
