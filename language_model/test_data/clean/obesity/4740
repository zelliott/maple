This study examines the role of environmental correlates of overweight and obesity among older adults independent of walking activity and lower body function.

In-person interviews were conducted with 789 adults aged 65 and older, residing in four areas in the U.S. Demographic information, general health, lower body function, walking behavior, and awareness of environmental infrastructure features using the modified Neighborhood Environment Walking Survey (NEWS) were obtained. Regression analyses examined the association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and environmental infrastructure features, adjusting for demographics and lower body function.

Older adults who perceived their neighborhood as less safe from crime and had reduced access to services were more likely to have higher BMI. Controlling for demographic and functional characteristics, access to services remained significant. This association remained significant for those with lower functional status.

This research suggests that neighborhood environment may have an influence on BMI above and beyond walking activity.
