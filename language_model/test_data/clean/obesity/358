Secondary analysis of Bolivian Demographic and Health Surveys 1994, 1998 and 2003 revealed a steady raising trend in levels of overweight and obesity among women in childbearing age (20-45 years), reaching 30% and 15% respectively in 2003. Adolescents' cross-sectional data suggest that overweight and obesity are mainly found in urban areas. Applying the Bolivian body mass index-for-age reference, obesity reached 5% in adolescents, while overweight affects 14% of adolescents. This overview highlights the importance of including the prevention of weight gain among the public health nutrition policies in Bolivia.
