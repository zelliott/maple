Fasting substantially decreases plasma leptin concentration. However, in obesity, the fasting-induced decrease in leptin concentration is blunted or absent. The objective of the current study was to determine in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats the contribution of altered leptin secretion and leptin expression to the blunted nutritional regulation of leptin concentration. Fasting-induced decreases in plasma leptin concentration were greater in lean (standard chow (SC)) rats compared to DIO (approximately 79 vs approximately 48%, P&<.05 for DIO vs SC). CSF leptin was significantly reduced by fasting in SC (approximately 46%) but not in DIO. Fasting decreased adipose tissue leptin secretion in both SC and DIO, but the decrease was greater in SC (average approximately 74%) compared to DIO (average approximately 44%, P&<.05, DIO vs SC). Additionally, leptin secretion in fasted DIO was substantially greater (average approximately 175%) than in fasted SC (P&<.05). Adipose tissue leptin protein content was increased by approximately 80% in DIO compared to SC (P&<.05). We conclude that a probable cause of blunted fasting-induced decreases in leptin concentration in obesity is elevated leptin secretion, which possibly results from increased leptin gene expression.
