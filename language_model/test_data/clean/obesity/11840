Recently, many data link inflammation and atherosclerotic events and systemic inflammation are increasingly recognized as an important mediator of coronary artery disease (CAD). Indeed, experimental and epidemiological studies indicate that eating patterns, such as the traditional Mediterranean diets reduce inflammation and cardiovascular risk. These anti-inflammatory diets should be considered for the primary and secondary prevention of CAD. We must also recognize that even a transient increase in free radicals derived from inadequate food intake acutely triggers atherogenic changes including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability. Here in this review, the evidence supporting a causal link between dietary factors related to inflammatory modulators and CAD are summarized and dietary strategies for improving obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular health are discussed.
