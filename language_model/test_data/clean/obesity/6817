Robotic-assisted surgery has enabled organ transplantation in a minimally invasive fashion. Kidney transplantation is the best treatment of patients with chronic renal failure. Robotic surgery has reduced the difficulties associated with kidney transplantation for obese patients. Benefits such as reduced recovery period and reduced number of wound complications and surgical site infections have been attained with the robotic surgical approach. We believe that robotic-assisted surgery has expanded the ability to complete complex surgical procedures in a minimally invasive fashion. However, advanced training and experience are required in all surgeons who are interested in pursuing this technique.
