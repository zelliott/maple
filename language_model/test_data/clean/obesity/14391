The relation of alcohol use to calorie intake and adiposity was studied in 155 non-smoking, overweight men. Alcohol use and calorie intake were assessed by 7-day dietary record, and body composition was determined by hydrostatic weighing. Increased intake of food calories (i.e., non-ethanol calories only) on alcohol-drinking days was compensated for by decreased food consumption on non-drinking days of the week. Added alcohol calories were not offset during the week and resulted in a surplus intake of over 4,000 kcal/wk for men in the highest drinking group. Although alcohol calories were "added" to food intake, alcohol use was unrelated to level of adiposity. This finding was not accounted for by concomitant differences in exercise status. Basal metabolic rate, however, was elevated in men imbibing one or more "drinks" per day (as compared to abstainers and light-drinkers). Increased basal energy expenditure may have partially offset the alcohol calories of men at lower levels of alcohol intake, but it did not substantially offset the large calorie surplus seen at higher levels of consumption. Our results support recent speculation that alcohol consumption may not be as "fattening" as traditionally believed.
