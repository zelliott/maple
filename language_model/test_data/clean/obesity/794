The regression equations of Slaughter and Dezenberg, which are based on mixed ethnic samples, are currently recommended for predicting body fat from skinfold-thickness measures in prepubescent children of African ancestry. These equations contain methodologic problems that could make them inappropriate for African children.

The objective was to apply the Slaughter and Dezenberg equations to predict body fat in African prepubertal children and to compare the results with body fat measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). If significantly different outcomes were observed, then the objective was to develop new prediction equations and validate them on African children.

The Slaughter and Dezenberg equations were applied to a cross-sectional sample of 214 prepubescent (Tanner stage 1) African children (118 boys). Body fat was determined by DXA, and subcutaneous fat at triceps, biceps, subscapular, suprailiac, thigh, and calf sites was measured with use of Holtain calipers. A randomly selected sample of 134 participants (78 boys) was used to generate new prediction equations that were validated on the remaining 80 participants (40 boys).

The Slaughter and Dezenberg equations significantly underestimated (P &<0.001) body fat compared with DXA in both boys and girls. The best combination of skinfold thicknesses to predict body fat in African prepubertal boys, controlling for chronologic age, was triceps, biceps, subscapular, suprailiac, and thigh (SEE = 2.87), and for girls it was biceps, subscapular, suprailiac, thigh, and calf (SEE = 3.51).

The Slaughter and Dezenberg equations are unsuitable for predicting body fat in 9-y-old African prepubertal children. New equations that are based on skinfold-thickness combinations from African children provide more accurate estimates.
