We have determined the blood metabolite responses to a 24-h starvation period of cafeteria obese rats, in both non-pregnant and late pregnant states. In the fed condition the concentrations of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, glycerol and urea do not differ when compared in control and obese rats, but acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate levels are higher in the obese group. The overall response of the cafeteria-obese rats to starving seems characterized by decreased rates of glucose and amino-acids utilization, substituted by a more intense utilization of lipid fuels, with excess ketone bodies production and increased utilization of the mobilized glycerol. What we observed in the obese pregnant response to starvation can be summarized as the additional or superimposed effects of excess fat reserves. In the obese pregnant starved rats a less severe hypoglycaemia, lower levels of glycerol (as a consequence of increased utilization), reduced urea levels, and increased acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate levels were observed. It can be assumed that the pregnant obese rat response to starvation is related to the size of the fat deposits: the more obese, the more hyperketonaemia and less hypoglycaemia, and even diminished rates of amino-acid utilization, as indicated by a lower levels, when compared to the lean pregnant.
