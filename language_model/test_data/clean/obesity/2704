To examine the association between central corneal thickness (CCT) and potential systemic and ocular factors affecting CCT in an Asian population.

Population-based cross-sectional study.

A total of 3,280 (78.7% response) adults aged 40 to 80 years of Malay ethnicity living in Singapore underwent a standardized interview and ocular and systemic examination at a centralized study clinic. CCT was measured with an ultrasound pachymeter. Blood samples were obtained to determine serum glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, and urine samples to determine glomerular filtration rate. The presence of diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and metabolic syndrome were defined based on a combination of investigation results and participant's history.

CCT was obtained from 3,239 individuals. CCT was normally distributed with a mean of 541.2 microm in the right eye. While controlling for age and gender, CCT was greater in individuals with higher body mass index (BMI) (P = .038), greater intraocular pressure (IOP) (P &<.001), greater axial length (P = .005), and greater radius of corneal curvature (P &<.001). Individuals with CKD (P = 0.012) and metabolic syndrome (P &<.001) also had greater CCT.

CCT is associated with higher IOP, longer axial length, and greater radius of corneal curvature, as well as higher BMI, metabolic syndrome, and CKD.
