The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of obesity on quality of a woman's life during pregnancy.

At the Hospital of Gynecology and Obstetrics in Le√≥n, Mexico, we followed-up 220 pregnant women (110 obese and 110 nonobese) who completed the 12-item short-form health survey at the beginning and during the third trimester of pregnancy.

The mental component score was lower in obese than in nonobese women at the beginning of gestation and at the third trimester but increased in the entire group during pregnancy. The physical component score (PCS) decreased during pregnancy and was lower in obese than in nonobese pregnant women (43.5 vs 47.2; P = .01) at the third trimester. Baseline body mass index, weight gain, and complications during pregnancy were associated negatively with PCS (R2=0.11; P &<.001 for the model).

Baseline body mass index, weight gain, and complications during gestation are associated negatively with PCS of quality of life.
