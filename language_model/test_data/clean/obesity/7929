Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ secreting different adipokines such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and adiponectin, among many others. In this study, we investigated the association between PAI-1 activity and serum adiponectin levels in a group of 444 overweight and obese women and assessed the interrelationship with visceral adipose tissue (VAT; CT-scan L4-L5), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HDL cholesterol (HDL-chol) and inflammation (hs-CRP). PAI-1 was inversely related to adiponectin (r = -0.25, p &<0.001; adjusted for age and BMI). After adjustment for age, VAT, HOMA-IR and hs-CRP, the relationship remained significant (r = -0.15; p = 0.001), but disappeared after additional adjustment for HDL-chol (r = -0.09; p = 0.067). Subjects were divided in two groups according to the median levels of adiponectin or PAI-1 levels. PAI-1 activity (19.1 +/- 11.4 vs. 15.8 +/- 8.6 AU/ml; p = 0.003) and adiponectin levels (9.8 +/- 4.6 vs. 8.4 +/- 4.0 microg/ml; p &<0.001) were significantly higher in the low adiponectin/PAI-1 groups. The difference in PAI-1 remained significant after adjustment for age and BMI (p = 0.001), became borderline significant after adjustment for age and VAT (p = 0.052), and disappeared after adjustment for age and HOMA-IR (p = 0.116) or age and HDL-chol (p = 0.443). The difference in adiponectin levels remained significant after adjustment for age, VAT, HOMA-IR and hs-CRP (p = 0.006), but disappeared after additional adjustment for HDL-chol (p = 0.089). Further analyses suggest a contribution of HOMA-IR and/or HDL-chol in the relationship between PAI-1 and adiponectin. HDL-chol was found to be the only factor independently determining both factors. In conclusion, in overweight and obese women, PAI-1 activity was inversely related to serum adiponectin, independent of visceral adipose tissue.
