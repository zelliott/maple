Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, coronary morbidity and mortality. In industrialized countries several studies showed that the lowest SES groups have higher coronary morbidity and mortality rates and higher coronary risk factors profile. The aim of our study was to investigate the distribution of risk factors in cases with CAD in different socioeconomic groups.

Our study group consists of 550 consecutive cases with&> or = 50% lesions in at least one coronary artery. Educational level and income were taken into consideration for the determination of the SES. In both sexes the distribution of eight risk factors such as, smoking, family history, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), body mass index, central obesity was compared in three different groups determined according to the education and income levels.

In men, the distribution of risk factors did not differ according to education levels. In women, central obesity was found to be higher in the group with low education level. In men, the prevalence of low HDL-C, high LDL-C and obesity increased with increasing levels of economical status. In women, central obesity was found to be inversely related with the economic status.

Our data show a higher risk factor profile in men with higher income level, while in women central obesity was inversely related to the income and educational level. These data should be considered in secondary prevention efforts.
