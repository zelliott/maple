Increased quantitiy of lean body mass, obstructive ventilatory syndrome and elevated initial maximal arterial pressure were found in 47 obese as compared with 70 control males, all aged 18--24. With the progressive cycling loading on a veloergometer up to an oxygen uptake of 1.5 1/min--1, considerably higher oxygen uptake was established in the obese as comparable loading grades and in some of the cases--hypeptensive reaction was found. The physical work capacity (PWC170) is insignificantly decreased and the ventilatory parameters were unchanged as compared with the control group. With obesity among young males, the physical work capacity was concluded to be decreased and the frequency of cardiac activity, with submaximal loading, to be increased on both cases--per one unit of body weight, per one unit of lean body mass resp.
