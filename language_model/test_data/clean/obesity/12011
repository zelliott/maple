With the increasing popularity of laparoscopic adjustable banding (LAGB), reoperations to treat band complications have become increasingly more common. Few studies, however, have documented the outcomes of such revisional procedures. The purpose of the present study was to compare the different reoperative approaches after LAGB placement. The present study was conducted at a tertiary referral academic medical center in the United States.

We reviewed our bariatric database to identify patients who had undergone LAGB from 2004 to 2007 and had undergone either revision of their original band or conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

Of the 66 patients who met our inclusion criteria, 47 (71.2%) had undergone revision and 19 (28.8%) conversion. The patient demographics were similar between the 2 groups. The interval to revision or conversion was 22 and 28 months, respectively. Band slippage was the most common surgical indication in the revision group, and inadequate weight loss was the most common in the conversion group. Although patients in the revision group had experienced good weight loss before their reoperation, the conversion group had not. However, the conversion group experienced good weight loss after their reoperation, with an average excess body weight loss of 48%.

Patients who have experienced successful weight loss with LAGB and experience band complications will have satisfactory outcomes with band revision, maintaining their excess body weight loss. These data suggest that patients with inadequate weight loss after LAGB can do well after conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
