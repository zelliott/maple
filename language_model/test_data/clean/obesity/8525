Obesity is a "disease of civilization" that leads to the formation of vascular pathology. Vegetodystonia, a heterogeneous syndrome both as regards the type and clinical course, is a pronounced clinical manifestation of obesity. The role of vegetodystonia in the formation of atherogenic potential of obesity has not been studied yet. 77 patients with metabolic alimentary obesity were examined for blood lipidograms as compared to the vegetative status and anthropometric data. Based on a correlation analysis performed, a relationship was discovered between the changes in the parameters indicated. The character of the correlation was determined by the type of vegetodystonia. The leading part in the formation of atherogenic potential is played by sympathoadrenal influences which are most manifest is permanent vegetovascular dystonia of the vagoinsular type. The treatment of obesity should be carried out with regard to the concrete variety of vegetative dysfunction.
