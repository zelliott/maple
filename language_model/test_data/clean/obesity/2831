The possibility of a relationship between the thyroid hormone level and the peripheral action of catecholamines was examined in 4 normal-weight and 19 obese euthyroid subjects as well as in 27 hyperthyroid subjects by comparing the serum thyroid hormone level and the in vitro effect of catecholamines on lipolysis and cyclic AMP accumulation in adipose tissue incubated with and without isopropyl noradrenaline (ISNA) or noradrenaline (NA). ISNA- and NA-induced rates of lipolysis and cyclic AMP production were significantly correlated with free thyroxine index (r = 0.63-0.74) and with the serum triiodothyronine level (r = 0.83-0.87). The thyroid hormone level was neither correlated with basal rate of lipolysis nor with basal cyclic AMP production (r &<0.2). These results suggest that the magnitude of catecholamine-induced cyclic AMP production by peripheral cells may be regulated by the level of circulating thyroid hormones. The effect of thyroid hormones on lipolysis appears to be specifically linked to the action of catecholamines.
