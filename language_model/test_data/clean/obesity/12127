The development of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) was assessed in rats made hyperphagic with parasagittal knife cuts in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). The animals were water deprived and presented with a .1% saccharin solution paired with injections of either lithium chloride or sodium chloride. In Experiment 1, VMH rats tested at a nonobese weight level did not differ from sham-operated control rats in the acquisition and extinction of the CTA. In Experiment 2, moderately obese VMH rats displayed a stronger CTA than did sham-operated control rats as evidenced by a slower rate of extinction. This effect was not due to the higher absolute dose of LiCl given to the obese VMH rats. A second group of obese VMH rats given an amount of LiCl equivalent to that given to the control rats also displayed retarded extinction of the CTA. The results of these experiments demonstrate that hyperphagia-inducing knife cuts do not alter aversive taste conditioning in rats but that hypothalamic obesity does enhance conditioned taste aversions. This may reflect an obesity-induced suppression in appetitive motivation.
