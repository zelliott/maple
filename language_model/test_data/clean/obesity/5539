Excessive glucose production by the liver contributes significantly to diabetic hyperglycemia. The enzyme system glucose-6-phosphatase plays a key role in regulating hepatic glucose production and therefore its inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for the correction of hyperglycemia. It has previously been shown that sulfated steroids, such as estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, inhibit the glucose-6-phosphatase system in vitro, principally through inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum glucose-6-phosphate transport. We report here that in the obese/diabetic ob/ob mouse model, orally administered estrone sulfate reduces the abnormally elevated hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme activity and enzyme protein levels that are characteristic in the ob/ob mouse, and that this reduction is associated with normalization of blood glucose levels. Other sulfated and non-sulfated steroids also reduced, to a lesser extent, glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme activity - with the exception of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, which had no apparent effect on this system in ob/ob mice. Estrone sulfate is therefore an effective antihyperglycemic agent in ob/ob mice, and the glucose-6-phosphatase system can be successfully targeted for the therapeutic management of hyperglycemia in this animal model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
