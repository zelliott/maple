We report a case of a patient who developed type II diabetes after receiving a successful combined kidney and pancreas transplant for type I diabetes and end-stage renal disease. This patient underwent a combined kidney and pancreas transplant and had no evidence of rejection with good function following the transplant for nine months. The patient developed significant post-transplant obesity with her transplant weight of 80 kg rising to 109 kg. At this level of obesity, the patient developed fasting hyperglycemia of 180 mg/dl with no change in her renal function or her pancreas exocrine function. She developed hyperinsulinemia to this fasting hyperglycemia. The clinical course of this patient demonstrates that rapid weight gain following transplantation can result in type II diabetes.
