To compare expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) coding for the cortisol regenerating enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1), and the adipocytokines leptin and resistin in paired biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SC) and omental adipose tissue (OM) from children.

Paired biopsies (SC and OM) were obtained from 54 children (age 0.17-16 years, body mass index (BMI) 12.5-28.3 kg/m(2), BMI standard deviation score (SDS) -2.5-4.5) and 16 adults (age 27-79 years, BMI 19-46 kg/m(2)) undergoing open abdominal surgery. mRNA levels of 11beta-HSD1, leptin and resistin were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

11beta-HSD1 mRNA level was higher in OM than in SC (P&<.05), whereas leptin mRNA was higher in SC than in OM (P&<.001). There was no difference in the resistin mRNA level between SC and OM. These results were consistent in children and adults. In children, 11beta-HSD1 mRNA in SC was positively associated with BMI SDS (P&<.05), whereas in OM it was positively associated with age (P&<.05). The association between 11beta-HSD1 expression and age remained significant after adjustment for BMI SDS and gender. Leptin mRNA was positively associated with BMI SDS (SC: P&<.001, OM: P&<.001) but not with age in children. In multiple regression analyses, including anthropometric variables and age, BMI SDS was independently associated with mRNA levels of 11beta-HSD1 (P&<.05) and leptin (P&<.001) in SC. When normal weight and overweight children were analyzed separately, 11beta-HSD1 mRNA levels were positively associated with leptin in OM in the overweight group (P&<.05).

There are depot-specific differences in mRNA levels of 11beta-HSD1 and leptin in children and adults. The positive association of 11beta-HSD1 mRNA in OM with age may reflect a causal role in visceral fat accumulation during growth. Increasing 11beta-HSD1 and leptin mRNA in SC with increasing BMI SDS could suggest that the risk of metabolic consequences of obesity may be established early in life.
