In this study we assessed the content of nitrites III and V in selected herbal medicaments used in obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2 treatment. The spectrophotometry Griess and Ilosvay method with cadmium column was used. Nitrites III content in all investigated herbal medicaments did not make any health menace for patients but content of nitrites V is very high and impacts on ADI. The percentage of extraction nitrites III was higher than theoretical counting value of 100% extraction, it could be due to nitrites V reduction to nitrites III during boiling.
