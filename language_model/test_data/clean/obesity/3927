The aims of this study were to investigate the therapeutic potential of intestinal electrical stimulation (IES) for obesity. Experiments were performed to investigate the effects of IES on food intake, gastric tone, gastric accommodation, and its possible pathway.

Ten normal dogs and six dogs with truncal vagotomy were used in this study. Each dog was equipped with a gastric cannula for the measurement of gastric tone and accommodation by barostat and one pair of duodenal serosal electrodes for IES. The experiment on food intake was composed of both control session without IES and IES session after a 28-hour fast. The experiment on gastric tone and accommodation was performed in the fasting and fed states and composed of three sessions: control, IES, and IES with N(G)-nitro-l-arginine.

IES significantly reduced food intake in the normal dogs (459.0 vs. 312.6 grams, p &<0.001). The food intake was negatively correlated with the fasting gastric volume during IES. IES significantly decreased fasting gastric tone in the normal dogs reflected as a decrease in gastric volume (89.1 vs. 261.3 mL, p &<0.01), which was abolished by vagotomy and N(G)-nitro-l-arginine.

IES reduces food intake and inhibits gastric tone in the fasting state. The inhibitory effect of IES on gastric tone is mediated by both vagal and nitrergic pathway.
