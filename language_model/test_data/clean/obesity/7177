To determine which primary cesarean delivery risk factors are important to practicing physicians.

A sample of current members of the American College of Obstetrician Gynecologists were surveyed about the risk factors for primary cesarean delivery that they thought were most important. Data on demographic and practice characteristics were also collected. Sample size was determined by theoretical saturation.

Theoretical saturation was reach at 60 responses. A total of 290 surveys were returned. The 10 most common factors listed by physicians as preexisting patient risk factors for primary cesarean delivery were, in descending order of importance, medical problems, maternal obesity, macrosomic infant, malpresentation, multiple gestation, maternal age, Bishop score, patient's fear, preterm labor, and postdate pregnancy. Six of the 10 factors listed by respondents are in previously published risk-adjustment models.

Our study suggested that the addition of obesity and birth weight to previously published risk-adjustment models should improve representation of practicing obstetricians' views.
