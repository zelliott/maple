The health of 69 children on Great Barrier Island was studied. This is an isolated community without a permanent doctor, and most children were healthy. Ear disease was the commonest problem, especially in Maori children. Problems of impetigo, scabies, rheumatic fever and dental caries were not present. Comparisons are made with the results of a recent Auckland study.
