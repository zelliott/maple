Musculoskeletal diseases are one of the major causes of disability around the world and have been a significant reason for the development of the Bone and Joint Decade. Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and back pain are important causes of disability-adjusted-life years in both the developed and developing world. COPCORD studies in over 17 countries around the world have identified back and knee pain as common in the community and are likely to increase with the ageing population. Musculoskeletal conditions are an enormous cost to the community in economic terms, and these figures emphasise how governments need to invest in the future and look at ways of reducing the burden of musculoskeletal diseases by encouraging exercise and obesity prevention campaigns.
