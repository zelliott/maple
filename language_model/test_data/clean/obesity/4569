Anthropometric measurements and the prevalence of overweight and obesity were studied in 661 adolescents aged 12-17 years from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Mean values for height and weight increased steadily with age in both sexes. Mean values for waist circumference ranged from 70.8-76.6 cm in males and 64.0-68.8 cm in females. Hip circumference varied from 84.8-91.2 cm in males and 84.9-91.2 cm in females. Body mass index was generally higher in males than in females (range 21.9-23.6 kg/m2 and 19.8-24.1 kg/m2 respectively). The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity was 19.3% and 21.6% in males and 12.3% and 19.5% in females. This study confirms the high incidence of overweight and obesity in Dubai adolescents.
