Resistin has been linked to components of the metabolic syndrome, including obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. We hypothesized that resistin deficiency would reverse hyperlipidemia in genetic obesity. C57Bl/6J mice lacking resistin [resistin knockout (RKO)] had similar body weight and fat as wild-type mice when fed standard rodent chow or a high-fat diet. Nonetheless, hepatic steatosis, serum cholesterol, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion were decreased in diet-induced obese RKO mice. Resistin deficiency exacerbated obesity in ob/ob mice, but hepatic steatosis was drastically attenuated. Moreover, the levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, and glucose were reduced in ob/ob-RKO mice. The antisteatotic effect of resistin deficiency was related to reductions in the expression of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis and VLDL export. Together, these results demonstrate a crucial role of resistin in promoting hepatic steatosis and hyperlipidemia in obese mice.
