Peptides involved in the regulation of body composition are of interest in hemodialysis (HD) patients because protein wasting associated with high fat mass (FM) is present in these patients. Zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG), a new adipokine, is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, adiposity, and energy balance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate ZAG levels and its relationship with body composition and dietary intake in HD patients. Forty-nine HD patients (28 men, 53.1 ± 12.5 years, and BMI 24.0 ± 4.3 kg/m2) were studied and compared with 20 healthy subjects (9 men, 49.5 ± 15.2 years, and BMI 25.6 ± 4.1 kg/m(2)). Plasma ZAG levels were measured using the ELISA methods and body composition was evaluated through anthropometric data. Dietary intake was assessed 3 days by 24-hour food recall. Although most of the HD patients (59.2%) were eutrophic according to BMI, 92.3% presented high percentage of body fat (BF), and 43.5%, reduced fat-free mass according to midarm muscle circumference values. ZAG levels were ∼2.5-fold higher in HD patients (135.9 ± 40.9 mg/L) compared with healthy individuals (54.6 ± 23.0 mg/L) (p &<0.0001). Circulating ZAG was not associated with dietary intake; however, this peptide was negatively correlated with %BF and, for each 1% reduction in BF, ZAG levels increased by 2.4 mg/L (p = 0.02). In summary, circulating ZAG is increased and inversely correlated with adiposity in HD patients; however, in spite of its higher plasma levels, the majority of HD patients did not show low BF.
