To assess the long-term impact of undernutrition during specific periods of fetal life, upon central adiposity, control of feeding behaviour and locomotor activity.

Pregnant rats were fed a control or low-protein (LP) diet, targeted to early (LPE), mid (LPM) or late (LPL) pregnancy or throughout gestation (LPA). The offspring were studied at 9 and 18 months of age.

Adiposity was assessed by measuring weight of abdominal fat depots relative to body weight. Locomotor activity was assessed using an infrared sensor array system in both light and dark conditions. Hypothalamic expression of mRNA for galanin and the galanin 2 receptor (Gal2R) was determined using real-time PCR.

At 9 months, male rats exposed to LP in utero had less fat in the gonadal depot, but were of similar body weight to controls. By 18 months, the males of groups LPA and LPM had more abdominal and less subcutaneous fat. Females deposited more fat centrally than males between 9 and 18 months of age, and this was more marked in groups LPA and LPL. Food intake was greater in LPM males. Among females hypophagia was noted in groups LPA and LPL. Expression of galanin and Gal2R were unaffected by maternal diet. Total locomotor activity was reduced in LPE males and all LP females in the light but not in the dark.

Locomotor activity and feeding behaviour in aged rats are subject to prenatal programming influences. Fetal undernutrition does not programme obesity in rats without postnatal dietary challenge.
