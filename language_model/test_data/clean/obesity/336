The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between the BMI of women living in rural areas and their dietary habits, taking into consideration the regularity and frequency of consumption as well as preferences in various groups of foodstuffs. The study included 60 women aged 23 - 69, living in one county. The women were divided into two groups according to nutritional status (BMI): group I with normal body weight and group II with overweight and obesity. Dietary habits were evaluated by using the anonymous and voluntary questionnaire. The questionnaire contained questions concerning dietary preferences. The results were statistically analyzed. The study indicated that a vast majority of overweight and obese women in rural areas prefer fried dishes, red meat and animal fats. However they do not consume vegetables and fruit frequently enough. Such dietary habits will only increase problems with obesity in rural communities. Thus it is important to start nutrition education as a significant strategy for non-pharmacological treatment of obesity and its health effects.
