Effects of physical training on obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and disorders of glucose metabolism were investigated in 359 males, 30-59 years of age. Body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and fructosamine (FA) were measured before and after the 2 month period of physical training at intensities of about 50% of maximal O2 uptake. Results are summarized as follows; 1. Means of BMI, SBP, DBP, TC and FA after the training were significantly lower than before the training. Mean of HDL-C was significantly higher than before the training. 2. In subjects with high BMI (n = 124), high SBP (n = 129) and high DBP (n = 128), means of BMI, SBP and DBP decreased with increase of training time per week. In subjects with low HDL-C (n = 104), high TC (n = 135) and high FA (n = 66), changes in means of TC, HDL-C and FA after the training did not show a relationship to training time per week. 3. Differences observed for measured values before and after the training of 2-3 hours per week were 0.4 kg/m2 in BMI, 15 mmHg in SBP and 10 mmHg in DBP, suggesting that training of 2-3 hours per week was effective in intervention of obesity and hypertension.
