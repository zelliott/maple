Polymorphisms (SNP) in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene can alter sensitivity to glucocorticoids. Previous studies of the N363S and BclI SNP in the GR gene have shown a metabolic syndrome phenotype in mostly non-African populations. The obesity phenotype of African Americans (AA) seems to be more severe than that of Caucasians.

We aimed to assess the prevalence of N363S and BclI in obese and non-obese Caucasian (n=26) and African (n=23) Mississippians (age: 23-63 years) to investigate associations with body composition (body mass index/BMI, waist-to-hip ratio), metabolic parameters (salivary cortisol, fasting glucose and insulin, hemoglobin A1C, fructosamine, HOMA-IR index), and psychological stress perception (blood pressure/BP, perceived stress scale/PSS).

All subjects were homozygous for wildtype N363N. BclI polymorphism genotype frequencies among the 23 AA were: homozygous CC (57%), GG (4%), and heterozygous CG (39%), and among the 26 white women: homozygous CC (35%), GG (19%), and heterozygous CG (46%). Linear and logistic regression analyses including a parsimonious model identified BMI as a statistically significant parameter between the two ethnic groups (BMI was 3.13 kg/m2 higher in AA). Within the AA group, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, log (HOMA-IR), PSS scores, BP, and hyperlipidemia showed no statistically significant relationships for the BclI polymorphism. PSS scores were 15.2 for AA vs. 14.7 for white women (normal mean: 14.7 vs. 12.8).

Black Mississippians have a higher BMI than whites, which may be related to the presence of the BclI polymorphism and increased glucocorticoid sensitivity. Although more blacks (52%) than whites (38%) had elevated BP, PSS scores in both groups suggest that a high BMI is not regarded as abnormal or stressful. This might negatively impact behavior change regarding lifestyle modifications with increased physical activity and healthier food choices. Larger studies, particularly in African populations, are needed to better define metabolic and psychological characteristics in relation to the N363S and BclI GR gene polymorphisms.
