We document the association among obesity, cardiovascular risk factors, and work limitations in the U.S. workforce.

Using clinical measurements from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III and 1999-2000, we analyzed obesity rates and cardiovascular risk factor prevalence. We examined work limitations using the National Health Interview Survey 2002.

Obesity increased 43.8% from 1988-1994 to 1999-2000 and now affects 29.4% of workers. Obese workers have the highest prevalence of work limitations (6.9% vs. 3.0% among normal-weight workers), hypertension (35.3% vs. 8.8%), dyslipidemia (36.4% vs. 22.1%), type 2 diabetes (11.9% vs. 3.2%), and the metabolic syndrome (53.6% vs. 5.7%). We also found increased prevalence rates among those classified as overweight.

Our study documents the association between excess body weight and health outcomes. Workplace weight and disease management programs could reduce morbidity and increase productivity.
