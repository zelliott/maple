To determine the prevalence of self-reported cardiovascular disease and risk factors among Ontario women aged 50 and older.

Analysis of the 1990 Ontario Health Survey, a population-based, cross-sectional survey.

Ontario communities.

Residents of Ontario communities during 1990 who responded to the 1990 Ontario Health Survey (61,239 respondents in 35,479 households), weighted to represent the population of Ontario.

Reported heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, height and weight, physical activity, and smoking habits.

Nearly 11% of women aged 50 and older report "heart disease"; 24.9% hypertension, and 5.4% diabetes. Women were less likely than men to smoke daily, to smoke 25 or more cigarettes a day, and to be overweight, but were more likely to have lower levels of physical activity.

The prevalence of self-reported heart disease and medical and lifestyle risk factors for heart disease is relatively high among Ontario women aged 50 and older. Physicians and public health officials must keep women in mind when designing or implementing programs or services for heart disease.
