Six pregnant rats were made mildly hyperglycemic by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin on d 5 of gestation. Four control rats were injected with citrate buffer. Thirty pups born to experimental dams who had increased birth weight (birth weight greater than 1.7 SD of mean birth weight of pups from control dams) maintained accelerated growth through 10 wk of age. At 10 wk, oral glucose tolerance tests showed higher glucose and insulin levels than the controls (n = 37). In addition to the higher body weight, the experimental rats also had higher fat weight to body weight ratios. Adipocytes of epididymal fat from obese males and periovarian fat from obese females had higher lipid content with significantly larger cell size than the adipocytes of the controls. The adipocytes of macrosomic rats showed attenuated response to insulin-stimulated glucose conversion to total lipid and fatty acid when compared with the responses seen in the adipocytes of the control rats. Interestingly, although the insulin-stimulated glucose conversion to CO2 was similar in macrosomic and control males, the response in the macrosomic female was blunted when compared with that of the control females. Insulin receptor binding capacities of the macrosomic rats were lower than those of the controls, which is consistent with a phenomenon of down-regulation. However, the receptor affinities were higher in the experimental animals than in controls. Therefore, a postreceptor defect may account for the abnormality in glucose metabolism in the obese rats. In conclusion, the abnormal response to oral glucose loading in these experimental obese, hyperinsulinemic rats is due to peripheral tissue insulin resistance that is probably postreceptor in nature.
