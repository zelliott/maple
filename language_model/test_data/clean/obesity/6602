Obesity is a long-term source of cellular stress that predisposes to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Autophagy is a homeostatic mechanism for cellular quality control through the disposal and recycling of cellular components. During times of cellular stress, autophagy affords mechanisms to manage stress by selectively ridding the cell of the accumulation of potentially toxic proteins, lipids and organelles. The adaptive processes employed may vary between cell types and selectively adjust to the insult by inducing components of the basic autophagy machinery utilized by the cells while not under duress. In this review, we will discuss the autophagic responses of organs to cellular stressors, such as high-fat diet, obesity and diabetes, and how these mechanisms may prevent or promote the progression of disease. The identification of early cellular mechanisms in the advent of obesity- and diabetes-related renal complications could afford avenues for future therapeutic interventions.
