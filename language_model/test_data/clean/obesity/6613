Renal dysfunction and disease, including hyperfiltration, proteinuria and hypofiltration, are commonly associated with obesity. Diabetic kidney disease is also common in obese cohorts. Weight loss interventions, including bariatric surgery, can effectively reduce weight and improve renal outcomes. Some of this effect may be due to the remission of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. However, other mechanisms, including the resolution of inflammatory processes, may also contribute. The effect of bariatric surgery on renal function has only recently become a focus of particular investigation. In this study, we will review the effects of bariatric surgery on obesity-associated kidney disease. We will discuss the pitfalls in assessing renal function in obese cohorts and will examine the effect of bariatric surgery on renal function and urinary protein excretion using different mechanisms. We will give particular attention to the evidence for bariatric surgery in cohorts with established renal disease and suggest future directions. In particular, we will outline the evidence for inflammation as an important therapeutic target, and the emerging medical therapies being considered to exploit this target in obesity- and diabetes-related kidney disease.
