The effects of fluothane, either and neuroleptanalgesia were studied in 104 obese patients with the excessive body weight 100% more than normal. A direct negative effect of fluothane on the left ventricle myocardium was registered. Deterioration of the contracting function of the cardiac muscle during neuroleptanalgesia was less pronounced. Under conditions of ether narcosis alterations of cardiohemodynamics were minimal and were caused by extracardial factors. A conclusion is made that fluothane is less acceptable of the anesthetics examined for obese patients.
