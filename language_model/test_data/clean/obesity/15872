The objectives of this study were to identify potential alterations in gene expression of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and Agouti-related protein (AgRP) in mouse hypothalamus under a chronic peripheral infusion of leptin or at early (8 weeks) and advanced (16 weeks) phases of diet-induced obesity. Control or diet-induced obesity mice (8 or 16 weeks of high-fat diet) were either treated or not treated with leptin. Metabolic features were analyzed and expression of the genes of interest was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot. We reported that in control mice, but not in obese mice, leptin infusion induced an increase in POMC mRNA level as well as in MC4-R mRNA level suggesting that leptin could act directly and/or through alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). This hypothesis was reinforced after in vitro studies, using the mouse hypothalamic GT1-7 cell line, since both leptin and Norleucine(4), D-Phenylalanine(7)-alpha-MSH (NDP-alpha-MSH) treatments increased MC4-R expression. After 8 weeks of high-fat diet, nondiabetic obese mice became resistant to the central action of leptin and their hypothalamic content of POMC and AgRP mRNA were decreased without modification of MC4-R mRNA level. After 16 weeks of high-fat diet, mice exhibited more severe metabolic disorders with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, hypothalamic expression of MC4-R was highly increased. In conclusion, several alterations of the melanocortin system were found in obese mice that are probably consecutive to their central resistance to leptin. Moreover, when the metabolic status is highly degraded (with all characteristics of a type 2 diabetes), other regulatory mechanisms (independent of leptin) can also take place.
