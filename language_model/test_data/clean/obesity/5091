Somatostatin content in the blood of healthy persons, of patients with cerebral nanism, diabetes mellitus, Icenko-Cushing's disease, and obesity, was studied by radioimmuno--assay. Comparative analysis of somatostatin, somatotropin, glucagon and immunoreactive insulin content in the blood of patients with different endocrine disturbances was carried out. Significant elevation of somatostatin level was revealed in cerebral nanism. An increase in the blood somatostatin concentration of patients with diabetes mellitus, Icenko-Cushing's disease and obesity was accompanied by a fall in somatotropin and glucagon secretion and a rise in the blood insulin level.
