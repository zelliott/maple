Changes in the activity of blood monocytic cholesterol esterase in men with major CHD risk factors (dyslipoproteinemia, arterial hypertension, excessive body mass) were described. Standard methods of epidemiological survey and a radionuclide method to determine cholesterol esterase activity applied to a representative sampling (195 persons) have shown that enzymatic activity was growing with age. In examinees with hyperlipoproteinemia of type IIa and IIb the activity of cholesterol esterase was decreased, and in persons with excessive body mass it was increased. In combination of 2-3 CHD risk factors significant differences in enzymatic activity were undetectable.
