to evaluate a personalized diet customize for present comorbidity, on metabolic control indicators and renal function.

a non-randomized clinical trial was conducted during a three-month period in a group of patients with microalbuminuria and in a group with macroalbuminuria. The patients received personalized dietary counseling customize to their comorbidity (obesity, hypertension, and dislypidemia). The effect of the diet was measured through metabolic control variables: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, fasting glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1))c and lipids profile; the renal function variables were: glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urine albumin excretion (UAE). Statistical analysis was done with t-paired test.

thirty-nine patients were included (21 women and 18 men). After the intervention, the weight and waist circumference had significantly decreased (p = 0.01); the fasting glucose levels and HbA(1)c were significantly lower (p = 0.001). The HDL-cholesterol increased significantly (p = 0.009); UAE decreased significantly in patients with micro and macroalbuminuria; 123.0 +/- 73.4 to 105.3 +/- 61.3 mg/24-h; p = 0.040 and 1482.7 +/- 1200.6 to 1093.5 +/- 601.8 mg/24-h; p = 0.02. The GFR increased in both groups: 68.9 +/- 35.4 to 74.7 +/- 41.6 mL/min, p = 0.04; and 62.2 +/- 26.6 to 68.5 +/- 25.3 mL/min, p = 0.02.

the dietary intervention improved the metabolic control and renal function in type 2 diabetes patients with comorbidity.
