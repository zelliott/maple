Treatment with H2 receptor antagonists may cause the heart to be more susceptible to atrioventricular conduction delay when exposed to an overwhelming insult by histamine released during an anaphylactic reaction. We present the case of a woman, pretreated with ranitidine, who developed 3:1 heart block secondary to latex anaphylaxis. We propose that H2 antagonist premedication alone in patients susceptible to anaphylaxis increases their risk of heart block.

A 38 yr old obese woman with cervical cancer presented for a radical hysterectomy. Systems review yielded a history of sleep apnea, orthopnea, gastroesophageal reflux, and sciatica. Medications included preoperative ranitidine, 150 mg. There was no history of atopy or allergy. Following general anesthesia induction, at the onset of the surgical procedure the patient developed a severe anaphylactic reaction which was heralded by the onset of 3:1 heart block, with decreases in SpO2, P(ET)CO2 and a decrease in systolic blood pressure to 45 mmHg. This was diagnosed as a possible latex reaction and treated using epinephrine boluses and infusion, fluids, 50 mg diphenhydramine, 50 mg ranitidine and 100 mg hydrocortisone. Following a 48 hr stay in the ICU the patient made an uneventful recovery. Allergy testing with intradermal latex injection and increased plasma tryptase levels confirmed a latex anaphylaxis.

The use of H2 antagonists alone as a prophylaxis for gastroesophageal reflux may increase the risk of heart block in patients who develop anaphylaxis.
