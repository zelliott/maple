Having a better understanding of the intersection between chronic pain and obesity in the Mexican American community can be valuable for pain management specialists in determining treatment, service, and prevention strategies. The objectives of this study were (1) to describe the type and severity of chronic pain among overweight/obese Hispanic adults aged 40 years and older, and (2) to determine the association between chronic pain indices and key demographic variables, including excessive weight. Hispanic adults (N=101) were interviewed using validated questionnaires and measured for BMI and waist circumference. Data analyses revealed that most participants had widespread pain; 60% were suffering severe pain (including back, knee, and shoulder pain); the most common pain location was head (headache, 80%), followed by knee and upper back (75-76%), shoulder (73%) and lower back (73%). Greater obesity was associated with some negative pain outcomes. Results are relevant for pain management with this at-risk population.
