Coronary stent under expansion is a major contributor to in-stent restenosis and acute stent thrombosis. StentBoost and IC Stent are advanced x-ray image enhancing techniques that provide improved stent visualization by eliminating motion artifact. These techniques can be useful in the detection of inadequate stent expansion. These motion-corrected x-ray stent (MXS) visualization techniques are more time-efficient compared to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), require less training of catheterization laboratory personnel, and have lower procedural costs. However, little clinical or outcome data evidence exist for MXS. Though IVUS remains the gold standard for evaluation of the adequacy of stent expansion, MXS may be a viable adjunctive imaging tool in certain clinical scenarios.
