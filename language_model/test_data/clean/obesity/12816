Several health hazards and social disabilities are associated with obesity. Increased mortality is associated with increased body weight. A high rate of mortality results from heart disease, diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, high blood pressure, and cancer. Physiologic cardiovascular changes occur, leading to left ventricular hypertrophy and lipid abnormalities. Hypertension, stroke, and venous stasis are increased. Pulmonary abnormalities include obstructive sleep apnea, which can be associated with secondary polycythemia and right ventricular hypertrophy. Gallstones, gallbladder disease, and accumulation of fat on the liver are significantly increased. Gout and reproductive abnormalities in women are common. Osteoarthritis of the knees and spine occur, although osteoporosis is rare. Risk for endometrial and breast cancer is increased, particularly in the presence of increased central fat. Changes in the skin include stretch marks, acanthosis negricans, hirsutism, intertrigo, and multiple papillomas. Impaired psychosocial function is manifested as social isolation, loss of job mobility, increased employee absenteeism, and economic and social discrimination.
