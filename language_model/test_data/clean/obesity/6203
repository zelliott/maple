Obesity and obesity-associated kidney injuries have played an important role in the rising prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The link between obesity and kidney disease begins with obesity's well-known associations with diabetes and hypertension, the two leading etiologies of CKD. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that elevated aldosterone levels and expanded extracellular volume are key components of obesity-induced renal disease via aldosterone's non-epithelial effects on the kidney. Highlighting these blood pressure- and diabetes-independent mechanisms of kidney injury in obesity allows an exploration of whether mineralocorticoid receptor blockade, coupled with weight loss and salt restriction, is an optimal treatment for overweight CKD patients.
