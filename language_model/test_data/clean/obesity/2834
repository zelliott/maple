Late biopsy results in 53 patients after jejunoileal bypass were reviewed and compared with 1 year postoperative biopsies. Patients were divided into groups based on clinical course and liver function tests. Of 24 patients with normal liver function tests and no clinical symptoms of liver failure, 8 (33 percent) had new or progressive lesions on late biopsy, while 1 of these 8 patients had cirrhosis. Thirty percent (6 of 20) of patients with liver function abnormalities but no evidence of liver failure showed evidence of progression on biopsy; 4 of these 6 patients had cirrhosis. Of those with clinical evidence of liver failure in the first year after operation, 44 percent had evidence of progression, but none had cirrhosis. Clinical parameters and liver function tests did not correlate with liver biopsies. In this series of patients, new and progressive lesions were found in the late postoperative period. Long-term serial biopsies are advisable in all patients after jejunoileal bypass to determine whether progressive deterioration in liver histology had occurred.
