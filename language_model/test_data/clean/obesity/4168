The review considers the general mechanisms of energy exchange in an organism, which determine its volume. The data are given on the energy exchange in various internal organs (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract). The reasons for a high energy exchange in the internal organs are considered and also for their substantial role in participating in the total energy budget of an organism.
