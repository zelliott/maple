Despite advances in the management of type 2 diabetes, glycaemic control remains suboptimal for many patients because of the complexities of disease progression and the need to balance improved glycaemic control against adverse treatment effects, particularly weight gain and hypoglycaemia. Thus, the development of new antidiabetes therapies continues in earnest. Incretin hormones have been the recent focus of research, as they account for up to 70% of the insulin response following a meal. There is also a high concordance between the physiological actions of one hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and the therapeutic needs of patients. As native human GLP-1 has a half life of only approximately 2 min, researchers have developed molecules that act as GLP-1 receptor agonists or inhibit the enzyme responsible for GLP-1 degradation (dipeptidyl peptidase-4). Liraglutide, a human GLP-1 analogue sharing 97% of its amino acid sequence identity with native GLP-1, has been approved for use as monotherapy (not in Europe) and in combination with selected oral agents. In this supplement, we summarise key liraglutide data, offer practical insight into what we might expect of liraglutide in clinical use and examine selected case studies. For reasons of the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists, many thought leaders believe that these will become background therapy for majority of patients in the coming years. This supplement will serve as a resource from which readers can extract information concerning the potential benefits for patients who are overweight, losing pancreatic beta-cell function and drifting towards the ravaging effects of chronic hyperglycaemia.
