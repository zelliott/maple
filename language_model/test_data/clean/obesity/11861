Food fat plays an important role in the human diet. On the one hand, fats provide the body with energy, contribute to the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and act as structural elements of cell walls. On the other hand, a high fat intake is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and coronary heart disease. Animal fats, which contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids, are often the focus of attention when it comes to reducing the share of fat in the diet. The present overview of the literature describes the amount of total fat and the percentage of individual fatty acid groups in meat and meat products, documents the contribution of meat and meat products to fat intake, and investigates the connection between meat fat and various diseases. The information given is based mainly on data material from Switzerland; data from other countries have been included for comparison.
