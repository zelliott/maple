The composition, morphology, beta-adrenergic receptor binding, and in vitro lipolysis were examined in lean and obese, 5- to 6-mo-old male Zucker rat interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT). IBAT pads from obese rats were heavier (283%), had more lipid (700%), and more (75%)( and larger (83%) adipocytes than those from lean rats. Also, IBAT from obese rats had no multiloculated cells, and 50% of their IBAT adipocytes were the size of white fat cells. High affinity binding for (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol (KD, 15-18 nM), as well as the estimated KD values for binding and the 1/2 Vmax values for adrenergic agonist-induced lipolysis were similar in isolated IBAT cells from lean and obese rats. However, adipocytes from IBAT in obese rats had 75% fewer high affinity beta-adrenergic binding sites per cell (Bmax) compared to those in lean rats. These findings are most compatible with the infiltration of IBAT by white adipocytes. Such infiltration would be expected to reduce the overall thermogenic capacity of IBAT in obese Zucker rats and thereby contribute to the maintenance of their obesity.
