Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death in Poland and in Europe. Children rarely suffer from them, although most of the risk factors which accelerate progression of atherosclerosis commence in childhood, including: dyslipidemias, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Moreover during last few years the incidence of some of risk factors in children, such as obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia has increased significantly. It is known from the autopsy studies that atherosclerosis can be identified at very young age in healthy children. In adult population medications such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) have strong position confirmed by many multicenter clinical trials. They significantly reduce cardiovascular risk and increase life expectancy. Latest recommendations on management of hyperlipidemias in children expand indications for screening of lipid level imbalances and indicate statins as main pharmacotherapy after failure of life style changes. On the other hand acetylsalicylic acid is not used so broadly. Only children at high risk of thrombosis may benefit from its antiplatelet property. This review presents the latest recommendations and the therapeutic role of these medications in pediatric population.
