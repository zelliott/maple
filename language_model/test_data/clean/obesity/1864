To investigate the relative contributions of insulin secretion and insulin resistance to the development of glucose intolerance in Japanese subjects.

A cross-sectional study of 756 Japanese subjects (530 nonobese, 226 obese) was performed. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was given, and subjects were classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (normal glucose tolerance [NGT], impaired glucose tolerance [IGT], and diabetes). Early-phase insulin secretion was assessed by the insulinogenic index (the ratio of the increment of insulin to that of plasma glucose [PG] 30 min after a glucose load [delta IRI0-30 min/delta PG0-30 min]). Total insulin secretion was assessed by mean immunoreactive insulin (IRI) during the OGTT, and insulin resistance was assessed by use of the homeostasis model [HOMA(R)].

Early-phase insulin secretion was significantly decreased in IGT, compared with patients with NGT, in both the nonobese and obese subjects (0.70 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.37 +/- 0.03, P &<0.01 and 1.36 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.73 +/- 0.08, P &<0.01, respectively). However, mean IRI and HOMA(R) in both nonobese and obese subjects with IGT and NGT were not statistically different. Subjects with diabetes showed a significant decline in early-phase and total insulin secretion and a significantly higher level of insulin resistance than did subjects with IGT. When the fasting glucose (FPG) exceeded 100 mg/dl, early-phase insulin decreased progressively. The graphed relationship between FPG and mean IRI did not show an inverted U-shape, and mean IRI decreased progressively when FPG exceeded 100-130 mg/dl. The pattern of changes in insulin secretion and insulin resistance associated with the progression of glucose intolerance was similar in both the nonobese and obese subjects.

The worsening from NGT to IGT in Japanese subjects may be associated with a decrease in early-phase insulin secretion in nonobese as well as in obese subjects. Hyperinsulinemia in IGT is not common. We suggest that impaired early-phase insulin secretion may be the initial abnormality in the development of glucose intolerance in Japanese people. Insulin resistance may be a consequence of hyperglycemia and/or obesity.
