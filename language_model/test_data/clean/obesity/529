The use of very low calorie diets under medical supervision is becoming increasingly popular in the UK, as the incidence of obesity continues to rise. We report the case of torsades de pointes developing during such a diet. Torsades de pointes has been reported in association with very low calorie diets in the past but to our knowledge, this is the first report since the introduction of newer, nutritionally complete versions of the diet. We review the intensive care management of recurrent torsades de pointes resistant to standard therapy and its relationship to dieting and obesity.
