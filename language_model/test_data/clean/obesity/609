During a study of 72 patients submitted to jejeunoileostomy for obesity seven were found in whom compulsive, episodic overeating was associated with depressive mood disturbance. When followed up nine to 27 months after operation all seven had lost weight and had also lost the habit of compulsive eating. In all cases psychiatric symptoms improved or disappeared, and symptom substitution was not observed. Obesity rather than psychiatric disorder is usually the main problem in such patients. The implications for psychoanalytic and other concepts of obesity are discussed.
