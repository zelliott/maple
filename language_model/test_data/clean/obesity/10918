The aim of this study was to examine the relation between the CETP-TaqIB polymorphism and reduced plasma HDL-cholesterol levels commonly observed among men characterized by abdominal obesity and features of the insulin resistance syndrome.

A total of 187 sedentary men, non-smokers and free from metabolic disorders were classified on the basis of their CETP-TaqIB genotype.

Plasma HDL and HDL3-cholesterol concentrations as well as the CETP activity were significantly different between the three genotypes, B1B1 men having significantly lower HDL and HDL3-cholesterol levels and higher CETP activity than B2B2 homozygotes. A 2x3 ANOVA was used to determine the source of variation of plasma HDL and HDL2-cholesterol levels among the three genotypic groups of men divided on the basis of either a high &>/=27 kg/m2) or a low (&<7 kg/m2) BMI, a high &>/=130 cm2) or a low (&<30 cm2) accumulation of visceral adipose tissue assessed by computed tomography, or a low versus a high fasting plasma insulin concentration (using the median value as a cut-off point). The effect of the CETP genotype observed on plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations was attenuated among men with features of the insulin resistance syndrome. It seems that the expected raising effect of the B2 allele on plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations was blunted in the presence of a BM&>/=27 kg/m2, a high accumulation of visceral adipose tissue or hyperinsulinaemia.

Our data indicate that the CETP gene TaqIB polymorphism influences plasma CETP activity on one hand and plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations on the other hand among men. The association between the TaqIB polymorphism and plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations is altered by the presence of abdominal obesity and some features of the insulin resistance syndrome.
