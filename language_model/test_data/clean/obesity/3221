The Lou/C rat, an inbred strain of Wistar origin, is presented both as an obesity-resistant rat and as a relevant model of successful ageing. In the present study, we examined throughout ageing the breathing pattern and the ventilatory response to hypoxia in Lou/C and age-matched Wistar rats. Ventilation was assessed by whole body plethysmography in resting condition and during a hypoxic challenge (10% O(2)) at 2, 6, 12 and 24 months of age. Lou/C rats maintained constant their resting ventilation rate throughout ageing while Wistar rats tended to decrease their ventilation with advancing age. Elderly Lou/C as well as Wistar rats increased their frequency rather than their tidal volume in response to hypoxia. As Lou/C rats did not develop obesity, ageing per se surpasses the effect of fat accumulation and prevents old rats to mobilise their tidal volume in response to hypoxia.
