The evaluation of an obese subject aims at better understanding the disease, its causes and consequences, in order to optimize its management. Schematically, this task can be done in three successive steps. First, it is necessary to analyse data from the past, by asking about family and personal history. Then, the present data should be carefully analysed, especially the severity of overweight, its type of distribution and the importance of associated complications. Finally, it is mandatory to project these data into the future, in order to assess the final prognosis of the obese patient allowing a better definition of the goals and the therapeutical strategies.
