The association between arterial hypertension and obesity has been known for many years and demonstrated by epidemiological studies. The physiopathological mechanisms involved consist of increased extracellular volumes, hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and abnormal ion exchanges between extra- and intracellular compartments. Recent studies have demonstrated an association between arterial hypertension and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may well be the most important aetiological factor in this type of arterial hypertension as it stimulates both renal sodium reabsorption and sympathetic nervous system activity and reduces vascular Na-K-ATPase activity.
