Increased intake of dietary fiber reduces the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. We assessed the effects of a fiber-rich diet on body weight, adipokine concentrations, and the metabolism of glucose and lipids in non-obese and obese subjects in Korea, where rice is the main source of dietary carbohydrates.

Eleven healthy, non-obese and 10 obese subjects completed two 4-week phases of individual isoenergetic food intake. During the control diet phase, subjects consumed standard rice; during the modified diet phase, subjects consumed equal proportions of fiber-rich Goami No. 2 rice and standard rice. We used a randomized, controlled, crossover study design with a washout period of 6 weeks between the two phases.

After the modified diet phase, body weight was significantly lower in both the non-obese and obese subjects (non-obese, 57.0 +/- 2.9 vs. 56.1 +/- 2.8 kg, p = 0.001; obese, 67.7 +/- 2.1 vs. 65.7 +/- 2.0 kg, p &<0.001 for before vs. after). The BMI was significantly lower in obese subjects (26.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 26.0 +/- 0.6 kg/m2, p &<0.001). The modified diet was associated with lower serum triacylglycerol (p &<0.01), total cholesterol (p &<0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p &<0.05), and C-peptide (p &<0.05) concentrations in the obese subjects.

These results indicate that fiber-rich Goami No. 2 rice has beneficial effects and may be therapeutically useful for obese subjects.
