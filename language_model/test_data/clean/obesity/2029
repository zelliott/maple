Although liposuction is considered to be a relatively safe procedure, several deaths and nonfatal serious complications such as sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, thromboembolic disease, fat emboli, and adult respiratory distress syndrome have been reported. In the present study, we have investigated a wide variety of components belonging to the coagulation, fibrinolytic, plasma kallikrein-kinin, and complement systems in 22 patients undergoing syringe-assisted liposuction using the superwet or tumescent technique. In spite of a relatively high mean aspirate volume (2,648 ml), only small changes over time well within the normal range were found for the different parameters. In nine randomly selected patients, we also measured interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The size of the interleukin-6 peaks was found to be of the same order of magnitude as those measured in patients undergoing hernia repair or percutaneous cholecystectomy but lower than those in patients undergoing open cholecystectomy, breast reduction, or breast reconstruction. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha was not detected in any sample in any of the patients. We conclude that syringe-assisted liposuction with the present aspirate volumes using the superwet or tumescent technique represents a small to moderate surgical trauma without clinical significant activation of the cascade systems.
