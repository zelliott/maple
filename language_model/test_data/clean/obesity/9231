The BioEnterics intragastric balloon (BIB) is one of the most common bariatric procedures in obese patients in Europe. Associated gastric perforation is a rare, yet very dangerous, complication. We report a case of such a complication after BioEnterics intragastric balloon insertion in a 60-year-old female patient and subsequent cooperation between an endoscopist and bariatric videosurgeon in her treatment.
