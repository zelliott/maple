The study was carried out on 102 obese and overweight women, average age 41.5 years, and 33 control non-obese women matched for age. Fasting venous blood vitamins (ascorbic acid, tocopherol, retinol, carotenes, thiamin, riboflavin, folic acid, pyridoxine), lipids (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, total lipids) and haematological indices were determined. Significantly lower serum antioxidant vitamin levels and a higher prevalence of vitamin deficiency were found in the study group. The study confirmed the high risk of dyslipoproteinaemia and the high frequency of elevated blood pressure in obese women. A correlation between ascorbic acid status, degree of obesity and the incidence of elevated blood pressure was demonstrated.
