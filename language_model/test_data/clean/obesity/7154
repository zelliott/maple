Obesity is associated with a blunted beta-adrenoceptor-mediated lipolysis and fat oxidation. We investigated whether polymorphisms in codon 16, 27 and 164 of the beta (2)-adrenoceptor gene (ADRB2) and exon 10 of the G protein beta (3)-subunit gene (GNB3) are associated with alterations in in vivo lipolysis and fat oxidation.

Sixty-five male and 43 female overweight and obese subjects (body mass index (BMI) range: 26.1-48.4 kg/m(2)) were included. Energy expenditure (EE), respiratory quotient (RQ), circulating free fatty acid (FFA) and glycerol levels were determined after stepwise infusion of increasing doses of the non-selective beta-agonist isoprenaline (ISO).

In women, the Arg16 allele of the ADRB2 gene was associated with a blunted increase in circulating FFA, glycerol and a decreased fat oxidation during ISO stimulation. In men, the Arg16 allele was significantly associated with a blunted increase in FFA but not in glycerol or fat oxidation.

These results suggest that genetic variation in the ADRB2 gene is associated with disturbances in in vivo beta-adrenoceptor-mediated lipolysis and fat oxidation during beta-adrenergic stimulation in overweight and obese subjects; these effects are influenced by gene-gender interactions.
