This article reviews intervention studies that address health disparities and the increasing rate of obesity in minority youth. The review focuses on interventions that target obesity-related behaviors (diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviors) and adiposity outcomes (body mass index) in minority children and adolescents.

A conceptual framework is presented that integrates ecological, cultural, social, and cognitive approaches to reducing obesity in ethnically diverse youth. The review highlights effective interventions in minority youth and distinguishes between culturally targeted and culturally tailored components.

A limited number of studies have been conducted that target obesity-related behaviors and adiposity outcomes in minority youth. The most successful interventions for minority youth have incorporated culturally targeted and culturally tailored intervention components using multi-systemic approaches.

Further research is needed that focuses on testing the efficacy of theoretically based approaches that integrate culturally appropriate program elements for improving obesity-related behaviors and adiposity outcomes in minority youth.
