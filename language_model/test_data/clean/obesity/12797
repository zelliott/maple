The body weight and height are measured and body mass index (BMI) is calculated in the female and male participants of the Hungarian Optimal Family Planning Service (which is a periconceptional care). Of 1133 female participants, 28 (2.5%) and 91 (8.0%) were obese &> 30 kg/(m)2 BMI] or had overweight [25-29.9 kg/(m)2 BMI]. Of 1125 male participants, 63 (5.6%) and 255 (22.7%) were obese or overweighted. These prospective parents were informed about the recurrence risk of obesity, triggering and suppressive protective factors for genetic predisposition and they were educated how they could reduce the recurrence of obesity in their planned children.
