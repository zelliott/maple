The effect of obesity on the relationship between very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride (TG) production rate and concentration was studied in 80 subjects whose TG concentrations ranged from 41-1315 mg/100 ml and whose relative weight varied from 0.74-1.46. There was a positive correlation between VLDL-TG production rate and plasma TG concentration in all 80 patients (r = 0.78), which was highly statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Both male and female subjects were subdivided into quartiles on the basis of relative weight; the relationship between VLDL-TG production rate and plasma TG concentration was found to be comparable in all subgroups. These observations suggest that moderate degrees of obesity do not affect VLDL-TG kinetics in patients whose plasma TG levels vary over an extremely wide range.
