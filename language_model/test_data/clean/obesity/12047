To investigate the association between various anthropometric indexes of obesity with arterial hypertension in elderly from Barbados (Bridgetown) and Cuba (Havana).

Cross-sectional data were extracted from the Survey on Health, Aging and Well being in Latin America and the Caribbean (SABE).

In Bridgetown and Havana, respectively, 1508 and 1905 subjects ( ≥ 60 years) were examined, and were selected by a controlled sampling design.

The occurrence of hypertension was assessed by self-report. Multiple measurements of adiposity were used including body mass index (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m(2)), waist hip ratio (WHR =&> 0.95 men;&> 0.80 women), waist to height ratio (W/ht. =&> 0.50) and waist circumference - WC(L) (&> 88 cm, women;&> 102 cm, men) e WC(OK) (&> 90.3 cm, women;&> 91.3 cm, men). Binary logistic regression analyses (Odds Ratio) were used to measure strengths of relationships.

In the elderly of Bridgetown, the final design (adjusted for age, education, race, smoking, regular physical activity and diabetes) shows that, in men, WC(OK) and W/Ht were associated with hypertension, and in women, WCL and WCOK were the indexes associated. In the Cuban elderly, the final design shows that, with the exception of WHR, all indicators were associated with hypertension. WCOK and W/ht were the indexes most strongly associated with the outcome.

The explanatory power of anthropometric indicators when determining the outcome differed between men and women, as well as between cultural groups living in relative proximity (Barbadians and Cubans).
