Obesity as a chronic condition among large numbers of people is a disease of recent origin, often but by no means always associated with dietary habits and sedentary lifestyle. Many obese people want to lose weight, and may have tried to do so numerous times with self-help or proprietary weight-loss programs. When they seek a physician for help in losing weight-or when a physician advises an obese patient to lose weight as part of a clinical strategy-care must be taken to "match" the patient to an appropriate therapeutic program with appropriate therapeutic goals. History and physical examination and psychologic evaluation are essential elements of patient screening. Complications of obesity must be taken into account in any treatment plan. The multidisciplinary management strategy is most likely to succeed in helping the patient lose weight. It also avoids untoward events associated with complications or concomitant disease. The multidisciplinary approach is especially important when the patient does not lose weight, and alternative strategies must be considered, such as surgical approaches.
