Basic concepts of epidemiology are presented with an update on the more than 270 factors that the authors have found suggested as contributors to cardiovascular disease risk. A comprehensive classification scheme and public health and clinical implications are discussed. Based on predictions from prospective and intervention studies, up to 90 per cent of coronary heart disease could be prevented by optimization of known cardiovascular risk factors.
