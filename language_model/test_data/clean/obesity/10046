Genetically obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats present an impaired response of hepatic glucose production to the inhibition by insulin. In this work, we have investigated the modulation by this hormone of epinephrine-stimulated gluconeogenesis, in hepatocytes isolated from obese (fa/fa) rats and their lean (Fa/-) littermates. Epinephrine (1 microM) caused a maximal stimulation of [14C]lactate conversion to [14C]glucose in hepatocytes isolated from either obese or lean animals. The stimulation of gluconeogenesis by epinephrine was accompanied by a significant reduction of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels, an inactivation of both pyruvate kinase and 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase, and by a 2-fold increase in the cellular concentrations of cAMP. The presence of insulin in the incubation medium antagonized, in a concentration-dependent manner, the effects of epinephrine. In hepatocytes isolated from lean rats, the reversion caused by insulin was complete, the concentration required for half-maximal insulin action ranging from 0.22 to 0.56 nM. In contrast, in obese rat hepatocytes, insulin only partially blocked epinephrine-mediated effects, and the sensitivity to insulin was 2- to 4-fold lower, as indicated by the corresponding half-maximal insulin action values. Furthermore, insulin (10 nM) almost completely blocked the increase in cAMP levels induced by epinephrine in lean rat hepatocytes, whereas it only provoked a small and nonsignificant reduction of epinephrine-stimulated levels of the cyclic nucleotide in hepatocytes obtained from obese rats.
