Electrical stimulation of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) temperature in lean and obese Zucker rats, whereas stimulation of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) was without effect in either genotype, before or after adrenalectomy. The prolonged duration of the increase in BAT temperature in the obese (fa/fa) rat observed after VMN stimulation was normalized after adrenalectomy.
