Traditionally, an awake intubation is performed by flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy. However, many new devices have been developed to assist anesthesiologists with both routine and difficult airway management, one of which is the Bonfils Retromolar Intubation Fiberscope. This device may be more beneficial than the flexible fiberoptic laryngoscope since it can readily navigate through soft tissue and physically lift airway structures, is more affordable, durable, and easier to clean. This case series demonstrates successful use of the Bonfils Scope in five patients for awake orotracheal intubation with anticipated difficult airways.
