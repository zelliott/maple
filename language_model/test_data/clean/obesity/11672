Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are transcription factors that regulate adipocyte differentiation and gene expression. We tested the hypothesis that the Pro12Ala variant of PPAR-gamma2 is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes-related traits in 921 subjects from the San Antonio Family Heart Study. Subjects with at least one Ala allele (n=210) had significantly higher body mass index (P=0.015) and waist circumference (P=0.028) and significantly higher levels of serum leptin (P= 0.022) than those without the allele. Further studies will determine whether the Pro12Ala variant itself, or other genetic variation at PPAR-gamma, is responsible for this association with measures of obesity in Mexican Americans.
