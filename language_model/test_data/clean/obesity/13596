Epidemiological data on impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) based on a representative Mexican sample are not available; thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence and distribution of IFG and IGT, and to establish its relationship with obesity in Mexican adults.

We performed a cross-sectional population-based study on a representative sample of Mexican adults aged 30 to 65 years. Anthropometric measurements of obesity that included waist circumference (WC) and total body fat percentage were collected and the body mass index calculated. All subjects also underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Diagnosis of glucose metabolism disorders was based on criteria of the American Diabetes Association.

Prevalence of IFG, IGT, and IFG+IGT was 24.6%, 8.3%, and 10.3%, respectively. The age-adjusted prevalence of IFG (49.5% and 50.5%), IGT (49.1% and 50.9%), and IFG+IGT (57.3% and 42.7%) was similar in men and women. Prevalence of obesity was 45.9% with predominance in women (48.8% versus 42.1%, P = 0.01). A total of 394 (31.0%) individuals were overweight. Among the 550 prediabetic normal weight subjects, 70 (22.4%), 15 (14.2%), and 7 (5.3%) had IFG, IGT, or IFG+IGT. The odds ratio (OR) between WC and IFG (OR 3.1, CI(95%) 1.4-9.7), IGT (OR 3.2, CI(95%) 1.2-9.1), and IFG+IGT (OR 2.8, CI(95%) 1.3-8.2) was higher than the OR of other measurements of obesity.

Prevalence of prediabetes in the Mexican adult population is high. WC is the measure of obesity more strongly associated with metabolic glucose disorders. A high proportion of subjects with normal weight exhibit prediabetes.
