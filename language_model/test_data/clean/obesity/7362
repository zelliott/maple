Through its classic effects on sodium and potassium homeostasis, aldosterone, when produced in excess, is associated with the development of hypertension and hence with higher cardiovascular and renal risk. In recent years, experimental and epidemiologic data have suggested that aldosterone also may be linked to high cardiovascular risk independently of its effects on blood pressure. Thus, aldosterone has been associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome in selected populations, and these associations may further contribute to the higher cardiovascular risk of subjects with elevated aldosterone levels. Moreover, aldosterone has been reported to promote inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in a number of tissues. Clinical evidence indicates that patients with primary hyperaldosteronism have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular and renal complications than patients with essential hypertension who have the same level of blood pressure. Aldosterone receptor blockade has been shown to lower cardiovascular mortality after myocardial infarction and in patients with congestive heart failure. Some studies have also demonstrated that aldosterone blockade could have a favorable impact on the progression of renal disease. However, prospective interventional trials are needed to further evaluate the impact of blockade of aldosterone on cardiovascular risk.
