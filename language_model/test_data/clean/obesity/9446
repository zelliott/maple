Fucoxanthin, a marine carotenoid found in edible brown seaweeds, attenuates white adipose tissue (WAT) weight gain and hyperglycemia in diabetic/obese KK-A(y) mice, although it does not affect these parameters in lean C57BL/6J mice. In perigonadal and mesenteric WATs of KK-A(y) mice fed fucoxanthin, mRNA expression levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which are considered to induce insulin resistance, were markedly reduced compared to control mice. In contrast to KK-A(y) mice, fucoxanthin did not alter MCP-1 and TNF-α mRNA expression levels in the WAT of lean C57BL/6J mice. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mRNA expression levels in WAT were also decreased by fucoxanthin in KK-A(y) mice. In differentiating 3T3-F442A adipocytes, fucoxanthinol, which is a fucoxanthin metabolite found in WAT, attenuated TNF-α-induced MCP-1 and IL-6 mRNA overexpression and protein secretion into the culture medium. In addition, fucoxanthinol decreased TNF-α, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression in RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells stimulated by palmitic acid. These findings indicate that fucoxanthin regulates mRNA expression of inflammatory adipocytokines involved in insulin resistance, iNOS, and COX-2 in WAT and has specific effects on diabetic/obese KK-A(y) mice, but not on lean C57BL/6J mice.
