Little is known about how ethnicity may influence how self-rated physical activity (PA) and obesity relates to measured obesity, cardiorespiratory fitness and self-rated health.

To examine the influence of ethnicity on the association between: (1) self-rated and measured obesity; (2) self-reported PA and cardiorespiratory fitness; and (3) obesity and PA with self-rated health.

Data from NHANES 1999-2004 (2,981 adults) was used.

Compared to white and overweight black men, Hispanic men were less likely to consider themselves overweight (OR = 0.36-0.56). Compared to white men, black active men were more likely to report being more active than their peers (OR = 1.44) but were less likely to be fit (OR = 0.74). Black active women and non-white overweight women were less likely to self-rate as having very good or excellent health as compared to white women with similar self-reported and measured health factors.

Ethnicity and gender influence how self-rated and measured health factors interrelate.
