To explore the hypothesis that sustained weight loss in severely obese patients may have benefits that are independent of their attained BMI.

We conducted a comparison of two weight-stable groups with BMI in the 30 to 35 kg/m(2) range. Subjects (n = 79) were selected obese patients 3 years after laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery, and controls (n = 79) were obese patients seeking weight loss therapy. Subjects were selected in a de-identified manner from our database to best match the control group. A range of clinical, biochemical, and questionnaire measures were obtained to assess obesity-related health status

Subjects maintained a mean weight loss of 32.8 +/- 18 kg after surgery. The weight loss subjects had significantly lower fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations, along with higher high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels and better indirect measures of insulin sensitivity when compared with controls (p &<0.05 for all). In addition, aminotransferase levels, neutrophil counts, and globulin levels were also significantly lower in weight loss subjects. All differences in laboratory variables remained significant after controlling for BMI. The subjects also reported better health-related quality of life, fewer symptoms of depression, and greater satisfaction with their appearance than controls.

These findings suggest that the post-weight loss state conveys benefits that are greater than predicted by the attained BMI. These findings may have important implications regarding the expectations of weight loss therapy, and mechanisms for this effect should be carefully sought.
