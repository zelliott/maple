The effects of various weight loss strategies on pancreatic beta cell function remain unclear. We aimed to compare the effect of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) on beta cell function.

One year controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00273104).

One hundred and nineteen morbidly obese participants without known diabetes from the MOBIL study (mean (s.d.) age 43.6 (10.8) years, body mass index (BMI) 45.5 (5.6) kg/m², 84 women) were allocated to RYGB (n = 64) or ILI (n = 55). The patients underwent repeated oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) and were categorised as having either normal (NGT) or abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT). Twenty-nine normal-weight subjects with NGT (age 42.6 (8.7) years, BMI 22.6 (1.5) kg/m², 19 women) served as controls. OGTT-based indices of beta cell function were calculated.

One year weight reduction was 30% (8) after RYGB and 9% (10) after ILI (P &<0.001). Disposition index (DI) increased in all treatment groups (all P&<.05), although more in the surgery groups (both P &<0.001). Stimulated proinsulin-to-insulin (PI/I) ratio decreased in both surgery groups (both P &<0.001), but to a greater extent in the surgery group with AGT at baseline (P &<0.001). Post surgery, patients with NGT at baseline had higher DI and lower stimulated PI/I ratio than controls (both P &<0.027).

Gastric bypass surgery improved beta cell function to a significantly greater extent than ILI. Supra-physiological insulin secretion and proinsulin processing may indicate excessive beta cell function after gastric bypass surgery.
