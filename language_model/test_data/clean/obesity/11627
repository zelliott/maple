Twenty-four male (12 obese and 12 lean) and 21 female (11 obese and 10 lean) SHR/N-cp rats were fed a diet containing either 54% sucrose or starch for periods of 3-4 months. Rats were killed after a 14-16 h fast and liver enzyme activities were determined in both sex groups. Liver glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), malic enzyme (ME), phosphofructokinase (PFK), glucokinase (GK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (per total liver capacity) were significantly affected by phenotype (obese&> lean). Arginase and ornithine transcarbamylase levels were analysed only in male rats and were found to be elevated in obese rats as compared to lean littermates. Some of the above changes in enzyme levels were exaggerated by sucrose feeding but not the changes in FBPase, PEPCK, ME and GK (in both sexes) plus AST, arginase and arginine synthase activities in male rats and ALT levels in female rats. Results from SHR/N-cp rats published in this paper were compared to results obtained from LA/N-cp rats published previously. Comparison of the non-diabetic obese LA/N-cp with the diabetic obese SHR/N-cp male shows a greater excess in lipogenic capacity of the liver in the LA/N-cp male rat. The SHR/N-cp obese female also shows a greater liver lipogenic capacity as compared with the obese male SHR/N-cp rat. The results suggest that an adaptation of excessive lipogenesis in the liver of obese rats may be an anti-diabetogenic adaptation resulting in increased glucose conversion to lipids, thus reducing blood glucose levels.
