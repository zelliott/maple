Recent studies have demonstrated that adipocyte fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of insulin resistance. The aim of our study was to assess serum FABP levels in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) before and after 3 months of treatment with PPAR-alpha agonist fenofibrate (F) and to explore the relationship of FABP to biochemical parameters and measures of insulin sensitivity assessed by hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp. We measured biochemical parameters by standard laboratory methods, insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp and serum concentrations of FABP by commercial ELISA kit in 11 obese females with T2DM before and after three months of treatment with PPAR-alpha agonist fenofibrate and in 10 lean healthy control women (C). Serum FABP levels were 2.5-fold higher in T2DM group relative to C and were not affected by fenofibrate treatment (C: 20.6+/-2.1 microg/l, T2DM before F: 55.6+/-5.7 microg/l, T2DM after F: 54.2+/-5.4 microg/l, p 0.0001 for C vs. T2DM before F). Hyperinsulinemia during the clamp significantly suppressed FABP levels in both C and T2DM group. FABP levels positively correlated with BMI, triglyceride levels, blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, atherogenic index and insulin levels. An inverse relationship was found between FABP and HDL levels, metabolic clearance rate of glucose, M/I and MCR(glc)/I sensitivity indexes. We conclude that FABP levels are closely related to BMI, parameters of insulin sensitivity, HDL levels and measures of diabetes compensation. This combination makes FABP a valuable marker of metabolic disturbances in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
