Obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are serious and growing health care problems worldwide, leading an increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Over the past decade, emerging evidence has shown that an increased chromosomal damage, as determined by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay, is correlated to the pathogenesis of metabolic and CVD. An increased micronuclei (MN) frequency has been demonstrated in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, a common condition in reproductive-aged women associated with impaired glucose tolerance, T2D mellitus and the MetS. High levels of MN have been detected to be significantly correlated with T2D as well as with the occurrence and the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). Long-term follow-up studies have shown that an increased MN frequency is a predictive biomarker of cardiovascular mortality within a population of healthy subjects as well as of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with known CAD. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that CBMN assay may provide an useful tool for screening of the MetS and its progression to diabetes and CVD in adults as well in children. Large population-based cohorts are needed in order to compare the MN frequencies as well as to better define whether MN is a biomarker or a mediator of cardiometabolic diseases.
