Recent evidence demonstrates that only about 5% of individuals embarking on a weight loss program show lasting weight reduction. While many weight loss strategies have demonstrated poor results, some combinations of approaches have been successful. Empirical evidence demonstrates that certain conceptual approaches can contribute to the development of strategies to facilitate weight loss. This manuscript addresses three conceptual approaches that direct intervention strategies. Cognitive-behavioral strategies are directed toward modification of eating behaviors, and the social-contextual approach is directed toward the social and partnership approach to intervention. Biophysical strategies that have demonstrated success in weight loss include the effect of dietary restriction and exercise on weight loss. Using this synthesis of empirical evidence for success in weight loss, practitioners can develop individually tailored intervention strategies for their clients.
