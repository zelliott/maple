This study investigates the contribution of body fat stores on the age-associated increase in serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Percentage of body fat was measured by hydrostatic weighing, and serum cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were determined in a sample of 472 healthy men and women ages 18-50 years. In both sexes, body fat mass was significantly correlated with serum cholesterol (r = 0.21 in men and r = 0.24 in women, P less than 0.01) and triglyceride (r = 0.33 in men and r = 0.24 in women, P less than 0.01) levels. After adjustment for the association between age and serum cholesterol, no correlation was observed between body fat mass and serum cholesterol (r = 0.01 in men and r = 0.09 in women). After correction for age, serum triglyceride levels remained significantly correlated with body fat mass (r = 0.26 and r = 0.17 in men and women, respectively, P less than 0.05). As body fat also increases with age, the possibility that a partial correlation coefficient procedure eliminated a portion of the age effect mediated by an age-related increase in fat, was addressed by performing further analyses. Within each sex subsample two sets of analyses were performed on (a) three groups of subjects individually paired for age but with different levels of body fat stores, and (b) three groups of subjects paired for the amount of body fat but differing in age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
