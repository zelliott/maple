The accuracy of waist to hip girth ratio (WHR) in assessing visceral/subcutaneous abdominal fat distribution has not yet been clearly established in the obese population. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between WHR and visceral/subcutaneous fat distribution, both assessed by computerized tomography (CT), in a group of 28 obese patients (15 male, 13 female). Furthermore, 33 normal weight or slightly overweight subjects (23 male, 10 female) were studied as a control group. Obese subjects of both sexes were found to have higher values of WHR than non-obese; conversely visceral:subcutaneous fat area ratio (VSR) values did not differ significantly. Significant correlation between WHR and BMI was present both in males (r = 0.41, P &<0.01) and in females (r = 0.54, P &<0.01). In normal weight males significant correlations between WHR and visceral fat area or VSR were found. In obese males these correlations were much weaker. In normal weight females a significant correlation was found between waist circumference and visceral fat area, whereas in obese females no positive correlations were found between anthropometric measurements and CT indices of visceral fat distribution. In conclusion, WHR cannot be considered as a reliable index of visceral/subcutaneous fat distribution in obese patients, particularly if they are females.
