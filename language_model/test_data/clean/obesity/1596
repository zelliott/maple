The purpose of this study was to develop and test a questionnaire to assess parental self-efficacy for enacting healthy diet and physical activity behaviors in their 6- to 11-year-old children.

A 35-item questionnaire was developed and tested with 146 U.S. parents.

Participant responses resulted in a 34-item questionnaire with two subscales (dietary behaviors and physical activity behaviors), which were valid and reliable in the study sample.

This new measure will serve as a tool for the assessment of parental self-efficacy for enacting healthy lifestyles in their children 6-11 years old.
