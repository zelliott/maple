Plasma profiles of glucose, insulin and lipids were examined in the male WBN/Kob-Lepr(fa) (fa/fa) rat, a new model of type 2 diabetes (T2D), in comparison with age-matched original male WBN/Kob (lean) rats. The fa/fa rats developed hypertriglycemia, obesity and hyperglycemia from 5, 7, and 9 weeks of age, respectively. Plasma insulin levels in fa/fa rats were significantly higher than those in lean rats at 5 weeks of age, but after 11 weeks of age gradually declined to the levels in lean rats. HOMA-IR, a measure of insulin resistance status, showed that fa/fa rats had insulin resistance. The fa/fa rat has the potential to become an important animal model of T2D with obesity.
