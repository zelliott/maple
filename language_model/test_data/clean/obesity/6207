To bridge the beneficial metabolic effects of pronounced weight loss on one side and the data on morbidity and mortality on the other side, we investigated the impact of profound weight loss on structural and functional markers of early atherosclerosis.

Thirty-seven obese adults were examined before and 18 months after bariatric surgery. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), nitroglycerine-mediated dilation, and abdominal fat distribution were assessed by high-resolution ultrasound. Surgery resulted in a body mass index decrease of 9.1 +/- 4.9 kg/m(2) with concomitant improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism. Carotid intima-media thickness diminished from 0.56 +/- 0.09 to 0.53 +/- 0.08 mm (n = 37; P = 0.004). Flow-mediated dilation improved from 5.81 +/- 3.25 to 9.01 +/- 2.93% (n = 25; P &<0.001). Both CIMT and FMD were associated with intra-abdominal fat diameter.

The present results demonstrate that bariatric surgery-induced diminution of visceral fat improves both functional and structural markers of early atherosclerosis, providing a link between the weight loss-associated improvements of traditional and non-traditional risk factors and the reduced long-term morbidity and mortality after bariatric surgery.
