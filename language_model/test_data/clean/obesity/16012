The incidence of and prophylaxis against clinically important pulmonary emboli (PE) in burned patients is an often discussed problem. To study its magnitude, all patients admitted with acute burns were followed for clinical evidence of thromboembolism: 2,106 patients were evaluated (1,439 adults). No children had evidence of PE. Six adults (0.4%) sustained a PE: none died. Mean burn size was 26.8%; mean age, 35.1 years; and mean weight, 90.8 kg. Mean PBD of the PE was 16.5 days. None with PE were ICU patients and none had lower-extremity IV lines. Two patients had embolic events after discharge from the hospital. No ICU patients who died unexpectedly had a PE. Only two patients had significant risk factors; they were obese with leg burns. Three had no risk factors; normal weight and upper body burns without prolonged bed rest. The incidence of pulmonary emboli and resulting morbidity do not justify routine prophylactic heparinization of all burned patients.
