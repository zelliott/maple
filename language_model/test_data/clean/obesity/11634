The relationship of blood pressure with physical activity and anthropometry was studied in 295 adolescents (mean age, 15.3 years) who entered 1. "formación profesional" (a technological training) in 1990 in Puerto Real, a village of Cádiz, Spain. Systolic and diastolic (fifth-phase Korotkoff) blood pressure, and anthropometrics measurements (weight, height and triceps and subscapular skinfolds thickness) were measured with standardized techniques. Habitual and sports physical activity were assessed by a self-reported questionnaire. The results reported in this study suggest that systolic blood pressure is associated with habitual physical activity in girls, and that the systolic blood pressure is associated weakly with sports activity in girls and in boys. The stronger predictor of blood pressure was Quetelet Index (kg/m2).
