The Danish Fitness and Nutrition Council has proposed a model to monitor the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Denmark. The model should make it possible to assess whether different initiatives reduce the prevalence of obesity and to gain knowledge on how to prevent obesity. The prevalence of obesity should be estimated in a non-biased randomly selected sample of the population once yearly, using all available data from routine measurements and encouraging new measurements conducted in professional settings where routine data are not available.
