To evaluate the effectiveness of a non-pharmacological intervention for weight gain management in severe mental disorders.

An open, multicentre interventional study was conducted in 93 mental health services. Patients concerned with weight gain were included in this study and received a 12-week 1-hour group intervention focused on nutrition counseling, lifestyle, physical activity and self-esteem. Weight, waist circumference and blood pressure were measured before and after the intervention.

1,071 patients were enrolled in the study, and 73.9% completed the 12-week intervention. Significant weight loss (Mean difference: 0.41, CI 95%: 0.18 to 0.64, p = 0.001) and a significant BMI reduction (Mean difference: 0.13, CI 95%: 0.04 to 0.22, p = 0.006) were observed. During the intervention 37 (4.4%) patients lost&> 7% of their initial weight, 780 (92.5%) maintained their weight, and 26 (3.1%) of the patients had a meaningful weight gain &> 7%). There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients undertaking physical activity after the intervention (70.8%, p &<0.001).

In this 3-month open study we found a small weight and waist reduction, and increased physical activity practice, suggesting a trend towards anthropometric profile improvement. However, further randomized-controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the efficacy and clinical relevance of this psychosocial intervention for weight gain.
