Prepubertal gilts of obese (n = 24) or lean (n = 24) genetic lines were injected (s.c.) daily with 0, 2, or 4 mg of porcine somatotropin (pST) for 6 wk starting at 160 d of age to determine whether pST affects follicular function. Blood and ovaries were collected at slaughter 24 h after the last injection. Surface follicles greater than or equal to 1.0 mm in diameter were counted, and pools of follicular fluid (FFL) and granulosa cells were collected from 1.0- to 3.9-mm (small) and 4.0- to 6.9-mm (medium) follicles. Oocytes were collected from small and medium follicles and evaluated for maturational stage and viability. Porcine somatotropin increased (P less than .08) the numbers of small but not the numbers of medium follicles per gilt (P greater than .10). Oocyte maturation and viability were not affected by pST or genetic line. Porcine somatotropin increased (P less than .05) concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in serum and FFL of both obese and lean gilts; IGF-I was lower (P less than .01) in lean gilts. Treatment with pST decreased (P less than .05) IGF-II in FFL of lean but not in that of obese gilts. Dose of pST and line had no effect on concentrations of progesterone in FFL of small or medium follicles or on concentrations of estradiol in FFL of small follicles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
