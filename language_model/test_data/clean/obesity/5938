Seventeen moderately obese middle-aged male outpatients with untreated mild hypertension (OH) and 47 normotensive men with normal weight (C) were investigated with respect to intraerythrocyte electrolytes, transmembrane sodium fluxes, PRA and urinary excretion of aldosterone (U-ALDO). There was no difference between the groups in intraerythrocyte sodium but red cell potassium was significantly elevated in OH compared to C. Sodium influx and the rate constant for sodium efflux were also significantly higher in OH. There was a significant positive correlation between sodium influx and U-ALDO (r = 0.56, p less than 0.05).
