Ankle fractures are a common orthopedic injury. Certain ankle injuries have been associated with patient demographics such as obesity and smoking. Obese patients are more prone to severe ankle injuries. Naturally, these injuries affect the lower extremity mobility significantly, which itself is a risk factor for obesity.
