A leak from the stomach is the most serious complication that occurs after a gastric bariatric operation. The experience with 19 leaks that occurred after 791 gastric bariatric operations performed at North Carolina Memorial Hospital from 1975 to 1986 is described. The incidence of leaks was higher (8.3%) after a second than after a first gastric bariatric operation (2.0%). Ten leaks were life threatening and nine were not. There were no deaths. The diagnosis was made on the basis of Gastrografin swallow in seven patients, clinical findings in six, oral dye studies in three, barium study, a sinogram, and operation in one patient each. Thirteen of 16 patients were operated on within 4 hours of the diagnosis of a leak. One patient with a life-threatening leak and two with non-life-threatening leaks were managed without operations. Three patients were discharged after uncomplicated courses and readmitted, and the diagnosis of a leak was established. To minimize morbidity and mortality related to a leak, it is imperative to (1) recognize that a leak can occur after any gastric bariatric operation, (2) perform a Gastrografin swallow when a leak is suspected, and (3) operate on the patient if the Gastrografin swallow is positive or if the clinical findings suggest a leak.
