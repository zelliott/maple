Efficiency of different phytotherapeutic modalities (per os, baths, inhalation) in patients with arterial hypertension was evaluated under conditions of balneologic treatment. Modes of their curative action and mechanisms of the disease are considered. Comparative analysis of non-medicamentous technologies used in balneologic practice is presented. It is shown that hormonal regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism plays the key role in the realization of therapeutic effects of phytopreparations. The improvement of functional activity of the cardiovascular system turns out to correlate with reduced clinical manifestations of metabolic syndrome.
