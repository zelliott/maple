The relationship of dyslipidemias between young offspring and their parents was examined to evaluate its usefulness in predicting lipid disorders among parents and children.

Young offspring ages 5-17 years and their parents were studied in a community-based sample of 477 families. The dyslipidemias were defined as: (1) isolated high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); (2) isolated high triglycerides (TG) and/or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); and (3) combined, involving both above.

Children of parents with a given dyslipidemia type had the highest frequency of the same disorder (P &<0.001 to P &<0.05). In discriminant analyses only the corresponding disorders in their parents were selected into the models as significant predictors after controlling parental obesity. In terms of sensitivity, 54.8, 50.0, 66.7, and 69.1% of offspring could be correctly predicted for isolated TG/HDL-C, isolated LDL-C, combined, and any type of disorder, respectively, by the corresponding disorders in both parents. Likewise, the predictability of parent's dyslipidemia from their children's disorder was also modest.

The conjoint dyslipidemias have familial basis to provide rationale for parents or children to determine their own risk status; however, sensitivity and positive predictive values are not high enough to be useful as a selective screening tool.
