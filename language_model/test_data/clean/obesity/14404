A fatal syndrome associated with brief periods of anorexia or acute weight loss was noted in monkeys. Affected monkeys died unexpectedly or after a very short illness. Consistent gross findings at necropsy were enlarged, pale yellow livers, pale tan to yellow kidneys, abundant deposits of body fat and empty gastrointestinal tracts. Fatty change of the liver and kidney was the predominant and characteristic lesion found microscopically. Most of the monkeys were female Macaca fascicularis greater than 8 years of age. However, monkeys of other species and ages, and one male also died of this syndrome. Affected monkeys generally had losses of 8-33% of body weight (last measured weight--weight at death). In some animals, this syndrome was associated with a location change forcing new social interactions. A common clinical pathologic finding was azotemia. These findings suggest that obese monkeys may be prone to a fatal syndrome characterized by fatty change of the liver and kidney, and weight loss.
