Sedentary 24 h energy expenditure (EE) in seven reduced-obese pre-menopausal women was measured in a respiration chamber before and after a three month aerobic training period. Six of the seven women showed a higher VO2max after the training period, while resting heart rate and blood pressure decreased significantly. No significant effects of training were seen in daytime, sleeping or total 24 h EE. However, change in daytime EE was positively correlated to the change in VO2max. Sleeping and 24 h respiratory quotients were slightly increased after the training period. A negative correlation was found between the change in VO2max and the change in fasting FFA. Change in postprandial glucose concentration was also negatively correlated to change in VO2max. Satiety measured 135 min after lunch was decreased after the training period. It is concluded that the moderate physical training programme was not sufficient to obtain a substantial elevation of sedentary 24 h EE.
