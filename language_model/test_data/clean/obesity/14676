This study explored attitudes toward obesity between dietetics and nondietetics majors at Ohio University and their relationship with dietary intake and body composition. A convenience sample comprised of 76 female dietetics (n=38) and nondietetics (n=38) majors was assessed for attitudes toward obesity using a validated Fat Phobia Scale. Dietary intake and percent body fat were measured using a food frequency questionnaire and air displacement plethysmography, respectively. Results show that both groups were well matched with respect to age, weight, and percent body fat. The two groups were similar with respect to negative attitudes toward obesity and these perceptions were comparable to norms reported in previous studies. However, there were intriguing, but subtle, differences in the rating of adjectives comprising the Fat Phobia Scale and in dietary intake between the groups. Together, these results suggest that dietetics students are no more or less susceptible to negative attitudes toward obesity than their peers.
