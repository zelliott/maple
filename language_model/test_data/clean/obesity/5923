The quantity of the main lipid classes in hepatic tissue has been determined via thin layer chromatography on silica gel, the tissue obtained by blind hepatic biopsy in 20 patients with diabetes mellitus and obesity and in a control group of 5 patients with no hepatic disease. A considerable increase of lipid in liver was established in the patients with diabetes mellitus and obesity-the fraction of neutral lipids mainly. The fatty infiltration of liver in diabetics was accompanied by a considerable increase of triglyceride concentration--3,78 g/100 g wet body mass as compared with the controls--0,95 g/100 g wet body mass. Increased concentration of esters and cholesterol (80%) was established in the liver of the patients with diabetes and obesity as well as increased fraction of free fatty acids (230%). The concentrations of total phospholipids and free cholesterol in liver in both groups of patients proved to be rather close. The fatty infiltration of liver of diabetics with obesity was accompanied by marked increase of percentage content of triglycerides--from 17.3% in the control group to 42.1% from the total lipids in the patients with diabetes and obesity. Reverse alterations were established for the fraction of total phospholipids. Pronounced increase of the coefficient triglycerides/total phospholipids was established in case of diabetes and obesity.
