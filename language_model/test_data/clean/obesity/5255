The renal morphology of 5 grossly obese patients with normal renal function and many of the features of the Pickwickian syndrome was studied at autopsy. The most striking feature was that of increased glomerular size. Measurements of two parameters of glomerular areas indicated statistically significant glomerular enlargement for both as compared to controls. Glomerulomegaly was primarily the result of vascular dilatation and a variable mesangial component. This abnormality was related to several factors, including increased blood volume, hypoxia, and increased right ventricular pressure. Polycythemia, commonly noted in other similar conditions with glomerulomegaly, is believed to be of no importance in the pathogenesis of glomerular enlargement.
