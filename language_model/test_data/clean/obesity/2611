To compare the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and controls, and assess risk factors associated with PCOS.

A fasting oral glucose tolerance test after ingestion of 75 g of glucose was administered to 264 women with and 116 without PCOS. Moreover, fasting glucose, insulin, and testosterone levels were measured in the women with PCOS. Body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were calculated for each woman with PCOS.

The AGT prevalence was 14.4% in the PCOS group and 11.2% in the control group (P=0.17). The women with both PCOS and AGT had significantly higher BMIs, WHRs, testosterone levels, and HOMA-IR values than those with normal glucose tolerance.

While AGT was not associated with PCOS, the women with both PCOS and AGT were significantly more obese, hyperandrogenic, and insulin resistant than those with PCOS and normal glucose tolerance.
