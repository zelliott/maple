We examined the data from 530 subjects enrolled in a survey on the prevalence of diabetes in a Japanese-Brazilian population aged 40-79 years. Past self-reported and current weight values were analysed. Student t test was used to compare anthropometric measures between subjects with and without disturbance of glucose tolerance (DGT), hypertension and dyslipidemia. Point and interval estimates of the weight at 20 years-, age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (OR) were obtained by logistic regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between these diseases and the percent weight gain. Subjects with DGT, hypertension or dyslipidemia tended to have higher BMI during adulthood and to gain more weight in a shorter interval of time. Also, they presented higher waist-to-hip ratio and plasma glucose and worse lipid profile. OR were consistent with associations between chronic diseases and percent weight gain. Trend test of OR indicated that the risk of developing DGT alone or combined with hypertension and abdominal obesity increased 2% and 15% by percent unit of gained weight, respectively, as compared with those subjects with stable weight. Weight gain and the rate by which this occurs during lifetime may confer increased risk of chronic diseases. We suggested that preventive measures against obesity, i.e. the maintenance of healthy body weight lifelong, are necessary to minimize the occurrence of these diseases, also among migrant populations such as the Japanese-Brazilians.
