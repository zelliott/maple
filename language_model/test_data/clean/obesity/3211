With a prevalence of 5%-10% the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an exceptionally common disorder of premenopausal women. According to prospective studies, women with PCOS present abnormal glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus in 31%-35% and 7.5%-10%, respectively. PCOS patients have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia. The rate of spontaneous abortions as well as the risk to develop gestational or type 2 diabetes is increased in PCOS. Therefore, PCOS is not only a reproductive problem but a complex endocrine disease with important health implications. The role of the glucose metabolism in PCOS, the health consequences and possible interventions are reviewed in this article.
