In 16 abdominal type obese males, in 16 gluteal-femoral type obese females and in 10 nonobese males and 9 nonobese females, as controls, the influence of body fat distribution on basal lipid oxidation was evaluated by indirect calorimetry. Basal lipid oxidation was significantly higher in the obese males (1.21 +/- 0.12 g/kg-FFM.die) than in the nonobese males (0.47 +/- 0.13 g/kg-FFM.die; p less than 0.001), but not significantly different between obese and nonobese females (0.98 +/- 0.16 and 0.89 +/- 0.13 g/kg-FFM.die; p ns). A significant correlation between basal lipid oxidation and percentage of body fat was found only in the male subjects (r = 0.51; p less than 0.01). These results suggest that basal lipid oxidation differs in the two sexes according to adipose tissue anatomic location.
