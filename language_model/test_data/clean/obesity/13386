Published studies have shown that overproduction of very low density lipoproteins is a major factor leading to hypertiglyceridemia in obesity. Few systematic studies of triglyceride removal or postheparin lipoprotein lipase activity (LPLA) in obesity have appeared. We have examined heparin-released lipoprotein triglyceride hydrolase activities in 12 lean and 12 obese age- and sex-matched volunteers after overnight fasting. Heparin doses were calculated to compensate for the disproportionality between body mass and plasma volume in obesity. Triglyceride hydrolase activities of hepatic (HTGLA) and extrahepatic (LPLA) origin were distinguished by in vitro inhibition of LPLA with protamine sulfate. Incremental heparin doses were given to each subject to determine lipase activities under conditions of maximal release and to define sensitivity to heparin-facilitated lipase release. Maximal postheparin LPLA and HTGLA (u/ml plasma or u/total plasma vol) were similar in lean and obese individuals despite a nearly three-fold increase in calculated adipose tissue mass in the obese. Since adipose tissue LPLA has been reported to increase in proportion to adipocyte size, the lack of difference in maximal postheparin LPLA was expected. There was an inverse correlation between plasma triglyceride concentration and LPLA/kg adipose tissue. These empirical observations may reflect relatively decreased heparin-releaseable (functional) LPLA in relation to adipose organ mass in obese subjects. The mechanism of this relationship has not been established.
