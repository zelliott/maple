Exposure of the fetus to the intrauterine milieu can have profound effects on the health of the offspring in adulthood. Results of a series of studies demonstrate the powerful influence of the mother's metabolic state on whether the emerging adult develops obesity and hyperinsulinemia. Importantly, these attributes can be passed on to the next generation nongenetically and can be reversed and prevented.
