This paper deals with investigations on the activity of glucose-6-phosphat dehydrogenase (G6-P-GH), a key enzyme of HMP Shunt in erythrocytes, kidney, adrenal cortex, testes and adipose tissue of rats fed a high-fat diet (50% fat), in comparison with 3% fat diet as control animals. In erythrocytes, kidney and testes no significant differences of enzyme activity were observed. The number of erythrocytes and haematocrit value were also no different. The haemoglobin level was significantly elevated. In adrenal cortex and in mesenterial adipose tissue significantly lowered activity of G6P-DH is observed. These data are comparised with former studies in liver of high-fat diet rats and with literature data from adipose patients.
