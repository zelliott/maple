In the view of the importance of nutrition for the eventual physical and psychological development of children, several ways to control the outcome of malnutrition, both due to excess and to defect, have been reported. Before introducing the adequate measures for the prevention and early diagnosis of malnutrition and obesity, the nutritional status of the children aged between 1-7 years was evaluated in the assigned population by means of the Shukla's index. In 681 evaluated children, 42 obese, 23 with malnutrition, 81 overweight and 105 with risk of malnutrition were detected. This prevalence of malnutrition and obesity warrants the implementation of screening measures for the nutritional status in children from the health center. A protocol to this end is outlined in the present article.
