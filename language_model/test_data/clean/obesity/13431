Whole-body protein synthesis was measured with [15N]glycine in malnourished and recovered infants and in obese patients. Comparisons were made: 1) between results obtained with single (S) and repeated (R) oral dosage of tracer; and 2) between urea and ammonia as end products. In the infants S and R gave similar values for the synthesis rate. With both methods of dosage, the values obtained with NH3 as end product were about two-thirds of those with urea. It is suggested that the cause of this result is that glycine contributes preferentially to the formation of urinary NH3. With NH3 as end product, a collection period of 12 h has been found to be suitable. With urea it is not possible to define an appropriate collection period. The combination of single dose of [15N]glycine with urinary NH3 as end product provides a simple method for measuring whole-body protein synthesis under clinical and field conditions. It can be repeated at short intervals and can give useful comparative information provided that conditions are carefully standardized. The reproducibility so far is +/- 13%.
