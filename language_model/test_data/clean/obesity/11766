This study was undertaken to determine the effect of previous exercise on adipose tissue responsiveness to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation and on adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF). Eight lean and 8 obese men (body mass index [BMI], 23.6 +/- 2.1 [SD] v 29.0 +/- 1.9 kg x m(-2)) were investigated with abdominal subcutaneous microdialysis and 133Xe clearance. A stepwise isoprenaline infusion (10(-8), 10(-7), and 10(-6) mol x L(-1)) was administered in situ in the microdialysis catheter before and 2 hours after a submaximal exercise bout (90 minutes of cycling at 55% of maximal O2 uptake). No differences in the response (increase in interstitial glycerol v preinfusion level) to isoprenaline infusions were found between the 2 groups. In both groups, there was no difference in the response to postexercise versus preexercise infusion. When the vasodilating agent hydralazine (0.125 g x L(-1)) was infused into the microdialysis catheter to control for the vascular effects of isoprenaline, an interaction effect between exercise and isoprenaline dose was found. Analyses showed an attenuated response to the high isoprenaline dose after exercise (lean, 251 +/- 42 [SE] micromol x L(-1); obese, 288 +/- 77 micromol x L(-1)) versus before exercise (lean, 352 +/- 62 micromol x L(-1), P = .045 v after; obese, 380 +/- 94 micromol x L(-1), P = .021 v after), indicating a desensitization of lipolysis to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. ATBF and arterial plasma glycerol increased after exercise in both groups, but the increase was delayed in obese subjects. Arterial plasma insulin was higher in the obese versus lean subjects at all times, and decreased during recovery in both groups. In conclusion, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue responsiveness to beta-stimulation is not enhanced postexercise in lean and obese men, whereas previous exercise increases ATBF. Furthermore, the data suggest slower lipid mobilization postexercise and resistance to the antilipolytic effect of insulin in the obese.
