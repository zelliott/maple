Since the inclusion of Bulimia Nervosa (BN) in DSM-III as a nosological entity, it has been a focus of attention in the literature. To the present day several therapeutical approaches have been developed, pharmacological, psychological either separated or combined with diverse results. We have studied 20 patients diagnosed of BN according to DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria, from a psychopathological, and evolution point of view, the therapeutical response to a fixed daily dose of Fluoxetine 80 mg., during three months, with evaluations on days: 0-14-30-90. The mean age of the sample was 19.5 years; in 70% at the onset of the illness the Anorexia Nervosa symptomatology was prominent; there was a predominance of affective-obsessive previous personality traits in 60%, 100% showed unsatisfied or altered body image. We want to point out the quick improvement of various parameters such as: the constant eating desire, the binge eating episodes, the vomiting, the misuse of laxatives and the affective and anxious symptomatology. We compare our results with previous studies and make a review of the literature on this topic, we also give an efficacy profile of the different psychopharmacological drugs used in the treatment of eating disorders and a clinical guide to identify those patients who could improve with a psychopharmacological treatment.
