In many western countries more than half of the population is considered overweight (BMI&> or = 25).

Data from the first national representative health survey for Switzerland (conducted 1992/93), including 7930 men and 7358 women (response rate 71%) aged 15 and over, were used. Means and percentiles of body weight, body height and BMI were calculated for men and women of different age groups. Overweight was defined as a BMI&> or = 25, graded as overweight grade I (25.00-29.99), grade II (30.00-39.99), and grade III (BMI&> or = 40.00) and analyzed according to gender, age, etc.

Mean values for height decreases with increasing age, and body weight increases up to the age of 55-64 years in men and women. BMI values of all percentiles and age groups are lower for women than for men with the exception of age groups of 55 years or older and the 90 percentile. The prevalence of grade I overweight is 33.1% for men and 17.1% for women, of grade II overweight 5.8% and 4.5%, and of grade III overweight 0.3% and 0.2% respectively. Overall prevalence of overweight is 21.8% for women and 39.2% for men. Increasing age is associated with a higher prevalence of overweight. The prevalence of overweight in men increases with age up to 55-64 years, then levels off. In women, prevalence continues to rise. Overweight is more common in men of all age groups than in women.

Periodic studies of the national prevalence of overweight are essential for monitoring the magnitude, and changes in the magnitude, of this serious public health problem.
