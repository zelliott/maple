Our previous proteomics study revealed that long chain acyl CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) and gelsolin (GSN) are oppositely regulated in white adipose tissue of diet-induced obese rats. To firmly establish these proteins as mediators of adipogenic and/or lipogenic events, we efficiently knocked down the Acsl1 and Gsn genes using siRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells. Expectedly, Acsl1 knockdown stimulated expression of lipogenic genes. Interestingly, Gsn knockdown suppressed expression of lipogenic genes but strikingly increased that of TnfÎ± and Il6, which may have connections with lipolytic capacity of these genes. Conclusively, we provide clear evidence that ACSL1 and GSN are potential target proteins in the context of obesity.
