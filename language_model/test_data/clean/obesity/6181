Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for macrovascular complications in adults. Recently young-onset type 2 DM has increased worldwide and the increase of macrovascular complications in the young is worrisome.

Plasma values for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as a marker for promotion, and adiponectin as a marker for inhibition of atherosclerosis, were compared in 33 patients with type 1 DM (16 boys, 17 girls; age 14.9 +/- 3.7 years, mean +/- standard deviation) with those of 43 patients with type 2 DM (15 boys, 28 girls; age 16.5 +/- 3.5 years).

The PAI-1 level was significantly higher (19.3 +/- 8.1 vs 32.9 +/- 17.2 ng/ml; P &<0.001) and the adiponectin level was significantly lower (10.1 +/- 3.8 vs 7.4 +/- 3.7 microg/ml; P &<0.005) in the type 2 DM group. In obese patients, the PAI-1 level was significantly higher (P &<0.005) and the adiponectin level was lower (P= 0.15) in the type 2 DM group. Also, in the non-obese subjects, the PAI-1 level was significantly higher (P &<0.05) and the adiponectin level was lower (P= 0.11) in the type 2 DM group.

Even in young patients, type 2 DM is a risk factor for macrovascular complications compared with type 1 DM.
