A total of 191 (males, 106) students participated in the study. The ratio of male to female was 1.24:1. The elbow breadth was measured by a vernier caliper (Tajima, Japan) to the nearest 0.1 mm. The body mass index (kg/m2) (BMI) was calculated using the height and weight measurements taken previously. Body frame size was obtained using a table based on elbow width. Data were analyzed using Microsoft excel for Windows 98.
