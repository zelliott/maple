Insulin action in the brain contributes to adequate regulation of body weight, neuronal survival, and suppression of endogenous glucose production. We previously demonstrated by magnetoencephalography in lean humans that insulin stimulates activity in beta and theta frequency bands, whereas this effect was abolished in obese individuals.

The present study aims to define metabolic signals associated with the suppression of the cerebrocortical response in obese humans.

We determined insulin-mediated modulation of spontaneous cerebrocortical activity by magnetoencephalography during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and related it to measures of ectopic fat deposition and mediators of peripheral insulin resistance. Visceral fat mass and intrahepatic lipid content were quantified by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze associations of cerebrocortical insulin sensitivity and metabolic markers related to obesity.

Forty-nine healthy, nondiabetic humans participated in the study.

In a multiple regression, insulin-mediated stimulation of theta activity was negatively correlated to body mass index, visceral fat mass, and intrahepatic lipid content. Although fasting saturated nonesterified fatty acids mediated the correlations of theta activity with abdominal and intrahepatic lipid stores, adipocytokines displayed no independent correlation with insulin-mediated cortical activity in the theta frequency band.

Thus, insulin action at the level of cerebrocortical activity in the brain is diminished in the presence of elevated levels of saturated nonesterified fatty acids.
