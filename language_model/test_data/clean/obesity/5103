Since 1976, in 100 morbidly obese patients, the lesser curvature of the stomach has been inverted by performing a Nissen's fundoplication followed by gastric wrapping. All but one are losing weight satisfactorily and have early satiety. There was one postoperative death from pulmonary embolus. No harmful metabolic or physiologic changes have been detected. This procedure corrects or prevents esophageal reflux and enables the patient to control morbid obesity.
