Cardiac ventricular tissue of lean and genetically obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats was used to study the expression, subcellular distribution and insulin-induced recruitment of the glucose transporter GLUT4 and to elucidate possible molecular alterations of the translocation process. Hearts were removed from basal and insulin-treated (20 min) lean and obese Zucker rats, and processed for subcellular fractionation and Western blotting of proteins. In obese rats, the total GLUT4 content in a crude membrane fraction was reduced to 75 +/- 8% (P = 0.019) of lean controls. In contrast, GLUT4 abundance in plasma membranes was not significantly different between lean and obese rats with a concomitant decrease (47 +/- 3%) in the microsomal fraction of obese animals. In plasma membranes of lean animals insulin was found to increase the GLUT4 abundance to 294 +/- 43% of control with a significantly (P = 0.009) reduced effect in the obese group (139 +/- 10% of control). In these animals insulin failed to recruit GLUT4 from the microsomal fraction, whereas the hormone induced a significant decrease (41 +/- 4%) of microsomal GLUT4 in lean controls. In GLUT4-enriched membrane vesicles, obtained from cardiac microsomes of lean rats, a 24 kDa GTP-binding protein could be detected, whereas no significant labelling of this species was observed in GLUT4 vesicles prepared from obese animals. In addition to the translocation of GLUT4, insulin was found to promote the movement of the small GTP-binding protein rab4A from the cytosol (decrease to 61 +/- 13% of control) to the plasma membrane (increase to 177 +/- 19% of control) in lean rats with no effect of the hormone on rab4A redistribution in the obese group. In conclusion, cardiac glucose uptake of insulin-resistant obese Zucker rats is subject to multiple cellular abnormalities involving a reduced expression, altered redistribution and defective recruitment of GLUT4. We show here an association of the latter defect with alterations at the level of small GTP-binding proteins possibly leading to an impaired trafficking of GLUT4 in the insulin-resistant state.
