The fat-derived hormone, leptin, is thought to regulate adipose tissue mass by acting on the brain to reduce food intake and increase thermogenesis. We have produced obesity in rats more than 8 weeks old by feeding a high-calorie diet and have then examined the inhibitory effect of intracerebroventricularly injected recombinant murine leptin on their food intake versus control rats. In control rats, randomized injections of leptin (0.5, 2.0, or 10.0 microg) or sterile saline vehicle into the lateral ventricle produced a dose-dependent reduction in normal laboratory diet consumed 1, 4, and 24 h after the lights were turned off. However, in diet-induced obesity, the dose-dependent inhibition of food intake was observed at 1 h only, and the effect was attenuated. Switching the diet-induced obese rats to a normal laboratory diet 1 week before injections of leptin were commenced resulted in a reduction in the daily food consumption. These data suggest that rats made obese by feeding a high-calorie diet override the normal satiety effects of leptin since when they are returned to a normal laboratory diet, they reduce their calorie intake, possibly as a result of a restoration of the satiety effects of endogenous leptin. However, the fact that the hypophagic response to exogenous leptin is impaired in these rats at this time suggests some residual impairment of the satiety signal, perhaps caused by reduced receptor sensitivity and/or near total occupation of receptors by endogenous leptin molecules, levels of which are raised in plasma.
