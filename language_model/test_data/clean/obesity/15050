The aim of this study was to investigate the association of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) 4895 C/T gene polymorphism with obesity and obesity-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in Japanese.

This study included 1,452 Japanese (678 men and 774 women, aged 25 to 74) from rural communities in Shimane Prefecture, Japan.

The frequency of the C minor allele of CNR1 4895 C/T polymorphism was 47%. In men, the CC genotype carriers showed significantly greater body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) values than T allele carriers, even after adjusting for age and medications for hypertension, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes. The frequency of obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m(2)) in CC genotype carriers was significantly greater than in T allele carriers (31.8% vs 21.5%), but the frequency of central obesity (WC ≥85 for men and WC ≥90 cm for women) was not significant by CNR1 4895 C/T genotype. CC genotype carriers of CNR1 4895 C/T showed, in logistic regression analysis, significantly greater odds for obesity than T allele carriers, even after adjustment for age and the above-mentioned medications. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) values were also significantly different between the CC genotype and T allele carriers after controlling for age, medications for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, and BMI or WC.

This study supports the association of CNR1 4895 C/T with interindividual differences in obesity in men.
