Due to high prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and increasing popularity of bariatric and metabolic operations, Surgeons are faced with patients with relatively more severe T2DM disease. High level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is widely considered as a marker for uncontrolled T2DM. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between high level of pre-operative HbA1c, peri-operative morbidity and post operative outcome after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

We conducted a retrospective study based on our medical center metabolic and bariatric registry. The inclusion criteria for selecting patients to the study group was HbA1c of 9 gram/dL and higher. A comparison control study was designed to include T2DM patients similar in all characteristics except for HbA1c of 7.5 gram/dl and less.

We included 20 patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Each group of patients included half of the patients. The mean pre operative HbA1c in the studied and the control group were 10.4 gram/dL and 7.1 gram/dL respectively (p&<.001). There were no differences in peri-operative morbidity and length of stay at the hospital. Mean excess weight loss, fasting glucose levels and HbA1c levels were similar six months post surgery mean.

According to our study we have not found correlation between high HbA1c levels and increased peri-operative morbidity or insufficient excess weight loss among patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.
