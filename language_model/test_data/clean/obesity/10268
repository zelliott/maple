Post-heparin plasma activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL), and fat and muscle activity of LPL were measured in neutered lean and obese cats. Lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF) mRNA were measured in muscle and fat tissue with real-time PCR using primers for feline LPL, HSL, and TNF. Lipoprotein lipase plasma and fat activity and fat mRNA levels were significantly lower (50, 80, and 50%, respectively) in obese cats than lean cats, whereas the muscle/fat ratio of LPL was significantly higher in obese compared to lean cats. The activity of HL was not different between the groups. Hormone-sensitive lipase mRNA levels were significantly higher in obese than lean cats. The level of fat TNF also was significantly higher in obese cats than in lean cats, whereas the level in muscle was not different. The lower LPL activity and mRNA expression in fat and the higher LPL and HSL mRNA expression in muscle in obese cats compared to lean cats expectedly favor a redistribution of fatty acids from fat to muscle tissue where they can be deposited or used for energy in times of need. Tumor necrosis factor alpha may regulate this repartitioning process through suppression of adipocyte LPL.
