The gut microbial environment (bacteria and metabolites) may have a role in obesity. Urinary enterolignan concentrations can provide a marker of interindividual differences in microbial environments. Analysis was conducted on 6806 individuals from 2003 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, and weight status, waist circumference groups and high- vs low-enterolignan concentration was evaluated using multinomial logistic regression, adjusted for personal and dietary factors. High-enterolignan concentrations were defined as the 90th percentile value and greater. High-enterodiol concentration was associated with 18% and 42% lower likelihood of being overweight and obese, respectively, and 48% lower likelihood of having high-risk waist circumference among adults. High-enterolactone concentration was associated with 24% and 64% lower likelihood of being overweight and obese, respectively. Age and sex were not modifiers of these associations. These results from a large human study population provide additional evidence supporting the microbiome-obesity relationship.
