In a population-based cohort of Japanese American men in Hawaii, the 450 joggers differed from 6,171 nonjoggers in being younger, taller, heavier, and more obese; in having larger vital capacity, higher socioeconomic status, and a higher prevalence of certain electrocardiographic abnormalities; and in being more health conscious as demonstrated by less smoking and a higher frequency of special diets. Blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, hematocrit and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Multiple regression analysis showed HDL-C to be inversely related to obesity and cigarettes, and directly related to alcohol consumption but to have no relationship to jogging or age. Temporal analyses suggested that initiation of jogging was followed by a reduction in heart rate, but there was no significant change in other measured parameters. Coronary heart disease (CHD) prevalence was increased in joggers, perhaps because the diagnosis of CHD predisposes to this activity. We conclude that jogging has probably had little impact on the health of this cohort.
