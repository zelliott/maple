The transient receptor potential (TRP) channel superfamily is composed of 28 nonselective cation channels that are ubiquitously expressed in many cell types and have considerable functional diversity. Although changes in TRP channel expression and function have been reported in cardiovascular disease and renal disorders, the pathogenic roles of TRP channels in metabolic diseases have not been systemically reviewed. In this review, we summarised the distribution of TRP channels in several metabolic tissues and discussed their roles in mediating and regulating various physiological and pathophysiological metabolic processes and diseases including diabetes, obesity, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, metabolic bone diseases and electrolyte disturbances. This review provides new insight into the involvement of TRP channels in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders and implicates these channels as potential therapeutic targets for the management of metabolic diseases.
