Cohorts consistently show that individuals with low levels of cardiovascular risk factors experience low rates of subsequent cardiovascular events. Our objective was to examine the prevalence and trends in low risk factor burden for cardiovascular disease among adults in the US population.

We used data from adults 25 to 74 years of age who participated in 4 national surveys. We created an index of low risk from the following variables: not currently smoking, total cholesterol &<.17 mmol/L (&<00 mg/dL) and not using cholesterol-lowering medications, systolic blood pressure &<20 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure &<0 mm Hg and not using antihypertensive medications, body mass index &<5 kg/m(2), and not having been previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. The age-adjusted prevalence of low risk factor burden increased from 4.4% during 1971 to 1975 to 10.5% during 1988 to 1994 before decreasing to 7.5% during 1999 to 2004 (P for nonlinear trend &<.001). The patterns were similar for men and women, although the prevalence among women exceeded that among men in each survey (P&<.001 for each survey). In addition, whites had a significantly higher prevalence of low risk factor burden than blacks during each survey except during 1976 to 1980 (1971 to 1975, 1988 to 1994, 1999 to 2004: P&<.001; 1976 to 1980: P=0.154). Furthermore, a larger percentage of whites had a low risk factor burden than Mexican Americans during 1988 to 1994 (P&<.001) and 1999 to 2004 (P=0.001).

The prevalence of low risk factor burden for cardiovascular disease is low. The progress that had been made during the 1970s and 1980s reversed in recent decades.
