Coping with a chronic illness challenges children and adolescents in addition to their normal developmental tasks. This double challenge probably endangers the development of a stable self-esteem. The present investigation explores the possibility whether these processes are different with respect to the kind of illness. Chronic illnesses such as obesity and congenital heart defects (CHD) serve as examples in comparing two samples (8-16 years): obesity (N = 54) as visible and partly controllable illness (with respect to the course of illness) vs. congenital heart disease (N = 56) as invisible and uncontrollable illness (with respect to the origin and course of illness). Self-esteem is measured by a scale (ALS) which focuses on the public areas "school" and "leisure time" and the private area "family". Children and adolescents with CHD (especially females) display an above-average positive self-esteem in all areas. Children and adolescents with obesity mainly display an average self-esteem, the females scoring above-average for the private area "family", the males scoring below-average for the public area "leisure time". Furthermore, leisure-time related self-esteem is significantly lower for obese than for CHD subjects. These specific relations implicate differential accentuations for intervention programs.
