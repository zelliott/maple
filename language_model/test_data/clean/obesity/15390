We determined the reproducibility of plasma leptin levels in 20 healthy subjects (10 men, 10 women; 10 lean, 10 obese) at stable body weight. Blood samples were obtained, after an overnight fast, between 0700 and 0800 on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 19, and 26. Body weights were recorded on the same days. Plasma leptin was measured using a specific radioimmunoassay. The mean +/- SE baseline body weights (kg) were 65.8 +/- 3.6 (lean) and 96.4 +/- 7.1 (obese). The body mass indices (BMI) were 22.9 +/- 2.8 kg/m2 (lean) and 32.7 +/- 2.2 kg/m2 (obese). The mean daily fasting plasma glucose level was 98.7 +/- 3.7 mg/dl. Baseline plasma leptin levels (ng/ml) were 5.3 +/- 0.75 in lean men, 14.9 +/- 4.6 in obese men, 11.2 +/- 2.8 in lean women, and 27.1 +/- 8.4 in obese women. Fasting leptin levels on days 2 to 26 were highly correlated with the baseline levels on day 1 (r2 = 0.9, P&<.0001). Body weights remained within 98%-102% of baseline, whereas intra-individual leptin levels fluctuated between 80% and 120% of baseline values, throughout the 26 days of study. We conclude that fasting plasma leptin levels are reproducible, with a maximum day-to-day variation of approximately 20%, in healthy, free-living, lean and obese persons who maintain a stable body weight.
