Dyslipidemia associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome is one of the central features contributing to the increased CV risk in these patients. In view of the pandemic of the metabolic syndrome, it is imperative to fully understand the mechanisms leading to the metabolic lipid phenotype before embarking upon optimal treatment strategies. The traditional concept that insulin resistance causes increased FFA flux via increased TG hydrolysis in adipose tissue is still of a central theme in the general hypothesis. The combination of increased hepatic VLDL secretion with impaired LPL-mediated TG clearance explains the hypertriglyceridemia phenotype of the metabolic syndrome. Hence, central IR may be an important factor contributing to peripheral hypertriglyceridemia. Recently recognized regulatory systems include the profound impact of the hypothalamus on TG secretion and glucose control. In addition, dysfunctional (or inflamed) intra abdominal adipose tissue has emerged as a potent regulator of dyslipidemia and IR. It will be a challenge to design novel treatment modalities that target “dysfunctional” fat or central IR to attempt to prevent the epidemic of CV disease secondary to the metabolic syndrome.
