A 67-year-old woman with insuline-dependent diabetes mellitus and chronic alcohol abuse was admitted with impaired consciousness and fever. Physical examination showed a livid induration of the perineal and vaginal soft tissues with crepitations.

Laboratory tests showed greatly elevated infection parameters. Abdominal computed tomography revealed perineal and vaginal subcutaneous gas accumulation extending into the ventral abdominal wall.

The combination of an obscure infection and subcutaneous genital gas accumulation suggested the diagnosis of Fournier gangrene, a necrotizing fasciitis. In spite of administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and repeated surgical removal of necrotic tissue the patient died of multiple organ failure.

Successful treatment of Fournier gangrene critically depends on immediate treatment. Administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive surgical resection of the necrotic tissue may prevent continuing spreading of the infection. Computed tomography provides an early diagnosis and guides the presurgical evaluation of the subcutaneous spread.
