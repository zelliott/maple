To determine the clinical conditions associated with systemic oxidative stress in a community-based cohort. Information regarding cardiovascular risk factors associated with systemic oxidative stress has largely been derived from highly selected samples with advanced stages of vascular disease. Thus, it has been difficult to evaluate the relative contribution of each cardiovascular risk factor to systemic oxidative stress and to determine whether such risk factors act independently and are applicable to the general population.

We examined 2828 subjects from the Framingham Heart Study and measured urinary creatinine-indexed levels of 8-epi-PGF2alpha as a marker of systemic oxidative stress. Age- and sex-adjusted multivariable regression models were used to assess clinical correlates of oxidative stress. In age- and sex-adjusted models, increased urinary creatinine-indexed 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels were positively associated with female sex, hypertension treatment, smoking, diabetes, blood glucose, body mass index, and a history of cardiovascular disease. In contrast, age and total cholesterol were negatively correlated with urinary creatinine-indexed 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels. After adjustment for several covariates, decreasing age and total/HDL cholesterol ratio, sex, smoking, body mass index, blood glucose, and cardiovascular disease remained associated with urinary 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels.

Smoking, diabetes, and body mass index were highly associated with systemic oxidative stress as determined by creatinine-indexed urinary 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels. The effect of body mass index was minimally affected by blood glucose, and diabetes and may suggest an important role of oxidative stress in the deleterious impact of obesity on cardiovascular disease.
