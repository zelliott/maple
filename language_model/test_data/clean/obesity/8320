To evaluate the association between BMI: kg/m(2) and mortality among Hispanic adults.

Eight years (1997-2004) of National Health Interview Survey data linked to public-use mortality follow-up data through 2006 were acquired. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, separate models for two attained age strata (18 to &<0 years, ≥60 years) adjusting for sex, smoking, and physical activity with over 38,000 analyzable respondents were fit.

Among those aged ≥60 years, underweight (BMI ≤ 18.5) associated with elevated mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-3.46), whereas overweight (BMI of 25 to &<0) and obesity grade 1 (BMI of 30 to &<5) associated with reduced mortality (HRs = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.95 and 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.91), respectively. There were no significant associations between BMI and mortality among the 18 to &<0 years attained age strata or among never smokers for either age strata.

Overweight and obesity are not obviously associated with elevated mortality among Hispanic adults.
