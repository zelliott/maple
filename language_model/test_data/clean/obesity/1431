A sample (N = 200) of undergraduate students in physical education from 12 universities in a midwestern state was sent the 1990 Price questionnaire; 178 responded (89%). 96% of the respondents indicated that normal weight is very important in children, 88% agreed that physical education teachers should play major roles in treating childhood obesity. 92% believed their college courses prepared them to administer exercise programs to help children reduce weight, and 70% supported school-based weight-reduction strategies. Over-all, the students seemed to want to help eliminate childhood obesity and indicated they should become significantly involved in school programs designed to achieve this goal.
