Binge eating disorder (BED) is a recently conceptualized eating disturbance, and its clinical features and prevalence are still a matter of debate. This study uses interview methodology to estimate the prevalence of BED in Italy in a sample of 66 obese people presenting for treatment, and examines potential related features typical of patients with anorexia and bulimia nervosa. The lifetime and the 6-month prevalences of BED were 18.1 and 12.1%, respectively. Breaking the group down on the basis of the current as well as lifetime presence of BED, we found that the weight and shape primary to self-esteem, and the interpersonal distress related to body image, were associated with lifetime BED (P&<.05). All-or-none thinking about food and dieting was typical of BED patients as a whole, either current (P&<.01) or remitted (P&<.05). We discuss two important findings from our study: (a) the key role of self-esteem depending upon weight and shape in discriminating the eating-disordered obese from non-eating-disordered individuals; and (b) the need to explore the whole lifespan when screening for BED, so pointing to the state-trait issue.
