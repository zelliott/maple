The present paper tries to answer the question, how far the degree of adipositas during adult age can be affected by influences from early childhood. Our special interest concerned the relation between the number of fat cells and adipositas. To answer this question we had to clarify some methodical problems. The difficulty was to find out in a statistical way the part of fat tissue in total body weight. Therefore we introduced the idea of variability of tissues supposing that the different tissues can be influenced in a different way by environmental factors. Bone tissue turned out to be the most steady in contrary to fat tissue as the most unstable one. We stated the hypothesis that the differences between two groupes of equal sized individuals are based upon differences of fat tissue. Our material have been the age classes born in 1938 till 1951. Their environmental conditions during infancy and the age of 19 have been investigated. The result was that the conditions of life of 19-year-old men can be regarded as similar, whereas those of infants showed significant differences. The age classes 1945-1948 proved to be nourished more badly than the years before (1938-1944) and after (1949-1951). With these results corresponds stature, whereas no similar effects could be revealed in body weight. The conclusion of our paper is that regarding to adipositas no connection between infancy and adult age could be proved.
