We conducted a survey of 356 married couples and their 552 children living in Hisayama in Fukuoka prefecture in order to investigate the correlation between changes in obesity from adolescence to young adulthood. 1. A positive correlation between couples in weight and height could be found, but its coefficient was weak (r = 0.12, 0.10). There was no correlation between couples in BMI. 2. The correlation between parents and their children in height, weight and BMI was significantly positive (r = 0.18, 0.45), having a coefficient greater than that of the correlation between married couples. 3. The correlation coefficient between mother and child was greater than that of the correlation coefficient between father and child. 4. The BMI of a child with either parent obese was significantly greater than that of a child with neither parent obese. Obesity appeared more frequently in children whose BMI of parent was higher. 5. A positive correlation between the BMI of young adults and that of adolescents could be found, and the average BMI of the obesity group was higher than that of the non-obesity group even in the adolescent subjects. 6. Even after considering BMI during adolescence, the familial factor had a significant relationship to the BMI of young adulthood. These results suggest that obesity in adolescence will influence obesity in young adulthood, and that the appearance of obesity strongly correlates with the familial obesity factor. In conclusion, it is very important to take preventative measures, in cooperation with the family, early in a child's adolescent years in order to avoid obesity in adulthood.
