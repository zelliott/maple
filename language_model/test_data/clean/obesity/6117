This study examined whether improvements in problem-solving abilities mediate the relation between treatment adherence and weight-loss outcome in the behavioral treatment of obesity.

272 women (mean+/-SD age=59.4+/-6.2 years, BMI=36.5+/-4.8) participated in a 6-month lifestyle intervention for obesity. Body weight and problem-solving skills (as measured by the Social Problem Solving Inventory-Revised) were assessed pre- and posttreatment. The completion of self-monitoring logs during the intervention served as the marker of treatment adherence.

At posttreatment, participants lost 8.4+/-5.8 kg, an 8.8% reduction in body weight. Changes in weight were associated with increased problem-solving skills and with higher levels of treatment adherence. Improvements in problem-solving skills partially mediated the relation between treatment adherence and weight-loss outcome. Moreover, participants with weight reductions&> or = 10% demonstrated significantly greater improvements in problem-solving skills than those with reductions &<%.

Improvements in problem-solving skills may enable participants to overcome barriers to adherence and thereby enhance treatment-induced weight losses.
