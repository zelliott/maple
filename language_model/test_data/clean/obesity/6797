To examine the relationship I/D polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene and polymorphism A1166S of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT2R1) gene with the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the residents of Kharkiv region. The study involved 318 patients with CAD, of whom 54 (17,0%) patients with CHD and AF were included in group I, 264 (93,0%) patients without AF - in group II. The control group included 35 people without atherosclerotic and morphological changes of spacecraft. Study of ACE gene I/D polymorphism and A1166S polymorphism of AT2R1 gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with electrophoretic pattern of result detection. Established that the AF development in patients with CAD, residents of Kharkiv region was associated with carriage of C allele of AT2R1 gene A1166S polymorphism and the presence of DD genotype of the ACE gene I / D polymorphism. Proved that the risk of AF development in patients with coronary heart disease independently associated with the presence of C allele of AT2R1 gene A1166S polymorphism, hypertension, type II diabetes and obesity.
