Skeletal muscles from mice stimulated with insulin in vivo were used to evaluate relationships between the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, p90rsk, p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k), and glycogen synthase. Two models of insulin resistance were also evaluated: (a) transgenic mice with a severe insulin receptor defect and (b) gold thioglucose (GTG) mice (obesity with minimal insulin receptor dysfunction). In normal mice, insulin stimulated MAP kinase (6-fold), p90rsk (RSK2, 5-fold), p70S6k (10-fold), and glycogen synthase (30-50% increase in fractional velocity). In transgenic mice, stimulation of MAP kinase and RSK2 were not detectable, whereas activation of p70S6k and glycogen synthase were preserved. In GTG mice, activation of MAP kinase, RSK2, p70S6k, and glycogen synthase were impaired. Since p70S6k and glycogen synthase were correlated, rapamycin was used to block p70S6k, and glycogen synthase activation was unaffected in normal mice; however, it was partially impaired in transgenic mice.

(a) stimulation of p70S6k and glycogen synthase are selectively preserved in muscles with a severe insulin receptor kinase defect, indicating signal amplification in pathways leading to these effects; (b) MAP kinase-RSK2 and p70S6k activation are impaired in obese mice, suggesting multiple loci for postreceptor insulin resistance; (c) glycogen synthase was dissociated from MAP kinase and RSK2, indicating that they are not required for this effect of insulin; and (d) p70S6k is not essential for glycogen synthase activation, but it may participate in redundant signaling pathways leading to this effect of insulin.
