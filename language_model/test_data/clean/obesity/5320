Some 20-25% of UK adults are obese according to the WHO criterion (BMI&>/=30 kg/m(2)). Type 2 diabetes, increasingly recognized as a major complication of overweight and obesity, is beginning to appear in UK adolescents, following the trends in the US. Epidemiological data indicate that the prevalence of overweight and obesity has doubled or tripled in the past few decades in the US, in Europe, and even in many developing countries. Thus obesity is increasingly seen as a public health problem requiring concerted action by both governmental and non-governmental organizations. A sound understanding of the root causes is crucial, if strategies for the prevention and treatment of this epidemic are to be developed. Many epidemiological studies suggest that physical activity at work, school or at leisure has declined to minimal levels, and that sedentary behaviours such as television viewing and computer games have become major pastimes. Thus energy requirements are substantially less than those for recent generations. Further, the food industry produces high-calorie foods which children and adults consume as snack meals, giving a substantial surfeit to their daily energy requirement. In children, a few school-based, preventive intervention trials have shown some promising results. Many negative trials have also been reported, and practical difficulties remain in the widespread implementation of appropriate protocols. Initiatives have been introduced by the government to increase the physical education syllabus in school to a minimum of 2 h/week, and the promotion of fruit and vegetables. Further research is required on the physiological and psychological causes of overweight and obesity in children and adults, and randomized, controlled, school and community-based trials are required to pilot preventative initiatives. Monitoring of the progress in prevention at both organizational and outcome level is required, and also of adverse outcomes such as a rise in the prevalence of eating disorders.
