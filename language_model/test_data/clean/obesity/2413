Defects in both insulin secretion and action have been documented in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), leading to the suggestion that both fasting hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in NIDDM are secondary to insulin deficiency. In order to test this hypothesis, insulin secretion (plasma insulin response to oral glucose) and insulin action (insulin clamp) were determined in 25 patients with NIDDM. The results documented relationships between incremental plasma insulin response to glucose and degree of fasting hyperglycemia (r = -.045, P less than 0.05) and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization (r = 0.25, P = NS). These data indicate that differences in insulin secretory response accounted for only approximately 20% of the variance in fasting plasma glucose level and 6% of the variance in insulin resistance in NIDDM. Thus, differences in insulin-secretory response contribute modestly to magnitude of glycemia, and not at all to variations in insulin resistance in NIDDM, permitting rejection of the hypothesis that insulin resistance is secondary to insulin deficiency.
