Plasma leptin has been suggested to be involved in the proatherogenic process by increasing oxidative stress. We investigated the relationship between leptin and plasma conjugated diene formation, a measure of LDL oxidation in vivo in schoolchildren.

We measured blood lipid profiles, plasma antioxidant vitamins, leptin and diene conjugation in LDL of 118 Korean children (35 overweight-obese vs. 83 normal weight children).

The overweight-obese children showed significantly higher levels of leptin (p &<0.0001), conjugated dienes (p = 0.02), total cholesterol (p &<0.05), triglyceride (p &<0.005) and LDL cholesterol (p &<0.01) and a significantly lower level of plasma lycopene (p &<0.0001) compared with the normal weight children. When all the subjects were classified into the three groups by tertiles of leptin levels, significant differences in circulating conjugated dienes (p &<0.05), lipid-corrected lycopene (p &<0.05), total cholesterol (p &<0.05), triglyceride (p &<0.05) and LDL cholesterol (p &<0.05) were found among the three groups.

Our results showed that leptin was positively associated with the LDL conjugated diene formation, which might be related to the proatherogenic process in schoolchildren.
