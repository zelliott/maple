The major aim of the work was to assess the awareness of risk factors and atherosclerosis prevention among the inhabitants of the Lublin region. The anonymous and voluntary questionnaire survey was carried out in winter 2007 (January - February) among 152 inhabitants of Lublin and surroundings. The anonymous questionnaire method was applied to assess the usual way of nutrition and the knowledge of atherosclerosis prevention rules. The questionnaire concerned among others: nutrition regularity, consumption frequency, preference levels of different kinds of food products, the knowledge of atherosclerosis prevention rules and the health condition of the respondents as well. The anthropometric data was also analysed and the BMI was measured. This survey shows that despite the declared knowledge of cardiovascular disease prevention rules the majority of the respondents did not apply them, which can be exemplified by the BMI percentage and screening frequency. Also the way of nutrition of the analysed population is inadequate due to numerous inconsistences with current nutritional rules.
