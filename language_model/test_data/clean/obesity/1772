To evaluate the influence of breast-feeding on the body mass index (BMI) growth trajectory from birth through 13 years of age among offspring of diabetic pregnancies (ODP) and offspring of non-diabetic pregnancies (ONDP) participating in the Exploring Perinatal Outcomes Among Children Study.

There were 94 ODP and 399 ONDP who had multiple BMI measures obtained from birth throughout childhood. A measure of breast milk-months was derived from maternal self-report to categorize breast-feeding status as adequate (â‰¥6 breast milk-months) or low (&< breast milk-months). Mixed linear-effects models were constructed to assess the impact of breast-feeding on the BMI growth curves during infancy (birth to 27 months) and childhood (27 months to 13 years).

ODP who were adequately breast-fed had a slower BMI growth trajectory during childhood (P=0.047) and slower period-specific growth velocity with significant differences between 4 and 6 years of age (P=0.03) and 6 to 9 years of age (P=0.01) compared with ODP with low breast-feeding. A similar pattern was seen in the ONDP, with adequate breast-feeding associated with lower average BMI in infancy (P=0.03) and childhood (P=0.0002) and a slower growth trajectory in childhood (P=0.0002). Slower period-specific growth velocity was seen among the ONDP associated with adequate breast-feeding with significant differences between 12-26 months (P=0.02), 4-6 years (P=0.03), 6-9 years (P=0.0001) and 9-13 years of age (P&<.0001).

Our study provides novel evidence that breast-feeding is associated with long-term effects on childhood BMI growth that extend beyond infancy into early and late childhood. Importantly, these effects are also present in the high-risk offspring, exposed to overnutrition during pregnancy. Breast-feeding in the early postnatal period may represent a critical opportunity to reduce the risk of childhood obesity.
