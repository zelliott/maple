It is the position of the American Dietetic Association (ADA) and Dietitians of Canada (DC) that women have specific nutritional needs and vulnerabilities and, as such, are at unique risk for various nutrition-related diseases and conditions that affect the duration and quality of their lives. Although women's health-related issues are multifaceted, nutrition has been shown to influence significantly the risk of chronic disease and assist in maintaining optimal health status. Therefore, the ADA and DC encourage dietetics professionals to strongly support research, health promotion activities, health care services, and advocacy efforts that will enable women to adopt desirable nutrition practices for optimal health.
