A favorable effect over development of degenerative diseases is derived of an adecuate intake of fruit and vegetables, mainly due to their antioxidant compounds

The goal of this study was to test the effect in vivo over oxidant status and inflammation in obese children of a novel food product made of dried apples enriched with mandarin juice by vacuum impregnation.

A four-week intervention study was conducted in 41 obese children &> 2 standard deviation score-body mass index). Participants were instructed to follow their usual diet supplemented with 40 g/day of the developed product. Anthropometric parameters were determined including body mass index, waist circumference and estimations of body fat percentage using bioelectrical impedance. Dietary intake was assessed by questionnaire. Metabolic risk factors (blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose and insulin resistance) were recorded. To determine oxidant status, plasma total antioxidant capacity and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, as marker of oxidative damage to DNA, were investigated. High-sensitive C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukins 6 and 1-α were measured as inflammatory markers. Measurements were collected at baseline and at the end of the intervention period.

Significant improvement in systolic blood pressure and lipid profile after intervention period was noted. A significant increase in the antioxidant capacity of plasma (ABTS and FRAP assays) and reductions in DNA oxidative damage and inflammatory markers were also found.

Overall, adding the product to the diet contributes to ameliorate oxidant and inflammatory status in obese children and several risk factors for atherosclerosis.
