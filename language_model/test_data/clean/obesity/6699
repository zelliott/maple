A link between obesity and coronary artery disease development has been repeatedly proposed, possibly in part due to the development of a proinflammatory and prothrombotic state in obese subjects. Adipocytes secrete numerous hormones and cytokines (adipokines) which influence gene expression and cell functions in endothelial cells, arterial smooth muscle cells, and monocytes/macrophages favouring the development of an atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque. Moreover, the release of such biologically active molecules also promotes endothelial function impairment, disturbs the haemostatic and fibrinolytic systems, and produces alterations in platelet function affecting the initiation, progression, and stabilization of thrombus formation upon atherosclerotic plaque rupture. In this review we will discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms by which obesity contributes to increase atherothrombosis paying special attention to its effects over thrombosis.
