The purpose of this study was to evaluate prolactin secretion in obesity. Basal level of serum prolactin and prolactin response after thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were investigated in 20 obese patients and 20 healthy subjects well matched for age and sex. Obese patients had higher basal levels of serum prolactin than those of healthy subjects. Conversely, no significant difference in serum prolactin concentration was found at any time during TRH stimulating test. However obese patients showed incremental areas of serum prolactin slightly, but not significantly, lower compared to healthy subjects, probably because their basal levels were higher. In conclusion, the present study confirms that prolactin secretion is altered in obese patients. The discrepancy between basal levels and prolactin response during TRH stimulating test seems to indicate a deficiency in the dopaminergic inhibitor system.
