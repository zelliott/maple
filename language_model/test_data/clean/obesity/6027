The Spontaneously Diabetic Torii (SDT) rat is a new model for non-obese type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we investigated changes in insulin secretion from the pancreas of male SDT rats aged 8, 16, and 24 weeks in order to analyze pancreatic function. An analysis of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in isolated islets showed a marked reduction in insulin secretion in pre-diabetic 16-week-old SDT rats. When the islets were treated with tolbutamide or glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (tGLP-1) in the presence of 11.2 mM glucose, however, insulin levels were restored to levels of normal rats. In vivo study, SDT rats exhibited a marked reduction in GSIS from 16 weeks of age. However, tolbutamide or JTP-76209, which is a novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) inhibitor, increased insulin release after glucose loading and improved glucose tolerance. A marked reduction in GSIS was observed in pre-diabetic SDT rats and the reduction was improved by tolbutamide, tGLP-1, and the DPP IV inhibitor. Therefore, we concluded that the SDT rat is useful, as a model of non-obese insulin secretory disorder, for the analysis of the onset of type 2 diabetes and the development of antidiabetic agents.
