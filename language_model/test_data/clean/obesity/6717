This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the relationship between weight status and gingival inflammation in Brazilian schoolchildren aged 8- to 12-year old, when controlling for potential confounders.

Overall, 1211 children aged 8- to 12-year old from public and private schools in Southern Brazil were selected by a two-stage cluster method. Questionnaires were used to assess socio-demographic data and oral hygiene habits. Oral examination evaluated presence of plaque and gingival bleeding. Anthropometric measures were collected to obtain body mass index. Multivariate Poisson regression was used for data analysis (Prevalence Ratio/95% Confidence Interval).

Prevalence of gingivitis was 44.0%. Mean and median values of gingival bleeding sites were 3.10 and 2.0 respectively. Obese/overweight children totalized 34.6%. In multivariate adjusted analysis, sex (PR 0.86; 95%CI 0.75;0.98), maternal schooling (PR 1.09; 95% CI 1.01;1.18), plaque (PR 1.37; 95% CI 1.26;1.50), dental caries experience (PR 1.16; 95% CI 1.01;1.36) and bleeding during tooth brushing (PR 1.27; 95% CI 1.11;1.48) were associated with the outcome. In the sex-stratified analysis, overweight/obese boys presented a greater risk for gingivitis (PR 1.22 95% CI 1.01;1.48).

Gingivitis was not associated with obesity/overweight in the total sample. Gender differences seem to influence the relationship between gingivitis and obesity/overweight; a stronger association was noted among boys than girls.
