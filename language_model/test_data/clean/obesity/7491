The high risk strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) requires an assessment of an individual's total CVD risk so that the most intensive risk factor management can be directed towards those at highest risk. Here we review developments in the assessment and estimation of total CVD risk.

Recent advances have focused on newer approaches to expressing risk, including lifetime risk and risk age; these are particularly useful in communicating risk to younger individuals. Additionally, increased emphasis has been placed on the role of body weight and abdominal obesity in CVD risk. Several recent large studies have clarified a number of issues relevant to the management of CVD risk, a matter of growing global concern.

Simple risk estimation systems utilizing only easily measured variables have a role in improving the accessibility and cost effectiveness of risk estimation. The addition of newer variables to risk estimation systems may be particularly useful for those at intermediate risk, in order to more correctly reclassify such individuals into appropriate risk categories.
