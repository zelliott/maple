Participants were current Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program participants in 3 Texas cities (Austin, Houston, San Antonio). Data were used to tailor the curriculum to the target population. This research provides evidence that members of the target audience can provide valuable insights into a particular topic. Formative work prior to intervention development should be conducted to identify key issues regarding a particular topic and to evaluate potential educational approaches.
