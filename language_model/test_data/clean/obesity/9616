In this study of the long-term psychosocial consequences of jejuno-ileal bypass, 24 patients were assessed with psychiatric interviews and psychological tests 4-12 years after the procedure. Twenty patients had had a good overall response to the surgery, and 4 had had a poor response. Most complications, physical and psychiatric, occurred during the first 3 years. Most patients with a good postoperative result maintained it for many years, gained occupationally and vocationally, were pleased with the results of the operation, and were willing to recommend it to others. Even those who had experienced complications tended to underrate their seriousness and to express satisfaction.
