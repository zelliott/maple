Increasing living kidney donation mandates ongoing assessment of living donors for future health risks and revision of national health policy.

Living kidney donors as reported to the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network database from January 1988 through December 2008 were reviewed for minor medical abnormalities, presence of donor health care coverage, and occurrence of surgical complications and death.

At donation in 2008, 19.5% were obese, 2.0% had a history of hypertension, and 3.5% had proteinuria. The median estimated GFR of living donors was 92.2 ml/min. Additionally, 12.2% of donors were reported not to have health insurance at the time of donation. By racial background, 14.9% of black and 17.0% of Hispanic donors did not have insurance at donation. Perioperative complications included blood transfusion (0.4%), reoperation (0.5%), and vascular complications (0.2%). Death occurred within 30 days of donation in 0.03% donating between October 1999 and December 2008. During those same years, overall donor death was 2.8%.

Almost one quarter of living donors have medical conditions that may be associated with future health risk. Close follow-up and a registry of these donors are necessary. Only then will we be able to inform prospective living donors most accurately of the real risk of donation on their health and survival. Additionally, these data speak to the need for a national discussion on the provision of health insurance for living donors.
