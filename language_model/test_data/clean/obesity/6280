The present study assessed the effects of child body weight (obese/lean) and familial loading for obesity (two obese parents/two lean parents) on the psychophysics of sweetness, fatness and exercise workloads, as well as subjective ratings of foods varying in sugar and fat and activities varying in energy expenditure. Children were measured in a baseline state and at 6 months after the obese children had participated in a family-based behavioral weight control program. No differences between obese and lean children in perceptual ratings were observed. However, offspring of obese or lean parents differed on intensity rating, food palatability and activity enjoyment ratings. Intensity ratings for sweetness in offspring of obese parents was increased, with a similar trend for intensity ratings for fatness. Offspring of obese parents rated all foods and activities with lower palatability and enjoyment ratings than offspring of lean parents. After a 6 month family-based behavioral weight loss treatment, obese children had significant decreases in percent overweight while lean children remained stable. Changes in the pattern of food ratings were observed for the obese children, with a reduction in liking for foods high in fat and/or sugar, and an increase in ratings for food slower in fat and sugar. The effects of parental obesity on food and exercise intensity ratings and hedonic ratings were maintained. Overall, these results suggest parental weight influences behavioral factors related to obesity in children.
