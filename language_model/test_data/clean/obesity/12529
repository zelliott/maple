Obesity and its comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, are associated with a state of chronic low-grade inflammation that can be detected both systemically and within specific tissues. Areas of active investigation focus on the molecular bases of metabolic inflammation and potential pathogenic roles in insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. An increased accumulation of macrophages occurring in obese adipose tissue has emerged as a key process in metabolic inflammation. Recent studies have also begun to unravel the heterogeneity of adipose tissue macrophages, and their physical and functional interactions with adipocytes, endothelial cells, and other immune cells within the adipose tissue microenvironment. Translating the information gathered from experimental models of insulin resistance and diabetes into meaningful therapeutic interventions is a tantalizing goal with long-term global health implications. In this context, ongoing clinical studies are testing the effects of targeting inflammation systemically on metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes.
