To describe the prevalence of obesity and the body fat distribution of New Zealanders. To discuss this in the context of the coronary heart disease risk.

Body weight and height, body mass index (BMI), waist:hip ratio (WHR) and six skinfold measurements were determined for 3204 randomly selected New Zealanders who responded to an invitation to a health check (response rate 56%).

In the study sample BMI generally increased with age. Fifty five percent of men and 38 per cent of women aged 18-64 had a BMI exceeding 25, and of these 13 per cent and 10 per cent were obese (BMI&> 30). WHR was greater in men than in women of all ages, and a third of the men and a quarter of the women had values exceeding 0.9 and 0.8 respectively. Central skinfold measurements (subscapular, suprailiac and abdominal) were lowest in young men, but rose markedly with age and were similar to women above age 35. Limb skinfolds were lower in men.

This survey indicates that a large percentage of New Zealanders are overweight or obese and their excess body fat tends to be centrally distributed, especially in men. Obesity is thus a significant health problem in New Zealand.
