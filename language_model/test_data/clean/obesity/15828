Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid. In animals, CLA consumption reduces body fat but results in humans are less conclusive. This review of the literature on CLA and loss of body fat or body weight in humans was conducted to explore the reasons for the discrepancy between animal and clinical trials. It indicates that the incongruity between human and animal data is largely related to methodological differences in the experimental design, including age and gender and, to a lesser extent, to CLA dose and isomers. The relatively unknown metabolic fate of CLA in humans may also be a contributing factor that helps explain the lack of consistency for CLA efficacy across studies.
