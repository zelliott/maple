Obesity, defined as a body mass index&> 30 kg/m2 is relatively common in Europe, particularly among women, and especially in Southern and Eastern European countries. Among men the distribution of body mass index values is surprisingly similar in most countries of Europe. Educational level is strongly inversely associated with the prevalence of obesity. Although differences in body mass index cannot entirely explain the large variation in risk factors and mortality from coronary heart disease, it can be shown that within populations an increased body mass index is associated with less favorable risk patterns. More research is needed to elucidate the reasons for the large variation in the prevalence of obesity among European women and to the health risks associated with obesity in different European countries.
