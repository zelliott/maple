Fat patterning was studied in a sample of 76 obese women before and after weight reduction by principal components analysis. Circumferences were selected as variables rather than skinfolds because circumferences correlated more highly with body composition determined either by total body water or total body potassium. A separate sample of 136 males and females, measured once, was employed to validate the results. The validation sample yielded similar findings. Two significant components were found, the first contrasting upper and lower fatness and the second trunk and extremity fatness. Waist circumference was the best predictor of upper-body fat patterning. For the lower body, thigh circumference loaded more highly than did the iliac crest circumference. Arm circumference did not contribute significantly to upper-lower fat patterning.
