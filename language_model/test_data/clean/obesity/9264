To measure the vascularization and ovarian volume with three-dimensional sonography in patients diagnosed of polycystic ovary syndrome with stimulated ovulation treatment, and to analyse the differences between the patients treated with clomiphen citrate versus clomiphen citrate and metformin.

Therty patients were studied. Twenty ovulation cycles were obtained with clomiphen citrate and 17 with clomiphen citrate plus merformin (added in case of obesity or hyperglucemy/hyperinsulinemia). Ovarian volumes and vascular indexes were studied with 3D-sonography and results were analysed by treatment.

There were no statistical differences of ovarian volume by treatment along the cycles, although bigger volume were found in ovulatory cycles compared to non-ovulatory ones (20,36 versus 13,89 ml, p = 0,026). No statistical differences were also found concerning vascular indexes, neither by treatment nor by the obtention of ovulation in the cycle.

Ovarian volume and vascular indexes measured with three-dimensional sonography in patients diagnosed of polycystic ovary syndrome do not show differents values in patients treated with clomiphen citrate alone versus clomiphen citrate plus metformin.
