Nutrient consumption data were obtained from 211 members of 41 families living in the coastal town of Busselton, Western Australia. It was found that food consumption patterns were similar in boys and girls up to the age of 11 years. After that, as expected, males consumed more food than females. There was a general tendency for daily kilojoule intakes to be considerably less than the Australian Dietary Allowances for all age groups with the exception of males aged from 35 to 55 years. There was a significant prevalence of obesity in the subjects who were studied, particularly in the older groups of both sexes. The results suggest that, in the older adult groups, failure to make concessions to decreased levels of physical activity by modifying appetite and customary eating practices is a major factor which contributes to obesity.
