The purpose of this study was to describe the effects of a community-based, multidisciplinary team-led, lifestyle modification program on short-term weight loss in a morbidly obese (mean BMI 40.8 kg/m2), predominantly Native Hawaiian population.

Descriptive study comparing weight loss over time in intervention and control groups. Of 217 eligible participants in the intervention group, 58% were Native Hawaiian.

Participants in the intervention group experienced a modest yet significant weight loss, while the control group gained weight. The mean 12-month weight loss in the intervention group was 4.1 pounds (1.9 kg). High program attrition rates hindered program effectiveness and data collection.

Although the weight loss in the study group was moderate, it was significant over the control group whose members actually had an increase in average weight over the study period. Further research into pre-treatment correlates of attrition in this population is needed in order to eliminate health disparities among Native Hawaiians.
