Both types of diabetes mellitus are conditions with high cardiovascular risk.

This work was aimed to study the frequency of cardiovascular risk factors, macrovascular and microvascular complications and to assess the results of continuous diabetes care in an adult population with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Method of the study was a questionnaire survey, altogether 400 patients, 49 with type 1 and 351 with type 2 diabetes, were enrolled to it.

Frequency of cardiovascular complications, obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia was higher in type 2 diabetes, smoking and microvascular complications were more frequent in type 1 diabetes. The ratio of conservative intensive and conventional insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes was 70% and 30%, respectively. Treatment methods used in type 2 diabetes were: diet only: 8%, oral antidiabetic therapy: 78%, antidiabetic agent and insulin: 7%, insulin therapy 7%. Ratios of the patients having at least three laboratory results were: fasting blood glucose: 50%, postprandial blood glucose: 30%, haemoglobin A(1C): 10%. Ratios of patients reached the target results were in type 1 and type 2 diabetes were: fasting blood glucose: 27% vs. 14%, postprandial blood glucose: 26% vs. 18%, haemoglobin-A: 29% vs. 34%. Ratios of the patients in micro- and macrovascular risk category were: fasting blood glucose: 59% vs. 68%, postprandial blood glucose: 54% and 53%, haemoglobin-A(1C): 40% vs. 27%.

Frequency of investigations to estimate glycemic control as well as ratio of patients reached target values were rather low, ratio of patients in micro- and macrovascular risk category was high. For these reasons there is a need for a more intensive continuous diabetes care to reach better results.
