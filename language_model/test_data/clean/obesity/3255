The number of people with diabetes grows worldwide. The complications resulting from this disease are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. World Health Organization estimates that, while in the year 2000 the number of people with diabetes was about 177 million, by 2025, this will increase to at least 300 million. The diabetes epidemic, without primary prevention, will continue to grow. Individuals with type 2 diabetes are at a significantly higher risk for coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke, and they have a greater probability of having hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. A number of clinical trials provide evidences that RAAS inhibition could be helpful at preventing new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pharmacologic treatment that antagonize the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) provide more benefits, not only in patients after myocardial infarction and in congestive heart failure, but also in persons with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
