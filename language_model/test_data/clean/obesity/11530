The aim of this study was to examine how major components of the insulin resistance (IR) syndrome relate to each other and to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in postmenopausal women in 4 ethnic groups. Baseline data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) on 3,083 50- to 79-year-old women (1,635 white, 802 black, 390 Hispanic, and 256 Asian/Pacific Islander) were examined. Participants underwent a personal interview and a physical examination, blood samples were drawn, and a detailed cardiovascular history was ascertained. Factor analysis was used to assess the clustering and interdependence of groups of CVD-related IR syndrome variables. Four factors were identified. An obesity factor included IR in all groups and had a significant association with CVD in white (P =.0001) and Hispanic (P =.0024) women. A dyslipidemia factor (high-density lipoprotein [HDL], triglycerides, and HDL2: total HDL ratio) also included insulin and IR and was significantly correlated with CVD in black (P=.0006) and Hispanic (P =.0217) women and had a borderline association in white women (P =.068). Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol did not relate to CVD in any group. Blood pressure was related weakly to CVD in white women (P =.0434) and strongly in black women (P =.0095). Components of the IR syndrome appear to be associated with CVD in postmenopausal women, although the magnitude of these relationships differed by ethnicity.
