Chronic heart failure imposes a significant health burden and remains a substantial and increasing problem despite advances in therapy. Hence, prevention of heart failure is a priority.

Various risk factors have been identified that contribute to the development of heart failure. In this review, we will discuss the various recently reported clinical trials, epidemiological studies, meta-analyses, and subanalyses that have identified these risk factors and have provided evidence regarding the strategies to prevent heart failure.

Heart failure is a costly, disabling, and potentially fatal disease. It is therefore important to incorporate the strategies for prevention of heart failure on the basis of the current available evidence into routine clinical practice.
