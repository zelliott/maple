This paper summarizes research examining the effects of walking on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and treatment of CVD risk factors in women. Epidemiological evidence indicates that walking reduces a woman's risk for developing CVD. Walking may lower CVD risk by having beneficial effects on risk factors associated with CVD development. Obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes can all be positively affected by increased physical activity or, more specifically, increased daily walking in women. With a large number of people living a sedentary lifestyle, it is important to focus on the effects of physical activity options that are both physiologically beneficial and personally appealing and available to the majority of individuals. With studies showing positive results using pedometer- monitored walking to decrease CVD risk, accumulated daily walking as opposed to structured walking activity should also be considered as a viable option in women.
