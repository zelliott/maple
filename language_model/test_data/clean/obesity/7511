Our objective was to draw growth curves and assess obesity prevalence in adolescents of public schools, and to explore selected food consumption frequency and physical activity.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in Lebanese public schools. From the list of schools provided by the Ministry of Education, a random sample of 20 schools was chosen, distributed in all Lebanese regions. Participants were 2547 adolescents, aged between 11 to 18 years. Anthropometric measures of height and weight were taken, growth curves were drawn. Obesity and at risk of obesity prevalences were also calculated. Selected food intake frequency, physical activity and sedentary behavior were also analyzed.

Growth curves were drawn for boys and girls. Overall, 6.6% of adolescents were obese, while 20.5% were at risk of obesity. There were significant differences in obesity prevalence estimates between age groups in girls : increased age was associated with higher obesity (3.8% in those &<or =13 years of age versus 10.6%in those&> 17 y ; p = 0.02) ; this trend was not found in boys (6.5% in those &<or = 13 y and 7.2% in those&> 17 y; p = 0.78). As expected, a significant increase in the risk of being overweight was found with increased frequency of eating fried potatoes, chocolate and eating out. In contrast, eating fruits and having physical activity were associated with a lower risk of being overweight.

In Lebanese public schools, we found high rates of obesity and associated behaviors. Preventing obesity should focus on promoting healthy lifestyles for adolescents of low socioeconomic status.
