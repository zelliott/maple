Differences in the composition of the blood (plasma) and urine of cows were evaluated in groups (n = 8) with a normal time of dry standing (50-60 days) and in cows standing dry for 80 to 124 days. Two approaches were used: repeated examination of the same animals two to three weeks before parturition and six to eight weeks after parturition, and single examination of the cows being in the same stage of reproduction cycle. A number of changes were recorded, testifying to a reduction of the function of the adrenal glands and to a decrease in the activity of the liver in the cows left to stand dry for a longer time. The calves of these cows had changes in their blood (plasma), indicating a hypofunction of the adrenal glands and a reduced phagocytic activity of the leucocytes, one of the parameters of the immunity system.
