A young obese female with acute pancreatitis complicated by pseudocyst formation and intermittent gastric outlet obstruction, who had been maintained on high-calorie enteral feeds, developed a sudden onset of confusion and ophthalmoplegia associated with papilloedema and retinal haemorrhages. A possible diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) was made, and the patient was treated with parenteral thiamine. Clinical resolution was complete. Any patient with suspicious or unusual neurological symptoms and signs associated with possible malnutrition, hyperemesis or malabsorption should be given intravenous thiamine without delay to avoid the potential morbidity and mortality associated with undiagnosed WE.
