The Department of Health is promoting the generation of specialist networks to manage long term ventilatory weaning and domiciliary non-invasive ventilation patients. Currently the availability of these services in England is not known. We performed a short survey to establish the prevalence of sleep and ventilation diagnostic and treatment services. The survey focussed on diagnostic services and Home Mechanical Ventilation (HMV) provision, and was divided into (a) availability of diagnostics, (b) funding, and (c) patient groups. This survey has confirmed that the majority of Home Mechanical Ventilation set-ups are currently for Obesity Related Respiratory Failure and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. We have found that there is variable provision of diagnostic services, with the majority of units offering overnight oximetry (95%) but only 55% of responders providing a home mechanical ventilation service. Even more interestingly, less than two thirds of units charged their primary care trust for this service. These data may assist in the development of regional networks and specialist home mechanical ventilation centres.
