Hypothalamic obesity syndrome can affect brain tumor patients following surgical intervention and irradiation. This syndrome is rare at diagnosis in childhood cancer, but has been reported with relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we present a case of hypothalamic obesity syndrome as the primary presentation of a toddler found to have CNS+ B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Cytogenetic studies on diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid revealed MLL gene rearrangement (11q23). Hyperphagia and obesity dramatically improved following induction and consolidation chemotherapy. We describe a novel presentation of hypothalamic obesity syndrome in CNS B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, responsive to chemotherapy.
