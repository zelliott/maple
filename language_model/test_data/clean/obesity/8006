The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity. The defining components of the metabolic syndrome, according to the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III), are elevated waist circumference, elevated triglycerides, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and elevated fasting glucose. The pathophysiologic basis of metabolic syndrome is complex and reflects several interrelated disturbances of glucose and lipid homeostasis. Metabolic syndrome is prevalent in the United States and developed nations, and patients with this disorder are at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, underscoring the need for prompt patient identification and management. The first-line approach to control of metabolic syndrome is weight control and exercise. A wide range of pharmacologic interventions (eg, statins, antihypertensive drugs, insulin sensitizers, and thiazolidinediones) have been shown to be effective in controlling the individual components of metabolic syndrome. Obesity, which is a necessary component of metabolic syndrome, has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Although lifestyle management or medications can control the underlying risk factors and most of the components of metabolic syndrome, long-term weight loss is difficult to achieve. Several promising pharmacologic interventions that may have an important role in the management of metabolic syndrome by treating adipose tissue-mediated metabolic disturbances are in the early stages of development.
