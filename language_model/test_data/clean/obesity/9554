Obesity, as malnutrition, is associated with an increased tendency to morbidity and mortality. Its prevalence has been reported to be increasing. Studies carried out in developed countries have shown obesity to be directly correlated with low socioeconomic level. The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of obesity among 300 children aged 84 to 143 months who were attending three schools of different socioeconomic levels in the town of Ribeirão Preto, State of São Paulo, Brazil. Weight, height, arm circumference and tricepital skinfold were measured. The prevalence of obesity in the sample was 16.7 per cent, distributed as follows: 38 per cent for high socioeconomic level, 12 per cent for middle socioeconomic level, and 4 per cent for low socioeconomic level. The prevalence of malnutrition was 8.3 per cent. The overall frequency of obesity reported here is as high as that found in developed countries, but, in contrast, obesity was directly correlated with socioeconomic level.
