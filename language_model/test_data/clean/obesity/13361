Forty-nine hypertensive patients who were overweight were randomly allocated to one of three strategies for attaining weight reduction and were followed for one year. Those referred to a dietitian lost more weight (mean 5.1 kg) than those given a diet sheet (mean 2.64 kg) or simply advised by the doctor to reduce weight (mean 2.15 kg). One-third of all the patients lost 6 kg or more. Successful weight loss was associated with a highly significant and substantial improvement in blood pressure control and with less frequent increases in antihypertensive treatment.
