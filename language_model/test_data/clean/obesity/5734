In 62 patients with diabetes mellitus type II, 22 patients with obesity I degree and 40 patients with normal body mass (28 with ischemic heart disease and 12 without ischemic heart disease) the blood sugar profile and the composition of the high density lipoproteins (HDL) were examined. In decompensated diabetes mellitus type II reduction of cholesterol and phospholipid contents of HDL and of apoprotein A were found. With compensation of the carbohydrate metabolism the composition of HDL becomes normal. In the obese diabetics the changes of these indices are more pronounced. In diabetic patients with ischemic heart disease the cholesterol and phospholipid contents and that of apoprotein A in HDL are lower than those in diabetic patients without ischemic heart disease. These data show that changes of HDL in diabetes mellitus favor the development of atherosclerosis changes.
