A survey of the prevalence of hypertension and associated risk factors including obesity was carried out among persons of West African heritage currently living in societies at different stages of social, economic and technological development. We present here the distribution of several anthropometric variables and the prevalence of obesity in these populations. Using a standard protocol with centralized training of field staff, 7,439 men and women aged 24 to 75 from six multinational sites were recruited and examined. Although men were taller, women were more obese across sites. Body mass index (BMI) and consequently the prevalence of overweight and obesity increased with westernization from rural African subsistence farming communities to suburban Chicago. Average BMI increased with age until about age 54, and then began to decline or at least level off. The mean BMI for African-American men and women was 27.1kg/m2 and 30.8kg/m2, respectively. Men displayed high levels of centripetal fatness, measured as the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), compared to the women across site. Based on the US Department of Agriculture guidelines, 22.6% and 56.9% of the African-American men and women had elevated WHR. Although account must be taken of the important contribution of an individual's genetic background, this multinational study of persons with similar heritage clearly shows the potent impact of current environmental factors on the distribution and level of obesity.
