The authors carried out an investigation with a detailed anthropometric programme on 135 women suffering from different kinds of cancer: ovarian n = 35, endometrial n = 22, cervical n = 54, and vulvar/vagina n = 24. All patients were Hungarian and belonged to European ethnic groups. Their age varied between 25.6 and 85.0 years. Somatotype of the patients was estimated with the Heath-Carter anthropometric somatotyping method. Somatotype (endomorphy, mesomorphy, ectomorphy) of the patients with ovarian cancer was respectively: 6.8-5.3-1.0, patients with endometrial cancer 7.9-5.8-0.9, patients with cervical cancer 6.8-5.3-1.3, and patients with vulvar cancer 7.5-5.9-0.9. Based on variance analysis, there was no significant difference among subgroups at the p &<0.05 level. The patients in all four groups--in the overwhelming majority of cases--showed mesomorphic-endomorph forms, i.e., endomorphic elements dominated in their physique and mesomorphy (robusticity) was greater than ectomorphy (linearity).
