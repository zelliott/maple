The primary and secondary purposes were to examine social-ecological correlates of excessive TV viewing &>2hr/day) in American children 1) between race/ethnic groups and 2) between boys and girls.

Children (n = 48,505) aged 6 to 18 years from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health were included. Social-ecological correlates included individual-, family-, and community-level variables. Logistic regression analyses were used for race/ethnicity [Non-Hispanic White (NHW), Non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic, other] and sex groups (boys, girls), to determine associated correlates.

By race/ethnicity, 16.6%, 37.8%, and 24.5% of NHW, NHB, and Hispanic exceeded recommendations. For boys and girls, 23.7% and 18.2% viewed excessive TV. Having a TV in the bedroom and higher poverty level were associated with excessive TV in all groups. Differences by race/ethnicity were age, sex, TV in the bedroom, extracurricular activities, physical activity, adequate sleep, family structure, family meals, knowing child's friends, parent/child communication, and neighborhood characteristics. Differences by sex were family structure, parent/child communication, family meals, and neighborhood elements.

Social-ecological correlates and associated prevalence of excessive TV viewing differed across subgroups. These specific correlates can be targeted in tailored interventions.
