A total of 2,923 elderly subjects were studied to determine the relationship between obesity, hypertension, thyroid disease, renal function, alcohol consumption, selected drugs, and the serum uric acid level. Comparison of the serum uric acid levels with indices of obesity demonstrated a strong correlation in normotensive (p less than .0001) and hypertensive (p less than .001) subjects. The serum creatinine level, when used alone, was not a reliable indicator of renal function. Of the drugs evaluated, diuretics had the most pronounced effect upon the serum uric acid level.
