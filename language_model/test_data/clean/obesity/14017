In a school population of 532 boys between 10 and 18 years and 287 girls between 10 and 15 years, were drawn up the normal weight height ratios and blood pressures. The frequency of obesity was 6% in both sexes. Girls were more obese than boys. The disease started before the age of 5--6 years. They are frequently familial. A narrow correlation exists between the weight height ratios and blood pressure. The obese patients had in 8 cases a high systolic blood pressure and in 4 cases a high diastolic blood pressure. Half the hypertensive patients were over weight. A strong link between obesity and high blood pressure was also found in the family history. These facts should lead us to treat obesity in children by slimming diets or at least prevent the disease by an appropriate diet. Half the cases of high blood pressure in children and adolescents improved on losing weight.
