Alternate day modified fasting (ADMF) beneficially modulates several indicators of CHD risk, but its effects on LDL particle size have never been tested. Accordingly, we examined the effects of ADMF on LDL particle size and distribution in obese adults. Sixteen obese subjects participated in a 10-week trial with three consecutive phases: (1) 2-week control phase; (2) 4-week ADMF controlled feeding phase; (3) 4-week ADMF self-selected feeding phase. After 8 weeks of diet, body weight and waist circumference were reduced (P &<0·05) by 5·6 (sem 0·9) kg and 4·0 (sem 0·9) cm, respectively. LDL-cholesterol and TAG concentrations decreased (P &<0·05) by 25 (sem 10) % and 32 (sem 6) %, respectively. Peak LDL particle size increased (P &<0·05) from 266 (sem 1) to 268 (sem 1) Å. Additionally, the proportion of small LDL particles decreased (P &<0·05) from 13 (sem 2) % to 9 (sem 3) %, while the proportion of large LDL particles increased (P &<0·05) from 68 (sem 4) % to 76 (sem 4) % post-treatment. These findings suggest that ADMF is an effective diet strategy for increasing LDL particle size and decreasing the proportion of small, dense LDL particles in obese adults.
