Lifestyle intervention is mandatory for obesity treatment. The aim of this study is to design a questionnaire to describe and quantify those behaviours more closely related to obesity in the Spanish obese population.

An expert panel designed a preliminary 57 Liker-type item questionnaire, which was self-administered to 335 overweight patients (110 male, 225 female; age, 42 +/- 14 years; BMI, 32.6 +/- 3.7 kg/m2). After a subjacent dimensionality searching and item reducing first phase, a shrunk questionnaire of 24 items was then self-administered to 156 overweight patients (52 male, 104 female; age 42 +/- 12 years; BMI, 33.1 +/- 3.5 kg/m2); 56 of those patients were re-administered the questionnaire in order to provide test-retest information.

Final questionnaire includes 22 items clustered in five dimensions: diet caloric intake, searching for psychological well-being eating, physical activity, healthy eating and alcohol intake. Proposed factorial structure is mostly reproduced in different samples and using different extraction methods: all dimensions but alcohol intake score alpha values&> 0.75 for liability; test-retest stability is greater than 0.90 in all dimensions but alcohol intake; results for all validity tests performed (of construct, of content and discriminative) are highly satisfactory.

Metrics study results (liability and validity) demonstrate that the proposed questionnaire provides an excellent tool to assess those lifestyles related to obesity control.
