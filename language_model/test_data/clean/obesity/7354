Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of on-duty death among firefighters. Determining firefighters' risk of cardiovascular death or all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk factor profiles, and energy demands while firefighting may aid in understanding why this occupational group is at risk for on-duty sudden cardiac death. A literature review conducted between 2006 and 2009 did not demonstrate that firefighters are at increased risk of all-cause death compared to the general population. In addition, cardiovascular risk profiles of firefighters are similar to those of the general population. Firefighters may be part of the national obesity epidemic; their hypertension and hypercholesteremia often are not diagnosed or are undertreated. The combination of personal cardiovascular risk factors and extreme physical work demands may contribute to sudden cardiac death in this population.
