The significance of weight in the indications for unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) is unclear. Our hypothesis was that weight does not affect the long-term rate of survival of UKRs. We undertook a retrospective study of 212 UKRs at a mean follow-up of 12 years (7 to 22). The patients were distributed according to body mass index (BMI; &<vs ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) and weight (&<vs ≥ 82 kg). Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis was performed and ten-year survival rates were compared between the sub-groups. Multimodal regression analysis determined the impact of the various theoretical contraindications on the long-term rate of survival of UKR. The ten-year rates of survival were similar in the two weight subgroups (≥ 82 kg: 93.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.5 to 96.3); &<82 kg: 92.5% (95% CI 82.5 to 94.1)) and also in the two BMI subgroups (≥ 30 kg/m(2): 92% (95% CI 82.5 to 95.3); &<30 kg/m(2): 94% (95% CI 78.4 to 95.9)). Multimodal regression analysis revealed that weight plays a part in reducing the risk of revision with a relative risk of 0.387, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.662). The results relating weight and BMI to the clinical outcome were not statistically significant. Thus, this study confirms that weight does not influence the long-term rate of survival of UKR.
