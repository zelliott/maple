The infants aged less than two years, though often overweight, are seldom obese with a weight exceeding 2.5 SD above average for their height. This study includes 14 cases of obesity with early onset. The children were referred at age 17 +/- 5.7 months, with a mean height of +1.07 +/- 1.15 SD for age and a mean weight of +4.54 +/- 2.44 SD for height. They were reported as overfed, without any associated abnormality in their prenatal and postnatal history, and without emotional disturbances. In 8 cases, one of the parents was obese. For obtaining a weight decrease in these very young patients, a severely restricted diet has been necessary, with 50-60 cal/kg/day, corresponding in fact to 65-85 cal/kg of the average weight for height when the weight excess is 4 to 9 SD, and sometimes less, and hospital care. This diet, continued for 1 to 8 months, has allowed to reduce the weight excess at the level of +2.66 +/- 1.38 SD for height. It has been harmless, but not well accepted, so that in spite of the good results 10 of the 14 babies and mothers were lost for follow-up. The data show that true obesity is different from common weight excess in infants, is rare and very difficult to manage, and is poorly understood.
