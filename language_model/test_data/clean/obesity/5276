The metabolism of estradiol in girls with anorexia nervosa was compared with obese subjects and normal weight, age and sex matched controls. Increasing body weight was accompanied by a sharp decrease in 2-hydroxylation of estradiol and an increase in 16alpha-hydroxylation. These metabolic changes are discussed in terms of the biological activity of 2-hydroxyestrone and estriol.
