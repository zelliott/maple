Obesity in childhood and adolescence is increasing in developed countries around the world. Management is often difficult and can be unsuccessful.

The epidemiology, causes and complications of obesity in childhood and adolescence are described, and a general clinical approach to weight management is provided.

In general, a comprehensive history and examination can elicit medical causes of obesity. This paper does not seek to expand on medical causes but rather focuses on the clinical issues dealing with management of the overweight child or adolescent. This approach relies on actively engaging the child or young person, as well as involving the entire family in the process. Weight management consists of a combination of healthy eating behaviour and engaging in physical activity.
