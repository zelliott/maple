Different etiologies for early- (&<4.0 weeks) and late (≥34.0 weeks)-onset preeclampsia (EO-LO PE) are reported. The aim of our study is to identify influencing factors for the LO form.

Retrospective study of 284 consecutive women diagnosed as preeclamptic at 22.4-41.5 weeks, from 3/2005 to 10/2011, evaluated in relation to EO versus LO PE.

LO PE was identified in 151 cases. Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (11% versus 4%, p = 0.04), body mass index (BMI) ≥35 kg/m(2) (9% versus 2%, p = 0.03), pathological weight gain for BMI class (30% versus 13%, p = 0.001), ≥5 (58% versus 23%, p &<0.001) and ≥7 kg/m(2) BMI increase (19% versus 9%, p = 0.04) were more common in LO than in EO PE. At Estimation Regression analysis weighted for Gestational Age (GA) at delivery BMI ≥35 and ≥5 kg/m(2) BMI increase resulted related to LO PE (OR = 3.76, CI(95%) = 1.97-17.04; OR = 4.28, CI(95%) = 2.44-7.54).

BMI ≥35 and ≥5 kg/m(2) increase appeared as influencing factors for LO PE, thus supporting the role of systemic inflammation in its pathogenesis.
