Here we present the case of Candida albicans colonization on an intragastric balloon placed for weight loss. A 52-year-old obese woman achieved a BMI reduction of 10.9 kg/m(2) within 7 months as a result of a BioEnterics Intragastric Balloon and a well-balanced, low-calorie diet. During endoscopy for balloon removal, the balloon, which was well impacted in the gastric fundus, was found to be lime green in color with clusters of cone-shaped cultures on its surface. Microbiology assessment revealed the presence of Candida albicans, although the patient was totally asymptomatic.
