Sleep disordered breathing was first described in ancient times. It is the result of a three-way interaction between the sleep/wake state-specific mechanisms of respiratory control, the interfacing of these mechanisms during times of state change, and the physical properties of the head and neck. Sleep disordered breathing results in pathological daytime sleepiness and is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity. This paper reviews the history of the field, the physiologic and structural factors that result in sleep disordered breathing, and the implications of these factors for therapy.
