The authors investigated the significance of vomiting for hyperamylasemia and sialadenosis in patients with bulimia nervosa. Hyperamylasemia was found in 61% of the bulimics and in 20% of the restrictor anorectics but in no patients with binge-eating syndrome. In more than three fourths of the bulimics there was a close positive correlation between the frequency of vomiting and total serum amylase levels. Both frequency and type of vomiting seem to be relevant to the extent of salivary gland enlargement. The significance of vomiting for the etiopathology of hyperamylasemia and for the diagnosis of eating disorders will be discussed.
