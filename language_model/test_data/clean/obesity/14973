Chronic systemic inflammation, characterized by elevated levels of the acute phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), plays an important role in the pathogenesis of glucose metabolic disturbances and diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine if the elevated levels of CRP are associated with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in obese subjects. Healthy obese men and nonpregnant obese women were enrolled in a case-control study. Individuals with new diagnosis of IFG were considered as cases and compared with a control group without IFG. Elevated CRP was defined by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels between 3.0 and 10.0 mg/L and new diagnosis of IFG by the presence of fasting plasma glucose levels of 100 to 126 mg/dL. A total of 74 subjects were allocated into the case group and compared with 74 subjects in the control group. Elevated hsCRP was identified in 61 (41.2 %) and 34 (23.0 %) individuals in the case and control groups, respectively (p &<0.001). The adjusted odds ratio used to assess the association between elevated hsCRP levels and IFG was 3.36; 95 % confidence interval was 1.66-6.79. In conclusion, the elevated hsCRP levels are associated with IFG in obese subjects.
