To determine the effects of metformin on blood pressure, left ventricular mass, and some metabolic and endocrine parameters in nondiabetic, obese, hypertensive women.

Twelve obese, nondiabetic, hypertensive women received 850 mg metformin 2 times/day for 12 wk and placebo for another 12 wk, according to a double-blind, cross-over, randomized design. All patients were hospitalized 4 times, i.e., before randomization and after each treatment (metformin or placebo), to conduct metabolic and cardiovascular investigations (oral glucose tolerance test, euglycemic clamp associated with indirect calorimetry, and echocardiography).

Fasting glucose, HbA1c, fasting and glucose-stimulated insulin, blood pressure and left ventricular mass, cholesterol, triglycerides, and fibrinogen decreased significantly after metformin treatment, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased. The improvement in glucose metabolism resulted from increased sensitivity to insulin.

These findings suggest that metformin treatment in obese, nondiabetic, hypertensive women produces a more favorable cardiovascular risk profile.
