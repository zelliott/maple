The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of weight loss on selected serum inflammatory biomarkers in obese dogs. An experimentally induced bodyweight reduction of approximately 2.5%/week was accompanied by significant decreases in metabolic markers of obesity (lipidic profile, fructosamine, and insulin-like growth factor-1). The concentrations of acute phase proteins and of selected cytokines remained within reference ranges in obese dogs during weight loss, suggesting that significant inflammation was not a major component of this experimental model. However, adiponectin concentrations increased following the period of weight loss suggesting reduced susceptibility of these animals to obesity-related inflammation.
