To analyze the effect in obese pre- and postmenopausal women of a daily dose of 100 mg dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S) provided over a period of 3 months as replacement therapy against metabolic syndrome.

Although DHEA-S appears to be effective against certain features of metabolic syndrome, its usefulness against this syndrome as a whole has not been evaluated to date.

A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted involving 61 postmenopausal women, who received DHEA-S (n = 41) or placebo (n = 20) for 3 months. The effect of DHEA-S treatment on the same postmenopausal women was compared with the effects observed in a group of premenopausal women (n = 20).

Anthropometric measurements were taken at the beginning and at the end of the treatment. Similarly, different parameters that define metabolic syndrome and other cardiometabolic variables were determined.

Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate replacement produced weight loss in the obese women studied. Moreover, waist circumference, glucose and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, among other metabolic syndrome parameters, improved in the postmenopausal group, who showed a significant reduction in the total metabolic syndrome score (P &<0Â·05). In contrast, in premenopausal women, the effect of DHEA-S was limited to obesity parameters, and no effect was observed on metabolic syndrome components. No significant changes were evident in the placebo group.

An oral dose of DHEA-S is useful for weight loss. In obese postmenopausal women, the hormone significantly improves plasma biochemical levels and anthropometric characteristics, leading to a better metabolic profile, which highlights the usefulness of this therapy against metabolic syndrome in this group of women.
