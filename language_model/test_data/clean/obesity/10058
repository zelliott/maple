In 112 obese compared with 42 lean children, we found that serum leptin is elevated early in the evolution of childhood-onset obesity (28.4 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.4 ng/ml in lean children, P &<0.0001) and correlates with adiposity. Obese children also had higher serum leptin normalized to fat mass. Despite high serum leptin, obese children ingested 2-3 times more calories than did lean control subjects (P &<0.0001) and gained weight rapidly (10.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.1 kg/year in control subjects, P &<0.0001). Girls had higher leptin levels than did boys, in obese as well as in nonobese children, and showed a closer correlation between adiposity and serum leptin. Elevation of serum leptin was comparable before and after puberty in obese boys, but puberty further increased leptin levels in obese girls (36 +/- 3 ng/ml), resulting in a clear sexual dimorphism with pubertal obese boys (22 +/- 5 ng/ml, P &<0.005). In conclusion, increased serum leptin reflects but does not halt fat deposition in childhood obesity. After normalization to body adiposity, leptin was found to be increased independently by obesity status, female sex, and female sexual maturation.
