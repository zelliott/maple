This study aimed to examine the secular trends in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), and the prevalence of general and abdominal obesity among Chinese children and adolescents from 1993 to 2009.

Data were obtained from the China health and nutrition survey conducted from 1993 to 2009. 9693 children and adolescents aged 6-17 years were included in this study, with their height, weight and WC measured. General obesity was defined using the BMI cut-offs for overweight recommended by the International Obesity Task Force, and abdominal obesity was assessed when a WC is above the 90th percentile for gender and age.

Among the total participants, mean BMI and WC increased significantly over the period 1993-2009: BMI increased from 17.6 to 17.8 kg m(-2) , and WC increased from 61.4 to 63.1 cm (both increases P &<0.001). The prevalence of general obesity and abdominal obesity increased significantly over the period: general obesity (including overweight) rose from 6.1% to 13.1% and abdominal obesity from 4.9% to 11.7% (both increases P &<0.001). WC and abdominal obesity increased at a relatively higher rate than BMI and general obesity. Upward trends in the prevalence of general and abdominal obesity were observed in all subgroups of gender, age and region (all increases P &<0.05), except for abdominal obesity in girls aged 13-17 years (P = 0.102).

General and abdominal obesity increased significantly over the past 17 years in Chinese children.
