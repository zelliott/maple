A case of delayed popliteal artery injury (PA-INJ) onset after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in a patient under postoperative anticoagulation therapy is reported. The role of anticoagulation both in late PA-INJ presentation and in PA-INJ management is discussed.

An obese 76-year-old woman was presented with a common femoral vein thrombosis coupled with pulmonary embolism five days after TKA. She was immediately placed under anticoagulation therapy. Four days later, during physiotherapy-supervised mobilization, she developed a calf haematoma and large retro-articular pseudoaneurysm. Angiography revealed a minor PA-INJ successively treated with a covered stent-graft.

In cases of initially undetected and staunched TKA-related PA-INJs, postoperative anticoagulation therapy may act as a potential trigger for final arterial rupture during mobilization exercises, followed by acute bleeding; in these cases, endovascular management represents an excellent treatment option. Close clinical and instrumental monitoring is strongly recommended after TKA, in patients who imperatively require full-dose anticoagulation therapy.
