Psoriasis is associated with comorbidities that include metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular risk. These conditions share etiologic features and health consequences that directly correlate with the severity of psoriatic disease. This disease, in both its skin and joint manifestations, may represent a relevant healthcare issue as an indicator of a broader, underlying disorder of systemic inflammation, and warrants more comprehensive study and multidisciplinary collaboration on its pathophysiology, epidemiology, and treatment in relation to its comorbid conditions.
