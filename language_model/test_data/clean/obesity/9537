The motor development of a group of fat babies was compared with that of a group of normal weight babies. A significant correlation was found between excessive weight and gross motor delay. Over the ensuing year, both weight and development reverted to normal in the majority of infants. The possible relationship between observations is discussed, and a plea is made that a comprehensive evaluation of the motor-delayed overweight infant be performed before concluding that the delay is due solely to the excessive weight.
