Paranoid psychosis may result from intoxication with, or withdrawal from amphetamines. The authors describe two cases of paranoid confusional psychosis commencing 1 week after the patients' withdrawal from sympathomimetic amines. The pathophysiology for this unusual disorder may be agonist-induced dopamine receptor hypersensitivity.
