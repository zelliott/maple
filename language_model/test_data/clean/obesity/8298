Feeding a Western high-fat diet (HFD) to C57BL/6 mice induces obesity, associated with a chronic inflammatory state, lipid transport, and metabolic derangements, and organ system effects that particularly prominent in the kidneys. Here, we report that RLIP76 homozygous knock-out (RLIP76(-/-)) mice are highly resistant to obesity as well as these other features of metabolic syndrome caused by HFD. The normal increase in pro-inflammatory and fibrotic markers associated with HFD induced obesity in wild-type C57B mice was broadly and nearly completely abrogated in RLIP76(-/-) mice. This is a particularly striking finding because chemical markers of oxidative stress including lipid hydroperoxides and alkenals were significantly higher in RLIP76(-/-) mice. Whereas HFD caused marked suppression of AMPK in wild-type C57B mice, RLIP76(-/-) mice had baseline activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which was not further affected by HFD. The baseline renal function was reduced in RLIP76(-/-) mice as compared with wild-type, but was unaffected by HFD, in marked contrast to severe renal impairment and glomerulopathy in the wild-type mice given HFD. Our findings confirm a fundamental role of RLIP76 in regulating the function of obesity-promoting pro-inflammatory cytokines, and provide a novel mechanism for targeted therapy of obesity and metabolic syndrome.
