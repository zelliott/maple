The concept of intragastric space-occupying balloon developed from observations in psychiatric patients with gastric bezoars. Several gastric balloons consisting of different materials were developed. The BioEnterics Intagastric Balloon System (BIB) is a smooth, spherical, silicone elastomer balloon inducing satiety and restricting food intake. The balloon is indicated to induce weight loss in patients before surgery, to reduce the surgical risk, to select the patients for gastric restrictive surgery. Our experience showed that patients who had good results with the balloon they are good candidates for gastric restrictive surgical procedures. There were few complications: balloon intolerance, spontaneous deflation, oesophagitis, gastritis and rarely gastric ulcers. Conclusion is that in selected patients intragastric balloon can be used as effective and safe approach and could be a great help to induce weight loss and to prepare for surgery.
