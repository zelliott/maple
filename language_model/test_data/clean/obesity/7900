The consumption of specific foods in energy-restricted diets may affect the weight loss process. The purpose of this research was to evaluate whether obese women following two hypocaloric diets with distinct fruit content differ in weight loss and metabolic responses. Fifteen obese women were included, who were randomly assigned to follow a low or a high-fruit energy-restricted diet for 8 weeks. The main outcome variables were weight and fat losses. Metabolic measurements concerning macronutrient oxidation were also assessed by using (13)C labelled fructose and indirect calorimetry. The induced weight loss was similar for both diets (6.9 +/- 2% vs. 6.6 +/- 2%, p = 0.785). Both experimental diets similarly improved the lipid plasma profile in the participants, but the cholesterol fall was higher in obese subjects receiving the diet containing more fruit. No statistical differences in lipids carbohydrates and (13)C labelled fructose utilisation were observed, but protein oxidation was differently affected by the experimental diets. The compensatory effects of the associated fibre/fructose intake may explain the lack of a specific effect of the fruit amount on hypocaloric diets designed to weight loss, although the increased fibre content from enriched fruit diets may be involved in the favourable effects on cholesterol plasma levels.
