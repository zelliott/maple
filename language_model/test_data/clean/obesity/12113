Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured in 154 women and 48 men before the beginning of a weight reduction program. In both sexes there were significant univariate correlations between RMR and fat-free mass, body fat, weight, fat cell weight, and fat cell number (from total body water). Women also showed significant correlations between RMR and fat cell number (from total body potassium), free triiodothyronine index, and fasting and postglucose insulin levels. Multiple regression analysis showed that both fat-free mass and fat cell weight and number were significant predictors of RMR. The contribution of fat-free mass was three to five times greater per kg than that of body fat. There was no significant contribution of thyroid hormones or insulin to the prediction of RMR. Fat cell number and fat cell weight were significant predictors of RMR, whether determined from body water, body potassium, or a formula using both water and potassium. There was no significant difference in regression coefficients between men and women. Thus the difference in RMR between the sexes is probably caused by the higher proportion of fat-free mass in men. The effect of age was small and not statistically significant.
