To establish whether the frequent finding of a moderate-intermediate increase in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) causes coronary artery disease (CAD), the authors evaluated the number of coexisting major traditional risk factors, as well as the major tHcy determinants, in patients with the same degree of CAD but different tHcy levels.

The authors studied 180 patients with CAD, who were divided into three groups according to tHcy levels: 60 patients with normal tHcy, 60 patients with moderate (15-30 micromol L(-1)) and 60 patients with intermediate hyperhomocysteinaemia (30-100 micromol L(-1)). The patient groups were matched for gender, age and number of affected coronary vessels. All patients were checked for the presence of traditional risk factors for CAD (i.e. hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, smoking habit, familial history, obesity), as well as determinants of tHcy levels. The population was subdivided into those having, or not, a substantial burden of traditional risk factors (i.e. &<4 and&> or = 4, respectively).

There was a significant trend towards a reduced number of subjects within the group with&> or = 4 risk factors across increasing tHcy levels (51.7%, 37.8%, 26%, for normal, moderate, intermediate tHcy, respectively, chi2 for linear-trend = 0.006). Folate and vitamin B12 concentrations, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), MTHFR 677C&> T polymorphism were the major determinants of tHcy in this population.

In patients with the same degree of CAD, those with hyperhomocysteinaemia had a reduced burden of traditional risk factors as compared with those with normal tHcy levels. Hyperhomocysteinaemia was significantly associated with an emerging non-traditional risk factor such as lower GFR.
