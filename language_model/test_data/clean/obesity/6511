The use of inflatable intragastric balloons is a new non-intensive approach in the treatment of obesity when poor results are obtained by more conservative treatment. The intragastric balloons are certainly less hazardous than bariatric surgery but their long term effect on body-weight reduction it is not still proved. Several types of balloons are currently in use. The two used most widely are the Garren-Edwards Gastric Bubble and the Ballobes Balloon. The Authors report their experience with these two types of anti-obesity gastric-balloon in 60 grossly obese patients.
