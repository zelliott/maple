During the 1990s, use of home care sector has increased substantially in Europe. However, research on home care continues to be underreported. This article summarizes the findings from the "Aged in Home Care" (ADHOC) study - carried out from 2001 to 2004 in Europe - and women's situation in European Home Care.

The review is based on 4 book chapters as well as on 23 articles listed in PubMed and published from August 2004 to October 2008. ADHOC used a standardized data set collected with the Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care (RAI-HC 2.0); this instrument was used to assess 4010 home care clients at 11 European sites. The included articles analyzed the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, basic physical needs, provision of selected preventive measures, and medication data from the ADHOC sample. In addition home service provision, quality indicators, and selected outcomes of home care intervention during the course of 1 year were assessed.

The mean subject age was 82.3 years; women were on average 2 years older than men and more frequently lived alone, 74% were women. Women suffered more frequently from pain, depression, and extreme obesity. There were marked regional differences in both the functional status of the clients and the characteristics and use of home care services.

The implementation of a common assessment instrument for HC clients may help contribute the necessary wealth of data for (re)shaping home care in Europe. Policy makers and service providers may learn about best practices in the European context.
