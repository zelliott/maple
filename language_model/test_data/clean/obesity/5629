The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 2 weeks of supplementation with (-)-hydroxycitrate (HCA) and HCA combined with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) on satiety and energy intake. The experimental design consisted of three intervention periods of 2 weeks separated by washout periods of 2 or 6 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, and crossover design. Seven male and 14 female normal to moderately obese subjects (mean+/-S.D.; age, 43+/-10 years; body mass index, 27.6+/-2.0 kg/m(2)) participated in this study. Subjects consumed three self-selected meals and four isoenergetic snacks daily with either no supplementation (PLA), with 500 mg HCA (HCA), or 500 mg HCA and 3 g MCT (HCA+MCT). Each intervention period ended with a test day, consisting of a standardized breakfast and ad libitum a lunch and a dinner. There was a significant body weight (BW) loss during the 2 weeks of intervention (PLA, -0.5+/-0.3 kg, P&<05; HCA, -0.4+/-0.2 kg, P&<05; HCA+MCT, -0.7+/-0.2 kg, P&<01), but this reduction was not different between treatments. Twenty-four-hour energy intake (PLA, 8.1+/-0.3 MJ; HCA, 8.3+/-0.3 MJ; HCA+MCT, 8.4+/-0.3 MJ) and the area under the curve of the appetite-related parameters during the test day were similar for all treatments. Two weeks of supplementation with HCA and HCA combined with MCT did not result in increased satiety or decreased energy intake compared to placebo in subjects losing BW.
