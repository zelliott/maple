This study was conducted to assess whether changes in atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) secretion could account for the natriuresis of the early phase of fasting. To this end, 8 AM (supine) and 10 AM (standing) plasma ANF concentrations were determined daily and compared with plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels in 8 obese subjects submitted to a 7-day total fast. Depiste constant daily sodium intake (51 mmol), urinary sodium excretion increased from 35 +/- 7 to 109 +/- 8 mmol/day after 4 days of fast (p less than 0.001) and declined thereafter. Urinary ketone excretion progressively increased over the whole period of fasting (p less than 0.001). Interestingly, fasting induced a decrease in plasma ANF concentrations (p less than 0.05). A contrast analysis revealed no significant change in ANF during the initial natriuretic phase of fasting but a decrease at the end of fasting averaging 36% (p less than 0.05) and 18% (p less than 0.05) at 8 and 10 AM respectively. In contrast, plasma aldosterone rose during fasting (p less than 0.05), the difference being significant at the end of fasting (p less than 0.01). Plasma renin activity and cortisol did not change significantly over the fasting period. Postural and/or diurnal changes of ANF, aldosterone, renin and cortisol were preserved during fasting (p less than 0.01). Postural changes of ANF were, however, attenuated at the end of fasting (p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the fasting natriuresis cannot be explained by changes in ANF levels but that the loss of sodium may contribute to a decline of basal ANF levels, with an attenuation of their physiological postural changes, and to a stimulation of the aldosterone secretion.
