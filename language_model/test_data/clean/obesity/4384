In the mid-1990s, interest in adipose tissue - until then generally regarded as a mere energy reserve - was revived by the discovery of leptin. Since then numerous other cytokine-like hormones have been isolated from white adipose tissue. These adipokines have been investigated in relation to obesity, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and other pathological conditions and processes. In addition, it is now established that adipokines play a role in the maintenance of an inflammatory state in adipose tissue and in the development of obesity and comorbidities. The contributions of individual adipokines in the pathophysiological features of obesity have yet to be determined in full, but recent data highlight important roles for adipokines in lipid metabolism.
