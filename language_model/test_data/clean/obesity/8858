To assess whether pelvic lymph nodes have a left-right asymmetric distribution.

The oncologic databases of two gynecologic academic departments were used to identify consecutive patients undergoing pelvic systematic lymphadenectomy as part of the treatment for a variety of gynecologic malignancies. All procedures were carried out in a standardized fashion. Lymph node counts were retrieved from pathological reports.

Four hundred and twenty-eight women underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy during the study period. The median lymph node count was higher on the right side than on the left side [10 (0-33) versus 8 (0-29); P&<.0001]. A prevalence of right-sided nodes was found in 265 (61.9%) patients, while in 44 (10.3%) cases pelvic nodes were equally distributed on the two sides. The right-sided prevalence was significantly higher than the expected 50% in each type of malignancy and surgical technique subgroup. The right-sided prevalence was statistically significant even when the analysis was performed for different nodal groups [external iliac nodes: 5 (0-23) versus 4 (0-13), P=0.005; hypogastric and obturator nodes: 6 (0-17) versus 5 (0-19), P=0.04]. Moreover, nodal count was higher on the right than on the left in obese [10 (1-33) versus 8 (1-26), P=0.0002] and nonobese women [10 (0-32) versus 9 (0-29), P&<.0001].

Our findings suggest the existence of a left-right asymmetry in pelvic lymph nodes distribution, with right-sided prevalence.
