Nephrotic syndrome has been reported in obesity; its precise incidence in obese patients without diabetes mellitus and/or arterial hypertension is however unknown. Thirty-two obese subjects without complications were therefore assessed before and after weight loss, together with 18 healthy control subjects. Overnight albumin excretion rate (AER) was assessed using a RIA method (H. Albumin-Kit, Sclavo). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was also evaluated in 10 obese subjects using Cr51 before and after weight loss. AER was found to be higher, although the difference was not statistically significant, in obese subjects compared to controls, but was significantly reduced after weight loss (p = 0.05). GFR also showed a non-significant tendency to decrease following loss of weight. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly decreased following weight loss (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.025 respectively). In conclusion, although it is not possible to confirm the presence of true nephropathy in uncomplicated obesity, the latter can facilitate the onset of hemodynamic-type mechanisms which, in the presence of diabetes mellitus or arterial hypertension, may lead to the appearance of the nephrotic syndrome.
