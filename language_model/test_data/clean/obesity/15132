To study the characteristics of the metabolic syndrome (MS) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in 336 patients with PCOS, and the serum levels triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and testosterone were measured.

The total incidence of MS was 18.8% in these 336 patients with PCOS. The incidence of MS increased with percent body fat (%BF) and lipid accumulation product (LAP) in patients with PCOS. The patients at child-bearing age appeared to have a higher incidence of MS than those in puberty. The muscle distribution coefficient, age, body mass index, and the metabolic parameters were all higher in patients with MS than in those without MS. The bilateral lower limb muscle strength were lower in patients with MS than in those without, but the level of testosterone showed no significant difference between them.

The risk of MS increases with BF%, age and LAP in patients with PCOS.
