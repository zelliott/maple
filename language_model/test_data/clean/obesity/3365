The weight, height, body mass index (BMI) and deviation from the ideal weight according to tables were measured in the patients over 24 years who spontaneously attended a demand clinic. These data permitted to calculate the prevalence of obesity in the demand clinic, and its relation with age, sex, frequentation rate and type of consultation were evaluated. 301 subjects were included, 113 males and 188 females, with a mean age of 53.43 +/- 10.68 years. According to their BMI, 52.62% were obese. It was concluded that: the prevalence of obesity in the demand clinic amounted to about 50% (65% in females); age was related with obesity only in females; weight and age influenced frequentation and type of consultation in females, whereas in males only the age had an influence.
