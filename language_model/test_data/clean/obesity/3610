Recent advances in genetic analysis especially DNA sequencing technology open a new strategy for adult disease prevention by genetic screening. Physicians presently treat disease pathology with less emphasis on disease risk prevention/reduction. Genetic screening has reduced the incidence of untreatable childhood genetic diseases and improved the care of newborns. The opportunity exists to expand screening programs and reduce the incidence of adult onset diseases via genetic risk identification and disease intervention. This article outlines the approach, challenges, and benefits of such screening for adult genetic disease risks.
