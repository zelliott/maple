Childhood obesity is a chronic disease that is associated with significant co-morbidity. Successful treatment and prevention of childhood obesity requires a multidisciplinary approach, including diet, nutrition education, behavior modification, and exercise. We studied 87 children (39 males, 48 females; aged 7-17 years) enrolled in a one-year multidisciplinary weight reduction program. Subjects were placed on a very low calorie/high protein diet, a moderate-intensity progressive exercise program, and behavior modification sessions for 10 weeks. Measures were taken at baseline 10 weeks, and 1 year. Significant anthropometric changes in weight, percent of ideal body weight, and percent body-fat were observed in all patients. We conclude that a multidisciplinary weight reduction program including diet, behavior modification, and exercise is an effective instrument to achieve weight loss in obese children and adolescents.
