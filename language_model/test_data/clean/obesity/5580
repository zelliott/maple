Abnormalities of copper distribution in tissues and serum has been described in obese subjects. In this prospective study, we evaluated the seric level of copper by atomic absorption in a group of 32 obese (BMI&> or = 30 kg/m2) compared to a group of 32 healthy subjects. We have noted an elevation of serum copper in obese with a middle level of 133 mg/dl significantly superior to the middle level of serum copper of healthy subjects, 108 mg/dl (p &<0.001). In another hand, we have noticed that the levels of serum cooper rise with the BMI. In fact, 58.3% of the obese that have a BMI&> or = 40 kg/m2 show a high concentration of serum copper although only 5% of obese with BMI &<40 kg/m2 show this high concentration. This work must be completed by the determination of ceruloplasmin levels in a larger group of obese in order to establish correlations between the serum ceruloplasmin levels, the serum copper levels and the obesity.
