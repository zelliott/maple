Six matched groups of obese patients underwent 3-week selective hypocaloric regimens which consisted of a 240 or 480 kcal/day liquid formula diets for groups 1-4 and an 800 kcal/day conventional diet for groups 5 and 6. Carbohydrate intake ranged from 19 to 112 g/day so that for each energy level two different amounts of carbohydrates were administered. Body weight loss was similar in groups 1-4 and significantly lower in groups 5 and 6. During treatment fasting serum insulin (but not serum C-peptide) levels and the daily urine excretion rate of C-peptide showed quite a similar fall in all groups. Fasting glucagon levels did not change. The rate of ketogenesis which developed during each nutritional treatment was inversely related to the amount of dietary carbohydrates; moreover, a significant correlation was found between percent variation of ketoacids and those of fasting IRI (r = -0.42; p less than 0.01) and glucose (r = -0.52; p less than 0.01) concentrations, but not with those of fasting C-peptide and its daily urine excretion rate. In conclusion, it seems that during underfeeding (1) low- and high-carbohydrate-containing regimens are substantially equipotent stimuli secretagogues of insulin secretion, and (2) carbohydrate (or glucose) availability affects ketogenesis even through noninsulin-mediated mechanisms.
