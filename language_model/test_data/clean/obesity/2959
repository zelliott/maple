The influence of the pituitary gland of lean and genetically obese (ob/ob) mice on insulin secretion from microdissected pancreatic islets of lean and ob/ob mice has been studied by perifusing the pituitaries of these animals in series with the isolated islets and measuring insulin secretion at 5-min intervals over a period of 60 min. It has been shown that the pituitary perifusate of both lean and obese mice stimulate insulin secretion from lean mouse islets but not from obese mouse islets. The maximum stimulation occurs in the first 10 min and with the lean mouse pituitaries returns to the basal level in about 20 min, whereas with the obese mouse pituitaries insulin secretion is about double that from the control islets even after 40 min. A concentration of pure porcine ACTH equivalent to about three times the amount released from the pituitary gland under the experimental conditions used, caused only a small stimulation of insulin release. Possible interpretations of these findings and further lines of investigation are discussed.
