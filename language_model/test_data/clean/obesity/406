Lower limb chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is one of the most common diseases in western world adults with considerable socio-economic impact. Varicose veins of the legs are caused by a number of factors. Current data suggest that both lifestyle and environmental factors play a role in varicose vein occurrence. Nevertheless, environmental factors seem to play greater role than previously thought. This was also observed in a Swiss survey of 1099 participants carried out during summer 2008 in 40 different Swiss pharmacies.
