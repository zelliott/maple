Visceral obesity is linked to insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. A recent genetic study indicated that the gene locus for the anti-oxidant defense enzyme methionine sulphoxide reductase A (MsrA) is positively associated with the development of visceral adiposity. This work tested the hypothesis that Msr activity is diminished in visceral fat as a result of obesity. It used two animal models of obesity, wild-type rats fed a high-fat (45% of calories from fat) diet and Zucker rats fed a 10% fat calorie diet. The data indicate that MsrA activity was selectively reduced by âˆ¼ 25% in the visceral adipose, but not subcutaneous adipose or liver, of both rat models as compared to control, wild type rats receiving a 10% fat calorie diet. MsrB activity was similarly reduced only in visceral fat. The data indicate that Msr activity is reduced by obesity and may alter oxidative stress signalling of obesity.
