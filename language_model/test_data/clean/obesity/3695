Cushing's Syndrome (CS) is associated with an increased mortality, where hypercoagulability seems to have a crucial role in both arterial and venous thrombosis. Parameters of in vitro thrombin generation (TG) such as lag time, peak thrombin and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), that describe the time until thrombin burst, the peak amount of TG and the total amount of thrombin generated, respectively as well as classical clotting markers were evaluated in 33 CS patients compared to both a group of 28 patients matched for the features of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) and 31 healthy individuals. CS and MetS patients had shorter lag time (p &<0.0001), higher peak and ETP (p &<0.0001) than healthy controls, though lag time was less shortened in CS (p &<0.0001) respect to MetS group. Prothrombin time (PT) was increased (p &<0.0001) in both CS and MetS patients, while partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was shorter (p &<0.0001) in CS compared to both MetS and healthy group (p &<0.0001). Factor VIII (FVIII), Antithrombin (AT), protein C and S were increased only in CS patients (p &<0.0001). lag time, AT and FVIII correlated to night salivary cortisol (r = + 0.59; p = 0.0005, r = + 0.40; p = 0.003, r = + 0.40; p = 0.04, respectively); PTT correlated inversely to urinary free cortisol (r = -0.45; p = 0.009). BMI correlated negatively to lag time (r = -0.40; p = 0.0001) and positively to peak and ETP (r = + 0.34; p = 0.001, r = + 0.28; p = 0.008, respectively). Obese and diabetic patients had shorter lag time (p = 0.0005; p = 0.0002, respectively), higher ETP (p = 0.0006; p = 0.007, respectively) and peak (p = 0.0003; p = 0.0005, respectively) as well as a more prolonged PT (p = 0.04; p = 0.009, respectively). Hypertensive individuals had higher ETP (p = 0.004), peak (p = 0.0008) and FVIII (p = 0.001). Our findings confirm a prothrombotic state in both CS and MetS patients, though lag time was less shortened in CS. The high levels of endogenous physiological anticoagulants, could possibly represent a protective mechanism against hypercoagulability seen in CS patients.
