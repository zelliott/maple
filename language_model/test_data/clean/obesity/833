Heart disease is the main cause of early disability and premature death in Europe. Regular physical activity may prevent heart disease, diabetes, ictus, and obesity. Nevertheless, a certain resistance to a dynamic lifestyle, lack of free time, lack of motivation and other factors are frequently encountered.

To stress the importance of physical activity in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

A literature review of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease was carried out.

It has been shown that physical exercise is beneficial to the cardiovascular apparatus and to the bones and joints, by improving some metabolic parameters. Recent studies have shown that a personalized, moderate physical activity should be suggested for primary and secondary prevention, in particular for subjects with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. An increase in sports activity and physical exercise at work and at school is recommended so as to improve quality of life and promote home rehabilitation. Some promising experience has already been made among workers and their families with excellent results, as shown by a follow-up period of three years.
