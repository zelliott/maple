Obesity has been considered a potential risk factor for complications during laparoscopic surgery. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively investigate the association of various obesity indices and intraoperative factors in laparoscopic donor nephrectomy.

This study included 70 and 44 patients who underwent laparoscopic donor nephrectomy by a transperitoneal approach and retroperitoneal approach, respectively. We measured fat thickness and fat areas on preoperative computerized tomography (CT) images. The median value of fat thickness or of the subcutaneous fat area, visceral fat area, perirenal fat area, or total fat area among subjects was used as a cutoff to define fatty and non-fatty groups. The operative time and estimated blood loss were then compared between the two groups.

In the transperitoneal approach group, there was no statistically significant difference in any of the indices or intraoperative factors between the fatty and non-fatty groups defined using any of the fat parameters. In the retroperitoneal approach group, patients in the fatty group categorized by perirenal fat thickness and visceral fat area had significantly greater estimated blood loss than those in the non-fatty group. Also, in the retroperitoneal approach group, patients in the fatty group categorized by perirenal fat area had significantly greater estimated blood loss and longer operating time than those in the non-fatty group (P=.02 and P=.014, respectively).

The results indicate that the visceral fat, and in particular the perirenal fat area measured using CT scan imaging, influences operating time and estimated blood loss after retroperitoneal approach surgery but not in transperitoneal approach surgery. In donors with a high volume of perirenal fat, the transperitoneal approach may be recommended for laparoscopic nephrectomy.
