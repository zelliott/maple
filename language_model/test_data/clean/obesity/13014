To assess the relationship of percentage of indigenous ancestry with body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) among Native Hawaiians.

A cross-sectional, observational study among 567 rural native Hawaiian men and women, aged 30 or older, enrolled between 1993-96.

Ancestry was assessed by self-report, and was verified with a brief genealogical interview. Anthropometric measurements, as well as dietary and physical activity histories were also obtained.

Percentage Hawaiian ancestry was significantly associated with increased body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), and age. The association between percentage Hawaiian ancestry and both anthropometric measures persisted after adjusting for age, leisure time physical activity and total dietary energy intake.

Obesity and central adiposity were highly prevalent among Hawaiians participating in this study. The association between BMI and WHR with percentage Hawaiian ancestry, unexplained by differences in diet and physical activity, suggests genetic factors play an important role in the high prevalence of obesity observed among Native Hawaiians.
