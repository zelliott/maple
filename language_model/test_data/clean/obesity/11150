Previous reports have connected between Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), obesity and different hormonal states. The aim of this study was to characterize the endocrine profile in women with IIH.

This is a data-based study of 51 IIH patients. We measured anthropometric parameters and assessed hormonal profile including cortisol, testosterone, bioavailable testosterone (BT), prolactin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), androstenedione, insulin, aldosterone, estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Pearson or Spearman rank correlation for non-normally distributed variables were calculated to evaluate the relation among the anthropometric measurements: age, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference and waist to hip ratio (WHR) with hormones levels.

Seventy-eight percent of the cohort had WHR &<0.85 and 21.6% had a WHR&> 0.85. Increased levels of testosterone, BT and androstenedione were all positively related to younger age of diagnosis in patient who are diagnosed after the age of 25 (R = -1.066, -0.845, -0.735, p &<0.001, =0.024, 0.019, respectively). No correlation was found between any of the analyzed hormones and the duration of the disease, WHR or BMI, except insulin, which was positively related to BMI (R = 0.461, p = 0.001).

Increased levels of circulating androgens are associated with earlier age of onset of IIH in women.
