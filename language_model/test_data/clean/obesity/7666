Despite the well-known recidivism of obesity, surprisingly little is known about the composition of body weight during weight regain.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the composition of body weight regained after intentional weight loss is similar to the composition of body weight lost.

The design was a follow-up to a randomized controlled trial of weight loss in which body composition was analyzed and compared in 78 postmenopausal women before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 6 and 12 mo after the intervention.

All body mass and composition variables were lower immediately after weight loss than at baseline (all P &<0.05). More fat than lean mass was lost with weight loss, which resulted in body-composition changes favoring a lower percentage of body fat and a higher lean-to-fat mass ratio (P &<0.001). Considerable interindividual variability in weight regain was noted (CV = 1.07). In women who regained â‰¥2 kg body weight, a decreasing trend in the lean-to-fat mass ratio was observed, which indicated greater fat mass accretion than lean mass accretion (P &<0.001). Specifically, for every 1 kg fat lost during the weight-loss intervention, 0.26 kg lean tissue was lost; for every 1 kg fat regained over the following year, only 0.12 kg lean tissue was regained.

Although not all postmenopausal women who intentionally lose weight will regain it within 1 y, the data suggest that fat mass is regained to a greater degree than is lean mass in those who do experience some weight regain. The health ramifications of our findings remain to be seen.
