The Metabolic Syndrome encompasses a set of laboratory and physical findings, including central adiposity, insulin resistance, hypertension, high triglycerides, and low HDL-cholesterol and several abnormalities in clotting and inflammatory markers. Using the definition provided by the Adult Treatment Panel III of the National Cholesterol Education Program, 24% of adult Americans have the Metabolic Syndrome. Central location of fat and release of fatty acids and cytokines from enlarged fat cells located in the intra-abdominal fat tissue provide the major agents that incite this syndrome. From a practical point of view, identifying dietary and lifestyle factors, including low levels of physical activity, are important in designing a diet and exercise program that can help individuals with the Metabolic Syndrome to reduce the associated detrimental health consequences.
