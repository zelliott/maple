Insulin resistance in the obese is closely related with cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors not only in adults but also in children and adolescents. We aimed to elucidate whether insulin resistance in non-obese adolescents is related with these conditions. A total of 74 non-obese high-school students (38 boys and 36 girls) were recruited. Anthropometry, blood pressure, fasting serum chemistry and insulin activity were measured. Subjects with a homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) level greater than the 75th percentile &> 2.25 for boys and&> 2.89 for girls) were defined as insulin resistant. Non-obese boys with impaired insulin sensitivity had higher systolic blood pressure, lower HDL-cholesterol concentration, and fewer hours of vigorous exercise during weekdays, while non-obese girls with impaired insulin sensitivity had higher systolic blood pressure than their peers with normal insulin sensitivity. By multiple stepwise regression analysis, systolic blood pressure (p &<0.001) and the hours of vigorous exercise during weekdays (p &<0.03) were independently associated with HOMA-IR in boys, while systolic blood pressure (p &<0.0001) and serum concentrations of HDL-cholesterol (p &<0.01) were found in girls. In nonobese adolescents, insulin sensitivity is related with cardiovascular risk factors.
