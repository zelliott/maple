This study was to explore the effects of a compound (BPG) from Balanophora polyandra Griff on metabolic syndrome in mice. The animal models, developed obesity, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, were induced by high-fat-diet in C57BL/6 mice, and were treated orally with 100 mg/kg/day BPG and 15 mg/kg/day rosiglitazone, respectively. The age-matched C57BL/6 mice fed with standard chow were used as normal control. The blood glucose, the value of serum triglyceride and the content of triglyceride in the skeletal muscle were determined by biochemical methods. The protein expression was evaluated by western blot. BPG administration decreased body weight gain, adiposity index, serum triglyceride levels, and triglyceride accumulation in skeletal muscle significantly. At the same time, BPG administration also exhibited extensive effects on insulin resistance by improving oral glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test and glucose infusion rate in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp test. Furthermore, in skeletal muscle, BPG reversed the defect expression of IRbeta, IRS-1 and PTP1B, and also decreased the expression of ACCbeta and increased the expression of p-AMPK in the high-fat-diet-induced mice. All the results suggest that BPG improves metabolic syndrome may by the enhancement of insulin sensitivity and fatty acid oxidation.
