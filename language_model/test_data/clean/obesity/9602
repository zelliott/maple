Numerous experiments indicate that in the pathogenesis of so-called civilization diseases, low consumption of dietary fibers seems to be one of etiological factors. Therefore, it is not surprising that dietary fibers play an ever increasing role both in prevention and dietetic management of the diseases. Among these fibers wheat bran containing about 50% of dietary fibers has the most beneficial physiological effect. Besides, wheat bran is fit very well for production of different foodstuffs. Data are reported on the content of crude and dietary fibers in cabbage, radish, carrot, wheat bran and brown bread.
