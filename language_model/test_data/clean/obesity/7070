To determine which clinical measure of childhood obesity should be monitored to best reflect change in adiposity in a weight management programme and estimate the degree of change needed to be relatively certain of fat reduction.

92 obese children with a mean (range) age of 12.8 (6.9-18.9) years and a mean body mass index standard deviation score (BMI SDS) of +3.38 (+2.27 to +4.47) attending a hospital-based clinic on a regular, 3 monthly basis.

Pairs of weight and height measured up to 2.41 years apart used to derive BMI as kg/m2, and adjusted for age and gender to give weight and BMI SDS (BMI-z score) using British 1990 Growth Reference Data. Contemporaneous adiposity estimated by fatness measured by a bioimpedance segmental body composition analyser.

Changes in BMI-z scores, compared to BMI, weight and weight SDS, most accurately reflected loss of fat. Reductions of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 BMI SDS equate to expected mean falls in total body fat percentage of 2.9%, 5.8%, 8.7% and 11.6%. Approximate 95% prediction intervals indicated that a fall in BMI SDS of at least 0.6 over 6-12 months (or 0.5 over 0-6 months) is consistent with actual fat loss.

Change in BMI-z score best reflects percentage fat loss compared to BMI, weight and weight SDS. The wide variation in likely percentage fat loss for a given BMI SDS reduction means a loss of 0.5-0.6 is required to be relatively certain of definite percentage fat reduction.
