Basic parameters of the reproductive system were examined in 121 women with Icenko-Cushing's disease and in 87 ones with primary obesity before and after therapy. Icenko-Cushing's disease was treated with the means acting on the adrenals (chloditan, destruction of one or both adrenals, uni- or bilateral adrenalectomy) and on the hypothalamohypophyseal area (parlodel, peritol, nakom, R-therapy). Combined therapy of primary obesity included low-caloric diet (approximately 1200 kcal) with 1-2 fasting days weekly, a complex of therapeutic exercises, physio- and balneotherapy. The results permit a conclusion that pathogenetic therapy, resulting in a stable clinical and hormonal remission of Icenko-Cushing's disease and body mass reduction in primary obesity as a rule lead to recovery of the reproductive system functioning in such patients.
