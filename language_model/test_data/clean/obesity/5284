Blood glucose, free fatty acid and insulin responses to oral glucose and the fasting serum lipids were measured in 3 groups: 32 non-obese (mean age: 47.5 years) and 9 obese (mean age: 84.5 years), male patients with coronary heart disease and 12 non-obese male controls (mean age: 46.5 years). The oral glucose tolerance tests were repeated after 3 years in 16 of the non-obese patients with coronary heart disease. The results were as follows: 1) Glucose tolerance was impaired in 19 of 32 non-obese patients (59.4%). There was a significant correlation between impaired glucose tolerance and hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia). 2) In obese patients FFA levels at 30, 60, and 120 min after oral glucose administration were significantly elevated and FFA decrease was delayed with a drop to minimum levels at 180 min. 3) The insulin response after oral glucose administration in the group of non-obese patients with normal glucose tolerance was similar to that of non-obese controls. In the group of non-obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance, serum insulin levels went up to normal levels, but the peak was delayed. The serum insulin levels in obese patients were significantly higher than those of controls of 0, 60, 120, and 180 min. After 3 years the change in insulin response to oral glucose was not related to anginal symptoms or ECG findings, but was related to body weight change in patients with minor changes in glucose tolerance. 4) The metabolic pattern in the non-obese group with impaired glucose tolerance resembled that of "mild diabetes" in delayed response of insulin and FFA, and mild hyperlipidemia. These findings suggest that obesity may contribute to hyperinsulinemia in patients with coronary heart disease and that impaired glucose tolerance observed in patients with coronary heart disease is in part due to "latent diabetes".
