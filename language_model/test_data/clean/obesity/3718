Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their risk factors are the major public health problems. There are some documented trend and point estimations of metabolic risk factors for Iranian population but there are little information about their exposure distribution at sub-national level and no information about their trends and their effects on the population health.Â 

The present study protocol is aimed to provide the standard structure definitions, organization, data sources, methods of data gathering or generating, and data on trend analysis of the metabolic risk factors in NASBOD study. We will estimate 1990 to 2013 trends of prevalence, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life years DALYs for MRFs by gender, age group, and province. We will also quantify the uncertainty interval for the estimates of interest.

The findings of study could provide practical information regarding metabolic risk factors and their burden for better health policy to reduce the burden of diseases, and to plan cost-effective preventive strategies. The results also could be used for future complementary global, regional, national, and sub national studies.
