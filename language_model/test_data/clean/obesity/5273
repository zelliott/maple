The jejunoileal bypass is, of all the current therapeutic possibilities, the only permanent method for the successful treatment of a patient with hypothalamic obesity. Pre-operatively, it is advisable, however, to reduce the body weight by exclusive alimentation with Vivonex, in order to improve lung function and diminish the operation risks. Putting a smaller section of the bowel at rest will prevent major weight loss, as well as more severe complications. The disturbances of the calcium and potassium metabolism and of liver function, which frequently occur after jejunoileal bypass operation, were not observed, when on both sides of the immobilised bowel section a section of small bowel 23 to 38 cm long was maintained in normal function.
