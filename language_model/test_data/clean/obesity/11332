Obesity is a chronic inflammatory condition with numerous metabolic consequences to the organism, highlighting its influence on bone mass. Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify the role of visceral fat, leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin on bone mineral density in obese post-puberty adolescents girls, submitted to an interdisciplinary therapy. The study involved 20 post-puberty obese adolescent girls: 16±1.5 years of age, 98.9±15.8 kg (weight), 1.60±0.72 m (height) and 37.2±4.8 kg/m2 [body mass index (BMI)]. Anthropometric measurements, body composition, visceral fat, subcutaneous fat, bone mineral density and content were determined. Ghrelin, leptin and adiponectin were analyzed and the leptin/adiponectin ratio was calculated. Our findings showed a significant increase in adiponectin concentration and a reduction in body weight, BMI, total fat mass, visceral and subcutaneous fat. In addition, ghrelin (r2=-0.53; p=0.02) visceral fat (r2=-0.46, p=0.04) (r2 -0.66, p=0.001) and leptin/adiponectin ratio (r2 -0.56, p=0.01) were negative predictors for bone mineral density and content in obese adolescent girls, respectively. It provides a novel physiologically concept that may shed light on the etiology of osteoporosis and help to identify new therapeutic targets. However this should be confirmed in a large cohort study.
