Postoperative venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) affects approximately one in four general surgery patients who do not receive preventive measures. In addition to the risk of pulmonary embolism, which is often fatal, patients with VTED may develop long-term complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome or chronic pulmonary hypertension. In addition, postoperative VTED is usually asymptomatic or produces clinical manifestations that are attributed to other processes and consequently this complication is often unnoticed by the surgeon who performed the procedure. Thus, the most effective strategy consists of effective prevention of VTED using the most appropriate prophylactic measures against the patient's thromboembolic risk. There is sufficient evidence that VTED can be prevented by pharmacological methods, especially heparin and its derivatives and with mechanical methods such as support tights or intermittent pneumatic compression of the lower extremities. To reduce the incidence of VTED as far as possible, strategies have been proposed that include a combination of drugs and mechanical methods, new antithrombotic drugs, or prolonging the duration of prophylaxis in patients at very high risk, such as those who have undergone surgery for cancer. Another important aspect is the optimal moment to initiate prophylaxis with anticoagulant drugs with the aim of achieving an adequate equilibrium between antithrombotic efficacy and the risk of hemorrhagic complications. The present article reviews the available evidence to attempt to optimize prevention of VTED in general surgery and in some special groups, such as laparoscopic surgery, short-stay surgery and obesity.
