The heart is an insulin-responsive organ, and disorders of insulin action, such as diabetes and obesity, can have profound effects on cardiac performance. Insulin signaling influences numerous functions within the heart, such as metabolic substrate preference, cell size, and the response of the heart to ischemia and hypertrophy. Because the systemic consequences of altered insulin action can have significant but indirect effects on the heart, the generation of mice with altered expression of insulin receptors and key components of the insulin-signal transduction pathways in cardiomyocytes have led to interesting and occasionally surprising new insights into the regulation of cardiac biology by insulin.
