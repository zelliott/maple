Forty-three subjects were studied as for the relationship between anaerobic threshold (AT) and medical data including individual life style. Age, habit of exercise, and obesity are related to AT, showing a correlation coefficient of 0.533, 0.457 and 0.428, respectively. On the other hand, plasma lipid levels and alcohol are not so strongly related to AT, showing low correlation coefficient of 0.241 and 0.209 respectively. No correlation is found on the other factors such as FBS, Liver and blood pressure etc. Physical active life, commuting time, cumulative exercise hours in a month and work hours in a month are correlated to AT, showing correlation coefficient of 0.799, 0.734, 0.708 and 0.671, respectively, and even "more than once a month" frequency of exercise has affected AT. In conclusion, AT is a useful index for evaluating daily life activity and prescribing exercise regimen.
