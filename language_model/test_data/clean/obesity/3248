A longitudinal design was used to survey individual members of 22 couples about food choices, dietary intake and body weight around three months prior to cohabitation and again about three months after the moving-in date. Changes after cohabitation included an increase in shared meal occasions, increased likelihood of including alcohol at meal times and social support for dietary temptations (and restrictions). Body weight increased significantly in women (58.3+/-7.1 - 59.8+/-7.9 kg) and in men (76.7+/-12.0 - 78.4+/-12.5 kg). This life stage may be a missed opportunity for obesity prevention initiatives.
