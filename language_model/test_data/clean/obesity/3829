To explore the change of the prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in Shanghai Bao-Steel Company population.

We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of all employees undergoing health examination biennially from 1995 to 2002. Overweight and obesity were respectively diagnosed when body mass index (BMI)&> or = 24 kg/m2 but still less than 28 kg/m2 and&> or = 28 kg/ m2. SPSS 11.5 and SAS of statistical software were used for data analysis.

During the period studied, in 59 131 times of medical check-up, 27.1% participants received four times check-up, 26.6% thrice and 24.0% twice. After adjusted by sex and age, the total prevalence rates of overweight and obesity increased from 26.50% and 4.10% to 34.60% and 7.70% between 1995 to 1996 and 2001 to 2002, respectively. After adjusted by age, the prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in men increased from 28.20% and 4.20% to 37.90% and 8.40%; less significantly in women from 19.60% and 3.70% to 21.10% and 5.20%. Among men, the prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in men younger than 60 years old increased along with time. While in women, only the overweight prevalence in women younger than 30 years old and the obesity prevalence in women between 50 years old and 60 years old increased along with time, with unchanged prevalence in other age sub-group.

The prevalence rates of overweight and obesity have been growing rapidly in Bao-Steel Company employees, primarily in middle-aged and young men, who should be paid more attention.
