To examine the relationship between hyperinsulinemia and clusters of cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged hypertensive patients.

A population-based study.

Pieks채m채ki District Health Center, and the Community health Center of the city of Tampere, in central Finland.

Hypertensive men and women aged 36, 41, 46, and 51 years (n = 18) in the town of Pieks채m채ki, and a normotensive control population of 177 subjects aged 40 and 45 years in the city of Tampere.

Clusters of obesity (body mass index&> 30.0 kg/m2), abdominal adiposity (waist:hip ratio&> 1.00 for men and&> 0.88 for women), hypertriglyceridemia &> 1.70 mmol/l), a low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (&<1.0 mmol/l in men and &<1.20 mmol/l in women) and abnormal glucose metabolism (impaired glucose tolerance or noninsulin-dependent diabetes as defined by World Health Organization criteria) according to statistical quartiles of the fasting plasma insulin concentration.

Among the hypertensives, there was a 2.0- to 3.6-fold higher risk of having a clustering of the insulin-resistance associated cardiovascular risk factors compared with that of the normotensives. Among the hypertensive subjects in the highest quartile of fasting plasma insulin there was a six- to 12-fold increase in risk associated with having two or more insulin resistance-associated cardiovascular risk factors compared with the subjects in the lowest quartile. There was a positive correlation between a high number of ascertained risk factors and high levels of fasting plasma insulin.

In clinical practice, knowledge of the close relationship between risk-factor cluster status and fasting plasma insulin levels offers a tool to evaluate the occurrence of hyperinsulinemia in middle-aged hypertensive men and women.
