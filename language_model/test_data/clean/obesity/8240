To highlight recent developments relating control of food intake after surgery and the gut-brain axis by reviewing clinically relevant English language articles mainly from January 2011 to March 2013.

The gut-brain axis involves a number of complex interactions between hypothalamic nuclei and the gastrointestinal tract. In the postoperative period, release of cytokines and neuromodulators are involved in the control of food intake. Analogues of neuromodulators have been developed and tested in animal studies. The emerging field of metabolic surgery has allowed study of these mechanisms in greater detail.

The current epidemic of worldwide obesity demands further research into the mechanisms underlying control of food intake.
