To identify barriers encountered by case managers in hospitals, home care agencies, and nursing homes in the transition of the obese patient from the hospital to the community.

Exploratory descriptive design was used. Hospital case managers, nursing home administrators, and Medicare-certified home healthcare agency administrators were surveyed to identify barriers.

Hospital case managers in each licensed acute care hospital, directors of licensed nursing homes, and administrators of the Medicarecertified home healthcare agencies in 1 southern state were surveyed. The survey instrument was designed by the investigators based on variables identified in the literature or encountered within their practice. Instruments consisted of items related to the respondent's experience with barriers such as patient size, degree of patient independence, patient care requirements, staffing levels, and the need for assistive equipment, as well as items used to collect basic demographic information.

Both hospital case managers and nursing home directors reported as major barriers the equipment, the size of the patient, patient independence, and finances. Home care agency directors reported that the presence or absence of a competent caregiver was the major factor in the decision to accept or not accept an obese patient.

Transition of the obese patient presents major challenges. Further exploration is needed to identify the extent of problems and make policy recommendations toward a solution.
