Scientific research is constantly looking for new molecules to be used as functional ingredients to combat obesity. The aim of the present study was to analyse whether resveratrol and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) together could reduce body fat more efficiently than their separate administration. Thirty-six male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: controls rats (C), rats treated with resveratrol (RSV), rats treated with CLA (CLA) and rats treated with a combination of resveratrol and CLA (RSV+CLA). All rats were fed on an obesogenic diet. In RSV and RSV+CLA groups, the rats received 30 mg resveratrol/kg body weight/day. In CLA and RSV+CLA groups, an equimolecular mixture of trans-10,cis-12 and cis-9,trans-11 was added to the diet to reach 0.5% of the active isomer trans-10,cis-12. After 6 weeks of treatment, white adipose tissue from different anatomical locations was dissected and weighed. Serum triacylglycerols, total and HDL cholesterols, glucose, insulin, fructosamine and TNF-α were measured. A glucose tolerance test was also performed. Separately, resveratrol and CLA significantly reduced body fat but did not do so when combined: 20% in the RSV group and 18% in CLA group but 7% in the RSV+CLA group. Resveratrol reduced serum triacylglycerols. No differences were found among groups in serum cholesterol. Resveratrol, as well as the combination RSV+CLA, improved glycaemic control. These results demonstrate that the combination RSV+CLA reduces the effectiveness of each compound on body fat-lowering action, but it maintains the positive effect of resveratrol on glycaemic control. Consequently, this combination has no usefulness in obesity prevention.
