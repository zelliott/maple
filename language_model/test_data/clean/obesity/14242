Obesity and hypertension are two major inter-related cardiovascular risk factors. Decrease in adiposity is one of the most effective preventive measures not only in decreasing the overall cardiovascular risk but also the blood pressure. This cross-sectional study measured the effect of various measures of adiposity on blood pressure in normal healthy subjects of Pakistani origin. 400 normotensive subjects (247 males and 153 females) were included in this study. Along with data on co-morbid conditions, two blood pressure readings and several anthropometric measurements were recorded. Age and gender specific analysis was done. Following the WHO cutoffs for Asians, about 52% of our sample population was found to be overweight or obese. Age was not associated with blood pressure indices in males; however it was strongly associated with all blood pressure indices in females. Greater Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC) and Waist to Height Ratio (WHTR) were associated with higher Systolic and Diastolic Blood pressure. Increasing age was also associated with higher levels of BMI, WC and WHTR. Anthropometric variables however, were more strongly associated with blood pressure indices than age in this sample population. In conclusion, we found WC and WHTR to be strongly associated with blood pressure indices in normotensive Pakistani males.
