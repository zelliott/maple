To determine and compare the prevalence of obesity in adult patients undergoing surgery in an Australian and a United States teaching hospital.

Retrospective and prospective surveys.

Operating theatres at two university hospitals.

Patients scheduled for surgery during two consecutive months at Royal Perth Hospital (RPH) in Perth, Western Australia, and Montefiore-University Hospital (MUH) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, were studied. Age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, height, and weight data were collected from anaesthesia records. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated according to the formula: BMI = weight/height2 (kg m-2). Obesity was defined as BMI&> or = 30, morbid obesity as BMI&> or = 35, and overweight as BMI = 25-30.

Data from 1604 patients were analysed. Patients ranged in age from 15 to 93 years (mean +/- SD = 52.4 +/- 20). The RPH group was slightly older (RPH = 54 +/- 20 years; MUH = 50 +/- 19 years). Men from MUH were significantly taller (MUH = 176 +/- 8 cm; RPH = 174 +/- 9 cm) and MUH women were also significantly taller (MUH = 162 +/- 8 cm; RPH = 160 +/- 8 cm) than Australian patients. Mean weight was significantly different between hospitals (RPH = 73.5 +/- 16 kg; MUH = 77.9 +/- 20 kg). Mean BMI was also significantly different between hospitals (RPH = 25.8 +/- 5; MUH = 27.3 +/- 7). The proportion of obese men (RPH = 15.7%; MUH = 21.0%), obese women (RPH = 21.9%; MUH = 30.2%), morbidly obese men (RPH = 2.1%; MUH = 6.8%), and morbidly obese women (RPH = 7.8%; MUH = 15.1%) was significantly greater in the MUH study population. However, the proportion of overweight patients was similar between countries. A greater proportion of women were found to be obese or morbidly obese in both hospitals.

Obesity is more prevalent among surgical patients at MUH than at RPH, and is more common among women. The proportion of obesity seen in this survey is greater than results from general population surveys.
