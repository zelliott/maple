To determine the relationship between anthropometric variables with blood glucose and lipid concentrations in different stages of hypertension and evaluate the risk factors involved in progression of pre-hypertension stage in to clinical hypertension stage-1.

Case-control study.

National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease and General Practitioner's Clinics, Karachi, from 2005 to 2007.

The study was conducted on 276 participants aged 25-65 years and classified into four categories of control, prehypertension (pre-HTN), hypertension (HTN) stage I and II, according to 7th JNC report. Anthropometric measurements and blood chemistry were obtained. The relationship between obesity indices (Body Mass Index [BMI], Waist Circumference [WC], Waist Hip Ratio [WHpR], Waist Height Ratio [WHtR], Basal Metabolic Rate [BMR] and Cardiovascular Disease [CVD] risk factors [blood pressure, serum lipids and glucose levels]) were investigated. The analysis of variance and test of Pearson's coefficient correlation were applied to assess relationship of all the variables.

The mean WHR had significant correlation with both systolic and diastolic BP in all groups of HTN, as well as with blood glucose level in control and pre-HTN groups. BMI was positively correlated with cholesterol (r=0.29) and triglyceride (r=0.25) in HTN stage-1. Impaired and high blood glucose levels were found in pre-HTN group; all lipid parameters except triglycerides were higher in HTN stage I.

WHR was positively and independently related to occurrence of arterial hypertension. Elevated levels of WHR, BMI, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides were responsible for progression of pre-HTN stage in to HTN stage-1.
