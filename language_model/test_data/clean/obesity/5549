The short form (Glu9/Glu9) of the 12Glu9 deletion polymorphism of the alpha2B-adrenergic receptor gene was previously found to be associated with reduced basal metabolic rate in obese subjects. We investigated the effects of this polymorphism on changes in body weight in Finnish non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects during a 10 y follow-up.

Controlled 10 y follow-up study with baseline, 5 and 10 y examinations.

A total of 126 non-diabetic control subjects and 84 newly diagnosed, middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients from eastern Finland participated.

Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, oral glucose tolerance test, plasma insulin, plasma C-peptide and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction followed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

No significant differences were found in the prevalence of the 12Glu9 deletion polymorphism between non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects. The non-diabetic subjects with the Glu9/Glu9 genotype had a greater increase in their mean body weight during 5 y follow-up than the non-diabetic subjects with other genotypes (changes in body weight 0.4+/-5.7, -0.5+/-6.4 and 3.4+/-4.9% for the Glu12/Glu12, Glu12/Glu9 and Glu9/Glu9 genotypes, respectively, P=0.040 for the difference between the groups). Also, the trend for the increment of body weight was statistically significant in the non-diabetic subjects with the Glu9/Glu9 genotype (P=0.012). The 12Glu9 polymorphism was not cross-sectionally or longitudinally associated with body weight in type 2 diabetic subjects.

The genotype of two short alleles (Glu9/Glu9) was associated with an increase in body weight among non-diabetic subjects.
