Obesity as a chronic disease needs a global approach taking into account, not only usual anthropometrical measurements allowing to define severity and the type of obesity (BMI and waist circumference) but also others parameters to evaluate the patient's morbid conscience and his level of motivation towards a potential treatment. Obese patient's possible therapeutic course is developed in this article according to three important parameters: eating disorders, motivation and capacity of introspection. The aim is to give tools to the generalist to select patients needing a multidisciplinary follow up in a specialized centre and those who can be treated in the office.
