It has recently been recognized that increased central blood pressure is a predictor of cardiovascular disease. Central blood pressure is higher in obese individuals than in nonobese individuals. However, the effect of lifestyle modification on central systolic blood pressure in obese individuals is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether lifestyle modification decreases central blood pressure in overweight and obese men.

Thirty-nine overweight and obese men (age, 49±2 years; BMI, 30±1 kg/m) were recruited into our study. We measured central systolic blood pressure and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), an index of arterial stiffness, before and after a 12-week lifestyle modification that included aerobic exercise and dietary modification.

After the 12-week program, body mass, BMI, and waist circumstance decreased significantly. Central systolic blood pressure and baPWV were significantly decreased after the lifestyle modification in overweight and obese men. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the lifestyle modification-induced change in central systolic blood pressure and that in baPWV.

This study showed for the first time that lifestyle modification-induced weight loss decreases central systolic blood pressure in overweight and obese men. The decrease in central systolic blood pressure was associated with the reduction in arterial stiffness. These results suggest that lifestyle modification-induced reduction in arterial stiffness may contribute toward the decreased central systolic blood pressure in overweight and obese men.
