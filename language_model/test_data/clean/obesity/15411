To examine the influence of genetic factors on plasma leptin levels.

We measured plasma leptin levels, body mass index and body fat distribution in healthy young female monozygotic (n = 19) and dizygotic (n = 14) twins. The twin zygosity was verified by determination of short tandem repeat and amplified fragment length polymorphism systems. The genetic analysis included analysis of variance-based and maximum likelihood-based methods.

Plasma leptin levels were correlated significantly with body mass index (r = 0.59, P &<0.001), waist circumference (r = 0.54, P &<0.001) and hip circumference (r = 0.63, P &<0.001), but not with age (r = -0.17) or the waist:hip ratio (r = 0.02). The heritability estimates derived from intraclass correlations were significant for body mass index (P = 0.001), waist circumference (P = 0.004), hip circumference (P = 0.01) and plasma leptin levels (P = 0.005), but not for the waist:hip ratio (P = 0.22). In the maximum likelihood-based path analysis, heritability was estimated at 79% for body mass index and at 73% for plasma leptin levels. After adjustment for body mass index, the heritability estimate for leptin levels from the model-fitting approach was 55%.

Genetic factors are major determinants of plasma leptin levels in humans and may account for as much as half of the variance in leptin levels.
