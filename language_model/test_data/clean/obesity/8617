The aim of the paper is to present the relation between the manner of nutrition, its consequences for [people's] health and the contents of Polish health programmes at the turn of the century. As far as quantity and quality are concerned, the nutrition manners in Poland of the second half of the 20th century were far from the accepted norms and recommendations. Changes of feeding habits which came after 1991 had many different consequences. In the discussed period occurence of diseases dependent on malnutrition, such as: diseases of cardiovascular system and neoplastic diseases and frequent occurence of diabetes and obesity, was intensified. It should be also stated that the nutrition issues in health programmes implemented in Poland of that period at different levels were not given proper consideration. The study ends with a comment and conclusions answering the question posed in the title which point to an urgent necessity to take some measures in the discussed field.
