A group of obese children between 6-12 years of age is compared with Lavik's questionaire which serves as base for statistical analysis (critical ratio). Meaningful differences appear in several behavioral areas: aggressiveness, interest in sexuality, impaired interpersonal relations, increased anxiety and depressive tendencies. Important differences are to be noted also comparing obese boys and girls.
