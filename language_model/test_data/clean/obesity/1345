To determine if obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is independently associated with cardiovascular risk factors and health status in subjects with severe obesity.

Cross-sectional analysis of epidemiological data.

3034 participants in the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) Cohort. Two sub-groups with a high and low likelihood for OSA based on questionnaire data were analysed in detail.

General health questionnaires, anthropometric data including CT calibrated values for body fat distribution and lean body mass, blood pressure, fasting insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, uric acid, glucose.

Self-reported loud snoring and observed breathing pauses (high likelihood of OSA) was associated with increased frequency of WHO Grade 4 dyspnea, admissions to hospital with chest pain, myocardial infarction, blood pressure, fasting insulin, fasting triglyceride (women only), uric acid (women only) after adjustment for body fat distribution and other potential confounders.

OSA may be another medical disorder which contributes to morbidity in severe obesity and is associated with some of the components of the metabolic syndrome observed in the centrally obese.
