To investigate the additive effects of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) gene Ala55Val variation and ADR beta(3) gene Trp64Arg variation on the obesity in Chinese Han population.

The UCP2 gene Ala55Val variation and ADR beta(3) gene Trp64Arg variation were examined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism(PCR-RFLP) in 119 obese subject with mean BMI (27.9+/-2.98)kg/m(2) and in 177 control subjects with mean BMI(21.9+/-1.9)kg/m(2). The additive effects of the two gene mutations were analyzed.

(1) The frequency of ADR beta(3) gene Trp64Arg variation in obese subjects was not significantly different from that in control subjects. In control subjects, the Trp64Arg variation carriers had higher fasting glucose level and 2-hour-post-prandial glucose level than did non-carriers. (2) The frequency of homozygote of UCP2 gene Ala55Val variation in obese subjects was higher than that in the control subjects (OR=3.71, P=0.001). In control subjects the Ala55Val variation carriers had higher BMI. (3) When there was only UCP2 gene or ADR beta(3) gene mutation, the frequency of gene mutation in obese subjects was not significantly different from that in control subjects (&>0.05). But when there were simultaneously two gene mutations, the frequency of gene mutations was higher in obese subjects than in control subjects (OR=2.57, P=0.009). (4) The genotype carriers with Val/Val+ Trp/Arg were the greatest relation to obese obesity (OR=8.58, P=0.002).

The homozygote of UCP2 gene Ala55Val mutation increases the risk of obesity. Though the UCP2 gene mutation alone or the ADR beta(3) gene mutation alone is not associated with obesity, the possible additive effects of the two micro-genes increase the occurring of obesity.
