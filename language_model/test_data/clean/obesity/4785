Alterations in plasma leptin and adiponectin concentrations are associated with an adverse metabolic profile in obese children.

To simultaneously assess multiple factors with possible effects on plasma leptin and adiponectin concentrations in healthy, non-obese children.

We studied 170 healthy non-obese children (86 males, age 10+1.5 years), with available medical records from birth.

Plasma leptin and adiponectin concentrations were assessed by immunoassay. The ratio of current weight/birth weight (WBWR) was used as an index of children growth from birth. Children's intensity of physical activity and parental characteristics were also assessed.

Leptin was positively associated with WBWR (p&<.0001); parental smoking (analysis of variance, ANOVA; p-=0.03) and parental obesity (ANOVA; p&<.001) were negatively associated with breastfeeding (p&<.01) and children's access to exercise (p&<.0001). Adiponectin was negatively associated with WBWR (p&<.0001) and parental smoking (p=0.04), with an additive negative effect of parental smoking status and parental obesity on children's adiponectin levels (ANOVA; p=0.02).

Children's and parental factors are related and could possibly influence leptin and adiponectin concentrations in healthy non-obese children. Early preventive strategies that target both children and parents could improve the profile of adipocytokine in these children.
