The nutritional composition of diets and prevalence of obesity in 77 osteoarthritis patients were assessed biweekly for 12 weeks as part of a multidisciplinary approach to the management of osteoarthritis. Height was measured at the first visit, and weight was measured at each of the seven biweekly follow-up visits. A body mass index was calculated, based on height and weight, to determine obesity. Nutrient information was obtained by use of a 24-hour dietary recall and a food frequency questionnaire. Seventy-nine percent of the patients were obese. Obesity was positively related to pain from osteoarthritis and was more prevalent among these osteoarthritis patients than it is among the general geriatric population. Dietary intakes of vitamin D, folacin, vitamin B6, zinc, and pantothenic acid were below 80% of the recommended dietary allowance. Osteoarthritis patients may benefit from weight loss if they are obese and from eating more foods that supply the nutrients in which they are deficient. In addition to providing nutritional recommendations to avoid dietary deficiencies, a registered dietitian can assist in the multidisciplinary treatment of osteoarthritis by providing weight-control counseling and follow-up.
