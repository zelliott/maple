INTRODUCTION. Prevalences of overweight and obesity in students from different altitudinal zones of Jujuy are compared using the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) references, and the agreement among them. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Weight and height data from 15 541 students were grouped in highlands (HL) (â‰¥2500 MASL) and lowlands (LL) (&<500 MASL) and in two age groups (5-6.99 years old and 11-12.99 years old). Overweight and obesity prevalences were calculated according to the different references. The differences in outcome measures and prevalences were established using the ?2 test and the t test, and agreement among the criteria was calculated using the kappa index. RESULTS. Students from the HL had lower weight, height and body mass index (BMI) values (p&<0.05). Overweight and obesity prevalences compared to the WHO reference were higher, except for overweight in students of both sexes, from 11 to 12.99 years old, from the HL and the LL. Regardless of the references, gender and age, overweight and obesity prevalences were generally higher in the LL. Agreement between the IOTF and the CDC was good-very good, and agreement among them and the WHO was fair-moderate. CONCLUSIONS. Students from the HL had a lower overweight and obesity prevalence. The greatest agreement was observed between the IOTF and the CDC references.
