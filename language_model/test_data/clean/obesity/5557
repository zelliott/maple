Studies examining the foetal origins hypothesis suggest that small birth size may be a marker of foetal adaptations that programme future propensity to adult disease. We explore the hypothesis that birth size may relate to fat distribution in childhood and that fat distribution may be a link between birth size and adult disease.

To investigate the relationship between birth size and abdominal fat, blood pressure, lipids, insulin and insulin:glucose ratio in prepubertal children.

Cross-sectional study, based on a birth cohort of consecutive full-term births.

Two hundred and fifty-five (137 females) healthy, 7- and 8-y-old children.

Body composition and abdominal fat was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Lipid, glucose and insulin profiles were measured after an overnight fast and an automated BP monitor was used for blood pressure measurements.

There was a negative association between abdominal fat and birth weight s.d. score across a range of normal birth weights (beta=-0.18; 95% CI=-0.31 to -0.04, P=0.009) and a positive association with weight s.d. score at 7/8 y (beta=0.35; 95% CI=0.24 to 0.46, P&<.001). Children who were born with the lowest weight s.d. score and had the greatest weight s.d. score at 7/8 y had significantly more (P&<.001) abdominal fat, as a percentage of total fat (6.53+/-1.3%) than those who had the highest birth weight s.d. score and the lowest weight s.d. score at 7/8 y (4.14+/-0.5%). Similar results were seen if head circumference, but not ponderal index, was used as an indicator of birth size. Increased abdominal fat was associated with higher total cholesterol:HDL cholesterol, higher triglyceride concentration and increased diastolic blood pressure.

Birth weight independently predicted abdominal fat. Children with the highest amount of abdominal fat were those who tended to be born lighter and gained weight centiles. Increased abdominal fat was associated with precursor risk factors for ischaemic heart disease.
