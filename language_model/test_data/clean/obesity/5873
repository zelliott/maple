Living kidney donors were analyzed in different respects in our long-term study. There were important findings, which include the following: 1. Kidney donors live longer, most likely due to a selection of healthy individuals. 2. Remnant kidney function increases for a long period, both in younger and older donors. There is a subsequent decrease in function that is more apparent in the elderly. 3. Hypertension is a common long-term finding, suggesting the need for regular blood pressure check-ups after donation. 4. Altruistic reasons were the most common motives for donation. 5. Spouses seem to be the best choice, since quality of life improves for the entire family. 6. For the donor, the transplantation results are the most important. Not only immunosuppressive therapy, but also treating co-morbidity in the recipients is therefore important. 7. Personal experience supports the use of living donors.
