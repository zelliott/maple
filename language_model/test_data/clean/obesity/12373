Hypertension usually clusters with other cardiovascular risk factors; however, it has not been reported whether hypertension treatment has an impact on the awareness and treatment of other cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia.

To analyze the effect of hypertension treatment on the management of other risk factors in a Korean population.

The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) was a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey in which a stratified multistage sampling design was used. The most recent KNHANES survey, conducted in 2008, was analyzed.

A total of 6547 adults (aged â‰¥20 years) were included in the analysis. Mean (SD) age was 49.1 (16.3) years, and 42.0% of the participants were male. The prevalence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity was 26.9%, 10.5%, 9.5%, and 31.2%, respectively. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity was significantly higher in the hypertensive group compared with normotensive participants (P &<0.001). Furthermore, clustering of cardiovascular risk factors was observed in the patients with hypertension. Treatment of hypertension was significantly associated with a higher awareness and treatment of diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia, especially in moderate- to high-risk patients. Moreover, the total cholesterol concentration and glycosylated hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in the treated hypertensive patients (P &<0.001 for total cholesterol and P = 0.003 for glycosylated hemoglobin).

Hypertension is a prevalent risk factor and is commonly associated with other cardiovascular risk factors. In the Korean population, treatment of hypertension can reduce global risk not only by lowering blood pressure but also by improving the control of other risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia.
