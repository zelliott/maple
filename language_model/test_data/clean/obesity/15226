The effect of phenobarbital (PB) and beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF) on acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity was evaluated in obese and lean Zucker rats. In addition, the consequences of APAP overdose on hepatic CYP2B1/2B2 enzyme activities following PB treatment were assessed. A single oral dose of APAP 3 g/kg (total body weight) was administered to both littermates 24 hr after the last dose of PB or beta-NF. Histologic evidence of hepatocellular necrosis and serum hepatic aminotransferase enzymes 48 hr after APAP administration was utilized to evaluate hepatic damage. Hepatic microsomal total cytochrome P450 concentrations, alkoxyresorufin O-dealkylase activities, and 16 beta-testosterone hydroxylase activities were determined to evaluate the effect of APAP overdose on cytochrome P450 enzyme-substrate activities in the presence and absence of PB treatment. APAP overdose produced lower hepatotoxicity in the obese Zucker rat compared to lean controls. A similar trend was observed in animals treated with PB prior to APAP administration. In contrast, beta-NF treatment produced potentiation of APAP toxicity and/or death of both obese and lean Zucker rats. Generally, APAP overdose produced reduction of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme-substrate activities. However, obese Zucker rats retained a higher percentage of their pre-APAP-treated enzyme activities which is consistent with the observation that obese Zucker rats are less affected by the hepatotoxic effects of APAP overdosage.
