Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-dependent extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is a key feature in cardiometabolic syndrome-associated adipogenesis and atherosclerosis. Activation of membrane-tethered (MT) 1-MMP depends on furin (PCSK3). However, the regulation and function of the natural furin-inhibitor serpinB8 and thus furin/MT1-MMP-activity in obesity-related tissue inflammation/remodeling is unknown. Here we aimed to determine the role of serpinB8/furin in obesity-associated chronic inflammation.

Monocyte â†’ macrophage transformation was characterized by decreases in serpinB8 and increases in furin/MT1-MMP. Rescue of serpinB8 by protein overexpression inhibited furin-dependent pro-MT1-MMP activation in macrophages, supporting its role as a furin-inhibitor. Obese white adipose tissue-facilitated macrophage migration was inhibited by furin- and MMP-inhibition, stressing the importance of the furin-MMP axis in fat tissue inflammation/remodeling. Monocytes from obese patients (body mass index (BMI)&>30kg/m(2)) had higher furin, MT1-MMP, and resistin gene expression compared to normal weight individuals (BMI&<5kg/m(2)) with significant correlations of BMI/furin and furin/MT1-MMP. In vitro, the adipocytokine resistin induced furin and MT1-MMP in mononuclear cells (MNCs), while MCP-1 had no effect.

Acquisition of the inflammatory macrophage phenotype is characterized by an imbalance in serpinB8/furin, leading to MT1-MMP activation, thereby enhancing migration. Increases in MT1-MMP and furin are present in MNCs from obese patients. Dissecting the regulation of furin and its inhibitor serpinB8 should facilitate targeting inflammation/remodeling in cardiometabolic diseases.
