The aim of this paper was to study the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), its changes with age, and its association with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), indicators of obesity, dyslipemia, insulin resistance and inflammation on a random population sample. BP, weight, size and waist circumference (WC) were recorded at home. Fasting morning blood samples were analysed. The eGFR was calculated with MDRD (eGFR-MDRD), Cockroft-Gault (eGFR-CG) adjusted to 1.73 m2 and reciprocal of serum creatinine (100/serum cretinine). A total of 1016 individuals, 722 females (41.97 +/- 0.66 years old) and 294 males (42.06 +/- 0.99 years old), completed the laboratory tests. The mean of 100/Scr was 115.13 +/- 0.60 (dl/mg), the mean eGFR-CG was 98.48 +/- 0.82 ml/min/1.73 m2; the mean eGFR-MDRD was 85.15 +/- 0.58 ml/min/1.73 m2. The eGFR-MDRD decreased with age and with the number of risk factors in both sexes. The eGFR-MDRD &<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 adjusted prevalence was 6.2 per 100 inhabitants (CI 95%, 4.7-7.7), 3.6 (CI 95%, 1.5-5.7) in males and 8.6 (CI 95%, 6.6-10.6) in females. The bivariate analysis showed that the eGFR-MDRD correlates inversely with age, SBP, DBP WC, BMI, serum glucose, serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, serum triglycerides, serum uric acid and, in males, with C-reactive-protein. There was no correlation with either insulinemia or HOMA. The mean eGFR value, its association with cardiovascular risk factors and the prevalence of eGFR &<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 found in a rural population of Argentina are similar to those found in other parts of the world.
