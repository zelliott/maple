To study the potential role of the ob gene pathway in childhood obesity, we have investigated leptin mRNA levels in s.c. adipose tissue obtained from nonobese prepubertal children (n = 20), obese nonsyndromal children (n = 6), and children with Prader-Willi syndrome (n = 6) by in situ hybridization histochemistry. We have also investigated the fasting serum leptin levels in such children. Compared with nonobese children, leptin mRNA expression was higher both in children with Prader-Willi syndrome and in children with nonsyndromal obesity (p &<0.01). Furthermore, the serum leptin levels were also significantly higher in both children with Prader-Willi syndrome and nonsyndromal obesity compared with the nonobese children (p &<0.001). However, no significant differences in adipose tissue leptin mRNA or serum leptin levels were observed between children with Prader-Willi syndrome and nonsyndromal obese children. As expected both fasting serum leptin levels and leptin mRNA expression levels correlated to body mass index (rs = 0.80 and 0.73, respectively, p &<0.005). No difference in leptin expression between Prader-Willi syndrome and nonsyndromal childhood obesity could be revealed in the present study. However, differences in the hypothalamic response to leptin between the two forms of obesity cannot be excluded.
