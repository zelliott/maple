The purpose of this study was to 1) investigate lifetime weight changes in community dwelling old-old, those age 80 or older; 2) explore reasons for weight changes from their personal perspective and 3) examine ways the old-old feel they can successfully lose weight. A cross sectional design was used for this qualitative study.

One county of a southeastern U.S. state.

Nine community dwelling old-old.

Content analysis of transcripts was used to examine the interviews.

All of the old-old interviewed had reached their maximum weight after the age of 65. Average lifetime weight gain was 73 pounds. All wanted to lose weight and found ways to incorporate small changes in their everyday lives.

With increasing life expectancy among older adults, health promotion targeting weight control needs to include the old-old.
