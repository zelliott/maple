The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial has conclusively established that intensive control of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in persons aged 19 to 26 years (almost exclusively white, normotensive, nondyslipidemic, of normal weight, and insulin sensitive) reduces by +/- 50% the likelihood of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. In contrast, persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are older, overweight, hypertensive, dyslipidemic, and insulin resistant. Glycemia is only one of their risk factors, and they die of macrovascular disease. Review of studies supporting glycemic control versus risk factor reduction as management of NIDDM suggests a clear need to address risk factors besides glycemic control for successful prevention of complications of NIDDM. A new schematic proposal for intervention based upon risk factor reduction is presented.
