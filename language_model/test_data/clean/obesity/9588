The urinary excretion of oestrone (E1), oestradiol (E2) and oestriol (E2) was measured in 42 obese post-menopausal women before and 6-12 mth after their participation in a weight reduction programme. The method of inducing weight loss was based on modification of eating behaviour without specific changes in dietary composition. Urinary oestrogen, as a ratio to creatinine, were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay after purification of the specific oestrogen fraction. Before weight reduction efforts, there is a significant correlation among E1, weight and the Quetelet-index and between E3 and the Quetelet-index. These correlations have disappeared after weight reduction. There is a significant positive correlation between changes in body-weight and changes in the excretion of E1, E3 and total oestrogens. There was no significant change in the so-called oestrogen ratio (E1 + E2/E3) in relation to change in body weight. With respect to the statistical association between endometrial cancer, breast cancer and overweight, our data give support to the concept that intervention programmes on weight reduction may influence both the incidence and the prognosis of these two diseases.
