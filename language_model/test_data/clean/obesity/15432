To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for regulating plasma lipid concentration associated with obesity, linkage analysis was carried out on the 190 F2 progeny of a cross between C57BL/6J female and KK-Ay (Ay allele at the agouti locus congenic) male. In F2 a/a (agouti locus genotype) mice, two QTLs were identified on chromosome 1 and a QTL on chromosome 3 for total-cholesterol. A QTL for HDL-cholesterol was identified on chromosome 1 and a QTL for NEFA on chromosome 9. In F2 Ay/a mice, two QTLs for HDL-cholesterol were found on chromosome 1. Loci for other lipids with suggestive linkage were also identified. In both F2 mice, one QTL on chromosome 1 for total- and HDL-cholesterol was mapped near D1Mit150, in the vicinity of the apolipoprotein A-II (Apoa2) locus. Seven nucleotide substitutions out of 309 nucleotide apolipoprotein A-II cDNA sequences were identified between KK and C57BL/6J. The Ay allele may be an indication of the plasma lipid levels, but its influence was less apparent than in the case of weight control. The loci for lipids were not on identical chromosomes with those previously identified for obesity, suggesting that hyperlipidemia in KK does not coincidentally occur with obesity.
