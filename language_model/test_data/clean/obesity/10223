The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a submaximal aerobic exercise bout on adiponectin and resistin levels as well as insulin sensitivity, until 48 h post-exercise in healthy overweight males. Nine subjects performed an exercise bout at an intensity corresponding to approximately 65% of their maximal oxygen consumption for 45 min. Adiponectin, resistin, cortisol, insulin, glucose and insulin sensitivity were measured prior to exercise, immediately after exercise as well as 24 and 48 h after exercise. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA while Pearson's correlations were performed to identify possible relationship among the assessed variables. There were no significant differences for adiponectin (microg ml(-1)) [pre, 3.61(0.73); post, 3.15(0.43); 24 h, 3.15(0.81); 48 h, 3.37(0.76)] or resistin (ng ml(-1)) [pre, 0.19(0.03); post, 0.13(0.03); 24 h, 0.23(0.04); 48 h, 0.23(0.03)] across time. Insulin sensitivity increased and insulin concentration decreased significantly only immediately after exercise. Furthermore, no significant correlations were observed among the variables assessed except for the expected between insulin level and insulin sensitivity. These results indicate that a submaximal aerobic workout does not result in significant changes in adiponectin and resistin up to 48 h post-exercise. Furthermore, it appears that adiponectin or resistin is not associated with insulin sensitivity.
