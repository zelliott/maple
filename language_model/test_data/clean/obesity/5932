In this study, the histological definition of endometrial cancer precursor (ECP) lesions is discussed and a comparison is made of clinical and histological parameters of ECP patients and endometrial cancer (EC) patients. ECP lesions were divided in 3 types: adenomatous hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia and in situ adenocarcinoma. The following parameters were analyzed: age, menopausal status, gynecological and extragynecological familiar cancer incidence, other cancers in the proband, diabetes, obesity, primary infertility, fertility and previous estrogen therapy. Results give support to the hypothesis of the existence of a common biological pathway between ECP and EC. The high frequency of coexistence of both types of lesions in hysterectomy specimens from EC patients studied by step sections adds a confirmatory supporting argument. Measures for primary and secondary prevention of these lesions are proposed.
