We assessed the association of lifestyle factors with white blood cell (WBC) count in 3681 Japanese male office workers aged 35-59 years.

The WBC count differed significantly across lifestyle factors (overall obesity, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, eating breakfast, nutritional balance, physical exercise and hours of work). From multiple linear regression analyses, overall obesity, alcohol intake, cigarette smoking, nutritional balance and hours of work remained as statistically significant factors associated with WBC count. The WBC count increment showed a positive dose-response relationship with poor lifestyle factors regarding overall obesity, cigarette smoking and nutritional balance. On the other hand, the WBC count increment showed a negative dose-response relationship with alcohol intake and hours of work.

These data indicate that lifestyle factors may exert an important effect on WBC count.
