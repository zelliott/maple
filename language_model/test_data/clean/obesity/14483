This study describes the nutritional status and associated factors among elderly Brazilians.

Data from "Pesquisa sobre Padr√µes de Vida" (PPV- Life Pattern Research), conducted by the "Brazilian Geographic and Statistics Institute" in 1996/1997 were used. Body Mass Index (BMI) was applied to classify nutritional status and is the response variable of this study. Multivariate analysis with polytomous logistic regression was used.

Prevalence of underweight was 5.7%, eutrophy 50.4%, overweight 32.3% and obesity 11.6%. Women have a 1.32 greater chance of overweight (CI 95% 0.99-1.74; p=0.05) and 4.11 of obesity (CI 95% 2.57-6.57; p&<.01). Higher age increased risk of underweight and diminished that of overweight and obesity. Elderly with a lower income have a higher risk of underweight and those with a greater income have higher risk of overweight and obesity. Elderly with a chronic disease have a higher risk of changes in the nutritional status.

Results show a higher prevalence of overweight and eutrophy and a lower prevalence of obesity and underweight. Characteristics associated with nutritional status other than eutrophy are: gender, schooling, income, chronic health problem and age.
