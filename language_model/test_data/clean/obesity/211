Although social behavior has been studied by sociologists, the absence of references to such work is strikingly apparent in many discussions of the behavioral aspects of obesity. This paper presents some sociologic notions and research that can contribute to the health care professional's understanding of the problems of obesity and its treatment possibilities. One such approach could well be the use of weight control programs predicated on rearranging the social environment in which obese people live and eat.
