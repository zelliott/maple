Develop a dose-response curve for the effect of intranasal lidocaine on food intake.

Healthy obese subjects had food intake, ratings of hunger, desire to eat, craving and fullness measured at lunch after an overnight fast. Four treatments were given as nose drops (0.5-0.6 ml per nostril) 5 min before the meal in a double-blind manner with a four period crossover design including a 7-day washout between periods. The treatments were saline, 2.5, 10 and 25 mg lidocaine per nostril. The order of administration was randomly assigned to each subject. Electrocardiograms, vital signs, chemistry panels, complete blood counts (CBC) and nasal inspections were carried out before and after each dose.

Forty-seven subjects were screened, 34 were randomized and 20 subjects completed all four study periods in the trial. The subjects were 39+/-12.5 (s.d) years of age, had a weight of 91+/-13.0 kg, a height of 167+/-10.3 cm, 56% were women, 47% were African-American and 53% were Caucasian.

Food intake, rating of hunger, desire to eat, craving and fullness are measures of efficacy. Adverse events, electrocardiograms, vital signs, chemistry panels, nasal inspections, CBC and physical exams are measures of safety.

The mean reduction in food intake vs saline control in the 20 subjects completing all four study periods was 3.3+/-7% (s.d), 4.2+/-8.5% and 7.4+/-7.3% in the 2.5 mg, 10 and 25 mg per nostril groups, respectively (P=NS). Hunger and desire to eat in subjects who completed at least one study period decreased dose dependently (P&<.03, at the 25 mg per nostril dose). There were no clinically significant changes in safety measures, electrocardiograms, vital signs, chemistry panels, CBC or nasal inspections.

Intranasal lidocaine reduced hunger and the desire to eat, but this did not translate into a significant reduction in food intake suggesting that intranasal lidocaine will not have value in treating obesity.
