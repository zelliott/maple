In a short-term (eight days) double-blind crossover study involving 10 obese patients, the effects of dexfenfluramine on glucose and lipid metabolism were examined. The protocol comprised whole body in vivo measurements (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp in combination with indirect calorimetry) and in vitro studies of isolated adipocytes (lipolysis and glucose transport). All study participants were weight stable during the study period (103.1 +/- 3.2, placebo vs 103.3 +/- 3.1 kg, dexfenfluramine, NS). The following parameters were significantly reduced after dexfenfluramine treatment: fasting levels of plasma glucose (6.2 +/- 0.2 vs 5.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, p &<0.01), serum insulin (168.0 +/- 14.5 vs 138.9 +/- 7.9 pmol/l, p &<0.05), serum C-peptide (0.68 +/- 0.03 vs 0.58 +/- 0.02 nmol/l, p &<0.05) and total serum cholesterol (6.07 +/- 0.41 vs 5.48 +/- 0.38 mmol/l, p &<0.01). In the basal state glucose oxidation rate was significantly reduced by 36% (p &<0.001), whereas non-oxidative glucose disposal was significantly increased by 41% (p &<0.01), following dexfenfluramine treatment. Insulin-stimulated (2 mU.kg-1 x min-1) glucose disposal rate tended to be increased (18%, p = 0.10) after dexfenfluramine. In conclusion, dexfenfluramine possesses beneficial regulatory effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in non-diabetic obese patients, independently of weight loss.
