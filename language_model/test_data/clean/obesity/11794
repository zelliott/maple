The ratio of two families of inositol phosphoglycans (IPG-A:IPG-P), insulin second messengers, is raised in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and obesity. It is shown here that IPG A type inhibits leptin release from adipocytes, contrasting with the action of insulin (stimulation) and IPG P type (no effect). The significance of inhibitory effects of IPG A type on leptin release is important in relation to obesity and NIDDM in view of the action of leptin in promoting Lep expression and fat oxidation in muscle, in addition to its effects on satiety. Energy conservation and oxidation via interorgan regulation by leptin could be compromised by a rise in the IPG-A:IPG-P ratio.
