Current thinking concerning the possible role off neurotensin in disease is reviewed. The type of approach used in this article is to summarize the results of studies concerning release of neurotensin-like immunoreactivity and to describe the effects of neurotensin which may be of physiological significance such as changes in gastrointestinal motility from a fasting to a fed type in gastric acid secretion and vasoconstriction in adipose tissue. The possible involvement of neurotensin in motility disturbances, duodenal ulcer and obesity has also been discussed. In addition, studies concerning the role of neurotensin in endocrine tumours are presented.
