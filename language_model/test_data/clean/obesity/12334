Previous studies showed that leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice develop obesity and impaired ventilatory responses to CO(2) (V(E) - CO(2)). In this study, we examined if leptin replacement improves chemorespiratory responses to hypercapnia (7 % CO(2)) in ob/ob mice and if these effects were due to changes in body weight or to the direct effects of leptin in the central nervous system (CNS). V(E) - CO(2) was measured via plethysmography in obese leptin-deficient- (ob/ob) and wild-type- (WT) mice before and after leptin (10 μg/2 μl day) or vehicle (phosphate buffer solution) were microinjected into the fourth ventricle for four consecutive days. Although baseline V(E) was similar between groups, obese ob/ob mice exhibited attenuated V(E) - CO(2) compared to WT mice (134 ± 9 versus 196 ± 10 ml min(-1)). Fourth ventricle leptin treatment in obese ob/ob mice significantly improved V(E) - CO(2) (from 131 ± 15 to 197 ± 10 ml min(-1)) by increasing tidal volume (from 0.38 ± 0.03 to 0.55 ± 0.02 ml, vehicle and leptin, respectively). Subcutaneous leptin administration at the same dose administered centrally did not change V(E) - CO(2) in ob/ob mice. Central leptin treatment in WT had no effect on V(E) - CO(2). Since the fourth ventricle leptin treatment decreased body weight in ob/ob mice, we also examined V(E) - CO(2) in lean pair-weighted ob/ob mice and found it to be impaired compared to WT mice. Thus, leptin deficiency, rather than obesity, is the main cause of impaired V(E) - CO(2) in ob/ob mice and leptin appears to play an important role in regulating chemorespiratory response by its direct actions on the CNS.
