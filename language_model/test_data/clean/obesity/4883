Limited research is available on the possible differences in the cardiovascular risk factors of total homocysteine (tHcy), dietary energy, and lipids among adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), type 2 DM, or healthy controls. This study's primary aim was to compare the dietary energy and the intake of macronutrients and micronutrients of folate, and vitamins B6 and B12, as well as lipids and tHcy for adolescents with type 1 DM, type 2 DM, and healthy non-DM controls.

This secondary analysis of the merging of 2 datasets included the following adolescents: 50 with type 1 DM, 14 with type 2 DM, and 53 controls. Mean ages for those with type 1 versus type 2 DM were 15.2 +/- 1.9 versus 16.1 +/- 1.9 years, respectively. Mean age for the controls was 16.5 +/- 1.0 years. Variables included fasting tHcy and lipids, and 24-hour dietary recalls for macronutrients and micronutrients. Hemoglobin A1c was obtained for those with DM. Statistical analyses included one-way analyses of variance, Pearson correlations, and stepwise regression.

Adolescents with type 1 DM had the lowest tHcy values (P &<05), which were reflective of the limited extant research with this population. Lipid profiles and dietary energy did not differ significantly among the 3 groups. Hemoglobin A1c was related to total cholesterol and triglycerides in those with type 1 DM, confirming the importance of promoting better metabolic control in lipid management for these youth. Future research should continue to explore the validity of tHcy and lipids as predictors of CV risks for youth with type 1 and type 2 DM.
