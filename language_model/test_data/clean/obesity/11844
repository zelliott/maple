A growing public health concern over the increasing prevalence of adolescent overweight and obesity and 2007 Expert Committee recommendations on child and adolescent overweight and obesity prompted a performance improvement project at 9 school-based health centers (SBHCs) in Delaware. Body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure measurements were assessed for 1548 students during the 2008-2009 school year. Students identified as having BMI or blood pressure readings out of the normal range were offered nutritional and/or medical services at the center and referred to their primary care physicians, when necessary, for further medical follow-up. Four of the centers additionally assessed their students for needed immunizations, availability of medical insurance, access to a medical home, and psychosocial risk factors. Students identified as in need of additional services were given appropriate referrals. Follow-up data are now being collected for students identified to be at risk.
