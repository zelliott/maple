The aim of this study was to assess a possible correlation between obesity and lower urinary tract symptoms in a selected population of women. All the subjects referred for lower urinary tract complaints over a 2-year period received a questionnaire and a frequency/volume chart. The patient population was divided into normal or low weight (BMI &<or = 29) and high weight and obese (BMI&> or = 30). The main outcome measures were lower urinary tract symptoms (infections, frequency, urgency, voiding difficulty, dysuria, nocturia and incontinence). The statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test, chi2 test and odds ratios; 694 women received the questionnaire and 553 were evaluated (79.7% response). Overall, 229 (42.4%) were of low or normal BMI; 311 (57.5%) had a high or obese BMI. After adjusting for prior bladder surgery, any surgery, history of medical problems and physical inactivity, only the association between BMI and incontinence remained statistically significant (adjusted OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.18-3.19).
