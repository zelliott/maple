Thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1), an antiangiogenic factor and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β activity regulator, has been recently recognized as an adipokine that correlates with obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance processes. In the present study, epididymal adipocytes of rats that were fed a chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 50 days were isolated and incubated (24-72 h) in low (5.6 mM) or high (HG; 25 mM) glucose, in the presence or absence of 1.6 nM insulin. Rats fed the HF diet showed an established obesity state. Serum TSP-1 levels and TSP-1 mRNA basal expression of adipocytes from HFD rats were higher than those from controls. Adipocytes from HFD animals presented an insulin resistance state, as suggested by the lower insulin-stimulated glucose uptake as compared to controls. TSP-1 expression in culture was higher in adipocytes from obese animals at 24 h, but when the adipocytes were treated with HG, these expression levels dropped dramatically. Later at 72 h, TSP-1 expression was lower in adipocytes from HFD rats, and no effects of the other treatments were observed. Surprisingly, the secretion levels of this protein at 72 h were increased significantly by the HG treatment in both types of adipocytes, although they were even higher in adipocytes from obese animals. Finally, cell viability was significantly reduced by HG treatment in both types of adipocytes. In summary, TSP-1 expression/secretion was modulated in an in vitro model of insulin-resistant adipocytes. The difference between expression and secretion patterns suggests a posttranscriptional regulation. The present study confirms that TPS-1 is closely associated with obesity-related mechanisms.
