Studies assessing the relationship of BMI and BF with cardiometabolic (CM) risks in Indian children are scarce.

To assess the occurrence of cardiometabolic risk factors in Indian children and adolescents in relation to BMI and body fat and to study their association with body fat distribution.

286 children and adolescents (mean age 11.2 Â± 2.6 years, 139 boys) were recruited from routine health checks and schools. Anthropometry and blood pressure were recorded, total body fat (BF) and fat distribution (android and gynoid) were measured by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry. Fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile and insulin were also measured.

When the study cohort was divided as per their BMI and biochemical cardiometabolic risk factors, 8% children had normal BMI with abnormal biochemical parameters while 40% children had abnormal BMI but normal biochemical parameters.

There are normal weight children with cardiometabolic risks. There was an increase in the occurrence of cardiometabolic risk factors with increased android distribution of fat (p-value &<0.05).
