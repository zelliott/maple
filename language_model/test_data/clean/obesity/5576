Current guidelines in the treatment of arterial hypertension do not recommend differential treatment of obesity-associated hypertension. Since optimal blood pressure control in most obese hypertensives requires a combination of blood pressure-lowering substances, careful consideration of the choice of treatment is of particular importance. On the basis of their favorable metabolic properties, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and low-dose diuretics, should be preferentially employed in the obese. Beta-blockers should not be given to young obese patients with uncomplicated hypertension. Before definitive pronouncements on what constitutes optimal treatment of obese patients can be made, the results of studies looking at hard end points must be available.
