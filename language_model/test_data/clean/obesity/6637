The prevalence of obesity is on the increase worldwide including in many developing countries. There is no report on the magnitude of obesity among adults in Maiduguri, a major city in northeastern Nigeria.

We selected a sample of 1650 men and women aged 15 years and above resident in Gwange ward in Maiduguri metropolitan council using a multistage sampling technique. Height, weight, waist (WC) and hip circumferences w measured. Body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were calculated. Data were analyzed using SPSS version13. The ethics committee of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital approved the study and consent was sought individually from the participants before being enlisted.

The mean (SD) age of the respondents was 36.2 (14.4) years, with a range of 15 to 70 years. The mean (SD) ages of the males and females were 34.9 4.3) and 38.9 (14.0) years, respectively, (p &<0.001). The overall crude prevalence rates of overweight and obesity were 27.1% and 17.1%, respectively. In men, 40.6% were either overweight or obese, while in women 51.9% were either overweight or obese. We observed the highest prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in the middle age group.
