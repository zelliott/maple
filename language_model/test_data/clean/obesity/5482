The paper is concerned with certain peculiar relationships between tumor and body in 150 endometrial carcinoma patients of 45 years or younger. Metabolic and generative disorders were detected in 70%. Such disturbances as chronic anovulation (80%). infertility and/or ovarian polycystosis (32%) were identified. They developed prior to neoplastic alterations had taken place and promoted various hyperplastic processes in the endometrium which are generally detectable in 70%. The most frequent localization of endometrial carcinoma was tubular angle area (76.9%). Lack of symptoms in some patients was due to the absence of morphological evidence on invasion into myometrial stroma (68.7%). We identified typical predisposition to endometrial carcinoma as well as an optimal sequence of cytological, ultrasound, endoscopic and morphological procedures which might help detect the disease in younger women at an early stage.
