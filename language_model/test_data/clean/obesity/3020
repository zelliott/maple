Preparative ultracentrifugal and electrophoretic analysis of serum lipoproteins was performed in 30-70-year-old healthy, fasting males (N = 80) and females (N = 77), randomly selected from the Uppsala region, Sweden. The concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides in total serum and in VLDL,LDL and HDL lipoprotein classes are reported. Total serum, VLDL and LDL triglycerides and cholesterol concentrations increased with age, while HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations did not vary with age. Overweight persons had higher total serum triglyceride, higher VLDL cholesterol and triglyceride and lower HDL cholesterol levels. The upper 90% population limit values for non-overweight males/females were: total triglycerides (mmol/l) 2.5/2.0, total cholesterol (mg/100 ml) 298/300, VLDL triglyceride 1.80/1.05, VLDL-cholesterol 32/33, LDL triglyceride 0.69/0.69, LDL cholesterol 210/218, HDL triglyceride 0.32/0.34 and HDL-cholesterol 69/93. The 2 major differences between males and females were that females had lower VLDL but higher HDL concentrations. For VLDL there was a very strong and for LDL a moderately strong positive correlation between cholesterol and triglyceride contents. In HDL however, the mearsured amounts of cholesterol and triglycerides did not correlate at all. Sinking pre-beta lipoproteins was found in about 25% of cases and a second pre-beta band floating at d 1.006, late pre-beta, was found in 35% of male and 25% of female subjects. Subjects with sinking pre-beta lipoprotein did not differ from other subjects with regard to the concentration of cholesterol and triglycerides in the 3 lipoprotein classes. Males, but not females, with the late pre-beta (LPB), had an increased amount of cholesterol in VLDL and a raised cholesterol-triglyceride ratio in this lipoprotein class. Also the LDL triglyceride level was increased in males with the late pre-beta lipoprotein.
