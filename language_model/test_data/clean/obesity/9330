Initial studies showed that the anorexigenic peptide oxytocin (OT) regulates gastric motility, responds to stomach distention and to elevated osmolality, and blocks consumption of toxic foods. Most recently, it has been proposed to act as a mediator of general and carbohydrate-specific satiety and regulator of body weight. In the current review, we discuss the function of OT as a homeostatic inhibitor of consumption, capable of mitigating multiple aspects of ingestive behavior and energy metabolism.
