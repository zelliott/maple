Leptin, a protein hormone secreted by adipocytes, plays an important role in energy homeostasis and regulation of body composition. We previously observed that acute feed restriction resulted in a rapid decline in concentrations of leptin in obese pony mares. This acute response prompted us to characterize the temporal changes in concentrations of leptin, GH, and insulin in obese pony mares during the transition between fed and feed-restricted conditions. Nine obese pony mares of mixed breed, previously maintained on fescue pasture, were randomly allotted to 2 groups. Treatments consisted of a 48-h feed restriction, a 48-h refeeding, and a 24-h feed restriction (RFR; n = 4), or 48 h of alfalfa hay ad libitum, a 48-h feed restriction, and a 24-h refeeding (FRF; n = 5). Blood samples were taken every 15 min during restriction and feeding transitions (0600 to 1400 on d 2 and 4), and every 30 min thereafter until 0830 of the following days (d 3 and 5). In the FRF treatment, plasma concentrations of leptin declined precipitously 6 h after the removal of feed (sample by treatment interaction; P &<0.01), and remained low and unresponsive to refeeding. Similarly, in the RFR group, plasma concentrations of leptin were initially low, and did not respond to feeding during the second (refeeding) sampling period. After feed restriction in each of the 2 treatment sequences, plasma insulin decreased and GH mean concentration, pulse frequency, pulse amplitude, and area under the curve increased (P &<0.05). Refeeding reversed these effects on insulin and GH. These data provide evidence that peripheral concentrations of insulin and GH are dynamically responsive to feed removal (decrease in insulin; increase in GH) and replacement (increase in insulin; decrease in GH), whereas leptin decreases in response to feed restriction but is slow to recover from a transient nutritional insult.
