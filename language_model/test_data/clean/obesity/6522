Since little descriptive data for field athletes is available, the anthropometric measurement, dietary intake and plasma lipid levels of 22 male and 15 female field athletes (throwers) are reported. Percentage body fat was calculated by using four skinfold thicknesses. Using this measurement as criterion, 53% of the females were obese. Percentage body fat and body mass index showed a positive correlation with total plasma cholesterol and plasma triacyglycerol and a negative correlation with percentage HDL cholesterol for males and females. Five of the males and three of the females were hypercholesterolaemic. The seven day estimated dietary record was used to determine their dietary intake. The males as well as the females consumed a diet that was high in fat and cholesterol content. Their diets were low in carbohydrate. It is recommended that these athletes increase their carbohydrate intake and lower their total fat intake. It is also recommended that the obese subjects should lose weight.
