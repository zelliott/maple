Retrospectively, to investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and basal electrogenic transport as measured by short-circuit current (SCC) in human duodenal and colonic mucosal biopsies.

The study included biopsies from mucosa of normal appearance in the sigmoid colon and/or distal duodenum. Patients were referred for routine endoscopy (predominantly for monosymptomatic abdominal pain) and had normal endoscopic findings. Biopsies were mounted in miniaturized Ussing chambers and basal SCC was recorded. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of BMI (≤25 and&>25 kg m⁻²). Statistical significance was assessed by the unpaired t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Correlation coefficients were calculated by Pearson product moment correlation.

In colonic biopsies, basal SCC (mean ± standard deviation) was significantly higher in 59 biopsies from 30 patients with low BMI than in 32 biopsies from 23 patients with high BMI (45 ± 29 μA cm⁻² vs. 27 ± 21 μA cm⁻², P = 0.016). In duodenal biopsies, mean basal SCC was numerically lower in 38 biopsies from 15 patients with low BMI than in 46 biopsies from 19 patients with high BMI (54 ± 26 μA cm⁻² vs. 74 ± 39 μA cm⁻², P = 0.069). The correlation coefficient between BMI and SCC was -0.26 (P = 0.06) in colonic biopsies and +0.44 (P = 0.001) in duodenal biopsies.

Basal intestinal active electrogenic transport is related to BMI and this relationship may differ in different segments of the intestinal tract.
