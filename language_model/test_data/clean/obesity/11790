To evaluate epidemiological situation by cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors in Tyumen.

An open population of the Central Tyumen district was studied (1608 patients) for prevalence of obesity, arterial hypertension, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure.

It was found: high incidence of arterial hypertension both in males and females (25.6 and 24.6%, respectively) with predominance of isolated systolic arterial hypertension in younger patients, high incidence of borderline hypertension in young men, higher predisposition to obesity in males vs females. Body mass index was higher in 25-34-year-old males but increased with age in females.

It is necessary to perform a cohort study of epidemiological parameters to detect persons with cardiovascular disease risk.
