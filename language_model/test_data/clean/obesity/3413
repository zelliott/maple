The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of occurrence of obesity and high risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a keratoconus population with that of a control group.

This prospective, case-controlled multicenter study was performed on patients with keratoconus and age- and gender-matched control subjects. One hundred forty-six patients were included in each group, and the Berlin Questionnaire was used for classifying patients as having a high risk or low risk of developing OSA. The patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and with the Ï‡ test for categorical variables.

The keratoconus (85 male/61 female) and control (79 male/67 female) groups' median ages were 25 (8-65) and 24 (9-60) years, respectively. Of the 146 patients in each group, 11 (7.5%) patients were determined to be at a high risk of developing OSA in the keratoconus group, and 8 (5.5%) patients were determined to be at a high risk of developing OSA in the control group. There was no significant difference between the groups (P = 0.477). The keratoconus and control groups' median body mass index values were found to be within normal ranges of 23.2 and 23.4, respectively.

In this study, the mean body mass index value of the keratoconus group was determined to be within normal limits. In a Turkish population, the ratio of a high risk of developing OSA was not found to be significantly different between the keratoconus and control groups.
