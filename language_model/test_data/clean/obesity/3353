The independent associations between overall obesity, body fat distribution, lipids, lipoproteins, glucose, blood pressure and some hormonal factors (sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) and fasting insulin) were cross-sectionally examined in 205 French working women. After adjustment for age, overall adiposity assessed by body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with most metabolic parameters, whereas regional adiposity assessed by the waist-hip ratio (WHR) was significantly associated only with triglyceride, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Blood pressure, glucose but not triglyceride, were also negatively and significantly correlated with SHBG and positively with fasting insulin. Negative independent associations were found between SHBG and both BMI and WHR, whereas CBG was positively associated only with WHR. Fasting insulin was no longer related to WHR after adjustment for BMI. After controlling for the effect of SHBG or insulin, the associations between triglyceride, blood pressure and both BMI and WHR were not substantially modified. After adjustment for BMI and WHR, fasting insulin was independently associated with both HDL cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure. In conclusion, in these French women, hormonal factors under study appeared to have little influence on the relationships between body fatness, body fat distribution, metabolic variables and blood pressure.
