The aim was to study the effect of placebo EA, electroacupuncture (EA), and diet on obesity and accompanying psychological symptoms. One hundred and sixty-five volunteer women participated in the study. There were three groups: (i) Placebo EA, (ii) EA, and (iii) diet restriction group. EA was performed by using three ear and six body points. There was a 4.8% reduction in weight of patients with EA application, whereas patients with a diet restriction and placebo EA had a 2.5% and 2.7% weight reduction, respectively. There were significant decreases in phobia, anger, anxiety, obsession, paranoid symptoms, and depression in the EA groups compared to those of the placebo EA and diet groups. It was suggested that electroacupuncture may be an effective therapy for obesity including the psychological signs and symptoms in women.
