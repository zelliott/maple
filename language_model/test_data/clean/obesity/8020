The aim of the study was to evaluate fibrinolysis in obese women. Study group consisted of 45 obese women (mean age 36,8 +/- 16,6 years, mean BMI 35,7 +/- 4,9), who were allocated to two subgroups: premenopausal (mean age 32,3 +/- 9,9 years, mean BMI 36,9 +/- 5,6) and postmenopausal (mean age 64,8+/-10,1 years, mean BMI 33,3 +/- 2,55). Control group consisted of 45 women (mean age 35,3 +/- 13,9 years) with normal BMI (21,8 +/- 3,09). Global fibrinolytic activity was diminished only in obese women after menopause. Final analysis revealed significant increase of TAFI antigen and activity in the plasma of obese women. The existence of significant correlation in multifactor regression analysis between TAFI plasma content and euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT) and global fibrinolytic capacity (GFC) as well confirmed negative influence of this inhibitor on fibrinolytic capacity in obese women. The increase of TAFI antigen and activity in the plasma was independent of age, BMI, glucose, cholesterol, triglicerides, insulin and leptin concentration in the plasma. The results of ECLT and GFC may be also influenced by PAI-1 activity particularly in women before menopause, which was significantly elevated in our group of patients. This increase as not dependent with TAFI antigen concentration. In conclusion, the observed increase TAFI antigen and activity in the plasma of obese women may influence the thrombotic risk in this group of patients, especially after menopause.
