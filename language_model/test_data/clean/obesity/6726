Laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery has become a popular form of treatment for individuals suffering from obesity. As such, many institutions routinely employ an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) study on postoperative day one to assess for surgical complications, including anastomotic leaks. In this study, retrospective case analysis was used to determine whether UGI studies prove useful in detecting a gastrointestinal leak. Seventy-five in-hospital case reports were analyzed, of which 55 cases received an UGI study routinely on postoperative day one. Twenty cases received intraoperative anastomotic analysis and an UGI study was completed only if clinically indicated. All UGI studies obtained were negative; however, other complications were noted, including anastomotic stricture and internal hernia. Our study found that routine UGI studies after laparoscopic Roux-En-Ygastric bypass did not contribute significantly to patient care. UGI studies should therefore be employed on a selective basis given the clinical signs and symptoms of the patient.
