Cohen syndrome is a very rare disease. Complication by spinal deformity has been reported, but management and surgery for spinal deformity in Cohen syndrome has not been previously described. The objective of this study was to examine the outcome of surgical treatment for kyphoscoliosis of Cohen syndrome with a literature review. The patient was a 14-year-old male with the characteristics of Cohen syndrome: truncal obesity, mental retardation, arachnodactyly, microcephalia, and a facial malformation. Scoliosis was conservatively treated with a brace at 13 years of age, but the spinal deformity rapidly progressed within a year. Plain radiographs before surgery showed scoliosis of 47 degrees (T5-T11) and 79 degrees (T11-L3), and kyphosis of 86 degrees (T7-L1). One-stage anteroposterior corrective fusion of T4-L3 was scheduled after 2-week Halo traction. Postoperative respiratory management was carefully performed because of Cohen syndrome-associated facial malformation, obesity, and reduced muscle tonus. Respiration was managed with intubation until the following day and no respiratory problems occurred. After surgery, thoracolumbar scoliosis was 28 degrees (correction rate: 65%). Kyphosis was markedly improved from 86 degrees to 20 degrees, achieving a favorable balance of the trunk. The outcome is favorable at 6.5 years after surgery. In conclusion, Cohen syndrome is often complicated by spinal deformity, particularly kyphosis, that is likely to progress even in adulthood. In our patient, spinal deformity progressed within a short period, even with brace treatment. Surgery should be required before progression to the severe spinal deformity with careful attention to general anesthesia.
