The 1999 Safe & Drug Free Schools and Communities Youth Risk Behavior Study collected data from representative samples of both high school (n=590) and middle school students (n=643) on Guam in May, 1999. Results showed that the dietary and exercise habits of Guam's adolescents were sub-optimal. Out of the 643 middle school students surveyed, 26% consumed at least 3 meals per week at a fast food restaurant and 53.3% consumed at least 2 cans of sweetened soda per day. Guam adolescents had a very low intake of fruits and vegetables. As many as 75.3% of high school students reported consuming fruits and vegetables less than once a day. Students who practiced unsafe weight loss practices were significantly more likely to smoke cigarettes, and use illegal drugs. In addition, 26.9% of adolescents surveyed were considered 'overweight'--similar to the prevalence of overweight reported among U.S. Mainland adolescents. Finally, data from survey showed that adolescents on Guam spent more time watching television and less time performing various physical activities than adolescents in the U.S. mainland. These suboptimal practices put Guam's adolescents at increased risk for immediate and long-term health problems.
