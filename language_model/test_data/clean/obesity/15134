To assess the effects of weight loss on serum adipokine levels in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

We determined serum leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and visfatin levels in 60 overweight/obese women with PCOS and 48 BMI-matched female volunteers. Measurements were repeated after 24 weeks of treatment with orlistat 120 mg 3 times per day along with an energy-restricted diet.

At baseline, serum visfatin concentration was higher in patients with PCOS than in controls (p = 0.036); serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, and resistin did not differ between the two groups. After 24 weeks, a significant reduction in BMI and waist circumference was observed in both patients with PCOS and controls (p &<0.001 vs. baseline in both groups). Also serum leptin levels decreased in both patients with PCOS and controls (p &<0.001 vs. baseline in both groups). The reduction in serum leptin levels did not differ between groups. Serum adiponectin, resistin, and visfatin levels did not change in either group.

Leptin, adiponectin, and resistin do not appear to play major pathogenetic roles in overweight/obese patients with PCOS. In contrast, visfatin emerges as a potentially important mediator of the endocrine abnormalities of these patients. However, serum visfatin levels are not substantially affected by weight loss.
