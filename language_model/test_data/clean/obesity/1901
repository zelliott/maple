In this study we describe the contribution of matrilineal and patrilineal effects on the adiposity, body weight, and on the weights of individual fat pads in F2 male mice derived from an SWR/J x AKR/J cross. AKR/J mice become obese after 12 weeks on a high-fat diet, whereas SWR/J mice remain relatively lean. Here we report that mice with AKR maternal and AKR paternal grandmothers have significantly larger epidydimal and retroperitoneal fat pads than those with SWR maternal and paternal grandmothers. However, grandparental strain had no effect on the overall adiposity (AI) or the weights of the inguinal, subcutaneous or mesenteric fat pads. The strain of the paternal grandparents had a small but significant effect on body weight. These effects can be attributed to in utero effects, imprinting effects, cytoplasmic and/or Y chromosome transmission of factors controlling body fat. We also describe the presence of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on Chromosome X, close to DXMit174, which is linked to adiposity, body weight, and to the weights of the individual fat depots. However, this QTL is not responsible for the grandparental strain effects described above.
