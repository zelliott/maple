We report four white adolescents aged 13 to 15 years (three females, one male) from the south and west region of England who presented with type 2 diabetes mellitus associated with significant obesity (body mass index more than +3SDS) in the past two years. Although these are the first reported obese, white cases from the UK to present with diabetes, we believe this clinical scenario will become more prevalent given the epidemic of childhood obesity in this country.
