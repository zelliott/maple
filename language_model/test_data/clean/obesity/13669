The relationships of retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) with insulin sensitivity and body fat distribution have been investigated in a few recent studies with conflicting results. This may have been due to differences in ages of the subjects in the different studies. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the association of RBP4 and insulin sensitivity and percent trunk fat are influenced by age.

Cross-sectional analyses of 48 young subjects and 55 elderly subjects. Insulin sensitivity was determined by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Body fat distribution was determined by a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

In the young subjects, RBP4 levels were associated with insulin sensitivity (r = -0.30, P = 0.04), percent trunk fat (r = 0.54, P &<0.001), triglycerides (r = 0.44, P = 0.003), low-density lipoprotein (r = 0.38, P = 0.01). In contrast, in the elderly subjects there was no correlation between RBP4 levels and insulin sensitivity (r = -0.18, P = 0.20), percent trunk fat (r = 0.00, P = 0.10), triglycerides (r = 0.25, P = 0.10), and low-density lipoprotein (r = -0.11, P = 0.47).

The associations of RBP4 with insulin sensitivity, percent trunk fat, and lipid levels are influenced by age.
