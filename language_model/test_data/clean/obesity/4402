To compare application of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) 3 definitions, proposed by International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in 2005, Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) in 2005 and Chinese Diabetes Society (CDS) in 2004, in Mongolian people of agricultural and pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia, China.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Chaoluto and Guribanhua township of Tongliao City of Inner Mongolia, between June 2003 and August 2004. A total of 2536 Mongolian people aged 20 yr and older completed all the surveys and examinations. Anthropometry, blood pressure, and fasting biochemistry were measured according to standard methods.

The age-standardized prevalence of MetS using the IDF, ATPIII, and CDS definitions was 17.1% (men 11.4%, women 21.6%), 22.9% (men 19.6%, women 25.8%) and 8.1% (men 7.6%, women 8.6%), respectively. The agreement of IDF and ATPIII, IDF and CDS, ATPIII and CDS were 93.5%, 85.0%, and 81.6%, and Kappa values were 0.822, 0.434, and 0.419, respectively. Among the subjects who had 3 or more MetS components, 100% were screened by ATPIII criteria, 76.1% by IDF criteria (men 57.3%, women 85.7%), and 33.5% by CDS criteria (men 7.6%, women 8.6%) respectively.

This investigation in Mongolian people showed very high agreement between IDF and ATPIII definitions, and moderate agreement between CDS and 2 other criteria. The cut points of waist circumference for males in IDF and ATPIII seemed high, and whether CDS definition should lower the fasting plasma glucose value from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l needs examination through further prospective studies in the Chinese population.
