The effects of St 587, a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, were investigated in non obese and obese Zucker rat heart ventricles. In both groups, the numbers and affinity constants for alpha-1 adrenoceptors were found to be similar. At 4 or 10 mM [K]o, St 587 failed to increase the developed tension whereas at 14 mM [K]o, St 587 significantly increased it in both groups of rats. This effect was reversed by prazosin; St 587 also increased action potential duration at 14 mM [K]o. [K]o is thus important for the occurrence of the inotropic effect of St 587 in 12 week-old Zucker rats, either non obese or obese with reduced beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness. This suggests the participation of phosphoinositide metabolism in the mechanism of St 587 inotropic effect in the rat.
