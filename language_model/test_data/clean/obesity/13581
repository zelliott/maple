This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between health quality of life, physical activity, and overweight status in children aged 8-12 years old.

Participants (n = 177 overweight boys and girls) completed a validated quality of life (QOL) inventory and wore an accelerometer to objectively measure physical activity for 1 week.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's standardized growth charts were used to categorize participants as overweight (M BMI% = 95.6) or obese status (M BMI% = 99.0) while accelerometer data was used to categorize participants as meeting or not meeting the recommended guidelines for physical activity.

Psychosocial, physical, and total QOL (all P &<0.05) were significantly lower for obese when compared to overweight participants. Less physically active children, irrespective of weight status, had significantly lower psychosocial and total QOL (all P &<0.05).

Physical activity promotion in overweight and obese children may have additional benefits to weight management that include improving QOL.
