In the present study, the nutritional quality of four grains including adlay (AD), buckwheat (BW), glutinous barley (GB), and white rice (WR) were evaluated in terms of plasma lipid parameters, gut transit time, and thickness of the aortic wall in rats. The rats were then raised for 4 weeks on the high-fat diet based on the American Institute of Nutrition-93 (AIN-93 G) diets containing 1 % cholesterol and 20 % dietary lipids. Forty male rats were divided into 4 groups and raised for 4 weeks with a diet containing one of the following grains: WR, AD, BW, or WB. The level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in liver was shown to be higher in rats by the order of those fed WR, AD, GB, and BW. This indicates that other grains decreased oxidative stress in vivo more than WR. The superoxide dismutase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase levels in the AD, BW, and GB groups were significantly higher than those in the WR group (p &<0.05). Plasma lipid profiles differed significantly according to grain combination, and decreased aortic wall thickness was consistent with the finding of decreased plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p &<0.05) and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) in rats fed AD, BW, and GB (p &<0.001). The antioxidant and hypolipidemic capacities of grains are quite high, especially those of adlay, buckwheat, and glutinous barley. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the whole grains had a cardioprotective effect. This effect was related to several mechanisms that corresponded to lowering plasma lipids, decreasing TBARS, and increasing antioxidant activities.
