We present a comprehensive picture of state requirements and recommendations for body mass index (BMI) and body composition screening of children and explore the association between pediatric obesity prevalence and state screening policies.

Researchers completed telephone interviews with contacts at the departments of education for all 50 states and reviewed state content standards for physical education.

Twenty states (40%) require BMI or body composition screening, and 9 states (18%) recommend BMI screening or a formal fitness assessment that includes a body composition component. The prevalence of adolescent obesity was higher in states that require BMI screening or fitness assessments with body composition than in states without requirements (16.7% vs 13.6%, P = .001).

Future studies should evaluate the effect and cost-effectiveness of BMI and body composition screening on child obesity.
