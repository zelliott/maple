The structure and function of right ventricle was echocardiographically assessed in patients (pts) with OSA and analyzed taking into account the presence of obesity and/or systemic hypertension (SH). Therefore, 118 pts (98 M, 20 F, aged 48,5 8,4 yr) were divided into OH = obese with z OSA and SH (n = 22), ON = obese with OSA, and no SH (n = 20), OC = OSA without either obesity and SH (n = 21), GH = obese without OSA but with SH (n = 18), GN = obese without either OSA or SH (n =17). Control group (ZZ) comprised 20 healthy subjects (14M,6F). Right ventricular diameter (RVD), diastolic (DRVW), and systolic right ventricle free wall thickness (SRVW) were measured and its systolic thickening (ST-RVW) was calculated. Acceleration time of ejection into pulmonary artery (AcT) was measured with Doppler echocardiography.

St. sign. p &<0.05 between: 1: all groups except OH and ON, GH and GN, GH and OC, GN and OC; 2--like 1 except ZZ and OC; 3--OH and all subgroup except ON, ON and GH, ON and ZZ, OC and GN; 4-- ON and all subgroups except OH, OH and OC, OH and GH, OH and GN.

Enlargement and functionally compromised RV is found in OBS mostly with concomitant obesity. Pulmonary hypertension at rest in patients with isolated OSA is rare and also requires additional contributing factors.
