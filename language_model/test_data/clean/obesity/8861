Metabolic syndrome is a complex disorder and an emerging clinical challenge. It is considered a "multiplex" cardiovascular risk factor, in that each component of the cluster of abnormalities is a risk factor in its own right. Introduced as Syndrome X by Reaven in 1988 and also termed insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome is recognized clinically by the findings of abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides, atherogenic dyslipidemia - i.e. low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure, high blood glucose and/or insulin resistance. The goal of our research was to investigate intensity of "complete metabolic syndrome"- (abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, high blood glucose and/or insulin resistance) in patients with different degrees of obesity. In our study 570 patients have been involved. The patients were divided into 3 groups: I group--123 patients with first degree of obesity (body mass index - BMI - 30-34,9 kg/m2), II group--189 patients with II degree of obesity (BMI - 35-39,9 kg/m2), III group--258 patients with III degree of obesity (BMI&>40 kg/m2). Results of carried out investigations have shown that the complete picture of metabolic syndrome was present in 132 (23,16%) patients and should note, that according to the increasing of obesity degrees also increases the intensity of metabolic syndrome.
