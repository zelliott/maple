Resting metabolic rate (RMR), as well as caffeine (CAF) and ephedrine (EPH) stimulated thermogenesis (VO2) were measured in young adult corpulent (corp) LA/N-cp (LA-corpulent) rats. RMR of lean was greater than corp. Administration of EPH, CAF and EPH + CAF resulted in 32, 48 and 50% increases in VO2, respectively, in both lean and corp rats. The time to attain maximal VO2 was similar for both drugs in both phenotypes, but the duration of maximal VO2 averaged 50, 26 and 42% longer in corp than lean for EPH, CAF and EPH + CAF, respectively. Acute weight loss following these treatments was greater for corp than lean, and corresponded with the duration of elevated VO2. These results are consistent with a normally functioning end-organ sympathomimetic receptor system in the corp phenotype of the LA/N-cp rat, and suggest that obesity in this model may be caused by factors other than defective brown fat thermogenesis at the end organ level.
