Genetic related health problems are often interrelated. Current practices to establish associations between diseases are expensive and rarely can reflect underlying molecular mechanisms, We propose a general framework to associate diseases by networking pathways. By applying our method on association study of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and obesity, we demonstrate that our method can both identify signature pathways for each disease and establish valid association of two diseases.
