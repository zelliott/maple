Despite declines in recent years, heart disease and stroke remain the first and third leading causes of death in the United States, respectively. Of all U.S. deaths in 2001, heart disease accounted for 29.0% and stroke for 6.8%. The major risk factors for both conditions are high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, and obesity, all of which have been targeted by national prevention programs. In addition, the prevalence of multiple major risk factors has been a matter of increasing concern. However, few studies of national and state-level data have examined the prevalence of no known major risk factors among adults and how that prevalence has changed during the preceding 10 years. To assess changes in prevalence of no known risk factors for heart disease and stroke during 1991-2001, CDC analyzed data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicate that prevalence of no known major risk factors is decreasing among men and women in nearly all states, racial/ethnic populations, age groups, and education levels. In addition, the prevalence of individual major risk factors is increasing. These findings underscore the potential for an increased burden of heart disease and stroke on the health-care system. To prevent the debilitating outcomes of heart disease and stroke among the aging U.S. population, increased prevention efforts and treatment interventions are needed.
