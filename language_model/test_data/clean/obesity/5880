The 3-hydroxyméthyl N-méthyl piperidine 4-chlorophenoxyacetate, hydrochloride, A, a potent anorectic, reduces weight gain of gold thioglucose obese mice through a reduced body fat and a decrease in metabolic efficiency. Compound A has much less effect in the lean mice than in the obese models. In contrast with pair-fed obese or lean mice, the decreased food consumption cannot account for all the reduced weight gain of the obese controls. Basal lipolytic activity in parametrial adipose tissue is greater in obese mice treated with A then in controls. It seems that the stimulating effect of A on lipolysis could contribute to the weight reduction.
