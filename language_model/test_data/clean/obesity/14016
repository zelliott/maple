After bypass operation for obesity the remaining lactose-hydrolyzing capacity of the functioning shunt is very low, especially if the shunt is constructed from a shorter jejunal and a longer ileal segment. In most cases a temporary decrease in the lactase activity of the jejunal part of the shunt occurs during the first postoperative months. In the present study lactose provoked or aggravated diarrhoea and other symptoms in 20 of 33 shunt-operated patients, and 10 patients reported milk intolerance postoperatively. Oral glucose tolerance tests indicated that the lactase activity was rate limiting for lactose absorption postoperatively.
