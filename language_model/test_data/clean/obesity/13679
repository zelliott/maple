The relationship of visceral adiposity with adipocytokines and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle distribution and oxidation in Asian metabolically obese, normal-weight (MONW) individuals has not been evaluated. We aimed to investigate the association between visceral adiposity and adipocytokines and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in MONW Korean women with normal glucose tolerance.

We examined the metabolic characteristics of 135 non-obese (BMI &<5 kg/m(2)) women aged 25-64 years. Twenty-five women (BMI &<5 kg/m(2) and visceral fat adiposity (VFA)&> or =100 cm(2)) were classified as MONW and 25 women (BMI &<5 kg/m(2) and VFA &<00 cm(2)), pair-matched for age, weight, height, and menopausal status, as control group. Plasma lipid profiles and adipocytokines were evaluated in these two groups.

MONW subjects had higher systolic (P &<0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (P &<0.005) and higher concentrations of triacylglycerol (TG) (P &<0.005), insulin (P &<0.01), and free fatty acid (FFA) (P &<0.05) than control subjects. There was no significant difference between two groups in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations; however, MONW subjects had smaller LDL particles (P &<0.01) and higher concentrations of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) (P &<0.05) compared with controls. Moreover, MONW subjects had higher concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (P &<0.05), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (P &<0.05) and leptin (P &<0.05), and lower plasma adiponectin concentrations (P &<0.05). Higher intake of saturated fat with lower ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to saturated fatty acids (SFA) and lower fiber intake than normal subjects were found in MONW women.

We found an unfavorable inflammatory profile and a more atherogenic LDL profile in MONW female subjects even in the absence of a known CVD risk factors. Moreover, MONW consumed more saturated fat and less fiber than the control group.
