Three hundred and eleven (311) Saudi visitors (teenagers and adults) participated in a nutritional awareness and anthropometric study in a Health Week Exhibition campaign sponsored by the Ministry of Health in 1408 H (1988). The study revealed that the average adult male and female heights were 167cm and 155cm against the American standard heights of 178cm and 163cm respectively. Adult females weighed more than males (43.2% vs 19.8%), and the married subjects of both sexes were heavier than the unmarried subjects (male: 15.4% vs 4.4%; female: 35.1% vs 8.1%). A good number of subjects consumed a variety of foods from the four food groups daily which reflected a good trend in food and nutrition awareness. However, the study emphasizes the importance of nutrition education and propagation for the improvement of general health and nutritional status of the population.
