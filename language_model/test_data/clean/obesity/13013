To explore long term results of my comprehensive group therapeutic weight-loss programme for obese people which included behavioural, psychological, cognitive and physical elements.

Retrospective analysis of patients' records and final follow-up questionnaires filled in at least 5 y after they left their group.

48 overweight people who joined the programme were followed up for at least 5 y. 14 'non completers' did not complete the programme (median initial BMI was 32.2). Other 34 were members of groups at least 4 months (median initial BMI was 31.8).

Median weight loss of 'completers' when they left the group was 11.5 kg. 10 members achieved normal body weight. At least 5 y later 13 of them still maintained the reduced weight. In the questionnaires they indicated that the diet, weekly group meetings, exercise and group discussions made most important contribution to their success.

The long-term intensive and comprehensive weight loss treatment offers a good opportunity to obese people to reduce their weight and maintain it afterwards. For success they have to have adequate diet, attend the group regularly, be physically active, have support from their families and friends and change their life style and eating habits.
