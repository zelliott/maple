Given the ongoing epidemic of obesity, femoral fracture management in the population affected by this condition is likely to become more frequent. Fracture treatment in obese patients poses a special challenge given greater difficulty in establishing an accurate diagnosis and confirming associated injuries. Adequate intraoperative positioning and obtaining accurate reduction and stable fixation may require special considerations. Obese patients have a high predisposition for complications such as compartment syndrome, nerve injuries, and pressure ulcers, and are at increased risk for medical complications given the high prevalence of comorbidities. A thorough understanding of the risks associated with obesity and the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges involved with femoral shaft fractures in this setting is paramount to achieve adequate results.
