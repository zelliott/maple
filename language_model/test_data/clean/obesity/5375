The prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to show a clear upward trend in Germany. In earlier days it was considered the "harmless diabetes of old age," but has become increasingly recognized as a disease carrying a high risk of vascular sequelae as well as shortening the diabetic's remaining life expectancy if adequate therapy is not initiated. In addition to correcting hyperglycemia, treatment consists in effective management of concomitant risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and adiposity resulting from faulty nutrition and lack of exercise. In the large majority of overweight type 2 diabetics, metformin is the oral antidiabetic agent of first choice provided the patient does not exhibit renal insufficiency, which represents the most important contraindication. This recommendation for monotherapy of overweight type 2 diabetics is supported by an endpoint study. In contrast, no equivalent evidence is available on any of the possible options for oral combination therapy.
