To assess the association between a measure of extensive tooth loss (functional edentulism) and obesity with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in a racially heterogeneous sample.

A cross-sectional survey (370 subjects) was performed by reviewing the medical and dental records of dependently or independently living individuals who were treated as inpatients and/or outpatients at a Department of Veterans Affairs facility. Frequencies and descriptive measures were derived; univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to test for associations, confounding, effect modification, and interaction using functional edentulism and obesity as the independent variables and NIDDM as the dependent measure.

Functionally edentulous individuals were at significantly greater risk for NIDDM (estimated odds ratio [OR] = 4.06), than the obese (OR = 3.29). These relationships were not confounded by age or race in this sample. Obesity did confound functional edentulism in the multivariable model, suggesting that they act independently on the outcome variable (NIDDM).

Dentist-assessed functional edentulism and physician-diagnosed obesity were significantly associated with NIDDM in this sample of predominantly older men. This finding ought to be considered by primary care providers in formulating dietary strategies in order to facilitate the realization of their therapeutic goals.
