The Maltese population has been shown to have a high incidence of endometrial adenocarcinoma when compared to other European countries. This high incidence has been correlated to the high prevalence of abnormal glucose metabolism and rather high dietary fat intake in the Maltese population. Hypertension and low parity were also found to be more frequent in the carcinoma group.
