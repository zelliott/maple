Childhood obesity is a major risk factor, especially for the metabolic syndrome and further cardiovascular diseases. The metabolic syndrome is defined by a combination of obesity, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia and dyslipidemia, insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Obesity in early childhood further increases the risk of premature illnesses and early death, therefore raising public health concerns. About one third of overweight or obese children and adolescents exhibit features of early metabolic syndrome. In view of the increasing issue of early-onset obesity, effective family- and school-based primary care programs in addition to sufficient weight-reducing therapeutic approaches are necessary in order to achieve a modification of our sedentary lifestyle. Local long-term therapeutic programs for obese young patients are an important tool to establish a more active and health-oriented life style in children and their families and to reduce the individual and public burden of obesity in childhood.
