In clinical trials the most frequently used anti-hypertensive treatments have been found to produce unfavourable changes in plasma high-density cholesterol-lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol) levels. We have investigated whether such effects could be observed in a general population in which these drugs are often prescribed. This population was divided into three groups: subjects with normal blood pressure, subjects with unrecognized arterial hypertension and subjects receiving an anti-hypertensive treatment. Treatment with beta-blockers of obese hypertensive patients was attended by unfavourable changes identical with those observed in a general population under the most common anti-hypertensive therapy.
