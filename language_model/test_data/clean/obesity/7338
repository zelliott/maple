The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among body mass index (BMI), self-perceptions, and body image discrepancy in African American (AA) girls.

Baseline self-perception and BMI data were collected by trained staff from 303 preadolescent AA girls participating in the girls health enrichment multi-site studies. Correlations and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify relationships of BMI with self-perception factors.

Girls with a BMI at or above the 85th percentile were more likely to have greater body image discrepancy and participate in weight control behaviors than girls with a BMI below the 85th percentile. Body image discrepancy was not related to self-esteem, but was positively correlated with physical activity self-concept and self-efficacy, and diet self-efficacy.

Girls with higher BMI had greater body image discrepancy and were less confident in abilities to be active and eat healthy. Findings may inform the development of obesity interventions for preadolescents.
