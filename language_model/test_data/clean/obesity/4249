Many health problems are related to lifestyle and dietary factors. Increasing trend in reproductive disorders observed in recent years may be associated at least in part with these factors, which are compounded by some of the new emergent life styles. The data available suggests that lifestyle factors such as obesity, tobacco smoking or chewing, alcohol and some of the illicit drugs like cocaine, cannabis etc and exposure to extreme heat, have adverse effects on male reproduction. The data on other factors such as use of mobile phone and stress on reproductive health are inadequate and need detailed study. Lifestyle related diseases could be lowered with modification in diet, living and working environment etc. Sub-fertile and/or normal subjects have some control over their reproductive function by adopting healthy lifestyles to avoid additional complications.
