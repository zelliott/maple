Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has been considered as a cardiovascular risk factor, mainly because of its strong association with insulin resistance.

To detect independent predictors of circulating PAI-1 levels in obese pediatric patients, we evaluated 86 subjects (mean age 10.7 +/- 2.8 years), 42 of whom were male (49%). Subjects were divided in two groups according to body mass index (BMI): obese subjects (n=61) and healthy non-obese controls (n=25). They were also divided by pubertal status. Besides anthropometric data, levels of PAI-1, leptin and biochemical markers of metabolic syndrome were measured.

The obese group had higher levels of PAI-1, leptin and biochemical markers of metabolic syndrome than nonobese controls (p&<.05). However, multivariate regression analysis showed that only puberty progression (p=0.005) and abdominal circumference/height index (p=0.002) remained independent predictors of PAI-1 levels.

In pediatric obesity, fat mass accumulation, mainly of visceral fat, and puberty progression were related to high PAI-1 levels, which might in turn contribute to cardiovascular risk.
