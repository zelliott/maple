Male and female Holtzman rats were made hyperphagic and obese with bilateral radiofrequency heat lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) area. When VMH rats were maintained at 28 degrees C, their brown adipose tissue (BAT) DNA, protein, and cytochrome oxidase contents were normal although more stored lipid was present, as judged from a threefold increase in wet weight. Thermogenic activity of BAT mitochondria was normal in male VMH rats, as judged from the unchanged level of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) binding (known to be a sensitive index of the functional activity of the thermogenic proton conductance pathway), and reduced in female VMH rats. When rats with VMH lesions were exposed to cold (4 degrees C for 24 h), the visible hyperemia of their BAT and normal large increase in mitochondrial GDP binding indicated normal thermogenic responsiveness. We conclude that the medial nuclei of the hypothalamus and associated afferent or efferent nerve tracts do not represent an essential central nervous system link for cold-induced, sympathetic-mediated activation of BAT thermogenesis. It is possible, however, that diet-induced, sympathetic-mediated activation of BAT function and growth might require an intact VMH region because no enhancement of BAT mitochondrial function normally associated with hyperphagia was detected in these hyperphagic VMH-lesioned animals.
