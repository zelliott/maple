The aim of this study was to evaluate our experience with single-port appendectomy (SPA) in obese children.

From January 2003 to June 2009, 94 SPA (65 women and 29 men, mean age of 12.4 years) were performed in children with appendicitis. Sixty-five of these patients were found to have normal weight, whereas 29 were obese. Patients' records were evaluated regarding operative time, intra- and post-operative complications, initiation of oral intake and histopathological findings.

There was no significant difference in operative time between obese and normal weight patients. In the obese group, one wound healing disturbance was documented. In the normal weight group, there were one post-operative bleeding and one wound infection. There was no difference with regards to the introduction of feeds following appendectomy between the groups. Histological examinations revealed 15 normal, 32 acute, 21 phlegmonous, 20 chronic and two perforated cases of appendicitis, three neurogenic appendicopathies and one case of enterobius vermicularis related appendicitis.

Our results indicate that the advantages of single-port appendectomy in the evaluation of the peritoneal cavity, the minimal rate of intra-operative incidents with this technique and superior cosmetics validate this alternative approach of minimal access appendectomy in obese children.
