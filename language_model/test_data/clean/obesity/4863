Obesity and physical inactivity are both associated with illness and death. A review of the literature has shown that the objectively measured level of fitness and self-reported physical activity both have a prognostic relationship with death from all causes, independently of BMI. Furthermore, there is evidence for a dose-response effect of physical activity. It is concluded that regular physical activity has health-beneficial effects which are beyond its effect on weight control.
