Obesity is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, in part due to its strong association with atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by high triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. There has been substantial research effort focused on the mechanisms of the link between obesity and atherogenic dyslipidemia, both in the absence and presence of insulin resistance. After a brief overview of the epidemiology of atherogenic dyslipidemia, this article details the known molecular mechanisms of adipocyte function and its relationship to apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly and metabolism, both in the healthy as well as in the obese states. We also discuss the pathophysiology of low HDL cholesterol in obesity and the implications for cardiovascular disease risk.
