Normocyclic functional sterility can be regarded as a starting point to the common pathophysiology of different endocrinopathies. Those are finally leading to secondary amenorrhoea, as the most severe sign of ovarian insufficiency. The incidence of abnormal hormonal parameter increases parallel to the duration and the extent of the respective endocrinopathy. For a better causal classification of the endocrine disorder a complete hormonal assessment is mandatory, as characteristic historical data or significant clinical signs will often be missed in infertile patients. The completion of one single basic hormonal examination might lead to an exact differentiated diagnosis and then allows accordingly for the induction of a purposeful treatment. The pregnancy rates are considerably high proving the effectiveness of the thoughtful pretherapeutic diagnostic evaluation. The principle of cost-effectiveness is as well maintained by the follow-up of complete diagnosis and master-tailored therapy.
