The prevalence of obesity is increasing today in western industrialized countries: therefore, many authors are focusing their attention on its multiple endocrine and metabolic effects. Because of the pathogenetic linkage between obesity and dyslipidemia, we have studied serum lipid pattern in a group of obese women: HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C) deficiency was the most striking lipoproteinemic disorder. This fact points out, in our opinion, that obesity must be considered as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
