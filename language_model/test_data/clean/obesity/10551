Upper extremity injuries are more prevalent in obese people than in nonobese people after low-energy falls. Because splinting and casting are inefficient methods of stabilization in the setting of obesity, internal fixation provides stability for mobilization and realignment. Morbid obesity adversely affects positioning, surgical exposures, and complications associated with operative fixation. Avoiding short cuts and complications, morbidly obese patients should be able to return to normal functioning.
