To explore the pathophysiologic roles of the obese (ob) gene product, leptin, in the development of obesity and hypertension, we examined ob gene expression and leptin secretion in obese spontaneously hypertensive rats (obese SHR or Koletsky rats) at the stage of established obesity and hypertension. Expression of the ob gene was augmented in the epididymal, mesenteric, subcutaneous, and retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (WAT) from 20-week-old male obese SHR compared to their lean littermates (lean SHR). Using a radioimmunoassay for rat leptin, we also measured plasma leptin levels in 20-week-old lean and obese SHR. Plasma leptin levels in obese SHR (292.5 +/- 37.1 ng/ml) were more than 100-fold higher than those in lean SHR (2.8 +/- 1.0 ng/ml). The present study demonstrates that ob gene expression and leptin secretion are markedly augmented in obese SHR.
