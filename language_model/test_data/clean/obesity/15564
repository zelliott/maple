Thirty-five years ago, Lois and Theodore Zucker reported the discovery of a genetic mutation in the rat that resulted in juvenile-onset obesity, increased food intake, decreased energy expenditure, and insulin resistance. The mutation was called fatty (fa). The fatty gene is passed on to successive generations by an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. In the intervening years, much work has been done to characterize the many abnormalities of this animal model of obesity. Nearly 10 years ago, we reviewed the evidence for a central nervous system mechanism in the etiology of obesity in the fatty Zucker rat. Since that time, the discovery of novel peptides and genes has revolutionized the study of the etiology of genetically linked obesities. In this review, we update the evidence for a central nervous system mechanism of obesity in Zucker rats by focusing on the possible role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and leptin in the etiology of obesity. We also discuss the role of glucocorticoids and insulin in the regulation of NPY.
