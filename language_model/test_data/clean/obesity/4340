The correlates of quality of life (QOL), as measured by the OSQOL questionnaire were investigated in a convenience sample of overweight patients recruited in pharmacies.

A convenience sample of patients with a Body Mass Index&> or = 28 kg/m(2) were recruited in community-based pharmacies. Baseline characteristics and QOL dimensions (1-Physical state, 2-Vitality-desire to do things, 3-Relations with others, 4-Psychological state) were reported in self-completed questionnaires from which the risk of obtaining a low QOL was assessed for each dimension.

QOL was inadequate for all dimensions in the 494 patients included in the study (median age = 61, 48% women, 21% professional persons/top executives). Older pre-obese and obese patients were more likely to report impaired physical functioning (OR = 2.02, 95%CI = [1.10-3.70]), but were less severely affected socially (OR = 0.32, 95%CI = [0.15-0.69]). Pre-obese and obese professional persons and top executives showed better physical capabilities (OR = 0.35, 95%CI = [0.15-0.81]) and increased vitality (OR = 0.47, 95%CI = [0.23-0.95]). Overall, men's psychological state was better than females' (OR = 0.46, 95%CI = [0.25-0.82]). A body-mass index&> or = 35 kg/m(2) was significantly associated with poorer QOL scores on physical, relational and psychological dimensions.

Our data highlighted the influence of the severity of excess weight, gender, age and socioeconomic status on QOL. These factors should be taken into account when interpreting QOL in pre-obese and obese persons.
