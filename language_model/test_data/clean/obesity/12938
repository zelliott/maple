Both obesity and insulin resistance increase the risk of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, but the mechanisms linking these abnormalities are unknown. The current study was undertaken to examine the effects of obesity, fat distribution, and insulin resistance on plasma levels of aldosterone and other adrenal steroids that might contribute to sequelae of obesity.

Twenty-eight normotensive premenopausal women and 27 normotensive men with a wide range of body fat underwent measurements of visceral adipose tissue by CT scan, total fat mass by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and plasma levels of three adrenal steroid hormones.

Plasma aldosterone in women correlated directly with visceral adipose tissue (r=0.66, p&<.001) and inversely with insulin sensitivity (r=-0.67, p&<.001), and these associations were independent of plasma renin activity. There were no corresponding correlations in men. Plasma aldosterone was significantly correlated with plasma cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in women. Seventeen women and 15 men completed a weight-reduction regimen, losing an average of 15.1+1.2 kg. After weight loss, plasma aldosterone was significantly lower and insulin sensitivity higher; however, the correlations of aldosterone with visceral adipose tissue and insulin sensitivity in women persisted (p = 0.09 and 0.07, respectively). Although none of the women were hypertensive, blood pressure correlated with plasma aldosterone both before and after weight loss.

We conclude that visceral adiposity and insulin resistance are associated with increased plasma aldosterone and other adrenal steroids that may contribute to cardiovascular diseases in obese women.
