Adolescents with obesity (N = 48) and their caregivers were randomized to Multisystemic Therapy (MST) or a group weight-loss intervention. MST adolescents significantly reduced percents overweight and body fat, while control adolescents did not. Treatments such as MST that can intervene in the multiple systems that influence weight are worthy of further study.
