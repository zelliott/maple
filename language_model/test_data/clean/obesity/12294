Individuals with obesity and abdominal adiposity are at higher risk for hypeinsulinaemia, insulin resistance, and diabetes. This study was therefore designed to investigate the relationship of obesity with oxidative stress and the role of abdominal adiposity on obesity induced oxidative stress, and further to explore the possible mechanism of obesity associated metabolic syndrome.

A total of 150 subjects (120 men and 30 women), aged 17-26 years of both genders, were studied. Body Mass Index and Waist-to-Hip Ratio were taken as a measure of generalized obesity and abdominal adiposity. The biochemical tests done included fasting blood glucose (FBG), lipid profile parameters, serum malondialdehyde (as a biomarker of oxidative stress), and serum adiponectin.

The concentration of serum malondialdehyde (MDA) increased with increasing levels of BMI (as per the NIH classification), which was found to be non-significant statistically in overweight subjects while obese class-I and class-II subjects exhibited a statistically significant (p &<0.001) higher level of serum malondialdehyde as compared to normal-weight subjects. Furthermore, according to the present study groups, on comparison with normal-weight subjects (Group-I), obese subjects with abdominal adiposity (Class-2) had statistically significant (p &<0.001) higher serum concentration of malondialdehyde while a non-significant difference was observed in obese subjects without abdominal adiposity (Class-1). Even within the subset of obese subjects, a statistically significant (p &<0.001) difference was depicted, suggesting the role of abdominal adiposity. Karl Pearson coefficient of correlation revealed a statistically significant negative correlation of malondialdehyde with adiponectin (r = - 0.587; p &<0.001).

Obese subjects exhibit increased systemic oxidative stress, which is enhanced when obesity is associated with abdominal adiposity and, moreover, increased oxidative stress is associated with adiponectin deficiency.
