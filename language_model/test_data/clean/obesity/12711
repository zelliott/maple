A 59-year-old man with obesity was admitted with nocturnal dyspnea and nocturnal precordial oppression. Catheter data disclosed no cardiac failure. Polysomnography was performed for a total of 3 nights. The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was made because apnea index was 50 times/hour in average, the max apnea time was about 80 seconds and disappearance of airflow during decrease of endoesophageal pressure was observed. At the max apnea time, ST-T change in leads V2-5 was observed with severe desaturation (arterial oxygen saturation: 49%). It was considered that myocardial hypoxia following sleep apnea might be the cause of nocturnal precordial oppression.
