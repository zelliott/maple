This article describes the development and growth of Lifestyle Improvements in the Family Environment (L.I.F.E.), a school-based heart-health screening and intervention program. The primary goals of L.I.F.E. through three rounds of grant funding remained constant: (a) to identify cardiovascular risk factors in students and their families and (b) to provide counseling, education, and opportunities to change lifestyle routines that contribute to those risk factors. The program began with direct ties to a university-based research program and grew with evidence-based successes and development of community partnerships. Waves of growth were influenced by capacity-building efforts, partnership development, and resource availability. School nurses managed the screening component and partnered with appropriate others in the intervention programming. School nurses are appropriately positioned to assist families as well as school and community partners in decreasing the incidence of obesity and promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors.
