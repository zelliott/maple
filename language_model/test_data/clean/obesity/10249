The relationship between excess abdominal adipose tissue, metabolic and cardiovascular health risk has stimulated interest in the efficacy of physical activity in specifically perturbing this adipose depot. The evolution of imaging techniques has enabled more direct measurement of changes in abdominal and visceral fat. The purpose of this summary was to systematically review the relationship between physical activity and abdominal fat.

Database searches were performed on MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORT DISCUS and PUBMED, from 1985 to 2005 with keywords "exercise", "abdominal fat" and "visceral fat".

Nineteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight non-randomized controlled trials were selected. In RCTs using imaging techniques to measure change in abdominal fat in overweight or obese subjects, seven out of 10 studies (including three trials with type 2 diabetics) reported significant reductions compared with controls. Reductions in visceral and total abdominal fat may occur in the absence of changes in body mass and waist circumference. Waist-to-hip ratio is not a sensitive measure of change in regional adiposity in exercise studies. No studies fulfil the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement's criteria for the highest quality of randomized trial; however, many studies were in progress or published before the opportunity to comply with these recommendations. Therefore, limited evidence from a number of studies suggests a beneficial influence of physical activity on reduction in abdominal and visceral fat in overweight and obese subjects when imaging techniques are used to quantify changes in abdominal adiposity. More rigorous studies are needed to confirm these observations.
