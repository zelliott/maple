In the last 25-30 years, there has been a marked increase in the prevalence of obesity within almost all age groups of the Danish population. The largest increase has been documented in studies based on objective data from total populations, and the latest data show the increase as continuing. The Danish studies show heterogeneity in the development of the obesity epidemic within various birth cohorts over time. This indicates a need for further etiological research, not only into behavioural factors but also into early life factors that may explain some of this pattern.
