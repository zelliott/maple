The article presents the results of population screening study in the Health Center. There is a high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors among the young and middle-aged population (56.66; 51.18 and 41.04%). Among elderly, there is high prevalence of chronic cardiometabolic diseases (80.65; 90.70%). Progressive deterioration of clinical and functional parameters comes with age, which leads towards the increased risk of heart and metabolic diseases. In particular, increase of blood pressure (p &<0.01), BMI (p &<0.01) and total cholesterol (p &<0.01) was seen. Early detection of risk factors and prevention of their realization have to be reached by more active work of health centers and higher level of their attendance by young and middle-aged persons.
