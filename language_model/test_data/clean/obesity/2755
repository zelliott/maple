The phenotypic variability of patients with syndromes presenting with dysmorphism makes clinical diagnosis difficult, leading to an exhaustive genetic study to determine the underlying mechanism so that a proper diagnosis could be established.

To genetically characterize siblings, the older sister diagnosed with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and the younger one with CHARGE syndrome.

Clinical case report.

Clinical, biochemical, and radiological studies were performed on the family. In addition, molecular genetic studies including sequencing of GNAS, typing of microsatellites on 2q and 21q, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of subtelomeric regions were performed, as well as confirmatory fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis.

The genetic analysis revealed that both sisters presented a 2q37 deletion due to the maternal unbalanced segregation of a 2;21 translocation.

This is the first report of a 2q37 deletion where differential diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome is needed due to the appearance of choanal atresia.
