The magnitude of thermogenesis induced by a test meal (17% protein, 54% CHO, and 29% fat) was assessed using indirect calorimetry in six obese women before and after weight loss (mean loss: 11.2 kg) and compared with six nonobese matched controls at rest for 5 h and during and following graded moderate exercise on a bicycle ergometer at three workloads. The test meal contained 60% of the energy expended in basal state over 24 h (736-1020 kcal/meal according to the group). In obese subjects the net absolute increase in energy expenditure (delta EE) in response to the meal was similar between exercising and resting conditions (delta EE = 0.27 vs 0.32 kcal/min, respectively) but tended to be lower in obese women after weight loss (delta EE = 0.19 kcal/min while exercising and 0.25 kcal/min while resting, p less than 0.05) and in control subjects (delta EE = 0.16 vs. 0.25 kcal/min, respectively: p less than 0.05). These results show that the thermogenic response to a meal is not potentiated by moderate exercise.
