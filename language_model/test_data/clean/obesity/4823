Past studies have suggested that the stress-induced GLUT4 localization pathway is damaged in fast-twitch muscles (white muscles) of obese subjects. In this study, we used obese rodents in an attempt to determine whether the stress-induced GLUT4 localization pathway is abnormal in slow-twitch muscles (red muscles), which are responsible for most daily activities. Protein expression levels of the intracellular stress sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), its upstream kinase LKB1, its downstream protein AS160 and the glucose transporter protein 4 (GLUT4) in the red gastrocnemius muscle were measured under either resting or stress conditions (1 h of swimming or 14% hypoxia) in both lean and obese Zucker rats (n = 7 for each group). At rest, obese rats displayed higher fasting plasma insulin levels and increased muscle AMPK and AS160 phosphorylation levels compared with lean controls. No significant difference was found in the protein levels of LKB1, total GLUT4, or membrane GLUT4 between the obese and lean control groups. After one hour of swimming, AMPK and AS160 phosphorylation levels and the amount of GLUT4 translocated to the plasma membrane were significantly elevated in lean rats but remained unchanged in obese rats relative to their resting conditions. One hour 14% hypoxia did not cause significant changes in the LKB1-AMPK-AS160-GLUT4 pathway in either lean or obese rats. This study demonstrated that the AMPK-AS160-GLUT4 pathway was altered at basal levels and after exercise stimulation in the slow-twitch muscle of obese Zucker rats.
