Using a combined general anesthesia/epidural technique, two cases of intraoperative malfunctioning epidural catheters in obese patients are presented. After the epidural was found to be malfunctioning, the anesthesiologist placed the palm of both hands underneath the patients' lumbar and thoracic area. The epidural catheter with tape and subcutaneous tissue was pulled in both cases towards the head. In each case, this simple maneuver made the catheter function again. In conclusion, this simple corrective maneuver should be attempted prior to discarding the epidural anesthetic technique.
