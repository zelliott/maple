Few studies have investigated changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in surgical patients who have undergone a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Prospective data were obtained from 78 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG; mean age, 42.4 years; mean body weight, 131 kg; mean body mass index (BMI), 47 kg/m(2) (24.4% of superobese patients)). Two HRQOL questionnaires were administered preoperatively and 12 months postsurgery: the generic Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 and the weight-specific IWQOL-Lite questionnaire. Excess weight loss at 12 months was 57.18%. No mortality was recorded. HRQOL scores revealed a significant improvement in all areas of both questionnaires. However, changes in HRQOL were not associated consistently with amount of weight loss. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is an effective and safe procedure, with positive changes in health-related quality of life as well as weight reduction. A fruitful area for future research is the investigation of long-term changes in HRQOL after LSG.
