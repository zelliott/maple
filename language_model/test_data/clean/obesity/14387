Associations between food habits and body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) were explored in a cross-sectional study with 7410 men and 7257 women. High BMI was most strongly associated with low bread consumption and use of low-fat milk. Weaker positive associations were seen for coffee, fish and ground meat consumption, and with use of table fat with a low P/S-ratio. Negative associations were seen for use of fruits and vegetables and amount of table fat at each slice of bread. Inconsistent relationships were noted for use of alcohol. The results suggest that individuals to some extent have changed their food habits in order to keep the BMI within limits they consider to be normal, and underline the need for adjustment for BMI when e.g. relationships between the diet and blood lipids are studied.
