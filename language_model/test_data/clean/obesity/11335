There is compelling evidence that carbohydrate quality has important influences on cardiovascular disease, the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Cohort and interventional studies indicate that dietary fiber is an important determinant of satiation, satiety, and weight gain, and also protects against cardiovascular disease. Cohort studies have shown that vegetables and fruits protect against coronary heart disease, whereas whole grains provide protection against cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and weight gain. Dietary glycemia within the range eaten by most of the population seems not to have a significant influence on body weight, although it may influence waist circumference. There is strong evidence from interventional trials that dietary glycemia does influence insulin resistance and diabetes control. Moreover, replacing saturated fat with high-glycemic carbohydrate may increase cardiovascular risk. Soft drink consumption is a proven cause of weight gain, which may relate to the lack of satiation provided by these drinks. In large amounts, dietary fructose leads to greater adverse metabolic changes than equivalent amounts of glucose, although the extent to which fructose per se is contributing to many of the metabolic changes found in the obese, as distinct from the calories it provides, is still a matter of debate.
