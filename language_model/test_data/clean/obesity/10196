To examine the changes in the erectile function in diet-induced obese rats and investigate the oral efficacy of DA-8159, a new phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, on penile erection in obese rats.

The rats were fed a high-energy diet for 12 weeks and divided into three groups: an obesity-resistant (OR) control group, an obesity-prone (OP) control group, and an OP-DA-8159 treatment (DA-8159) group. The electrostimulation-induced erectile responses were measured in all groups. The body weight, plasma cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose levels were also measured.

In the OP control group, the maximum intracavernous pressure (ICP) and ICP/blood pressure (ICP/BP) ratio after electric stimulation were significantly lower than those in OR control group. The corresponding area under the curve (AUC) of the ICP/BP ratio, the detumescence time and the baseline cavernous pressure were also lower than those in the OR control group, but this difference was not significant. The body weight gain, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride level in the OP group were significantly higher than those in the OR group. After administering the DA-8159, a significant increase in the maximum ICP and the ICP/BP ratio were observed. The corresponding AUCs in the DA-8159 group were also higher than those in the two control groups. Furthermore, the detumescence time was significantly prolonged after treatment with DA-8159.

These results demonstrate that diet-induced obesity affects the erectile function in rats and these erectile dysfunction (ED) can be improved by the treatment with DA-8159, indicating DA-8159 might be a treatment option for ED associated with obesity.
