The link between uric acid levels and metabolic syndrome was investigated.

We used data for 997 men and 1290 women. Metabolic syndrome was defined by a new criterion in Japan and uric acid was measured.

Subjects who did not drink alcohol were evaluated. Uric acid was significantly higher in subjects with metabolic syndrome compared with subjects without the syndrome in both sexes. The presence of abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia in men and abdominal obesity in women revealed positive impacts on uric acid levels.

High serum uric acid may be often associated with metabolic syndrome in Japanese people, which accelerates the development of cardiovascular disease from metabolic syndrome.
