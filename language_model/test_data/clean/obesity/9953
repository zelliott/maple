The aim of this study was to know about the plasmatic variations of insulin and its potential origin in the obesity with or without abnormal tolerance to glucose. Obese patients with normal tolerance to glucose showed normal and hypersecretion of insulin during fasting and after oral overdose of glucose (OOG). Fasting hyperinsulinism in patients with normal secretion of insulin was due to a decrease in its hepatic clearance, whereas in patients with hypersecretion, it was due mainly to insulin hypersecretion. Most of the obese patients with glucose intolerance showed hypersecretion of insulin during fasting and after OOG, being their basal hyperinsulinism due to insulinic secretion. After the OOG, the hyperinsulinism due to insulin hypersecretion and/or a decrease in its hepatic clearance. In addition, we observed an inverse correlation between body mass index and obese patients with normal tolerance to glucose.
