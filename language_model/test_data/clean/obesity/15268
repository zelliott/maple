The levels of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing hormone (ir-CRH) were measured in discrete hypothalamic nuclei and the median eminence of obese Zucker rats and their lean littermates. More than 90% of total hypothalamic ir-CRH was detected in the median eminence in both obese and lean rats. Though ir-CRH levels in the paraventricular nucleus of obese rats tended to be lower than those of their lean littermates, no significant difference of ir-CRH levels was observed in any hypothalamic nuclei studied between obese and lean rats. However, ir-CRH levels in the median eminence of obese rats were significantly lower than those of their lean littermates (5263 +/- 438 pg/tissue vs. 7050 +/- 473 pg/tissue, P &<0.05). These results suggest that the hypoactive hypothalamic CRH tonus would play some role in the phenotypic expression of obesity in the genetically obese Zucker rats.
