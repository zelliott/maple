To investigate the antiobesity effect of Jueming Prescription (JMP), a Chinese herbal medicine formula, and its influence on mRNA expressions of beta3 adrenergic receptor (beta3-AR) and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) in adipose tissue of diet-induced obese rats.

Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the normal control group (n =8) that was on a standard chow diet, and the obese model group (n =42) that was on a diet of high fat chow. Two weeks after the high fat diet, 29 obese rats in the obese model group were further randomly divided into 3 groups: the untreated obese model group (n =9), the metformin group (n =10, metformin 300 mg kg⁻¹ day)⁻¹, and the JMP group (n =10, JMP 4 g kg⁻¹ day⁻¹). After 8-week treatment, body weight, wet weight of visceral fat, and percentage of body fat (PBF) were measured. The levels of fasting blood glucose, serum lipids, and insulin were assessed, and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was calculated. The adipose tissue section was stained with hematoxylin-Eosin, and the cellular diameter and quantity of adipocytes were evaluated by light microscopy. The mRNA expressions of beta3-AR and UCP-2 from the peri-renal fat tissue were determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Compared with the obese model group, treatment with JMP resulted in significantly lower body weight, wet weight of visceral fat, PBF, and diameter of adipocytes, and significantly higher level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, ISI (all P&<.01), JMP increased the mRNA expressions of beta3-AR and UCP-2 from perirenal fat tissue (P &<.05, P&<.01).

JMP could reduce body weight and adipocyte size; and the effect was associated with the up-regulation of beta3-AR and UCP-2 expressions in the adipose tissue and improvement of insulin sensitivity.
