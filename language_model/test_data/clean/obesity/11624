A study of blood pressure levels of 372 rural Zambian schoolchildren age 7-16 years showed that blood pressure increases with age. The association between age and blood pressure is decreased when growth is controlled for in the analysis. Girls tended to have either the same or slightly higher mean blood pressure levels at all ages than boys. The main determinants of blood pressure in the children were age, height and weight. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) values of the children were lower than those for Nigerian, American and worldwide adolescents of comparable age, whereas mean diastolic blood pressure values were similar to those of American and worldwide adolescents of comparable age. The associations between blood pressure and the three indices commonly used to measure relative obesity, i.e. weight-for-length, weight/height2 and weight/height,3 were only significant for weight-for-length after adjusting for height, suggesting that the other two indices may not be appropriate in studies focussed on children and should be applied with caution. The nonsignificant associations observed between blood pressure and the other two weight-for-height indices may be attributed to the almost nonexistence of obesity in this sample of children.

A researcher used data on 372 7-16 year old children from 2 rural primary schools in Zambia collected between October 1986-June 1988 to learn blood pressure levels in health school age children and to see of an association between blood pressure and age, sex, height, and weight exists.  Overall blood pressure increased gradually with age (p.05), but when the researcher controlled for growth, the association between age and blood pressure diminished.  Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of girls either remained the same or were higher than those of boys which may be explained by hormonal and other changes during puberty.  Age, height, and weight were the leading determinants of blood pressure (p.001).  The Zambian children's mean SBP levels stood lower than those of Nigerian and US children of comparable age and those from children worldwide of comparable age, but DBP levels paralleled those of US and worldwide children.  After the researcher adjusted for height, blood pressure was only significant with weight for length (p.05), but not with the other indices used to measure relative obesity (weight/height sq. and weight/height cubed).  Thus these 2 other indices may not be applicable to studies on children.  Further the nonsignificance of blood pressure with these other 2 indices may indicate limited obesity among these children.
