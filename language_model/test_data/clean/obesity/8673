5 days of lowering of body mass followed by body mass gain up to its presurgery value 3 weeks after tonsillectomy was observed in 76 young men aged 15-17. These changes are explained by post-tonsillectomy diet. 247 adolescents with chronic tonsillitis had height and body mass greater than those in control group of 364 healthy subjects. Still higher mass and height were registered in 109 youths 2 years after tonsillectomy. Many of the latter had obesity.
