Cardio-metabolic profile is influenced by modest modifications of body weight An increased body mass index (BMI) is associated with the metabolic syndrome (MS) and parameters composing it. There is a quasi linear relationship between BMI and number of MS components: an increase in BMI is associated with increasing number of cardio-metabolic alterations. This relationship exists not only in subjects with established obesity but also in those who are overweight or even have normal body weight. It has been also shown that a modest weight gain is associated with an increase in the number of MS components which, in turn, could contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. On the other hand, a modest weight loss is associated with decrease of MS components number and improvement of the cardio-metabolic profile.
