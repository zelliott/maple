The consumption of nutrients by rodents is markedly influenced by the number of containers of each nutrient provided. Most rats given a choice from separate sources of protein, carbohydrate, and fat thrived if given one cup of each but half failed to thrive if given one cup of each and three extra cups of carbohydrate or fat. Rats given five bottles of sucrose solution and one bottle of water became fatter than rats given five bottles of water and one of sucrose. These studies in rats may point to a model for human obesity, in which the availability of food can override physiological controls of ingestion.
