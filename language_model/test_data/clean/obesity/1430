There has been recurring interest over nearly three decades in preferences for different disabilities. In the present study, the perceptions of eight disabilities were compared across three groups, 42 occupational therapy students, 20 formerly obese, and 166 of the general community. A disability ranking task was adapted from a forced-choice task used by other researchers. Consistent with previous results, blindness was ranked as most difficult to live with. Contrary to prediction, there was no significant difference between the formerly obese subsample and the general community in their ranking of obesity; however, these groups differed in their ranking of diabetes. There were minor differences between the students and other groups. Across the entire sample, the disability of 'needing a hearing aid' was ranked as easiest to live with. Implications of the results are discussed, and suggestions made for further research.
