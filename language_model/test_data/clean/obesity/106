Current data indicate that correction of one or more risk factors results in a decrease in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is important, therefore, to identify early the high-risk individual who has one or more risk factors and to introduce treatment before the development of cardiovascular disease. Evidence to date suggests that correction of risk factors after the development of cardiovascular disease is less likely to show a beneficial effect on the progression of the cardiovascular disease. Treatment of cardiovascular risk factors is warranted and outweighs the minimal risk that such treatment may entail.
