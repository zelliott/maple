The menopausal status is associated with an increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Since the post-menopausal modifications have not been clearly investigated in obese women, we evaluated the influences of menopausal status on anthropometric, hormonal and biochemical characteristics in selected groups of normal-weight and obese women. We studied 92 female outpatients: 24 normal-weight pre-menopausal (Pre-NW) [body mass index (BMI) 23.6 +/- 0.48, age 44.8 +/- 0.68], 24 normal-weight post-menopausal (Post-NW) (BMI 23.7 +/- 0.44, age 55.5 +/- 0.69), 24 obese pre-menopausal (pre-OB) (BMI 32.3 +/- 0.45, age 44.6 +/- 0.75), 20 obese post-menopausal women (Post-OB) (BMI 32.9 +/- 0.57, age 55.2 +/- 0.82). All the subjects were non smokers and free from hypertension, diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Anthropometric parameters, body composition, 17 beta-estradiol, LH, FSH, androstenedione, SHBG, testosterone and leptin were determined. Free androgen index (FAI) and insulin resistance index (HOMA) were calculated. In comparison with Pre-OB, Post-OB had higher values of waist circumferences (p &<0.02), while Post-NW showed no difference. Total and LDL-cholesterol were high in Post-NW women, whereas in the obese subjects they were already elevated in the premenopausal period. SHBG levels declined and FAI increased in Post-OB in comparison with Pre-OB. SHBG levels showed an inverse correlation with BMI, waist and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), while FAI positively correlated with waist values. Serum leptin levels were higher in Post-OB than in Pre-OB, whereas they were similar in normal-weight women. The rise of leptin levels may be related to the greater abdominal fat deposition. In addition, menopausal status of uncomplicated obese women is associated with a greater abdominal fat deposition and with higher values of free androgen index, which may be considered as factors of cardiovascular risk.
