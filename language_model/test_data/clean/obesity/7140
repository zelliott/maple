The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension in the rural adults of Liaoning province of China.

The study was conducted in 2004-2006, using a multistage cluster sampling method to select a representative sample. A total of 45925 adults, 35 years or older, were examined. Two blood pressure measurements were obtained by trained observers by use of a standardized electric sphygmomanometer after a 5-min sitting rest. Information on the history of hypertension was obtained by use of a standard questionnaire.

Overall, the prevalence of prehypertension was 44.1%; for men 48.7 and women 39.6%. The prevalence of hypertension was 37.8%; for men 37.0 and women 38.6%. Among hypertensive patients, only 29.5% patients were aware of their high blood pressure, 23.6% patients were taking antihypertensive medication, and 1.1% patients achieved blood pressure control.

Prehypertension and hypertension are highly prevalent in rural areas of China. The percentage of those with hypertension who are aware, treated, and controlled are unacceptably low. These results underscore the urgent need to develop strategies to improve prevention, detection, and treatment of hypertension in rural areas of China.
