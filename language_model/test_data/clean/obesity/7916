The purpose of this study was to determine if Disodium Ascorbyl Phytostanol Phosphates (FM-VP4) alters animal body weight and plasma lipid levels in a dietary-induced obese mouse model.

Twenty-four C57BL6 mice (28 days old) were housed individually and fed a standard mouse diet for 2 weeks upon arrival. After 2 weeks the animals were weighed and divided in 4 groups of similar average weight, and the groups received a low fat (10% kcal from fat) and high fat (45% kcal from fat) diet with or without FM-VP4 (2% w/w) for 12 continuous weeks. Food, water and caloric intake and body weight were recorded on a daily basis throughout the duration of the study. Following the 12th week of the study all animals were humanely sacrificed and blood and abdominal fat pads were harvested for further analysis. Plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, AST/ALT and creatinine levels were measured using enzymatic kits.

There is a significant difference in weight gain between the low-fat diet and the low-fat diet + 2% w/w FM-VP4 treatment groups (P&<.05), as well as between the high-fat diet and the high-fat diet + 2% w/w FM-VP4 treatment groups (P&<.05). However, the reduction of weight gain of the high-fat diet + 2% FM-VP4 treatment group compared to the high-fat group was 51%, while the reduction in weight gain between the low-fat diet + 2% w/w FM-VP4 treatment group and the low-fat diet group was 17% over the duration of the study. No significant differences in food and water intakes, serum creatinine and AST/ALT levels were observed between the four groups. No significant differences in caloric intake between the low-fat diet and the low-fat diet + 2% w/w FM-VP4. However, a significant difference in caloric intake between high-fat diet and the high-fat diet + 2% w/w FM-VP4 treatment groups was observed. In addition, significant reductions in plasma cholesterol levels and abdominal fat pad weight between diet alone and diet + FM-VP4 treatment groups were observed.

These findings suggest that FM-VP4 may have potential weight-loss and cholesterol lowering activity in both High Fat and Low Fat Diets treated groups.
