The problem of obesity in children has grown considerably in recent years in the United States as well as the rest of the world. This has resulted in a marked increase in the prevalence of nonalcoholic liver disease in the pediatric age group. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common hepatic disorder seen in pediatric hepatology practice.

We have reviewed the most recent literature regarding the prevalence, pathogenesis as well as the most recent advances in the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities of NAFLD in children.

NAFLD affects a substantial portion of the population including children.

The rising incidence of NAFLD, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis emphasizes the need for effective treatment options. The lack of complete understanding of the pathogenesis of NAFLD still limits our ability to develop novel therapeutic modalities that can target the metabolic derangements implicated in the development of the disorder.
