Performing bilateral autologous breast reconstruction using the abdominal donor site usually entails harvesting one flap from each hemiabdomen. However, the overlapping vascular territories of the superior epigastric, deep inferior epigastric, superficial inferior epigastric, and superficial circumflex iliac vessels make it theoretically possible to harvest two flaps based on vessels from one hemiabdomen. This may be useful in the obese patient, where one hemiabdomen may provide adequate tissue to reconstruct two breasts. The authors describe three clinical scenarios where they have used this principle, including the first reports in the literature of metachronous and synchronous bilateral breast reconstructions using two flaps based on pedicles from a single hemiabdomen.
