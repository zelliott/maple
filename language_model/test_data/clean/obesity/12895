The aim of our study was to estimate the effect of fasting and physical exercise on a treadmill on plasma leptin concentrations in high-fat fed rats. Male Wistar rats were injected a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ) or buffer at 2 days of age and later fed a standard or high-fat diet (HFD). Plasma leptin was measured by RIA method in all the groups studied in basal conditions, after 48h fasting, a single bout of exhaustive exercise, and 4 weeks of exercise training. Plasma leptin concentrations were markedly elevated in the HFD and STZ/HFD groups compared to the control group. The significant correlation between plasma leptin and body weight was noted. Fasting and exercise training decreased plasma leptin in similar percentage in all the groups studied. The observed decrease was greater than expected from changes in body weight. We conclude that high-fat feeding results in an increase in plasma leptin levels in rats independently of plasma insulin or daily calorie intake. High-fat fed rats have maintained leptin response to fasting and exercise training. The reduction in plasma leptin after exercise training is partly independent on changes in body weight or plasma insulin.
