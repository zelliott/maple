To observe the prevalence and distribution of ideal cardiovascular health behavior.

Health examination data between 2008 to 2009 from the employees of Kailuan Group were analyzed.

A total of 101 333 subjects took part in the health examination, subjects with previous myocardial infarction (n = 871), stroke (n = 2255), myocardial infarction and stroke (n = 162) and subjects with incomplete examination data (n = 9311) were excluded and 88 534 subjects were included for final analysis [mean age (50.6 Â± 12.3) years, male 69 916]. (1) Body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic pressure, cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride were significantly higher in males than in females (all P &<0.05), women's income and the education lever were significantly higher than men (P &<0.05). (2) The distribution of ideal cardiovascular health behavior (smoking, BMI, physical exercise, salt intake) was 55.8%, 41.4%, 18.9% and 14.0% respectively among the population; the ideal cardiovascular factors (fasting blood glucose, TC, blood pressure) was 80.9%, 61.8% and 18.5%, respectively. (3) The subjects with distribution of seven, six, five, four ideal cardiovascular health behavior and factors was 0.1%, 1.9%, 9.1%, 20.3%, respectively. (4) Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that female, age &<55 and high education level were associated with the ideal cardiovascular health status with a RR value (95%CI) of 4.52 (4.32 - 4.72), 1.46 (1.39 - 1.53) and 2.23 (2.10 - 2.37), respectively.

The prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health is extremely low in the study population, most persons were not in the ideal cardiovascular health behavior and factors and female, age &<55 and high education level are linked with ideal cardiovascular health status.
