Adiponectin increases insulin sensitivity, protects arterial walls against atherosclerosis, and regulates glucose metabolism, and is decreased in obese, insulin resistant, and type 2 diabetic patients. Adiponectin circulates in plasma as high, medium, and low molecular weight forms (HMW, MMW, and LMW). The HMW form was suggested to be closely associated with insulin sensitivity. This study investigated whether diet-induced changes in insulin sensitivity were associated with changes in adiponectin multimeric complexes.

Twenty obese women with highest and twenty obese women with lowest diet induced changes in insulin sensitivity (responders and non-responders respectively), matched for weight loss (body mass index (BMI)=34.5 (s.d. 2.9) resp. 36.5 kg/m(2) (s.d. 4.0) for responders and non-responders), were selected from 292 women who underwent a 10-week low-caloric diet (LCD; 600 kcal/d less than energy requirements). Plasma HMW, MMW, and LMW forms of adiponectin were quantified using Western blot method.

LCD induced comparable weight reduction in responders and non-responders by 8.2 and 7.6 kg. Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index decreased by 48.1% in responders and remained unchanged in non-responders. Total plasma adiponectin and the quantity of HMW and MMW remained unchanged in both groups, while LMW increased by 16.3% in non-responders. No differences between both groups were observed at baseline and after the study. Total plasma adiponectin, MMW, and LMW were negatively associated with fasting insulin levels at baseline.

No differences in total plasma adiponectin, HMW, MMW, and LMW forms were observed between responders and non-responders following 10-week LCD, suggesting that adiponectin is not a major determinant of weight loss-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity.
