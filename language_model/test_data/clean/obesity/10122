In this article we report a new technique for the treatment of recurrent large abdominal hernias and skin laxity: the overlap flap. This technique combines abdominoplasty with hernia repair. Obese patients with recurrent large abdominal hernias and skin laxity could benefit from this operation. This operation could not be performed in patients with a wide absence of the abdominal wall. A total of six patients were treated with this technique in our clinic. Follow-up of the patients has ranged from 1 to 4 years. Cosmetic results were excellent in all patients. No recurrence of the hernias has been observed in any of the patients. Two flaps are prepared; the lower one is deepithelialized, and it is used as an autogenous mesh in place of a prosthetic material to reinforce the abdominal wall, and the upper flap is prepared and overlapped on this lower one.
