Melanocortin obesity develops after puberty in mice with Agouti yellow mutation. The aim of the work was to study dynamics of the main characteristics oflipidcarbohydrate metabolism during the obesity development. We used female mice of C57BI/6J strain homozygous for recessive mutation nonagouti (a/a-mice) who were predisposed to the obesity, and heterozygous for dominant mutation Agouti yellow (Ay-mice) who were not predisposed to the obesity. Food consumption and body weights were measured from week 4 to week 22. Some animals were decapitated on 8, 11, 13, 15, 22 weeks. Hyperphagia (6 week) proceeds to body weight increasing (7 week) in the Ay-mice. In the Ay-mice compared to a/a-mice, adiposyte size and blood level of leptin were increased on the 11th week, blood levels of fatty acids and glucose--on the 13th week, blood level of insulin--on the 15th week. The hyperphagia seems to promote development ofmelanocortin obesity, stable disturbances of lipid metabolism appearing before those in glucose metabolism. Complete metabolic obesity syndrome was formed after the 15th week of life.
