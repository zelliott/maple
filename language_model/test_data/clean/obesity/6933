The possibility to separate 11 patients with anatomically and histologically proven Cushing's syndrome from those 23 with Cushing's syndrome imitating obesity on the basis of 2 anamnestical, 10 physical and 8 basic laboratory and instrumental examinations was studied with the aid of a pattern recognition procedure by computer. Both groups were well distinguished one from another. The sensitivity of Cushing's diagnosis was 73%, its specificity 100% and effectivity 91%. The most important sign appeared the muscle hypotrophy of the proximal limb girdle.
