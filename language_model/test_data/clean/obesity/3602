We aim to explore the relationship of neck circumference to metabolic syndrome (MetS) and obesity in Chinese elders and to establish cut-off points of the neck circumference for MetS and obesity.

Cross-sectional analysis for a population sample of 2092 individuals aged over 65 years, representative of East China elders. MetS was identified according to the 2004 Chinese Diabetes Society criteria.

Neck circumference was correlated with body mass index (r = 0.70, p = 0.000 in men, and r = 0.73, p = 0.000 in women) and waist circumference (waist circumference; r = 0.70, p = 0.000 in men, and r = 0.72, p = 0.000 in women). According to neck circumference quartile, the prevalence of MetS and its components were increased significantly from Q1 to Q4 (p for trend &<.001) in both genders. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that both waist circumference and neck circumference were independent predictors of Mets, with odds ratios (95% confidence interval) 1.11 (1.08-1.15; p = 0.044) and 1.17 (1.07-1.28; p = 0.000), respectively, in men and 1.08 (1.05-1.10; p = 0.000) and 1.31 (1.21-1.42; p = 0.000), respectively, in women. As for obesity, the significant independent indicators in both genders were also waist circumference and neck circumference (all p &<0.01). In the receiver operating characteristic curves, both the optimal cut-off points of neck circumference for MetS and obesity were 38 cm in men and 35 cm in women.

The neck circumference, as waist circumference, is also a valuable tool for identifying MetS and obesity, with established cut-off points for the prediction of MetS and obesity in Chinese elders.
