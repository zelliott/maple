Approximately 3,000 women die each year in the United States of carcinoma of the endometrium. Statistics which have been complied by the American Cancer Society record 39,000 new instances each year. This high cure rate is dependent upon the frequent and correct use of diagnostic techniques and the excellent patient education programs now in use. The results of this study also collaborate the value and cost effectiveness of the patient receiving treatment in community-based comprehensive therapy centers or properly equipped hospitals. In this survey, patients are identified who are at high risk for having carcinoma of the endometrium and prognostic factors which are frequently discovered by careful pretherapy evaluation are discussed. The current therapy methods being used today are presented so that trends are easily detected. The data entered by 546 participating hospitals are not to be used as a guide to therapy, but as a study of the current state of the art in the treatment of this malignant disease.
