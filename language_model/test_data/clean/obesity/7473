Primary cilia are sensory organelles that protrude from the surface of most mammalian cell types. In humans and mice, mutations in proteins required for normal cilia function have been identified as causing a class of disorders with overlapping phenotypes known as ciliopathies. Recent evidence has linked obesity in ciliopathies to both the regulation of energy homeostasis in the hypothalamus and to adipogenesis. This article considers the role of cilia in these processes and whether cilia dysfunction may be relevant to more common forms of obesity.
