The GDR-MONICA project comprises 25 administratively defined areas with a population of nearly two million people aged 25-64. Data from the first random sample survey are reported here. The survey gathered information regarding risk factors, dietary behaviour, physical activity and psychosocial factors from 11,281 persons aged 25-64. The average risk factor levels were high in the population: The mean casual blood pressure was 140/88 mmHg and 138/86 mmHg for men and women respectively. In both sexes the mean total cholesterol level exceeded 6.1 mmol/L, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was just over 26.0. The study population consumed, on average, excessive amounts of energy, fat, alcohol, and sodium, and too few carbohydrates. Preliminary conclusions regarding unfavourable trends in risk factor levels have been drawn by comparing the present data with other recent reliable epidemiological studies.
