Individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and/or impaired fasting glucose (IFG) are at high risk, not only to develop diabetes mellitus, but also to experience an adverse cardiovascular (CV) event (myocardial infarction, stroke, CV death) later in life. The underlying pathophysiologic disturbances (insulin resistance and impaired Î²-cell function) responsible for the development of type 2 diabetes are maximally/near maximally expressed in subjects with IGT/IFG. These individuals with so-called prediabetes manifest all of the same CV risk factors (dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, insulin resistance, procoagulant state, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation) that place patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for macrovascular complications. The treatment of these CV risk factors should follow the same guidelines established for patients with type 2 diabetes, and should be aggressively followed to reduce future CV events.
