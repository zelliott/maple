Leptin is a key signal linking peripheral adiposity levels to the regulation of energy homeostasis in the brain. The injection of leptin decreases body weight and food intake in lean rodents; however, in a rodent model of high fat diet-induced obesity (DIO), the exogenous leptin cannot improve adiposity. This ineffectiveness is known as leptin resistance, and the factors downstream of leptin signaling have received attention as viable targets in the treatment of obesity. We previously reported that the histaminergic system is one of the targets of leptin. In the present study, the effect of an H(3)-receptor inverse agonist on hypothalamic histamine release and energy intake was investigated in normal and DIO mice. Leptin (1.3 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased hypothalamic histamine release and reduced 12 h-energy intake in normal mice, but had no such effects in DIO mice. In contrast, clobenpropit (5 mg/kg, i.p.), an H(3)-inverse agonist, elicited a significant increase in histamine release in both types of mice. Clobenpropit did not reduce 12 h-energy intake; however, it decreased 3 h-energy intake in both types of mice. These results suggest that lack of the activation of the histaminergic system partly contributes to obesity in DIO mice and direct activation of the histaminergic system circumvents leptin resistance.
