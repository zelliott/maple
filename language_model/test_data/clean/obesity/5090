It was established that alimentary obesity in rats was accompanied by a considerable elevation of the blood insulin level. Under these conditions the number of receptors to insulin on the rat liver cell plasmatic membranes decreased 1 1/2 to 2 times depending on the obesity degree. The receptor affinity to the hormone remained unchanged. It was shown that the receptor density to insulin on adipocytes isolated from the rat fatty tissue was sharply reduced, the decrease being correlated with the biological effect lowering of insulin in this tissue.
