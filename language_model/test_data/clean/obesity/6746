This commentary reviews the 9 articles in the Special Issue on Innovative Treatment and Prevention Programs for Pediatric Overweight and Obesity. Taking a socio-ecological perspective, contextual factors such as characteristics of the child, family, community, and culture are offered as ways to improve treatment and prevention programs. Using a more tailored approach that takes into account individual differences in family communication patterns and problem solving is warranted. Pediatric psychologists are urged to consider the role of prevention and targeted efforts during early childhood to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity.
