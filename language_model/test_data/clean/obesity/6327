Chronic renal failure and ESRD are major causes of morbidity, mortality, and chronic disability in patients in the United States. Hypertension is a major underlying cause of chronic progressive renal disease and continues to be a leading reason for the heavy burden of ESRD observed in African Americans. Hypertension is actually a syndrome of vascular pathology manifesting itself in patients by a constellation of common findings and attributes. These pathophysiologic alterations include dysregulation of arterial compliance, endothelial dysfunction, obesity and insulin resistance, abnormal sympathetic nervous system activation, accelerated atherosclerosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and a propensity for increased vascular thrombogenesis among others. This review will focus on some of the important mechanisms possibly involved in the progression of renal disease in the setting of chronic hypertension.
