Fifty non-diabetic, young Chinese hypertensives were compared to their normotensive siblings with respect to body fat distribution and fasting lipid and glucose (FPG) profiles. Sitting BP in hypertensives met conventional hypertension criteria after a 4-week washout period on placebo. Hypertensives had greater body mass index (BMI), subscapular skin-fold thickness (SFT), waist circumference (W), waist-to-height (WHtR) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), p&<.0001 for all. Higher triglycerides (p=0.004) and lower HDL-cholesterol (p=0.015) concentrations were also observed. Weight, W, WHtR and BMI were higher in hypertensives in both male (n=9) and female gender-concordant sibling pairs (n=21). Higher WHR, hip circumference and subscapular SFT were only seen in the male hypertensives. Hypertension is associated with central adiposity and adverse lipid profiles in this group of young hypertensives, supporting the hypothesis that obesity, particularly central, is closely associated with hypertension in Chinese as in other ethnic groups.
