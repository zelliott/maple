This review covers surveys of nutritional intake in adolescents living in several countries of Western Europe. Current definitions of nutritional status are discussed, with a special emphasis on adolescent years. It is generally observed that obesity rates are increasing (especially those of massive obesity) in young people, whereas declared energy intakes are decreasing. Average daily energy input seems adequate in adolescents of Western Europe. However, fat (especially saturated) intake is high while that of CHO and fiber is low. Proteins are mainly (two-thirds) from animal sources. Average micronutrient intakes correspond to recommended values in most cases, but there are a few exceptions (calcium and iron) that are low, particularly in girls. Specific problems become frequent at adolescence, such as dieting, smoking, getting low quality foods away from the home, etc. These behaviors may induce adverse nutritional conditions. On average, nutritional problems at adolescence do not appear to be more severe than at other ages, however they may exert a strong deleterious impact on future health.
