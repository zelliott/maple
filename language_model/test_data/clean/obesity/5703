The levels of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing hormone (ir-CRH) were measured in discrete brain regions and pituitary of obese Zucker rats and their lean littermates. Ir-CRH levels were lower in the hypothalamus and neurointermediate pituitary but higher in the striatum and cerebellum of obese Zucker rats than those of lean littermates. These results suggest some abnormalities in the CRH regulating system in obese Zucker rats.
