Obesity, currently affecting&>20% of the adult population in most Western countries, is a major risk factor for the development of hypertension. Hypertension in obese patients is, in the majority of instances, further complicated by the concomitant presence of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. The latter is reflected by derangement of glucose homeostasis, ranging from hyperinsulinemia to frank type 2 diabetes. Hypertension in obese patients is also associated with an increased risk for left ventricular hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, renal hyperfiltration, microalbuminuria, and elevated markers of inflammation. Sodium retention, volume expansion, and increased cardiac output are common findings in obese individuals. These changes are largely attributable to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and insufficient suppression of the renin-angiotensin system. Recent data show increased expression of angiotensin II-forming enzymes in adipose tissue, and increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system has recently been implicated in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Accordingly, antihypertensive agents that block the renin-angiotensin system might be a beneficial strategy for treatment of obesity-related hypertension. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin type-1 receptor blockers have been associated with favorable metabolic properties and end-organ protection in addition to their antihypertensive effects. Data from ongoing large trials will provide an indication of the protective and preventive effects of these treatment strategies while offering insights into the mechanisms linking obesity, hypertension, and other facets of the metabolic syndrome.
