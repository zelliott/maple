The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of such ischaemic heart disease (IHD) risk factors as cigarette smoking and overweight, and the degree of IHD risk in the Polish and Slovak populations. The investigated population consisted of men aged 45-54 years; 2944 of them were from industrial plants in Warsaw, with response rate of 88.4%, and 698 from plants in Bratislava (response rate: 64.5%). 60.4% of the Warsaw group were cigarette smokers, with average daily consumption of 12.7 cigarettes; the respective values in the Bratislava group were lower (46.4%; 9.2 cigarettes). The mean body weight and the prevalence of overweight were higher in Bratislava (79.6 kg; 25.6%) than in Warsaw (77.9 kg; 20.8%). The IHD risk evaluated according to the multilogistic function was higher in Bratislava. It is concluded that the difference in the IHD death rate found in these cities could to a high extent be explained by the difference in the prevalence of risk factors.
