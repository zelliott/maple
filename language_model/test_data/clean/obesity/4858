Leptin is a recently isolated circulating peptide hormone that is primarily synthesized and secreted by adipocytes. One of the major functions of this hormone is the control of energy balance by binding to receptors in the hypothalamus, leading to reduction in food intake, elevation in temperature and energy expenditure. In addition, increasing evidence suggests that leptin, through both direct and indirect actions, may play an important role in cardiovascular and renal functions. While the relevance of endogenous leptin needs further clarification, it appears to be a potential pressure- and volume-regulating factor, and may function pathophysiologically as a common link to obesity and hypertension.
