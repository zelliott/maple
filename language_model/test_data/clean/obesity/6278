Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps coupled with an injection of [2-3H]deoxyglucose were performed in rats 1 or 6 wk after lesion of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and their age-matched controls. In the basal state, glucose utilization was not different in controls and VMH rats in all the tissues studied except in white adipose tissue where it was greatly increased after the lesion. When insulinemia was clamped at 850 microU/ml, glucose utilization was less important in glycolytic and normal in oxidative muscles in animals 1 wk after the lesion (VMH1) compared with controls. In animals 6 wk after the lesion (VMH6), all the muscles utilized less glucose than those of controls. In white adipose tissue, glucose utilization was increased twice more in VMH1 and returned to normal in VMH6. These data demonstrate a progressive development of insulin resistance in muscles. Simultaneously, there is a transient insulin hypersensitivity in white adipose tissue. This, together with a hypersecretion of insulin, could contribute to the development of body fat mass by redirecting glucose towards adipose tissue.
