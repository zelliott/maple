The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that limit the use of venoactive drugs (VADs), especially in patient with chronic venous disorders (CVD) noncompliant with compression therapy in a nationwide survey.

Analysis included 5134 CVD patients compliant with compression therapy and 4663 of those not accepting such method of therapy, participating in a large survey.

Venoactive drugs (VADs) and topical agents were used significantly less frequently by patients noncompliant with compression therapy compared to the compliant population (95.2% vs. 97.7%, P&<.001 and 70.1% vs. 79.9%, P&<.001, respectively). There were also less patients on two VADs concurrently in these subgroups (14.6% vs. 24.6%, P&<.001 respectively). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that noncompliant also have decreased adherence to Ruscus aculeatus extracts (OR=0.870), micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) preparations (OR=0.886), and topical agents (OR=0.877), but not horse chestnuts seed extracts. Coexisting obesity and other chronic illnesses were among the factors that decreased the use of Ruscus aculeatus extracts and micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) preparations. The use of topical agents was reduced with age, male sex, patients with coexisting chronic illnesses, obesity and adverse to accepting compression therapy. Additionally diuretics, antiplatelet agents and low-molecular weight heparins were less frequently used in the noncompliant population.

Patients who are not compliant with compression therapy are more frequently not adherent to pharmacological therapy. Coexisting obesity and other chronic illnesses demonstrate decrease in adherence to CVD pharmacotherapy.
