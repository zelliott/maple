American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Public Education describes the possible negative health effects of television viewing on children and adolescents, such as violent or aggressive behavior, substance use, sexual activity, obesity, poor body image, and decreased school performance. In addition to the television ratings system and the v-chip (electronic device to block programming), media education is an effective approach to mitigate these potential problems. The European Society of Social Paediatrics (ESSOP) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) offers a list of recommendations on this issue for pediatricians and for parents, the federal government, and entertainment industry.
