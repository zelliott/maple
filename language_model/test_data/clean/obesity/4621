Assessing energy requirements is a fundamental activity in clinical dietetics practice. A study was designed to determine whether published linear regression equations were accurate for predicting resting energy expenditure (REE) in fasted Hispanic children with obesity (aged 7 to 15 years). REE was measured using indirect calorimetry; body composition was estimated with whole-body air displacement plethysmography. REE was predicted using four equations: Institute of Medicine for healthy-weight children (IOM-HW), IOM for overweight and obese children (IOM-OS), Harris-Benedict, and Schofield. Accuracy of the prediction was calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the measured and predicted REE divided by the measured REE, expressed as a percentage. Predicted values within 85% to 115% of measured were defined as accurate. Participants (n=58; 53% boys) were mean age 11.8±2.1 years, had 43.5%±5.1% body fat, and had a body mass index of 31.5±5.8 (98.6±1.1 body mass index percentile). Measured REE was 2,339±680 kcal/day; predicted REE was 1,815±401 kcal/day (IOM-HW), 1,794±311 kcal/day (IOM-OS), 1,151±300 kcal/day (Harris-Benedict), and, 1,771±316 kcal/day (Schofield). Measured REE adjusted for body weight averaged 32.0±8.4 kcal/kg/day (95% confidence interval 29.8 to 34.2). Published equations predicted REE within 15% accuracy for only 36% to 40% of 58 participants, except for Harris-Benedict, which did not achieve accuracy for any participant. The most frequently accurate values were obtained using IOM-HW, which predicted REE within 15% accuracy for 55% (17/31) of boys. Published equations did not accurately predict REE for youth in the study sample. Further studies are warranted to formulate accurate energy prediction equations for this population.
