Independently of the amount of adipose tissue, certain patterns of fat distribution increase the risk of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Although the ratio of waist to hip (WHR) circumferences has been consistently related to diabetes mellitus, it is possible that only two measures do not completely characterize fat topography. The current study, therefore, examines the cross-sectional relation of six girths (waist, hip, neck, bust, wrist, and ankle) to diabetes mellitus in 43,595 women. As compared with non-diabetics, Quetelet index (kg/m2) and all circumferences were elevated among diabetics. Stratified analyses showed that WHR, and waist, neck, and bust girths were consistently related to diabetes independently of the degree of overweight. As estimated from a logistic regression model that simultaneously controlled for age and all anthropometric variables, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was positively related to Quetelet index, and to the waist, bust, and neck girths, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.4 to 2.6. However, diabetes was inversely related to hip (OR = 0.61) and ankle (OR = 0.73) girths; p less than 0.005 for each association. Although cross-sectional in nature, these results suggest that an adverse body fat distribution is not limited to the abdominal region, but that a relative preponderance of adipose tissue in various regions of the upper body is associated with diabetes mellitus in women.
