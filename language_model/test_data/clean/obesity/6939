Previous analysis based on data derived from a prevalence study of hypertension among workers in different economic activities in the Greater Metropolitan Area of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, have shown separate effects of biologic and social attributes on diastolic blood pressure levels (DBP). The present paper explores joint effects of sociodemographic, anthropometric, and behavioral characteristics on blood pressure levels. For that purpose, the Morgan-Sonquist procedure on interaction effects in the prediction of DBP levels was used. Six independent variables emerged as predictors: age, Quetelet index, occupation, schooling years, subsector of the economy, and smoking. Very young and lean women who were also smokers had the lowest mean DBP levels (66.1 mm Hg). Young, overweight women without college education showed intermediate levels (71.5 mm Hg). Highest levels were found among older women in production-linked occupations engaged in transportation and metallurgy activities (89.5 mm Hg). The study suggests that the potential role of work-related characteristics on blood pressure levels is greatest among older women.
