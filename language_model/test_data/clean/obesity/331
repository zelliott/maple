The development of insulin resistance in the obese is associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation. We aimed to identify novel links between obesity, insulin resistance and the inflammatory response by comparing C57BL/6 with type I interleukin-1 receptor knockout (IL-1RI(-/-)) mice, which are protected against diet-induced insulin resistance. Mice were fed a high-fat diet for 16 wk. Insulin sensitivity was measured and proteomic analysis was performed on adipose, hepatic and skeletal muscle tissues. Despite an equal weight gain, IL-1RI(-/-) mice had lower plasma glucose, insulin and triacylglycerol concentrations, compared with controls, following dietary treatment. The higher insulin sensitivity in IL-1RI(-/-) mice was associated with down-regulation of antioxidant proteins and proteasomes in adipose tissue and hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase, consistent with a compromised inflammatory response as well as increased glycolysis and decreased fatty acid beta-oxidation in their muscle. Their lower hepatic triacylglycerol concentrations may reflect decreased flux of free fatty acids to the liver, decreased hepatic fatty acid-binding protein expression and decreased lipogenesis. Correlation analysis revealed down-regulation of classical biomarkers of ER stress in their adipose tissue, suggesting that disruption of the IL-1RI-mediated inflammatory response may attenuate cellular stress, which was associated with significant protection from diet-induced insulin resistance, independent of obesity.
