Healthy eating is important for obesity control. Dietary interventions target the adoption of behavioral strategies to increase fiber and decrease fat consumption. However, little is known about the contributions of psychosocial factors to the use of these strategies.

This study examined psychosocial correlates of behavioral strategies for healthy eating among Latinas.

Participants included 361 Latino mothers living along the U.S.-Mexico border in California. Data included measures of sociodemographics, acculturation, and psychosocial determinants of healthy eating. A 30-item dietary behavioral strategies scale assessed strategies to increase fiber and decrease fat consumption.

Family interactions regarding dietary habits (β = .224, p &<.001) and financial status (β = .148, p = .029) were associated with the use of strategies to decrease fat consumption. Positive family interactions regarding dietary habits (β = .226, p &<.001), fewer barriers to obtaining fruits and vegetables (β = -.207, p &<.001), and more family support for vegetable purchasing (β = .070, p = .047) were associated with use of strategies to increase fiber consumption.

Future interventions would benefit from improving family systems associated with healthy eating.
