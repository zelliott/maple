EUROASPIRE study has been carried out in 9 European countries with the aim of assessing coronary risk factors in high-risk patients admitted to hospital to undergo coronary revascularization procedures (coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting) or because of angina or myocardial infarction. The results of the initial stage of the study in Italy, investigating the data from 691 hospital medical records, showed that management of risk factors in these patients was inferior than expected. In particular, the prevalence of hyperlipidaemia (63%), hypertension (40%) and diabetes (27%) was remarkably high. These results suggest that there is still a need for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.
