Abductor avulsion after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an uncommon event and is associated with the lateral approach. Results of surgical repair have only been reported in one previous study. In a retrospective review of 2657 primary THAs, we identified 19 (0.7%) patients operated upon for repair of abductor avulsion on average 19 months after primary THA. The study's aim was to assess improvement in pain and limp, patient satisfaction, and functional outcome (Harris Hip Score) after surgical repair. Eighteen patients were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 38 months. Overall, only half of the patients had substantial improvement of both limp and pain. Limping and functional outcome markedly improved with early repair (&<5 months), whereas obesity was associated with worse functional results.
