The incidence of overweight children aged between 6 and 11 years has more than doubled while the incidence for adolescents from age 12 to 19 has tripled between 1980 and 2000. The prevalence is highest among minorities and children belonging to low socioeconomic classes. Because overweight children tend to become obese adults, the future economic burden on the American healthcare system will be significant. This article examines the prevalence of the problem, highlights research and best practice models, and reviews policy trends related to childhood obesity.
