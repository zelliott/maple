We previously reported that obesity in sheep and cattle was associated with basal hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and an exaggerated insulin response to a single dose (350 mg/kg) of glucose. In this study, the glucose-dose dependency of insulin secretion in obese and lean sheep was determined by 1) using jugular venous concentrations of insulin (Exp 1) and 2) arteriovenous differences in insulin concentrations across the pancreas together with plasma flow rates in the portal vein (Exp 2). Sheep were injected with glucose doses of 0 (water), 10, 30, 100, and 350 mg glucose/kg body weight in Exp 1 (six sheep per group) and with a low (20 mg/kg) and high (200 mg/kg) dose of glucose in exp 2 (four sheep per group). In Exp 1, mean (+/- SE) pretreatment plasma concentrations of insulin (22.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 9.4 +/- 0.4 microU/ml) and glucose (56.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 52.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dl) were greater (P less than 0.01) in obese than lean sheep fasted for 12 h. The glucose-induced rises in insulin concentrations above pretreatment levels were always greater (P less than 0.05) in obese than lean sheep regardless of glucose dose. Eadie-Scatchard plot analysis of the hyperbolic relationship between the acute insulin and acute glucose response areas (0 to +10 min) indicated that the maximum (Vmax) early phase insulin response was greater (P less than 0.025) in obese than lean sheep (568 +/- 148 vs. 156 +/- 33 microU ml-1 X min). In Exp 2, pretreatment concentrations of insulin (25.1 +/- 3.4 vs. 5.6 +/- 1.2 microU/ml) and glucose (58.3 +/- 1.8 vs. 45.5 +/- 1.1 mg/dl) in arterial plasma were greater (P less than 0.01) in obese than in lean sheep fasted 18 to 22 h. Similarly, pretreatment pancreatic secretion rates of insulin were greater (P less than 0.01) in obese (17.8 +/- 5.8 mU/min) than in lean (4.9 +/- 1.3 mU/min) sheep. Glucose-induced acute (0 to +10 min) increments in pancreatic secretory rates of insulin also were greater (P less than 0.05) in obese than in lean sheep after the low (215 +/- 73 vs. 11 +/- 15 mU) and high (881 +/- 281 vs. 232 +/- 66 mU) doses of glucose. It was concluded that insulin secretion in response to a range of stimulatory concentrations of glucose was greater in obese than in lean sheep because the obese sheep had greater maximum (i.e. Vmax) acute phases of glucose-induced insulin secretion.
