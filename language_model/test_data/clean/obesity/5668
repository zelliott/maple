Bulimic women from underweight (n = 20), normal-weight (n = 31), and overweight (n = 22) categories were compared with restrictor anorexics (n = 20), normal controls (n = 31), and obese subjects (n = 22). Each subject was administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, the Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Semantic Differential Potency Scale. Bulimic women in all 3 weight categories exhibited greater psychopathology, more external locus of control, lower self-esteem, and lower sense of personal effectiveness than nonbulimic women at similar weight levels. The highest psychopathology, lowest self-esteem, and most external locus of control were found among the underweight bulimic women. Significant differences between bulimic women of different weight levels suggest the need for some modification of treatment approaches depending on the bulimic women's weight level.
