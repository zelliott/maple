The aim of this study is to investigate the biodistribution of phosphatidylinositol (PI) after oral administration and its anti-obesity effect. When a suspension of radiolabeled PI was orally administered to mice and the biodistribution was examined, PI radioactivity accumulated in the liver compared to myo-inositol radioactivity at 48 h or later after administration. Then, a PI suspension was orally administered to diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice every 4 days, and the anti-obesity effect of PI was examined. As a result, PI suppressed the body weight increase of DIO mice and significantly reduced the plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and cholesterol. Furthermore, PI regulated the expression of some genes in the liver involved in lipid synthesis and metabolism. The present study demonstrated that PI accumulated in the liver after oral administration and exerted its anti-obesity effect on DIO by regulating the expression of certain genes involved in lipid metabolism in the liver.
