Adiponectin is secreted by the adipose tissue and it has been shown to be down-regulated in states of insulin resistance and in cardiovascular disease. It has also been found to be correlated with various parameters of lipoprotein metabolism, and in particular, it is associated with the metabolism of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides; adiponectin appears to induce an increase in serum HDL, and conversely, HDL can up-regulate adiponectin levels, and in addition, adiponectin lowers serum triglycerides through enhancement of the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Studies investigating whether adiponectin is causally linked with lipoprotein metabolism have yielded conflicting data, and the mechanisms underlying the interplay between adiponectin and lipoproteins remain to be elucidated. The adiponectin-HDL relationship can explain at least in part the presumed protective role of adiponectin in cardiovascular disease and the adiponectin changes observed after dieting, exercise and lipid-lowering treatment. Statins, fibrates, niacin and n-3 fatty acids may influence circulating adiponectin levels, indicating that adiponectin may mediate some of the metabolic effects of these agents. Further studies to investigate more thoroughly the role of adiponectin in lipoprotein metabolism in the human setting should be carefully planned, focusing on causality and the possible impact of adiponectin on the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.
