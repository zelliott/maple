Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin potentially involved in the pathophysiology of obesity and metabolic syndrome in adults. In children, it has scarcely been studied.

To analyse plasma BDNF and its relationship with metabolic syndrome components before and after 2 years of a lifestyle intervention programme in a prepubertal obese cohort.

Case-control study with a 2-year prospective follow-up in a referral paediatric endocrine outpatient centre.

Seventy-three prepubertal obese children, 8·03 ± 1·08 years old, and 47 age- and gender-matched lean controls were studied. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, platelet count (PLT), oral glucose tolerance test, homoeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profile, BDNF, diet and physical activity were evaluated. Weight loss was considered if z-score body mass index (BMI) decreased at least 0·5 SD.

At baseline, BDNF tended to be lower in prepubertal obese children compared with lean controls (P = 0·076). BDNF did not correlate with any metabolic syndrome component. After 2 years, obese patients showed an increase in BDNF. Regression model analysis adjusted by age, sex, puberty, BMI, PLT and HOMA-IR showed that BDNF increased in subjects who lost weight (P = 0·036), practiced sports (P = 0·008) and had an adequate carbohydrate intake (P = 0·032).

Plasma BDNF tends to be lower in obese prepubertal children than in lean controls, is not related to any other metabolic syndrome component and increases after a lifestyle intervention programme.
