We investigated whether high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity was associated with changed function of components of the mesenteric innervation (adrenergic, sensory and nitrergic), the mechanisms involved and the possible effects of rosuvastatin on these changes.

Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups. (i) rats fed a standard diet (control group); (ii) rats fed a HFD (33.5% fat) for 7 weeks; and (iii) rats fed a HFD and treated with rosuvastatin (15 mg·kg(-1) ·day(-1) ) for 7 weeks. Segments of isolated mesenteric arteries were exposed to electric field stimulation (EFS) with or without tetrodotoxin, phentolamine, 7-nitroindazole (7NI) or N(ω) nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Noradrenaline, ATP and NO release, and nNOS expression were also measured.

EFS induced a greater frequency-dependent contraction in obese than in control rats. In HFD rats, phentolamine reduced contractions elicited by EFS, but noradrenaline release was greater and ATP release decreased. L-NAME and 7NI increased contractions to EFS in segments from control rats, but not in those from HFD rats. NO release and nNOS expression were lower in arterial segments from HFD rats than in control rats. All these changes in HFD rats were reversed by treatment with rosuvastatin.

Neural control of mesenteric vasomotor tone was altered in HFD rats. Enhanced adrenergic and diminished nitrergic components both contributed to increased vasoconstrictor responses to EFS. All these changes were reversed by rosuvastatin, indicating novel mechanisms of statins in neural regulation of vascular tone.
