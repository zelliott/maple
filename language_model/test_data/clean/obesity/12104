Accumulation of 131I was decreased in patients with heart ischemic disease and excessive body mass whereas this decrease occurred more seldom in patients with metabolic-alimenatary obesity. Increase in the ratio of alpha-cholesterol/cholesterol in blood serum was more typical for the patients with heart ischemic disease as compared with corpulent patients. Deterioration of iodine-accumulating function of thyroid gland in the ischemic disease was accompanied by decrease in content of cholesterol as well as by increase of alpha-cholesterol. These alterations were not found in the patients with obesity. In the decrease of iodine-accumulating function of thyroid gland contents of cholesterol and alpha-cholesterol were dissimilarly altered in the patients with excessive body mass and heart ischemic disease as well as in the patients with metabolic-alimentary obesity.
