To explore the effects of dietary calcium on the blood glucose, blood lipid and hormone of Wistar rats fed high fat diet.

54 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: A group was fed basic diet (0.5% calcium), B group was fed high fat and low calcium diet (0.08% calcium), C group was fed a high fat and normal calcium diet (0.5% calcium), D and E group was fed a high fat and high calcium diet (1% and 1.5% calcium respectively), F group was fed high fat and high calcium diet (1.5% calcium) supplemented with vitamin D(600IU%). After 9 weeks, blood glucose, blood lipid and serum insulin, leptin, thyroid hormone, growth hormone, neuropeptide Y (NPY) were measured.

Compared with those of C group, the body weight and body fat content decreased significantly in other groups, so did the serum cholesterol and triglyceride, but there was no significant difference among all the groups in high density lipoprotein (P&> 0.05). The blood glucose and serum insulin in C group increased and compared with that of C group, the insulin in E group decreased significantly (P &<0.05), the serum FT3 in D, E, F groups increased significantly (P &<0.05) and the plasma NPY in E, F groups decreased significantly. There was no significant difference among all the groups in the level of serum growth hormone (P&> 0.05).

Dietary reduced serum cholesterol and triglyceride, improved hyperinsulinemia, decreased plasma NPY and increased serum FT3, thereby inhibited the obesity induced by high fat diet.
