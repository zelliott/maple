Pseudotumor cerebri is a condition of intracranial hypertension without localizing signs except for papilledema with normal intracranial contents and normal cerebrospinal fluid constituents. It is seen more frequently in women than in men (8:1) especially women are of childbearing age, and in 90% of cases of obesity. The most common symptoms are headache and visual obscuration. Other symptoms include pulsatile tinnitus, shoulder and arm pain. The papilledema present in almost all PTC patients can lead to decreased vision and blindness. One third of the large series had substantial visual loss including loss of visual field. Treatment has been directed toward preserving vision. Medications that reduce intracranial pressure such as diuretics like Acetazolamide have some success. When vision is threatened, these individuals may undergo optic nerve sheath decompression or lumbar peritoneal shunt to preserve vision. Even with prompt intervention, visual loss can occur.
