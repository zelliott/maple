The predicted increase in the number of people in the Netherlands known to have diabetes mellitus to 1.3 million people in 2025 is rather staggering. Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus account for most of the increase. An important part of this rise is due to changing living conditions, including obesity and being overweight, sedentary behaviour, and an unhealthy lifestyle. In order to alleviate this expected rise, much energy will have to be put into preventive measures, with much effort in the initial phases and results only to be expected after a prolonged period. These efforts will be necessary not only within the health care system, but in the population as a whole, with focus on changing attitudes and lifestyles.
