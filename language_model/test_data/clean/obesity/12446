Leptin is a key hormone of weight regulation that modulates food intake. Since the elaboration of the leptin action mechanism, several studies tried to establish the relationship between obesity and the common polymorphisms of leptin (LEP) and leptin receptor (LEPR) genes, but results were controversial. We studied the association of G2548A of the LEP gene and Q223R of LEPR gene polymorphisms with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). We recruited 169 nonobese volunteers (body mass index [BMI] &<30 kg/m(2)) and 160 obese ones (BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m(2)). Glucose, insulin, and lipids were measured. BMI, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and daily energy intake were calculated. After adjustment to confounders parameters, 2548AA was found to increase the MetS (p=0.043) and obesity risk (p=0.019) in the studied population. After stratification according to the degree of obesity, the odds ratio [OR] of 2548AA was associated with moderate obesity (p=0.048) and morbid obesity (p=0.048). The LEPR 223RR genotype was associated with obesity in the studied population (OR=1.74, p=0.037) and only in the overweight (OR=1.8, p=0.049). Subjects with 2548AA had significantly higher BMI, daily energy intake, total cholesterol (TC), waist circumference (WC), insulinemia, and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. With regard to 223RR, we noted a significantly higher daily energy intake, BMI, TC, glycemia, insulinemia, HOMA-IR index, and low HDL-C levels. Haplotype model AR (2548A+223R) and AQ (2548A+223Q) increased the risk of obesity (OR=3.36, p&<.001; OR=2.56, p=0.010, respectively). When we added daily energy intake in adjustment, these significant associations disappeared. In addition, the AR and AQ increased the MetS risk. This significant association persisted after we had added daily energy intake in adjustment. This study showed that LEP G2548A and LEPR Q223R polymorphisms and haplotype combination were associated with MetS and obesity risk in Tunisian volunteers.
