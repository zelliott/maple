In order to evaluate the effectiveness of a gastric implant in an animal model of dietary obesity, silicone implants (2.5 ml) were inserted into the stomachs of male rats maintained on a chow or "cafeteria" diet. At the time of implantation, the cafeteria fed rats weighed 14% more than chow fed controls. Overweight cafeteria fed animals lost weight in response to the gastric implant, whereas control chow fed animals did not. Both implant groups had significant increases in stomach weights in contrast to sham implant groups, but the increase was much less in the cafeteria diet group. The fasting plasma levels of the gastrointestinal hormones, gastrin and pancreatic polypeptide, and oxytocin (a marker of vagal afferent function) were measured by radioimmunoassay. Cafeteria fed sham or implanted animals had significantly higher fasting levels of plasma oxytocin and gastrin, and significantly lower plasma levels of pancreatic polypeptide than the chow fed groups. These studies demonstrate that the gastric implant has more effect on weight in overweight animals on a palatable mixed diet, perhaps related to both mechanical and neural factors.
