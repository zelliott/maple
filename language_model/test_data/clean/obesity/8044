We investigated the effect of short-term feeding of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on adipose tissue weights, liver weight, hepatic lipid metabolism, and serum lipoprotein profiles in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were fed semi-synthetic diets containing either 6%, high-linoleic safflower oil (HL-SAF) or 4% HL-SAF+2% CLA for 1 wk. Short-term feeding of CLA showed an anti-obesity effect without inducing hepatomegaly in mice. In addition to the decline of hepatic triglyceride concentration, significant inhibition of A9 desaturation of fatty acid in the total liver lipids was found in CLA-fed mice. The CLA diet significantly increased the activities of peroxisomal beta-oxidation and decreased the activities of diacylglycerol acyltransferase, a triglyceride synthesis-related enzyme, in the liver. Moreover, serum lipoprotein profiles of CLA-fed mice showed preferable changes in the atherogenic indices. However, serum leptin and adiponectin were drastically decreased by CLA feeding, suggesting that prolonged administration of CLA would induce further decrease of serum adipocytokine levels, which may be a cause of lipodystrophy in mice. These results show that short-term feeding of CLA does not induce adverse effect in C57BL/6J mice.
