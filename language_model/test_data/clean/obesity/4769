Cardioprotective strategies such as pre- and postconditioning result in a robust reduction in infarct size in young, healthy male animals. However, there are data suggesting that the protection is diminished in animals with comorbidities such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. It is important to understand at a mechanistic level the reasons for these differences. The effects of sex and diseases need to be considered in design of cardioprotective interventions in animal studies and clinical trials.
