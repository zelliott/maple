The mean values of body mass index, haemoglobin A1, serum protein, total lipids, triglycerides, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, amylase and beta-glucuronidase and heart rate and blood pressure and blood urea levels of Libyan diabetic patients with secondary complications are significantly higher than those of the patients without secondary complications. However, the mean values of fasting blood glucose, serum cholesterol and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase of patients without complications are higher than those of the patients with secondary complications. The duration of diabetes in patients with secondary complications was 10.2 +/- 1 years while that of patients without complications was 5.2 +/- 0.65 years. The significance of these results is discussed.
