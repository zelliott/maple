Accumulating evidence suggests a cross-sectional association between oxidative stress and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Systemic oxidative stress, as measured by oxidized LDL (oxLDL), has been correlated with visceral fat. We examined the relationship between oxLDL, and T2D- and obesity-related traits in a bi-racial sample of 2985 subjects at baseline and after 7 years of follow-up.

We examined six T2D-related traits (T2D status, HbA(1c), fasting glucose, insulin, adiponectin and HOMA-IR) as well as six obesity-related traits (obesity status, BMI, leptin, % body fat, visceral and subcutaneous fat mass) using logistic and linear regression models.

In all subjects at baseline, oxLDL was positively associated with T2D (OR = 1.3, 95% CI:1.1-1.5), fasting glucose (ss = 0.03 +/- 0.006), HbA(1c) (ss = 0.02 +/- 0.004), fasting insulin (ss = 0.12 +/- 0.02), HOMA-IR (ss = 0.13 +/- 0.02) and negatively with adiponectin (ss = -0.16 +/- 0.03), (all p &<0.001). The strength and magnitude of these associations did not differ much between blacks and whites. In both blacks and whites, oxLDL was also associated with obesity (OR = 1.3, 95% CI:1.1-1.4) and three of its related traits (ss = 0.60 +/- 0.14 for BMI, ss = 0.74 +/- 0.17 for % body fat, ss = 0.29 +/- 0.06 for visceral fat; all p &<0.001). Furthermore, of four traits measured after 7 years of follow-up (fasting glucose, HbA1c, BMI and % fat), their relationship with oxLDL was similar to baseline observations. No significant association was found between oxLDL and incident T2D. Interestingly, oxLDL was significantly associated with % change in T2D- and obesity-related traits in whites but not in blacks.

Our data suggest that systemic oxidative stress may be a novel risk factor for T2D and obesity.
