Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups and fed diets containing either 10, 20, or 40% protein for 56 days. Half of the rats in each dietary condition were given a 32% sucrose solution plus the standard diet and water. Sucrose intake varied directly as a function of dietary protein levels. Rats fed either the 10 or 20% protein diet and sucrose had higher caloric intakes, gained more weight, were more efficient at using calories for weight gain, and had more adipose tissue than rats given the same diet without sucrose. Rats fed the 40% protein diet and sucrose did not exhibit overeating, excess weight gain, or increased feed efficiency relative to animals fed the 40% diet alone. Animals given sucrose had more interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) and a greater metabolic potential for thermogenesis in IBAT as determined by GDP binding in mitochondria than rats not fed sucrose. These results demonstrate that dietary protein is important in the development of sucrose-induced obesity and that increases in IBAT mass and activity can occur concomitant with increased feed efficiency.
