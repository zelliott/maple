The influence of diabetes mellitus on the course of breast cancer was investigated retrospectively in 752 patients. Possible unfavourable prognostic factors like overweight, lipid disorders, age and menopausal status were considered as confounders in a Cochran-Mantel-Haensel analysis. There was no difference in primary tumor status and lymph node involvement between patients with diabetes mellitus and nondiabetic patients. Diabetic patients had more often overweight, lipid disorders and were older than nondiabetic patients. Metastatic disease was highly significant correlated with primary tumor status (p less than 10(-6)) lymph node involvement (p less than 10(-10)) and diabetes mellitus (p less than 10(-5)). Overweight, lipid disorders, age and menopausal status were not correlated with metastatic disease. A possible explanation of the correlation between diabetes mellitus and metastatic disease could be hyperinsulinism in type IIB diabetes. A type IIB diabetes in most of the patients included in this study is very plausible because of the correlation between overweight, lipid disorders, old age and diabetes mellitus. This type of diabetes is characterised by a relative resistence to insulin in the target tissues and a prolonged and exceeding insulin secretion. Experimental data demonstrate that insulin stimulates the growth of breast cancer cell in vivo and in vitro.
