Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of nourishment of gymnasium pupils from Białystok and its vicinity was conducted on 294 schoolchildren of both sexes, drawn by lot from two public middle schools. Their nourishment was qualitatively assessed according to Szewczyński's classification. The quantitative analysis used the previous day 24-hour history method. Caloricity of meals and the content of basic nutrients were calculated using a computer program FOOD 2. The results were compared with the recommended sex and age norms for moderate physical activity and subjected to statistical analysis using t-Student test. The study has shown that the majority of meals consumed by young people are incorrect. The menus are characterized by too high fat content. The diets of boys from the country exceed the norm of caloricity, and like the menus of boys from town, contain too much protein.
