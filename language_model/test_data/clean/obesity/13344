226 of 243 infants who took part in a prospective study of nutrition and weight during the first year of life were reviewed at age 4 years. 23 of 243 infants (9%) were obese on one or more controls the first year, and 4 of 226 (2%) at age 4 years. Only 3 of 23 infants remained obese. The weight and length of the children obese at 0-1 year of age were significantly increased at age 4 years. Overnutrition occurred during the first year in 26 infants and the number of obese infants in this group was significantly increased at age 7-12 months and of overweight children during the first two years of life. At age 4, however, none of them were either obese or overweight.
