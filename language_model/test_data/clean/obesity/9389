National survey data from 884 families were used to examine the overall health of children and adults with fragile X syndrome. Results indicate the rate of obesity in adults with fragile X syndrome is similar to the general population (âˆ¼30%). Male children with fragile X syndrome, however, had higher rates of obesity (31%) when compared with typically developing same-aged peers (18%). Both males and females displayed food selectivity, especially with regard to texture. Physical activity levels for children were higher than for adults, but neither group met recommended levels. Several cognitive and behavioral characteristics, food selectivity, and physical activity were related to overall health and body mass index. Continued monitoring of the health status of individuals with fragile X syndrome is recommended.
