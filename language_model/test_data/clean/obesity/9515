The present experiment was designed to assess the role of adrenal hormones in hypothalamic hyperphagia and obesity. Ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) or sham lesions were produced either 15 days before or after adrenalectomy (ADX) or sham adrenalectomy in rats in a completely counterbalanced design (experiment 1). Body weight and food intake were recorded for 30 days after the second surgery. Adrenalectomy in obese VMH animals eliminated all excess weight gain and decreased food intake to below the level of all control groups. VMH lesions in ADX animals did not produce the characteristic weight gain associated with ventromedial hypothalamic damage, and this group was not significantly different from animals with sham lesions in body weight or food intake. In experiment 2, the administration of corticosterone resulted in a marked increase in the rate of weight gain in ADX-VMH animals, and the withdrawal of the hormones was followed by weight loss. It is concluded that adrenal glucocorticoid hormones are necessary for the development and maintenance of VMH hyperphagia and obesity.
