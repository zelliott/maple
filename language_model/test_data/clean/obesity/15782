IGFs (insulin-like growth factors), which in an unbound form induce glucose and amino acid uptake, circulate bound to IGFBPs (IGF-binding proteins), which modulate their bioavailability and activity. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a standard meal [2301 kJ (550 kcal)] on the serum levels of IGFBP-1 in obese patients with T2DM (Type 2 diabetes mellitus), non-obese patients with T1DM (Type 1 diabetes mellitus) and healthy controls, using the artificial pancreas (Biostator) to obtain a normal glycaemic response to the meal. IGFBP-1 levels decreased by 50% over 2 h following the meal at a similar clearance in both the healthy controls and patients with T1DM, but no significant decline was seen in the patients with T2DM, despite a several-fold increase in insulin levels. The patients with T2DM were also studied during Sandostatin (somatostatin) infusion to decrease the inappropriate secretion of glucagon during the meal. During the 210 min of somatostatin infusion, the glucagon response was suppressed and IGFBP-1 levels were increased concomitantly with the peak in insulin levels, without any significant decrease after the meal. In conclusion, the impaired IGFBP-1 response to meal-related hyperinsulinaemia in obese patients with T2DM suggests a decreased availability of active IGF-1, leading to a decrease in glucose uptake during and after a meal in these patients. The stimulated meal response to glucagon, which contributes to postprandial hyperglycaemia, could not explain the increase in serum IGFBP-1 in these obese patients with T2DM.
