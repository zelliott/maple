We investigated the progression of vascular dysfunction associated with the metabolic syndrome with and without hyperglycemia in lean, Zucker obese, and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Responses of aorta and small coronary and mesenteric arteries were measured to endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilators. Indices of oxidative stress were increased in serum from ZDF rats throughout the study, whereas values were increased in Zucker obese rats later in the study [thiobarbituric acid reactive substances: 0.45 +/- 0.02, 0.59 +/- 0.03 (P &<0.05), and 0.58 +/- 0.03 (P &<0.05) mug/ml in serum from 28- to 40-wk-old lean, Zucker obese, and ZDF rats, respectively]. Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxation was not altered in vessels from lean animals from 8-40 wk. ACh-induced relaxation was nearly abolished in coronary arteries from 28- to 36-wk-old Zucker obese rats and by 16-36 wk in ZDF rats and was attenuated in aorta and mesenteric vessels from ZDF rats [%relaxation to 10 muM ACh: 72.2 +/- 7.1, 17.9 +/- 5.9 (P &<0.05), and 23.0 +/- 4.5 (P &<0.05) in coronary vessels; and 67.9 +/- 9.2, 50.1 +/- 5.5, and 42.3 +/- 4.7 (P &<0.05) in mesenteric vessels from 28- to 40-wk-old lean, Zucker obese, and ZDF rats, respectively]. The attenuated ACh-induced relaxation was improved when vessels were incubated with tiron, suggesting superoxide as a mechanism of endothelial dysfunction. Sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation was not altered in aorta or coronary arteries and was potentiated in mesenteric arteries from Zucker obese rats. Our data suggest that diabetes enhances the progression of vascular dysfunction. Increases in indices of oxidative stress precede the development of dysfunction and may serve as a marker of endothelial damage.
