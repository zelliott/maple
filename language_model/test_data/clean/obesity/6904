Strong support has been gathered for a defect in insulin-glucose-mediated thermogenesis in obese and particularly obese insulin-resistant and/or diabetic subjects compared to lean subjects. This defect appears to be reversible with weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity. The mechanism for this blunted thermogic response is directly related to the decreased glucose storage in the obese and obese diabetic subjects.
