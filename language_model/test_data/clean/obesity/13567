The relationship between breast-feeding and childhood obesity is of great interest. Since 2000, several studies have been published with conflicting data regarding the potential protective effect of breast-feeding on childhood obesity. Meta-analyses suggested a small but significant protective effect of breast-feeding, but a recent study was not able to show such an effect. This paper summarises one of these meta-analyses and discusses the strengths and limitations of the meta-analysis approach.
