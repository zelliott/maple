An 8-year-old male with a complex developmental syndrome and severe obesity was heterozygous for a de novo missense mutation resulting in a Y722C substitution in the neurotrophin receptor TrkB. This mutation markedly impaired receptor autophosphorylation and signaling to MAP kinase. Mutation of NTRK2, which encodes TrkB, seems to result in a unique human syndrome of hyperphagic obesity. The associated impairment in memory, learning and nociception seen in the proband reflects the crucial role of TrkB in the human nervous system.
