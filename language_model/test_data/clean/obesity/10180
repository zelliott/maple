Some years later, two additional gastrointestinal hormones, gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK), were discovered, but it was not until the 1970s that gastrointestinal endocrinology studies became more prevalent, resulting in the discovery of many more hormones. Here, we examine the role of gut hormones in energy balance regulation and their possible use as pharmaceutical targets for obesity.
