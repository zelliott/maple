Obesity is epidemic in the United States and the prevalence is increasing. We sought to determine if the prevalence of obesity in women eligible for health care at military treatment facilities, specifically, active duty (AD) women, is increasing similar to national trends.

Our retrospective cohort study evaluated selected outcomes in women delivering in 1999 and 2006. Women delivering living, singleton, term, nonanomalous neonates in 1999 and 2006 were eligible. Prepregnancy weight and weight gain during pregnancy were compared between the two populations, and data were stratified by AD status, age, and ethnicity. Obstetric outcomes were evaluated based on body mass index (BMI).

There were 1,543 and 1,745 mother-infant pairs available, respectively, for analysis. Prepregnancy BMI for all women evaluated increased significantly from 1999 to 2006 (25.0 vs. 25.6, p &<0.05). Prepregnancy BMI increased significantly for AD women between 1999 and 2006 (24.3 vs. 25.4, p &<0.05). The prevalence of overweight and obese women increased from 1999 to 2006 in the population evaluated (41.2% vs.46.2%, respectively), and this was demonstrated among all ethnicities. Obesity was associated with increased adverse obstetric outcomes.

We demonstrated increasing maternal obesity in a military population over time and associated adverse perinatal outcomes.
