The role of TNF-alpha in contributing to obesity-associated cardiovascular and metabolic risk has gained much attention.

Paired biopsies of omental and subcutaneous fat were collected from 16 lean subjects and 32 central obesity subjects. The expression of TNF-alpha in omental and subcutaneous fat was quantified by western blotting method, and correlations with plasma PAI-1, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and lipid were investigated.

In obese female, TNF-alpha expression was higher in the omental than in the subcutaneous fat tissue. There was no significant difference in the levels of TNF-alpha between subcutaneous and visceral fat in obese male. Significant positive correlations were found between omental TNF-alpha protein and plasma PAI-1 levels in obesity. In obese female subjects, omental TNF-alpha protein levels showed a close association with most of the parameters studied: fasting glucose (r=0.541, P&<.05); fasting insulin (r=0.599, P&<.01); HOMA-IR (r=0.546, P&<.05); triglycerides (r=0.469, P&<.05); HDL-cholesterol (r=-0.759, P&<.01). In obese male population, correlations between omental TNF-alpha protein levels and fasting glucose (r=0.762, P&<.01); fasting insulin (r=0.622, P&<.05); triglycerides (r=0.650, P&<.05); HDL-cholesterol (r=-0.880, P&<.01) were found.

Omental TNF-alpha may play a key role in contributing to cardiovascular risk in central obesity subjects.
