Fourteen of nineteen-self referred obese women were treated for weight reduction by jaw-wiring. Most were immature, passive-dependent or passive-aggressive personalities. Only one-third of the group completed the study, which was six months in length. All lost weight initially, but about two-thirds later regained some weight. At first all responded with enthusiasm, but later most felt discouraged and found jaw-wiring difficult to accept. Only two patients derived significant benefit. There were no dental complications. Jaw-wiring appears to be a safe but ineffective means of controlling weight, especially if applied to patients with poor motivation and immature personalities.
