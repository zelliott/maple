To evaluate the weight reducing effect of fluoxetine on steroid-induced obesity, we conducted an open, clinical intervention study of 20-40 mg/day fluoxetine, 24 weeks duration. Thirteen myasthenia gravis, overweight, long-term steroid-treated patients [age: 31-59, body mass index (BMI): 29-54 kg/m2] were included. Measurements of weight, BMI, and routine laboratory tests, were undertaken at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. Muscle strength and fatigue parameters were assessed at 4 week intervals. Fluoxetine induced mean weight loss of 7.7+/-2.6 kg and 10.3+/-2.9 kg over a period of 12 and 24 weeks respectively, (P&<.05). Mean BMI decreased from 35.8 to 32.2 kg/m2 over the study period. No significant side effects were noted. We conclude that patients suffering from steroid-induced obesity respond to fluoxetine treatment of overweight by significant weight loss.
