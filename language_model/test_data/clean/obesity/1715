The aim of this paper was to determine whether maternal BMI influences breast-feeding practice in quality and duration

A retrospective case-control study were included Fifty women with Body Max Index (BMI) â‰¥25 kg/m2 considered overweigh and obese and fifty controls with BMI&<5 kg/m2 who delivered in our clinic between 2010 and 2011.

The incidence of breast-feeding was significantly lower in overweight and obese women compared with normal weight. Breastfeeding length was negatively related to prepregnancy BMI but not to gestational weight gain, method of delivery or lactation integration. Obese women presented an elevated Body Max Index one year apart from childbirth and are correlated to maternal complications during breastfeeding.

Maternal overweight and obesity is negatively correlated to duration and quality of lactation.
