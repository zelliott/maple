Authors summarise their 5-year long experiences on 343 patients about diagnostic methods of metabolic syndrome X and offer a simple possibility for screening of the jeopardized individuals. In a group of patients with hypertension and central obesity (group I: with 2 insulin resistant condition), 229 (89%) out of 255 cases met the basic criteria of the syndrome X which were hypertension, central obesity and high insulin levels for the corresponding blood sugar levels during oral glucose tolerance test (probable insulin resistance). Dyslipidemia was missing in 20% of these people. Hyperinsulinism occurred in 85%, glucose intolerance in 53%, presumable insulin resistance in 90% of cases. Insulin resistance was characterised by late hyperinsulinism (90 and 120 min.) during oral glucose tolerance test. This was the case in people with "diabetoid" glucose responses too, suggesting an early failure of glucose tolerance and/or insulin secretion. Components of syndrome X were present with a lower frequency in 24 patients with obesity (group II), in 35 patients with hypertension (group III) and in 29 patients without obesity or hypertension (group IV), as well. According to central obesity and hypertension, syndrome X could be screened by a probability of 90%. This can be helpful in prevention of NIDDM and coronary heart disease.
