Obesity appears to be one of today's most common health problems. Its incidence has doubled in the past 75 years (Waxler & Leef, 1969), and it is estimated that 45 million Americans are obese (body weight 15% over ideal weight). There also seems to be preoccupation with dieting, as evidenced by the proliferation of weight-control devices and schemes. It has been noted that depression, distorted body image, problems in peer and family relations, and poor school performance are evident among the obese (Bowers, Faulkner, & Michel, 1979). The literature is replete with evidence of body image distortion in obesity. Among the factors contributing to this distortion are age of onset, presence of emotional disturbance, and negative evaluation of the obese person by significant others (Wineman, 1980). Since body image is an important concept, perhaps movement can be made to other areas of self-concept, such as family, social, identity, and personal conceptions of selfhood. The purpose of this study is to provide information about the total self-concept of obese students as compared to nonobese students in a junior nursing class. A determination is made of the relationships between self-concept and variables of obesity, age of onset, and social class. Implications for nursing care are described.
