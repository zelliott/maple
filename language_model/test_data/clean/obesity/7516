Obesity is a chronic disease which affects a substantial number of patients. It also increases a person's risk of genital prolapse. Conventional techniques of prolapse repair (sacropexy, transvaginal meshes and sacrospinal fixation) are used in very adipose women, but the effectiveness of this technique is sometimes restricted due to the difficultly of performing the surgery.

Here we will describe a new method of endoscopic prolapse surgery, which is especially developed for obese patients. The lateral parts of the iliopectineal ligament are used for a bilateral mesh fixation of the descended structures. We have already used this method successfully in 12 patients without any complications.

This method provides a stable and durable repair. The laparoscopic access reduces morbidity. The operation time for this procedure is approximately 50 min.
