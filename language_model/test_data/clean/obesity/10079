In non-diabetic subjects, insulin concentrations and insulin resistance are clearly connected, and both correlate with leptin levels, making interpretations about mechanisms difficult. In non-insulin-dependent (Type 2) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), however, insulin concentrations and insulin resistance are less closely associated. Therefore, we examined the relationship of plasma leptin concentrations within insulin resistance and insulin levels in 32 subjects with NIDDM, who underwent measurement of insulin resistance with an insulin sensitivity test. Plasma leptin was measured with an in-house monoclonal immunoradiometric assay. Fasting leptin level correlated with BMI (r = 0.78; p &<0.001), metabolic clearance rate of glucose (= -0.44; p = 0.015), and fasting specific insulin (r = 0.58; p = 0.001), but not with age, cholesterol, triglycerides or blood pressure (r = -0.26 to 0.21; p = NS). In linear regression analysis, after adjustment for BMI and gender, leptin concentrations correlated with those of insulin (partial r = 0.42; p = 0.025), but not insulin resistance (partial r = -0.10; p = NS). We conclude that in NIDDM, concentrations of plasma leptin are closely related to those of insulin per se and to obesity, but not to insulin resistance. Insulin may be an important regulator of leptin concentration in NIDDM.
