It has been suggested that obese children have increased problems with self-esteem and depression when compared to the normal pediatric population. Fifty-one consecutive patients enrolled in a hospital based weight management program received the CDI and the PHSCS as part of their initial evaluation. There were 24 males and 27 females with ages ranging from 5-17 years and BMI (kg/m2) of 22-63 (mean 33.3). Results of the CDI were classified into three groups. Children with CDI scores greater than 13 were classified as depressed (n = 16). Scores between 9 and 12 were considered borderline depression (n = 11). Scores less than 9 were considered normal (n = 24). The children in the depressed and borderline groups were significantly different from the children in the normal group in their level of self-esteem. As depression increased, self-esteem decreased, indicating an inverse relationship between self-esteem and depression. Depressed and borderline depressed children were also more anxious (i.e., nervous, worried) and had more perceived behavior problems (increased frequency of punishment, difficulty obeying orders) than the normal group. They also had fewer interests in school and felt their physical appearance was not acceptable. The depressed group's scores were significantly lower on the happiness and popularity scales of the PHSCS than the normal group. Scores on the CDI did not correlate with age, race, sex, Tanner stage, socioeconomic status, or body mass index. In this study obese pediatric patients showed significant depression and lowered self-esteem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
