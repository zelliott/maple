Obesity/insulin resistance ("diabesity") and the associated long term complications are reaching epidemic proportions worldwide. Recent evidence in experimental animals and humans shows that nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in glucose and cardiovascular homeostasis. Pharmaceutical drugs releasing small and physiological amounts of NO may represent potential new treatments for insulin resistance.
