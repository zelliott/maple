To assess the effect on various aspects of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism of administering a quick-release formulation of bromocriptine (Ergoset) to obese, nondiabetic, hyperinsulinemic women.

Hourly concentrations of prolactin, glucose, insulin, free fatty acid (FFA), and triglyceride were measured for 24 h before and after approximately 8 weeks of treatment with Ergoset. In addition, fasting lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration in response to a continuous infusion of somatostatin, insulin, and glucose were determined before and after Ergoset administration.

Circulating prolactin concentrations were dramatically decreased (P &<0.001) following treatment, associated with a significant fall (P &<0.05) in 24-h-long plasma glucose, FFA, and triglyceride concentrations. Neither circulating plasma insulin concentrations nor the ability of insulin to mediate glucose disposal changed with treatment. Finally, fasting total cholesterol fell (P &<0.05) and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol decreased (P = 0.06) in association with Ergoset treatment.

The fact that significant metabolic improvement was seen in the obese nondiabetic hyperinsulinemic women studied suggests that Ergoset could be of therapeutic benefit in clinical conditions of hyperglycemia and/or dyslipidemia.
