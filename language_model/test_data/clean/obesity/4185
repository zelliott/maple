Interethnic marriage between nikkey Brazilians and non-nikkey Brazilians may favor the westernization of diet. Dietary consumption, clinical data and frequencies of metabolic diseases were compared in a Japanese-Brazilian population, with intraethnic or interethnic marriage.

T test, Mann-Whitney, chi-square and Person coefficient were used.

Among 1009 Japanese-Brazilians there were 18.9% of interethnic marriage, being more frequent among nikkey men. These showed higher means of BMI, waist, blood pressure, glycemia and triglyceridemia than women. Overall frequencies of obesity, hypertrigliceridemia and metabolic syndrome were 47.7%, 68.1% and 45.2%, being higher in interethnic than intraethnic marriage. Comparing individuals with interethnic marriages, hypertriglyceridemia was more common among men while low-HDL among women. Energy, fat, groups of alcohol, sweets and oils were higher in interethnic marriage. Individuals with intraethnic marriage consumed more carbohydrate, proteins, fibers, vitamins, minerals, vegetables, fruits/juice, cereals and missoshiru. Comparing individuals with interethnic marriages, nikkey men showed a more westernized dietary pattern than nikkey women.

Interethnic marriage was associated with less healthy food habits and worse cardiometabolic profile.
