500 patients of a dispensaire of diabetes were inspected dermatologically. 335 patients had a duration of the glucose metabolism intoleration less than 10 years and 165 patients more than 10 years. 215 patients stated a striking family case history according diabetes. 54 per cent (273) of the cases showed an adiposity, 418 patients (83.6 percent) had pathological changes of the skin and mucosal changes. It is clear that dermatomycoses, eczema and pyodermias occur more often with acute metabolic disorder and adiposity. Neurovascular changes of the skin occur with long persistent glucose metabolism intoleration. Bad healing tendencles of wounds, pruritus, intensive dermatomycoses, balanitis, vulvitis, furunculosis and pyodermias are important references to a glucose metabolism intoleration. They should give rise to look for a diabetes irrespective of the age of the patient.
