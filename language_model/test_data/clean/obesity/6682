The Heart Foundation Tick aims to help consumers make healthier food choices and overcome confusion in understanding food labels. Little is known about what factors differentiate frequent from infrequent users and the effectiveness of this scheme in helping Australians make healthier food choices.

A cross-sectional survey was used to explore use of the Tick and associations with a range of individual characteristics.

A national panel of Australians, living in each state and territory, completed an online survey (n 1446).

Adult men (41 %) and women participated in the study.

Most trusted the Heart Foundation (79 %), and used the Tick at least occasionally (19 % regularly, 21 % often, 35 % occasionally, 24 % never). A majority was classified as overweight/obese (60 %), 3·5 % were diagnosed with CHD, 5·2 % with diabetes and 23 % with hypertension. Many did not meet recommendations for the consumption of red meat (30 %), processed meat (23 %), vegetables (78 %), fruit (43 %) and fast foods (47 %). Female frequent users tended to have hypertension, be married/de facto, older than 45 years, rural dwellers, and limit their intake of fast foods. Male frequent users tended to have hypertension, meet recommendations for fruit, vegetables and processed meats, but not have a tertiary education.

The Heart Foundation Tick is a highly trusted, highly recognizable food labelling scheme and helpful to consumers who are motivated to make healthier food choices. More inter-sector collaboration is required to incorporate these schemes into public health campaigns to help consumers make healthier food choices.
