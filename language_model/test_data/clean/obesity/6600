Obesity is a worldwide epidemic that is associated with several health issues, including kidney diseases. A specific kidney disease, referred to as obesity-related glomerulopathy, has been described in earlier publications. Obesity can affect the prognosis of other types of kidney diseases. Body-weight reduction with caloric restriction is an essential therapy, although strictly controlling food intake coupled with an appropriate evaluation is challenging. Low birthweight can be an important factor for obesity and results in kidney dysfunction. In this review, we analyse the consequences of obesity on kidney prognosis and potential strategies for combating obesity-associated kidney injury.
