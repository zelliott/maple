A study concerning long term results of dietetic treatment of obesity has been conducted on 1479 obese women, aged 16 to 76 years, who attended the ambulatory during the period 1992-1995. Best results in short term reduction of weight excess were found in obesity due to sedentariness or arisen after operations or emotional stress. Also, it has been noticed that percentage of subjects who went on to loose weight decreased after first year of treatment instead, percentage of subjects who grew fat increased. So, authors believe that long term therapy main object in obese people isn't loss of weight but to avoid further weight increases.
