Serum adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) concentrations are linked to human obesity and other features of metabolic syndrome. Whether FABP associates with metabolic alterations in chronic malnutrition is unknown. In the present study, we measured fasting serum levels of FABP, leptin, soluble leptin receptor, adiponectin, resistin, C-reactive protein (CRP), insulin, glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides in 19 patients with a restrictive type of anorexia nervosa (AN) and in 16 healthy age-matched control women (C). Body mass index, serum leptin, and CRP concentrations were significantly lower, while serum adiponectin and soluble leptin receptor levels were significantly higher in AN relative to C group. Serum insulin, glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels did not differ between the groups studied. Serum FABP levels were unchanged in patients with AN and were not related to any of parameters studied. We conclude that, in contrast to patients with obesity where FAPB is a prominent marker of metabolic alterations, chronic malnutrition in AN does not significantly affect its serum levels.
