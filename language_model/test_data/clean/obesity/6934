The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the benefits and the potential risks of a very low calorie protein-diet in obese patients with metabolic abnormalities and at increased cardiovascular risk. To this end, the 420 kcal diet (with 50% of energy as protein) was administered for 10 days to 10 grossly obese subjects with glucose intolerance, hyperlipemia, arterial hypertension, ischemic cardiopathy and thrombotic risk related to high levels of fibrinogen factor VIII and reduced fibrinolytic activity. Weights loss averaged 360 g/day with a mean protein loss of 17 g/day occurring essentially during the very early phase of the diet. There was a rapid normalisation of blood pressure, plasma lipids and glycaemia. With the exception of a slightly negative potassium balance other ion remained in balance. There was no change in electrocardiogram, in parameters of blood coagulation or in hepatic and renal function. There was only a moderate increase in ketonaemia and plasma urate. It appears therefore, that an 8 to 10 day very low calorie protein-diet is well tolerated even in obese patients with increased cardiovascular risk, and that it corrects of several metabolic abnormalities without alteration in cardiac, hepatic or renal function.
