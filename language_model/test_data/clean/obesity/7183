To examine the predictors of the occurrence of hypertension in a large multiethnic US cohort.

There were 614 patients with systemic lupus erythematoses (SLE;&> or = 4 American College of Rheumatology revised criteria) with &<or = 5 years of disease duration at entry into the cohort (T0) and of Hispanic (Texan or Puerto Rican), African-American or Caucasian ethnicity. T0 variables were compared between patients who did and did not develop hypertension (blood pressure&> or = 140/90 mm Hg on at least two occasions and/or the use of antihypertensive drugs) after T0. Significant and clinically relevant variables were then examined by a stepwise logistic regression model.

A total of 379 patients without hypertension at T0 were included (patients who developed hypertension prior to SLE diagnosis (n = 126) or before T0 (n = 109) were excluded). Predictors of hypertension were African-American and Texan-Hispanic ethnicities, renal involvement and a higher body mass index.

Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, disease-related factors and ethnicity play a role in the occurrence of hypertension in patients with SLE. Controlling renal involvement and optimising body weight may prevent the occurrence of hypertension.
