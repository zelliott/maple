We undertook this study to evaluate whether simple obesity is associated with breast arterial calcifications.

Mammograms and patient records of 1309 women who underwent screening or diagnostic mammography were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were divided into two groups according to body mass index. Mammograms were evaluated for the presence of arterial calcification and results were coded. Plasma osteopontin levels were measured.

The prevalence of breast arterial calcification of patients classified with simple obesity was lower than the non-obese group. Obese group exhibited significantly increased circulating osteopontin concentrations as compared with non-obese group. Plasma osteopontin level is an independent protective factor for the presence of breast arterial calcification.

Simple obesity is associated with reduced breast arterial calcification. Our study indicates the use of breast artery calcification as an indicator of cardiovascular disease or arterial status should be reconsidered.
