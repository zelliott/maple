This overview of the significance of viral infections in the development of human obesity is presented within context of the commonly recognized obesity risk factors, including the personal and public health consequences of obesity in various countries. In addition, the results of past and recently published studies on the recognition of six taxonomically different viruses which can undoubtedly be associated with obesity progression in some species of animals are summarized. More attention is focused on the results of preliminary epidemiological studies indicating that human infection by the avian adenovirus SMAM-1 or the human adenovirus Ad-36 can be objectively related to symptoms, prevalence, and complications of obesity in some adult men. Proposed pathogenic pathways involved in the observed cases of viral infection-dependent obesity in animals and humans are also briefly described. Urgent implementation of high-throughput diagnostics procedures is advised to extend viral infection-oriented modes of prevention, recognition, and therapy of obesity currently available in modern societies.
