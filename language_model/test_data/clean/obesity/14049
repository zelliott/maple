The so-called protrusio socket technique of total hip arthroplasty was shown to be very effective in a series of twenty-two chronically dislocated or subluxated hips. In seventeen patients with follow-up of sixteen to fifty-nine months, excellent results were obtained in all but two hips. Obesity and rheumatoid arthritis or other systemic causes of osteopenia are considered contraindications to the procedure.
