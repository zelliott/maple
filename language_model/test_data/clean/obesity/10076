Although useful in most situations, there are several inherent disadvantages of the standard laparoscopic access techniques of Veress needle insertion and Hasson-type cannula placement. Veress needle placement may be hazardous in patients at high risk for intraabdominal adhesions and difficult in patients who are obese. The usual alternative, the Hasson-type cannula, often does not provide a good gas seal. As another option, the use of a visualizing trocar (OPTIVIEW) has proven to be effective in the initial experience at the University of Michigan. The inner trocar of the visualizing trocar is hollow except for a clear plastic conical tip with two external ridges. The trocar-cannula assembly is passed through tissue layers to enter the operative space under direct vision from a 10-mm zero-degree laparoscope placed into the trocar. Results suggest that this technique is an excellent alternative to Veress needle placement when laparoscopic access is likely to be hazardous or difficult.
