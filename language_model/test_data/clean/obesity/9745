To review federal, state, and local antiobesity policies and to assess their relationships with obesity growth rates.

We performed a literature review, acquired data from governmental Internet sources, and assessed the statistical correlation between state antiobesity policies and the concavity in obesity growth rates.

State-by-state antiobesity policies in 3 categories-taxation of sugared beverages and snacks, physical education and physical activity in schools, and funding for bicycle trails-were found to have no significant immediate correlation with the change in obesity growth rates.

Ineffective antiobesity legislation may be attributable to shortcomings in policy implementation. Behavioral economics and addressing large-scale cultural issues may have critical roles in promoting more healthful lifestyles. We propose that a systems-based paradigm evaluating complex interactions among pathophysiological, cultural, political, economic, and behavioral components can improve antiobesity policy implementation and should therefore be a research focus.
