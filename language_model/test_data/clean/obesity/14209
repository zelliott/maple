To examine the effect of orlistat on dietary restraint, disinhibition, hunger, and binge eating and to understand the relation between changes in eating behavior and weight maintenance.

Subjects were 306 women and men (age: 19-45 years; BMI: 37.5 +/- 4.1 kg/m(2)) included in the Scandinavian Multicenter study of Obese subjects with the Metabolic Syndrome, a 3-year clinical trial of orlistat or placebo following an 8-week very low energy diet (VLED). Outcomes were changes in weight and in the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) and Binge Eating Scale (BES) between screening and 17 and 33 months after randomization. As reported previously, weight gain following VLED was lower in subjects treated with orlistat than with placebo.

Compared to screening results, dietary restraint was increased and disinhibition, hunger, and binge eating were decreased in both groups. These changes were similar in both groups with the exception of the hunger score at month 33 that was reduced more in the placebo than in the orlistat group (difference between groups -1.1 (95% CI (-2.0, -0.2)) P = 0.014). In multivariate analyses, scores for restraint, disinhibition and binge eating were associated with weight loss after adjustment for BMI, gender, age, and treatment (all P &<or = 0.002, model R (2) = 0.12-0.17).

Orlistat did not affect eating behavior differently in any substantial way than the placebo did in this long-term weight maintenance trial. The results indicate that increased restraint and decreased disinhibition and binge eating are important for sustained weight maintenance in obese subjects with the metabolic syndrome.
