The three-numeral somatotype index to quantitatively represent human body type has gained general acceptance since being proposed in 1940. The two-dimensional Reuleaux triangle somatochart has been a customary format for graphically representing three-dimensional somatotype data. This paper presents the traditional, quick plot somatochart, the rationale for development of the Health-Carter 1980 somatochart with scaled axes and, based on that rationale, a proposal for a somatochart utilizing a traditional x, y-coordinate axis system. Two completed somatocharts are presented; one showing mean somatotypes of collegiate rugby, football and soccer players, and another depicting phenotypic changes in somatotype after diet and exercise.
