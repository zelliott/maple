Because obesity is associated with an increased risk of multiple health problems, it is important for gastroenterologists and all health care providers routinely to identify, evaluate, and treat patients for obesity in the course of daily practice. Therapy for obesity always begins with lifestyle management and may include pharmacotherapy or surgery. Setting an initial weight loss goal of 10% over 6 months is a realistic target, followed by long-term management.
