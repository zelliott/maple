To examine sex differences in children's weight-based stigmatization.

School-based sample of children evaluating qualities of children of varying weights.

Thirty-four children (age, 7-9 y; body mass index (BMI) 12.1-31.2 kg/m2).

Drawings of children that varied by sex (boy, girl) and weight (thin, average, chubby) were presented to children. Parents provided written consent and demographic data.

Children evaluated drawings of thin children most favorably and drawings of chubby children least favorably. Thin girls were rated more favorably than average or chubby girls, for whom ratings did not differ significantly. Conversely, chubby boys were rated less favorably than average or thin boys for whom ratings did not differ significantly.

These patterns may further explain gender differences in motivation to lose weight.
