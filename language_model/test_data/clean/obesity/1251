Soluble dietary fiber is a potentially important factor determining our ability to maintain a stable energy balance and avoid obesity. However, clinical metabolic investigations have given conflicting results on the effects of soluble fiber on energy regulation, perhaps for the reasons that a) other dietary components that affect energy regulation have not always be controlled adequately and b) in the past it has been hard to ensure that subjects are consistently compliant with the dietary requirements of soluble fiber protocols. The recent development of techniques for assessing dietary compliance in metabolic studies, combined with increased control of non-fiber dietary variables that influence energy intake, should help ensure more consistent findings in future investigations.
