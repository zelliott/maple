The aim of this study was to investigate effect of loss weight on P wave dispersion in obese subjects.

After a 12-week weight loss program (diet and medical therapy), a total of 30 (24 women and six men) obese subjects who had lost at least 10% of their original weight were included in the present study. All subjects underwent a routine standard 12-lead surface electrocardiogram. Electrocardiograms were transferred to a personal computer by a scanner and then magnified 400 times by Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). P wave dispersion, which is also defined as the difference between the maximum P wave duration and the minimum P wave duration, was also calculated.

After a 12-week weight loss program, BMI (p &<0.001), maximum P wave duration (p &<0.001), and P wave dispersion (p &<0.001) significantly decreased. The mean percentage of weight loss was 13% (10% to 20.3%). The decrease in the level of P wave dispersion (21 +/- 10 and 7 +/- 12 ms, p &<0.002) was more prominent in Group II &>or=12% loss of their original weight) than Group I (&<2% loss of their original weight) after the weight loss program. A statistically significant correlation between decrease in the level of P wave dispersion and percentage of weight loss was found (r = 0.624, p &<0.001).

Substantial weight loss in obese subjects is associated with a decrease of P wave duration and dispersion. Therefore, these observations suggest that substantial weight loss is associated with improvement in atrial repolarization abnormalities in obese subjects.
