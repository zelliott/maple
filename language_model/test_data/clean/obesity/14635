Decreased levels of GH and total IGF-I have been reported in obesity. It has been hypothesized that increased free (biologically active) IGF-I levels generated from IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) protease activity could be the mechanism for the low GH release in dieting obese subjects. However, no published data exist on free IGF-I levels, acid labile subunit (ALS), or IGFBP protease activity in relation to GH release during a hypocaloric diet. The main purpose of this study was to determine free IGF-I, ALS, IGFBPs-1-4, and IGFBPs-1-3 protease activity in relation to 24-h GH release before and after a short-term very low-calorie diet (VLCD).

Six obese subjects before weight loss, five after an average weight loss of 36.1 kg, and five age-and sex-matched lean controls underwent a 4-day VLCD. All subjects were studied on two occasions, once during normal basic diet and again during the last day of the VLCD (1.6 MJ).

Free IGF-I was determined by a non-competitive immunoradiometric assay.

Free IGF-I levels decreased in concert with increased ALS and unchanged blunted GH release after a VLCD in the obese subjects. IGFBPs-1-3 proteolytic activity was found to be unchanged by hypocaloric diet in all groups.

We conclude that free IGF-I decreases after a short-term hypocaloric diet in obese subjects with no concomitant change in 24-h GH release. Circulating free IGF-I per se cannot be the main mechanism of the attenuated GH release in dieting obese subjects.
