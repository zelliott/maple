We have performed jejunoileal bypass procedures in 114 patients during the last nine years. Seven of these patients have had complications develop that required restoration of normal gastrointestinal continuity. In the last four patients in our series, we have performed a gastric exclusion operation at the same time that normal anatomy of the small intestine was restored. These operations lasted only three and one-half hours and were performed without difficulty and without postoperative coomplication. The metabolic derangements have been corrected and weight loss has been maintained. We believe that the gastric bypass provides the surgeon with an effective additional option in managing patients with serious complications of their jejunoileal bypass that necessitates restoration of intestinal continuity.
