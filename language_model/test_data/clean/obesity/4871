Weight loss of several kilograms improves glycaemic control and the lipid profile and reduces blood pressure. A consultation with a clinical dietician who is educated in behaviour therapy can, for many patients, induce a weight loss of 5-10%. The use of orlistat and sibutramine has been shown to increase weight loss by about 2-6 kilograms. A very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) promotes faster and greater weight loss. Surgical treatment of obesity results in considerable weight loss and often normalisation of blood glucose levels. Except for surgically treated patients, most patients begin to regain the weight lost four to six months after the start of the change in diet.
