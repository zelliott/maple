For the purpose of understanding regulatory effect of acupuncture and moxibustion, we have observed the changes of the obese indices and the lipid indices in 196 sample obesities before and after the acupuncture and moxibustion. The results showed that a good therapeutic effect of acupuncture and moxibustion on obesity was obtained. At the same time, there are the benign regulatory effect of acupuncture and moxibustion on the lipid metabolism and high density lipoprotein cholesterol.
