There have been many new published articles on the association between oral contraception (OC) and carcinogenic effects.  Risk of benign breast cancer seems to be about 3/1000 in women under OC treatment.  According to a study by the Royal College of General Practitioners this decrease is in proportion to the dose of progesterone used.  Incidence of malignant breast cancer in OC users varies greatly; it is about 13/100,000 in Japan and 71.4/100,000 in the U.S.: the influence of the environment seems to be as responsible for side effects as genetic and obstetrical factors.  Risk of malignant endometrial cancer is increased by age over 40, obesity, and nulliparity.  However, since 1975, there has been an increase in the reported incidence of endometrial adenocarcinoma in young women.  There is only 1 published study which shows that OC may decrease endometrial effects in OC users.  Cervical pathology in OC users includes endocervical polypus, which are asymptomatic, and dysplasia and carcinoma, which are both related to age at 1st sexual encounter and to the number of sexual partners.  The incidence of hepatic carcinoma in relation to OC is only 1/50,000.  Risk of thromboembolism and hypertension are increased by age over 35, obesity, smoking, and family or antecedent history of cardiovascular problems.
