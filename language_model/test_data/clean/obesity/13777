Genetically obese Zucker rats share several abnormalities with obese patients: inheritance of the obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia. Because alterations in membrane fatty acid composition and in prostaglandin synthesis can be involved in the genesis of the cardiovascular complications of obesity, cardiac prostaglandins and phospholipid fatty acid composition were compared in obese and lean animals. Obese cardiac tissues produced smaller amounts of prostacyclin, thromboxane A2 and PGE2 than lean (p less than 0.01). The cyclooxygenase pathway and the activation of phospholipase by the calcium ionophore A 23187 were not altered. Phospholipid fatty acid composition of obese tissues was abnormal: the amount of stearic, arachidonic, docosapentaenoic and cervonic acids was decreased, whereas the amount of linoleic acid, the precursor of arachidonic acid, was doubled. It is concluded that obesity in Zucker rats is associated with alteration of cardiac arachidonic acid metabolism and that the alterations associated with obesity can be studied in this rat strain.
