The simultaneous contribution of various socio-demographic variables to body mass index (BMI; weight/height) was studied in young adults in three age groups (19-21, 24-26 and 29-31 yr) in a Dutch population. Medians of the BMI of males (n = 1765) and females (n = 2092) were 23.1 and 21.8 kg/m2, respectively. The prevalence of severe obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30.0 kg/m2) was 2 per cent in both sexes. There was a positive relationship between age and BMI, while level of education and level of father's occupation were inversely related to BMI in both sexes. Married females who had given birth to two or more children weighed more than those with one or no children. The mean BMI of the males in the rural area was higher than that of the males in the urban area. Both the Lutheran males and females weighed more than the non-Lutherans. The mean BMI was lower in males attending church more frequently than once a month. There were no independent relationships between BMI and the other socio-demographic variables (marital status, main daily occupation, size of family of origin and birth order) in either sex. In conclusion, it can be stated that age and socio-economic status were the most important socio-demographic determinants of BMI. Socio-economic status can be useful in directed prevention of obesity.
