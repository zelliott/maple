The aim of this study was to investigate whether inflammatory markers are associated with hypertensive end organ damage or obesity in patients with hypertension. Seventy newly diagnosed essential hypertensive patients (29 men and 41 women aged 49.6 ± 9.5 y) and 25 age-sex-matched normotensive subjects (12 men and 13 women aged 45.8 ± 7.3 y) were asked about their family history of hypertension and smoking habits, and body mass index (BMI) was recorded and blood samples were taken to measure fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and homocysteine levels. In hypertensive patients, creatinine clearance, urinary albumin extraction, and left ventricular mass index were determined. Hypertensive patients had significantly higher BMIs and inflammatory markers when compared with normotensive healthy controls. The CRP was positively associated with BMI (P &<.05), diastolic blood pressure (P &<.05), fibrinogen (P &<.01), urinary albumin extraction (P &<.01), and left ventricular mass index (P &<.05). The BMI and serum fibrinogen level were independently associated with CRP. The effect of inflammation on the development of hypertensive end organ damage may be associated with obesity, so that control of obesity may eliminate the inflammatory state in hypertensive patients and also hypertensive end organ damage.
