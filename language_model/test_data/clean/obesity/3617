Regulation of adipokines in lean adults without metabolic disease and without eating disorders has not been comprehensively elucidated. We hypothesized that some of the established associations of these adipocyte-secreted proteins with anthropometric and biochemical measures of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, renal function, as well as inflammation, differ in healthy and low weight adults as compared to overweight/obese patients. Eighty-one subjects with a body mass-index below 22.0â€‰kg/m2 and without malnutrition or eating disorders, as well as fifty overweight/obese patients, were recruited for the study. Serum concentrations of seven adipokines (adiponectin, leptin, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein [AFABP], chemerin, fibroblast growth factor [FGF]-21, resistin, retinol-binding protein [RBP]-4) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Lean probands had significantly higher levels of adiponectin and resistin, as well as lower levels of leptin, AFABP, and RBP-4, as compared to overweight/obese subjects. Serum concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, AFABP, chemerin, and resistin were significantly higher in lean women as compared to men (p&<.05). In lean subjects, fasting insulin independently predicted leptin and resistin concentrations. Furthermore, C-reactive protein was independently associated with circulating AFABP and chemerin. Moreover, lean body mass was an independent predictor of leptin, fat mass predicted AFABP levels, whereas RBP-4 was independently correlated to age and triglycerides. In addition, high density lipoprotein cholesterol predicted AFABP. Our results support the notion that several of these adipokines are regulated in a different manner in lean adults as compared to overweight/obese subjects and patients with eating disorders.
