To determine whether there are any changes in the fatty acid composition of serum triglycerides, cholesterol esters, and phospholipids induced by administration of orlistat three times a day compared with placebo as combined with a low-fat hypocaloric diet.

After 4 weeks of placebo administration, 75 obese subjects were randomized to receive either one capsule (120 mg) of orlistat or placebo three times a day with meals for 1 year in conjunction with a nutritionally balanced hypocaloric diet. Food records were kept to estimate the nutrient intake. The fatty acid composition of serum lipids were analyzed with gas chromatograph. The molar percentage proportions of fatty acids in serum lipid fractions were calculated.

Compared with placebo, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of linoleic acid in triglycerides, cholesterol esters, and phospholipids in the orlistat group, even after the effect of the decrease in the linoleic acid dietary intake (percent of energy), weight change, and gender were taken into account. However, the use of orlistat explained only 9% to 13% of the decrease in the proportion of linoleic acid in serum cholesterol esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids.

The long-term treatment with orlistat may result in a small decline in the proportion of diet-derived fatty acids in serum lipid fractions when used in conjunction with low-fat diet.
