We treated 44 individuals, 31 women and 13 men, for 12 months; each one had a body mass index&> or = 28 kg/m2. Mean age was 53 years (range 20-75 years). Each individual visited a nurse regularly for diet recommendations, and each was provided a prescription for orlistat from his or her own doctor. The target weight loss of 2.5 kg prior to treatment with orlistat was obtained by 28 patients. After 3 months the average weight loss was 3.3 kg, and after 6 months, when 10 women and 6 men remained, the average weight loss was 6.1 kg and 6.5 kg respectively. The average weight decrease between 6 and 12 months was 0.3 kg and 2.7 kg for 7 women and 4 men respectively. Total cost for medical staff's working hours was approximately 700 Swedish crowns per kg weight loss. This cost seems rather high in comparison with the unsatisfactory results obtained for the group as a whole.
