The muscle function of 21 obese patients on a hypocaloric diet (450 kcal/day) was studied. On days 1, 7, and 12 the maximal isometric force and contractile properties (force:frequency relationship, relaxation rate, and fatigability) of the adductor pollicis were measured. The patients lost a mean of 5.7 kg but there was no significant change in the muscle strength or contractile properties. Twenty normal and three malnourished patients were also studied; the latter demonstrated abnormalities of muscle function. The use of such tests to monitor changes in nutritional status must be treated with caution.
