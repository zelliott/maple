Snoring and sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) are two disorders of considerable relevance due to their high prevalence in the general population and their notable morbidity and mortality, particularly in association with their harmful effects on the cardiovascular system. As well as sex, age, weight, craniofacial malformations, alcohol consumption, and use of hypnotic drugs, it has been suggested that smoking may be a risk factor for developing sleep-disordered breathing. While there is solid evidence for the independent association between snoring and smoking in both children and adults, it is still unclear whether smoking constitutes an independent risk factor for developing SAHS, despite the many studies carried out to assess this link. This is probably because the association, if it exists, is very weak.
