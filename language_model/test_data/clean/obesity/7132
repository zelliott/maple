To assess the levels of adiposity and physical activity among Saudi preschool children from Jeddah.

Participants included 224 Saudi preschool children, randomly selected from public and private preschools in Jeddah during April and May of 2006, using a multistage stratified sampling technique. Measurements included weight, height, body mass index, triceps and subscapular skinfolds, fat percentage, fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), FM index (FMI) and FFM index (FFMI), time spent watching television and physical activity levels using electronic pedometer for 3 continuous days during weekdays.

The fat content averaged 20.6% of body weight, while the prevalence of obesity was 10.8%. There were significant gender differences in fat percentage, FM, FFM, FMI, and FFMI. The mean value for pedometer-determined steps counts for the preschool children was 6773.2 steps per day. Boys were significantly more active than girls. Only 22.4% of the preschool children had 10,000 steps or more per day. There were no significant age differences in skinfolds measurements, fat percentage, FMI, FFMI, central obesity or daily steps counts. Television viewing time increased by 22.5% from age 4 to age 6. Compared to non-obese, obese preschool children were significantly heavier, taller and had higher values for all adiposity indices and television viewing time.

A considerable proportion of Saudi preschool children is obese and even a greater proportion is physically inactive. Obesity and physical inactivity represent major risks for a number of non-communicable diseases, and an early intervention is most appropriate.
