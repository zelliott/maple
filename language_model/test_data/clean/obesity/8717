To evaluate the management of overweight and obesity in coronary artery disease patients in Europe.

The EUROASPIRE Study is a multicentre epidemiological study involving nine European countries. The major cardiovascular risk factors and their management were collected from hospital records and measured at least 6 months after hospitalization during a specific interview. A total of 4863 consecutive records from men and women with coronary artery disease, under 71 years of age, were reviewed. Interviews were obtained for 3569 (73%). Body mass index was computed from height and weight noted in the medical records and measured at interview. Management of overweight and obesity was recorded at interview. At least 6 months after hospitalization, 75% of women and 80% of men were overweight and 33% of women and 23% of men were obese. Height noted in medical records was over-estimated, inducing an under-estimation of obesity in 16% of men and 33% of women. Advice from a nutritionist was offered in less than 20% of obese patients. The same trends were observed in all participating countries.

Prevalences of overweight and obesity are high in coronary artery disease patients in Europe. A systematic measurement of height and weight is a prerequisite to a better management of this common modifiable risk factor.
