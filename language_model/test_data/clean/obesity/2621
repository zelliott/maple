Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is the main risk factor of metabolic syndrome. However, there are obviously non obese individuals who are metabolically abnormal and therefore exposed to an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Unfortunately, those persons fail to be detected because of a falsely reassuring body weight. The present paper aims at better understanding the etiopathogenesis and pathophysiology of this particular phenotype, at evaluating its potential clinical consequences and at describing the main principles of its therapeutic management.
