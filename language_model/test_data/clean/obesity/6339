Nurses have an important role to play in health promotions and it is important that they have a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the theories of health promotion and conventional interventions. However, they are increasingly likely to be asked about the efficacy of non-conventional interventions and the likelihood of these interventions being of value to the client. This paper offers a review of the evidence to support the role of complementary therapies as adjunctive treatments to enable nurses to discuss their use with their clients as part of their health choice options.
