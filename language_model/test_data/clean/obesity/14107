In our societies, the increase of the frequency of the diseases of overweight, in particular obesity, diabetes type 2 and metabolic syndrome, coincides with that of the urinary lithiasis. Like the lithiasic disease, the metabolic syndrome or syndrome X is multi-factor. Several epidemiological studies were interested in research of a physiopathological relation between the various components of this syndrome (obesity, arterial hypertension, diabetes, dyslipemy) and lithogenesis. During the metabolic syndrome, resistance to insulin and the defect of renal ammoniogenesis constitute the principal disorders supporting lithogenesis. The defect of renal ammoniogenesis armature by the resistance of the renal cells to insulin involves a urinary hyperacidity which supports the crystallization of the uric acid responsible for the formation of uric or mixed uric acid/oxalate stones.
