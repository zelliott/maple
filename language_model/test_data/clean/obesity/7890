The link between obesity/adipositas and excess mortality has been a prominent topic in medical literature for some time. The epidemic increase in obesity in the western world is going to confront the medical profession with a new problem, particularly with regard to life expectancy trends and appropriate prophylactic measures. Swiss Reinsurance Company (Swiss Re), which has a large portfolio of life reinsurance business, has conducted a follow-up study over an observation period of 25 years (1976 - 2001) to investigate the correlation between body weight and mortality. The findings indicate that the lifestyle-related risks of obesity and adipositas, especially in combination with other risk factors such as high blood pressure and smoking, contribute to a significantly elevated mortality risk.
