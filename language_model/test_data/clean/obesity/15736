In developed countries, obesity is the most frequent nutritional disorder, and overweight and obesity prevalences have increased whilst physical activity and breakfast consumption have declined. There is growing scientific interest in the possible role of breakfast in weight control and in factors such as appetite control, dietary quality and reduced risk for chronic diseases. The current article reviews the literature and discusses how the breakfast 'environment' and the composition of breakfast meals might be improved, particularly in children, so as to maintain the breakfast eating habit throughout life. Recommendations are proposed to encourage children to keep eating breakfast and the nutritional composition of the 'American breakfast' and two types of Mediterranean 'cereal breakfasts' are compared. We also propose a new breakfast type for children and adolescents that is based on chocolate hazelnut spread within a mixed breakfast type in order to reinforce positive experiences.
