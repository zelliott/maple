To assess the association between bariatric surgery and pregnancy-related outcomes among obese and non-obese women in the state of Florida.

We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort analysis using vital records and hospital discharge data in Florida during 2004-2007. Women were categorized based on prior bariatric surgery and pre-pregnancy obesity status. Maternal complications (i.e., anemia, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, endocrine disorders, cesarean section, prolonged hospital stay) and fetal morbidities [macrosomia, preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA)] were the outcomes of interest. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed.

Mothers with a prior history of bariatric surgery, regardless of obesity status, were more likely to have anemia, chronic hypertension, endocrine disorders, and SGA infants. Classification based on prior history of bariatric surgery and obesity status showed that non-obese mothers with prior bariatric surgery were more likely to have anemia, chronic hypertension, endocrine disorders, and SGA infants, whereas obese mothers without prior bariatric surgery were at greater risk of having gestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, macrosomic infants (AOR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.65-1.73), and prolonged hospital stay as compared to non-obese mother without prior bariatric surgery.

Although prior bariatric surgery is associated with multiple negative maternal and fetal outcomes, it is protective against infant macrosomia in obese mothers. Our findings support the need for preconception/interconception services tailored for former bariatric surgery patients to improve maternal and feto-infant health outcomes.
