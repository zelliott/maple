The acute and subacute effects of different diets on serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration and/or HDL composition are described. In obese normolipemic, hypercholesterolemic (type II) and hypertriglyceridemic (type IV) patients, low HDL cholesterol values remained low during total starvation for 2 weeks. Prudent diets in patients with type II and IV hyperlipoproteinemia had no significant effects on HDL cholesterol within 3 weeks, whereas in normal individuals, a high carbohydrate diet given for 10 days caused significant decreases in HDL cholesterol with concomitant increases in HDL triglycerides as compared to a high-fat diet. The HDL triglyceride fatty acid composition changed in healthy volunteers during the day, depending on the type of ingested fat. The data demonstrate the possibility of acute manipulations of HDL in normal patients and the difficulties of normalizing low HDL cholesterol levels in patients by dietary means. Additional information on the function of HDL is desirable before the therapeutic manipulation of HDL cholesterol or other constituents of HDL can be evaluated regarding their effectiveness in the prevention of ischemic vascular disease.
