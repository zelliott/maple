Childhood obesity is an epidemic. Addressing this problem will require the input of many sectors and change in many behaviors. The "community" must be part of the solution, and the solution must be constructed on existing assets that lend strength to positive environmental change.

To catalyze an established asset-based community partnership to support efforts to reduce television viewing time by developing and providing alternative activities as part of a broader, 3-year study to reduce childhood obesity among preschool-aged children in rural, upstate New York.

Asset mapping was utilized to compile an inventory of individual and community strengths upon which a partnership could be established. Facilitated focus group sessions were conducted to better understand childcare environmental policies and practices, and to guide changes conducive to health and fitness. Planning meetings and targeted outreach brought key stakeholders together for a community-participatory initiative to support positive environmental change. RESULTS.: The partnership planned and initiated an array of after-school and weekend community activities for preschool-aged children and their families in the weeks preceding, during, and following a designated 'TV Turn-off' week in April, 2004 and March, 2005.

Methods of asset-based community development are an effective way to engage community participation in public health initiatives.
