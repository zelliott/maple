Obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes represent multi-factorial conditions resulting from improper balances of hormones and gene expression. In addition, these conditions have a strong inflammatory component that can potentially be impacted by the diet. The purpose of this review is to discuss the molecular targets that can be addressed by anti-inflammatory nutrition. These molecular targets range from reduction of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids that can alter hormonal signaling cascades to the modulation of the innate immune system, via toll-like receptors and gene transcription factors. Working knowledge of the impact of nutrients, especially dietary fatty acids and polyphenols, on these various molecular targets makes it possible to develop a general outline of an anti-inflammatory diet that offers a unique, non-pharmacological approach for treating obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes.
