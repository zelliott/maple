The present study was undertaken to assess in pre- and postmenopausal women whether obesity influences cutaneous reactive hyperemia in the forearm.

Cross-sectional study.

Eight lean premenopausal (age 24.6+/-3.5 y, BMI=21.9+/-1.5 kg/m(2), mean+/-1 s.d.), eight obese premenopausal (age 27.8+/-5.1 y, BMI=35.3+/-5.8 kg/m(2)), eight lean postmenopausal (age 56.1+/-8.3 y, BMI=20.2+/-2.2 kg/m(2)) and eight obese postmenopausal women (age 57.4+/-6.1 y, BMI=32.8+/-3 kg/m(2)) were included. Plasma glucose, insulin and lipid profile were determined in fasting state, and a glucose tolerance test was performed. The skin blood flow response to transient occlusion of the forearm circulation (reactive hyperemia, RH) was measured using a laser-Doppler imaging system.

Obese women had hyperinsulinemia, suggesting that they were insulin-resistant. The magnitude of the RH was similar in postmenopausal compared to premenopausal women. Obesity did not influence this microvascular response.

Obesity, which is known to be associated with impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation in the skeletal musculature, has no effect on the RH of the forearm skin microcirculation.
