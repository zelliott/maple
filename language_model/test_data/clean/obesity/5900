The basal levels of cholesterol (CS), triglycerides (TG), sugar, immunoreactive insulin (IRI), cortisol, testosterone, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) were compared in 116 healthy males with risk factors of developing coronary heart disease (CHD), aged 45, engaged in administrative activities associated with stress and hypokinesia, with relation to normo-, hyperlipoproteinemia (NLP and HLP) and percentage of excessive body mass (IBM). In NLP as well as in HLP with an increase in IBM a tendency to elevated levels of CS, TG, sugar, IRI was noted, however there was no direct parallelism. In both cases the IBM value within the limits of obesity, I degree, did not influence the concentration of blood cortisol and testosterone. T3 and T4 levels were significantly decreased in males with IBM exceeding the normal one by 25%. They demonstrated the highest content of blood CS, TG and sugar on an empty stomach.
