We examined the relationship between portal venous velocity and hepatic-abdominal fat in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), using spectral Doppler ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

In this prospective study, 35 patients with NAFLD and 29 normal healthy adults (control group) underwent portal Doppler US. The severity of hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD was assessed by MRI through chemical shift imaging, using a modification of the Dixon method. Abdominal (intra-abdominal and subcutaneous) fat was measured by MRI.

The difference in portal venous velocity between the patients with NAFLD and the control group was significant (p &<0.0001). There was no correlation between the degree of abdominal or hepatic fat and portal venous velocity (p&> 0.05). There were strong correlations between the hepatic fat fraction and subcutaneous adiposity (p &<0.0001), intraperitoneal fat accumulation (p = 0.017), and retroperitoneal fat accumulation (p &<0.0001).

Our findings suggest that patients with NAFLD have lower portal venous velocities than normal healthy subjects.
