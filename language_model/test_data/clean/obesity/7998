The medical demand for useful biomarkers is large and still increasing. This is especially true for cancer, because for this disease adequate diagnostic markers with high specificity and sensitivity are still lacking. Despite advances in imaging technologies for early detection of cancer, peptidomic multiplex techniques evolved in recent years will provide new opportunities for detection of low molecular weight (LMW) proteome biomarker (peptides) by mass spectrometry. Improvements in peptidomics research were made based on separation of peptides and/or proteins by their physico-chemical properties in combination with mass spectrometric detection, respectively identification, and sophisticated bioinformatic tools for data analysis. To evaluate the potential of serological tumor marker detection by differential peptide display (DPD) we analyzed plasma samples from a tumor graft model. After subcutaneous injection of HCT-116 cells in immunodeficient mice and their growth to a palpable tumor, plasma samples were analyzed by DPD. The comparison of obtained mass spectrometric data allows discovery of tumor specific peptides which fit well into the biological context of cancer pathogenesis and show a strong correlation to tumor growth. The identified peptides indicate events associated with hyper-proliferation and dedifferentiation of cells from an epithelial origin, which are typical characteristics of human carcinomas. We conclude that these findings are a "proof of principle" to detect differentially expressed, tumor-related peptides in plasma of tumor-bearing mice.
