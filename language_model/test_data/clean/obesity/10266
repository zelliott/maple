In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the effect of sibutramine and cognitive-behavioural weight loss (cognitive-BWL) treatment was assessed in obese subjects with and without subclinical binge eating disorder (sBED).

Seventy-three obese participants were recruited from the community, 29 with and 44 without sBED. Subjects were randomly assigned to a 16-week treatment with either sibutramine or placebo while simultaneously participating in a cognitive-behavioural weight loss treatment.

Intent-to-treat analysis showed moderate weight loss after treatment in all subject groups. Treatment with BWL programs and sibutramine leads to a higher weight loss in all subjects compared with that in patients who had undergone BWL programs alone. Subjects with sBED significantly reduced their binge episodes during treatment, but with no augmenting effect of sibutramine.

Our results yield further evidence that sBED is associated with characteristics comparable with full-syndrome BED, significantly differing from those of obesity alone. These findings call for a systematic assessment of eating behaviour before starting obesity treatment.
