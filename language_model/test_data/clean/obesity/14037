A group of obese children comparatively to a control group of normal children using Rorschach's protocols is studied. Quantitatively it doesn't appear significant differences, although a serie of characteristics in obese children (a proportional increase in answer of small detail and human movement, less number of answer of colour-form and animal contents), is found. Cualitatively some differences (desvitalitation phenomenous and shock in front of grey colours) are also found. The present work deduces that it doesn't exist reasons to think about an specific structure and dynamic in personality of obese children.
