The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with obesity and to examine the health habits of the obese and non-obese. In this study of over 44,000 insured individuals, obesity rates increased with age until age 65 and were highest among members of Samoan ancestry. Because the causes of obesity are multi-faceted, treatment approaches may need to address diet, exercise, pharmacotherapy and management of comorbid conditions.
