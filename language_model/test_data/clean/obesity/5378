Few data have been published on the association of variables of the metabolic syndrome and infection with Helicobacter pylori, a putative risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity, in large, representative samples of total populations. The null hypothesis was no association of prevalent infection with H. pylori with prevalent coronary heart disease (CHD), systemic inflammation, and variables associated with the metabolic syndrome in American men.

Cross-sectional survey of a large national sample, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Among men aged 40-74 years, the survey measured history of CHD, glycated hemoglobin percent, and concentrations of fasting serum glucose, insulin, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and C-reactive protein (CRP).

Prevalence of infection with H. pylori increased with age. H. pylori infection was not correlated with serum CRP, prevalence of diagnosed diabetes mellitus, glycated hemoglobin percent, or other risk factors other than age. In diabetic men but not in all men, seropositivity was significantly associated with CHD prevalence.

No consistent associations of H. pylon infection with diabetes prevalence or variables of the insulin resistance syndrome were found in American men aged 40-74 years. In diabetic men, H. pylori infection was associated with CHD prevalence.
