In this retrospective review of 5,234 cardiac catheterizations and percutaneous coronary interventions, the rate of vascular complications was highest in extremely thin and morbidly obese patients and lowest in moderately obese patients, consistent with the previously reported "obesity paradox." The use of transradial access and arterial access closure devices was associated with reduced vascular complications in the population of obese patients.
