To test the hypothesis that age at menarche is inversely related to body mass index (BMI).

A questionnaire was filled in by 11,293 young women at the time of discharge from compulsory military service, in order to determine the self-reported age at onset of menarche. The participants were weighed and measured and BMI was calculated. Obesity was defined as BMI&>30 and leanness as BMI &<0.

The age at menarche was significantly and inversely correlated with BMI (R = -0.11, p &<.001). The age at menarche of obese women (12.9+/-1.3 years) was significantly lower than that of non-obese, non-lean women (13.3+/-1.4 years), who themselves had a lower age at menarche than lean women (13.5+/-1.4 years) (p &<.001).

We conclude from our data that the relationship between BMI and pubertal development in girls appears to be a continuum.
