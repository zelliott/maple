Physical inactivity and lack of nutritious diets increase children's risk of obesity, especially children from low-income and ethnic minority groups. To address this risk, the school-based TAKE 10! program was implemented to increase the physical activity and improve the nutrition of K-6th grade students in one public urban school serving a predominantly low-income, Hispanic population. In this study the researchers (a) evaluated the program outcomes using the physical activity and nutrition questionnaires provided with the TAKE 10! curriculum material, teacher surveys, observations, and interview data; (b) evaluated the questionnaires provided with the TAKE 10! curriculum material and provided suggestions for modification; and (c) described the experience of a positive partnership among school, university, and community agencies implementing the TAKE 10! curriculum. Based on the findings, recommendations are offered for successful physical activity and nutrition health promotion programs for these children.
