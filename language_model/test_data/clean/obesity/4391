Many patients with type 2 diabetes are obese (diabesity), and the two conditions together impose a particularly complex therapeutic challenge. Several differently acting agents are often required at the same time, encouraging development of more single-tablet combinations. Longer-acting (once daily and once weekly) injected agonists of glucagon-like peptide-1 are due to provide additional options to stimulate insulin secretion with weight loss and minimal risk of hypoglycemia. Further, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors ("weight-neutral" insulinotropic agents) are also expected. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors offer a new option to reduce hyperglycemia and facilitate weight loss by increasing the elimination of glucose in the urine. Selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators are being studied to produce compounds with desired effects. Many other agents with antidiabetic and antiobesity activity are progressing in clinical development.
