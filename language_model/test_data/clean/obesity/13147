To investigate the incidence and risk factors of symptomatic pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in patients following gynecologic surgery or cesarean section in Japan.

We examined the clinical records of all patients who have undergone gynecologic surgery or cesarean section at 32 hospitals affiliated with the Tohoku University Hospital between 1990 and 1999.

The total number of gynecologic surgical procedures and cesarean sections were 61648 and 26502, respectively. Twenty-five of the 88150 (0.028%) patients developed clinical PTE. Among the PTE patients who underwent gynecologic surgery, 86% were more than 40 years of age, 36% were obese (BM&>25 kg/m(2)) and 43% had uterine body cancer. Among the PTE patients who underwent cesarean section, 36% were more than 35 years of age and 55% were obese (BM&>29 kg/m(2)).

Risk factors in Japanese patients undergoing gynecologic surgery may include age and cancer of the uterine body; risk factors for the development of PTE following cesarean section may include age and obesity.
