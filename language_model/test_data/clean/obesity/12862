We report a case of paraumbilical ventral hernia with increasing size over 1 year which was successfully repaired using laparoscopic techniques. The repair was made using a 1-mm-thick expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patch inserted intraperitoneally and then stapled to the anterior abdominal wall over the defect. This laparoscopic repair is easily accessible, is considered to reduce morbidity and is thus recommended as the first choice of treatment for ventral hernia.
