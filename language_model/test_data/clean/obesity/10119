415 obese subjects received dexfenfluramine 15 mg twice daily for 3 months. These subjects were suffering from obesity with either no concomitant complications (n = 210) or the following concomitant complications: hypertension (n = 59), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)[n = 86], eating disorders (n = 60). After 3 months of dexfenfluramine treatment, the mean weight loss in the patients who had completed the study was as follows: simple obesity 5.7(+)-0.3 kg (n = 183); obesity with hypertension: 6.0(+)-0.3 kg (n = 57); obesity with NIDDM: 4.2(+)-0.3 kg (n = 78); obesity with eating disorders: 6.1(+)-0.4 kg (n = 58). In the patients with obesity and hypertension, the mean systolic and diastolic pressures showed highly significant reductions. In the patients with obesity and NIDDM, the fasting and postprandial blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin were also highly significantly reduced. In the obese patients with eating disorders, the mean total caloric intake was reduced by 36%, which was highly significant. The mean carbohydrate and fat intake was reduced by 35.4 and 37.9%, respectively, whereas protein intake was only marginally reduced. Adverse events were usually moderate and transient, occurring at the beginning of treatment. In conclusion, dexfenfluramine induced significant weight loss in this group of obese patients, both with and without concomitant complications. A concomitant improvement in diabetes and hypertension was observed in patients initially presenting with these complications.
