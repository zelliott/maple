Glycation reactions of proteins and other compounds, depending on blood glucose concentrations, have a detrimental effect on health.

The association of diet and other lifestyle factors with glycated hemoglobin (Hb A(1c)) values was examined in a nondiabetic population.

This was a cross-sectional study of 1773 middle-aged men and women. Mean Hb A(1c) values were calculated for categories of diet and lifestyle factors, and odds ratios (ORs) for the highest versus lowest tertiles of Hb A(1c) were determined and compared.

The OR of being in the highest Hb A(1c) tertile compared with the lowest increased with greater age [age 40-44 y compared with&>60 y: men (OR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.60, 5.20) and women: (6.11; 3.15, 12.30)] and greater obesity [body mass index (in kg/m(2))&>25 and waist-hip ratio&>1.0 in men and&>0.8 in women): men (2.80; 1.48, 5.45) and women (1.73; 1.15, 2.61)]. High energy and energy-adjusted saturated fat intakes were associated with increased risk of being in the highest tertile of Hb A(1c) [highest compared with lowest quintile: (1.53; 1.04, 2.26; P for trend = 0.013) and (1. 98; 1.33, 2.95; P for trend = 0.003), respectively]. No significant associations were observed for intakes of carbohydrates, protein, dietary fiber, or beta-carotene; however, some of the associations were nearly significant. Alcohol, vitamin C, and vitamin E intakes were inversely related to risk [highest compared with lowest quintile: (0.56; 0.38, 0.83; P for trend = 0.001), (0.50; 0.33, 0. 74; P for trend = 0.003), and (0.65; 0.43, 0.96; P for trend = 0. 036), respectively].

Hb A(1c) values might be modifiable by diet and other lifestyle factors.
