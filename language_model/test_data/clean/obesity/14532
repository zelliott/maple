To study the metabolic syndrome (MS) in Indian subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in comparing them with controls from the Indian community and from the general population.

An adapted definition of MS by the Third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III was used. We defined three groups matched for sex and age (+/-5 years). Non parametric tests for comparison of matched samples and conditional logistic regression were used.

We selected 71 Indians with T2D (group 1) and two control groups with fasting blood glucose&<.1 mmol/L: 71 Indians (group 2) and 213 subjects from the general population (group 3). Patients were 24 to 76 years-old and each group contained 56% men. Globally, MS was identified in 77% of the group 1 when diabetes was taken into account. When diabetes was excluded there were 47% of MS in group 1, 18% in group 2 and 16% in group 3. The clusters of four factors (hypertension, large waist circumference, hypertriglyceridemia and Low HDL-C) were more common in Indians. The most frequent factors were hypertriglyceridemia and large waist circumference in Indians. Indians with T2D had a 5-fold higher risk of MS than the general population group, OR (95% CI): 4.93 (2.71 - 8.97); P&<.001.

The high frequency of MS and of hypertriglyceridemia in Indians with T2D highlights the need for screening and management of MS in this population facing a high cardiovascular risk.
