The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the effects of the addition of coping skills training for obese multiethnic parents whose overweight children were attending a weight management program. At 6 months, parents in the experimental group had significantly lower body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage (BFP) and higher numbers of pedometer steps compared with those in the control group. Parents in the experimental group also demonstrated significant improvement in interpersonal relationships, behavior control, and stress management compared with those in the control group. Children in the experimental group demonstrated trends toward decreased BMI and BFP and increased pedometer steps.
