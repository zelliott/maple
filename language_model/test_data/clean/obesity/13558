This study aimed to investigate abnormalities in right and left ventricular function in older obese patients with no left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy.

Subjects with normal coronary angiography were included in this study. They were divided into two groups according to their body mass index (BMI): Group I = BMI&> or = 27, and group II BMI = &<27. Standard echocardiography and pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging (PW-TDI) parameters were performed in all subjects.

The obese patients had tachycardia (P = 0.017) and hypertension (P = 0.020). In the obese patients, there was evidence of altered LV geometry; an increase in the posterior wall thickness (P = 0.001), and larger aortic valve diameter (P = 0.007).

In obese patients of older ages, there is evidence of left and right ventricular dysfunction.
