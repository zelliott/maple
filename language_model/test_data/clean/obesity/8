294 subjects, 89% of the adult Aboriginal population of Bourke and Enngonia, New South Wales, were investigated for diabetes and IGT (impaired glucose tolerance). The prevalence of known diabetes was 9.5%, that of previously unknown diabetes 6.1% and that of IGT 2.4% (all defined according to World Health Organization criteria). A serum glucose value 2 h after 75 g of glucose was found to be an acceptable screening test but not HbA1 due to a large number of false positives. The total prevalence of diabetes (15.6%) was lower than the 19.0% described in the study of Aboriginals in Davenport [Wise et al., Med. J. Aust., 2: 1001-1006, 1970]. However, when these crude prevalences are standardized, the prevalence in Bourke and Enngonia (15.6%) is higher than that calculated for Davenport (11.2%) and higher than that found in a previous report of the Bourke population [Kamien, Med. J. Aust., Spec. Suppl., April: 38-44, 1976]. In contrast to Davenport a large proportion (67%) of diabetic subjects in Bourke were under the age of 50. This may be partly attributable to obesity which, relative to older subjects, was common in young adults in Bourke, particularly men. The consumption of alcohol in this population, though high, was not associated with abnormal glucose tolerance.
