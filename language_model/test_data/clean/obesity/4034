This study analyzed a group of morbidly obese patients who underwent jejunoileal bypass over a 10 year period. Patients underwent either a Payne or Scott procedure. Weight loss was reported in terms of percent of excessive weight loss. Results showed that patients who had a Payne bypass had an average excess weight loss of 75 percent, whereas those with the Scott bypass had an average excess weight loss of 61 percent. All patients lost weight. Complications in this series were lower than what has been traditionally reported. The problem that occurred most often was kidney stones (8 percent of the patients). There has been only one death to date. The low incidence of complications can be attributed to the fact that the patients were evaluated, operated on, supervised, and followed by one doctor and his associated nurses. Thus, it is proposed that jejunoileal bypass, compounded with good patient care and careful patient selection, can produce positive results with a minimum number of problems.
