We measured plasma amino acid together with insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and glucose concentrations after the ingestion of a protein meal in lean and obese subjects. The basal plasma amino acid levels were similar in both groups. The postprandial increase in the plasma amino acid levels in the obese subjects was only 15-50% of that in the lean subjects. The mean basal and peak postprandial plasma insulin levels were significantly higher (72 and 165 pmol/L) in the obese group than in the lean group (36 and 115 pmol/L; P less than 0.05-0.01). The postprandial rise in plasma glucagon was largely attenuated in the obese subjects, and there was no difference in plasma PP and glucose levels in the 2 groups. To further evaluate the role of circulating amino acids on pancreatic endocrine function in obese and lean subjects, an amino acid mixture consisting of 15 amino acids was infused iv. During the infusion the plasma amino acid levels were comparable in both groups. Plasma insulin rose by 36 +/- 7 (+/- SE) pmol/L (5 +/- 1 microU/mL) in the lean and 129 +/- 22 pmol/L (18 +/- 3 microU/mL) in the obese subjects, whereas plasma glucagon, PP, and glucose levels were similar in both groups. In view of the 3.6-fold greater insulin responses in the obese subjects, it is likely that circulating amino acids contribute to their hyperinsulinemia in spite of the reduced postprandial rise of amino acids in this group (50-85%). Thus, under physiological conditions amino acids have to be considered as an important regulatory component of postprandial insulin release in obese subjects.
