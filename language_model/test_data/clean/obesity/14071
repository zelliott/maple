Obesity is associated with substantial metabolic changes and subclinical inflammation. We explored associations between body mass index (BMI) and cardiometabolic biomarkers and their clustering in overweight and obese schoolchildren.

In this population-based, cross-sectional study among 450 children 10 years old, we measured adiponectin, leptin, inflammatory markers, apolipoprotein (apo) AI and B, and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)). Except for adiponectin and apoAI (10th percentile) the 90th percentile was used as cutoff point. Body weight was categorized in age- and sex-specific BMI percentiles and overweight and obesity according to International Obesity Task Force definitions.

In linear regression models, all cardiometabolic markers except apoB were statistically significantly associated with overweight. In logistic regression models, compared with the reference category (25th-75th percentile of BMI), overweight was associated with increased concentrations of leptin [odds ratio (OR) 59.80; 95% CI 16.68-214.39], C-reactive protein (6.30; 2.95-13.45), fibrinogen (2.82; 1.33-6.01), and low apoAI (2.62; 1.19-5.75). Overweight was positively associated with interleukin-6, Lp-PLA(2), and apoB concentrations and inversely with adiponectin concentrations. Most importantly, in obese children 35% showed one, 20% two, 10% three, and 15% four or more abnormal cardiometabolic biomarkers. The number of abnormal cardiometabolic markers increased in overweight (p(trend) &<.001) and obese (p(trend) &<.001) children.

Overweight and obesity in children are associated with complex metabolic changes and a low-grade inflammatory response, and thus might not only accelerate cardiovascular disease later on, but may also be associated with the initiation of atherosclerosis in early life.
