Cardiovascular function and structure were evaluated by M-mode echocardiography and systemic hemodynamics in paired lean and obese patients, either hypertensive or normotensive. Compared to lean patients, obese patients had greater left atrial (p less than 0.0001), ventricular (p less than 0.001), and aortic root (p less than 0.002) diameters; posterior and septal wall thickness (p less than 0.001); and ventricular mass, cardiac output, stroke volume, and stroke work (all p less than 0.0001). Hypertensive patients had increased posterior wall thickness, end diastolic wall stress, stroke work (p less than 0.01), and a lower radius to posterior wall thickness ratio indicating concentric hypertrophy (p less than 0.001) when compared to normotensive patients. Cardiac adaptation to obesity consists of left ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy (eccentric hypertrophy) irrespective of arterial pressure levels. In contrast, essential hypertension solely produces concentric hypertrophy. Both obesity and hypertension increase left ventricular stroke work by disparate hemodynamic mechanisms; their presence in the same patient will tax the heart and increase the long-term risk of congestive failure.
