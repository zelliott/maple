This article proposes a model grounded in behavioral theory and empirical evidence for use when developing a program to prevent type 2 diabetes in high-risk minority youth.

The model is based on key concepts of 4 behavioral theories: the Health Belief Model, Social Learning Theory, the Theory of Planned Behavior, and the Ecological Model. Determinants of behavior to target for change are selected based on their theoretical link to behavior change, their success in changing behavior in past programs, and through thorough formative research in the target community.

Diabetes prevention in children requires modifying a complex set of behavior patterns. Social norms and the environment are especially important in children in whom cognitive processes have not fully developed. Family and community involvement is essential for developing a health program and providing a supportive environment in which to change behavior and ongoing reinforcement to maintain behavior changes.

Behavioral theory informs the selection of factors to target in a behavioral intervention. Special considerations apply when working with children. A program to target risk must be based in behavioral theory, supported by practical data, and tailored to the needs and beliefs of the target community.
