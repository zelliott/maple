Atractylodes macrocephala Koidzumi (AMK) is an herbal medicine traditionally used for treatment of abdominal pain, gastrointestinal disease, obesity, and related complications.

We investigated the effects and molecular mechanism of AMK rhizome water extract on 3T3-L1 adipogenesis and an animal model of obesity.

To study the effect of AMK on adipogenesis in vitro, differentiating 3T3-L1 cells were treated every two days with AMK at various concentrations (1-25Î¼g/ml) for eight days. Oil Red O staining was performed to determine the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of AMK on adipogenesis, phosphorylation levels of Akt and expression of perilipin, were analyzed by Western blotting. AMK was administered orally to high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats to confirm its effect in vivo.

AMK inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner without cellular toxicity. Phospho-Akt expression was highly decreased by AMK treatment, whereas there was no significant change in perilipin expression. AMK administration significantly reduced the body weight of rats fed a HFD. Plasma triglyceride levels were significantly lower in the AMK-treated HFD group than those in the HFD control group or normal diet (ND) group, although serum total, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol levels did not differ between the groups.

These results demonstrate an inhibitory effect of AMK on adipogenesis through reduction of an adipogenic factor, phospho-Akt. AMK had a beneficial effect, reducing body weight gain in a HFD-induced animal model of obesity.
