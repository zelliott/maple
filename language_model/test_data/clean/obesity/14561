Despite the fact that the last decade has seen major advances in our knowledge of obesity, the average unsatisfactory successes of lifestyle changes and pharmacological treatment strategies clearly show how very far obesity research and treatment still has to go. What is most regrettable, however, is the fact that, in contrast to the WHO, the German Social Security Code V does not recognize obesity as a disease. This means ignoring the approaching flood of costs associated with obesity, which will put a great strain our health system.
