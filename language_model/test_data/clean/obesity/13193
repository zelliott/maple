Recent studies have suggested that leptin, a plasma protein secreted by adipocytes, may play a role in artherothrombosis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that leptin contributes to in vivo endothelial dysfunction in obese subjects. A cross-sectional comparison of plasma leptin, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) and soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was carried out in 35 obese women (age 48+/-13) selected with a body mass index (BMI)&> or =30kg/m(2) and 25 normal weight women (age 50+/-11, BMI &<25). An additional study was conducted to determine the short-term effects of weight loss induced by caloric restriction. Plasma levels of leptin, sTM and sVCAM-1 were measured before and after weight loss. Obese women had higher levels of leptin (35+/-22 versus 22+/-19, P&<.01), sTM (4.8+/-1.8 versus 1.9+/-1.5, P&<.001) and sVCAM-1 (726+/-109 versus 583+/-50, P&<.001) than non-obese women. sTM and sVCAM-1 concentrations had a positive correlation with BMI (sTM, r=0.70, P&<.001; sVCAM-1, r=0.60, P&<.001), waist circumference (sTM, r=0.66, P&<.001; sVCAM-1, r=0.37, P&<.01) and leptin levels (sTM, r=0.53, P&<.001; sVCAM-1, r=0.42, P&<.005). At multiple regression analysis leptin predicted sTM and sVCAM-1 independently of obesity measures and other covariates. Twenty-nine obese patients who completed the program of weight reduction showed a significant decrease in leptin, sTM, and sVCAM-1 levels. The magnitude of decrease of sTM and sVCAM-1 was related to the magnitude of reduction in leptin levels. Therefore, our results show that obesity is associated with enhanced levels of atherosclerosis markers. These abnormalities are related to abdominal obesity possibly mediated by leptin levels, and are reversible with weight loss.
