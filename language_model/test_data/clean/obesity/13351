In an epidemiological survey the serum cholesterol levels of 3057 persons belonging to the middle or lower socioeconomic groups were checked. None of these persons suffered from any disease that might affect the lipid metabolism. The values varied according to the age: in children and adolescents 133.46 mg/dl (3.45 mmole/liter); in adults 160.82 mg/dl (4.15 mmole/liter); in persons over 50 years of age 181.02 mg/dl (4.68 mmole/liter). No differences were found between the sexes. Three smaller, highly selected groups showed higher levels. Among 324 obese persons the mean values appeared around 20 mg/dl higher per age group. 168 individuals from higher social classes had readings between 204.25 to 232.85 mg/dl (5.29 to 6.03 mmole/liter), depending on the age. In 311 patients with diseases of the cardiovascular system the mean cholesterol levels were 215.45 mg/dl (5.58 mmole/liter). The average caloric intake per day of the population of Punjab is highest all over India (2500 cal). Most of the calories derive from wheat and cereals, only 20 to 25% from milk and milk products. This, and the fact, that most people have normal weight, might explain why the serum cholesterol levels in the population of Punjab do not differ much from findings in other, less developed state of India.
