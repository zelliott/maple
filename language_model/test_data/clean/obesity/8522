20 obese men with OSAS were examined. Polysomnography confirmed this diagnosis. In the daytime pattern of breathing, mouth occlusion pressure (P0.2) and ventilatory responses during CO2 rebreathing test were evaluated. Lung function indices were within normal limits except decreased value of MEF 25 and slight hypoxaemia (Pa0.2 -67 +/- 6 mm Hg). In comparison to control subjects the patients with OSAS when awake had increased ventilation, Vt/Ti ratio and P0.2. This suggests increased inspiratory neuromuscular output in daytime. During CO2 rebreathing test the whole ventilatory and P0.2 response lines were shifted to the left but the slopes of these lines were within normal limits. We conclude that the control of breathing in OSAS patients is changed in comparison to healthy subjects with normal weight.
