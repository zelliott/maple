Obesity results from a complex interplay between a susceptible genotype and an environment that both promotes increased caloric intake and enables sustained decreases in energy expenditure. One commonly employed approach to modeling obesity in preclinical species is the diet-induced obese (DIO) rodent. Here, theoretical and practical considerations for producing obese rodents via dietary manipulation, and for assessing drug-induced changes in food intake and body weight are described. Based on these considerations, a standardized protocol for diet-induced obesity in both mouse and rat is provided and sample data from these models are also described.
