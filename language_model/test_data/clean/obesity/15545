Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death in the United States. Obesity is highly related to CVD risk, especially in African American women. This study explored the efficacy of a culturally specific obesity prevention program. Designed for low-income, inner-city African American girls and their mothers, the program addressed the importance of eating a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet and increasing activity. Mother-daughter dyads were randomly assigned to a 12-week treatment or an attention placebo group. Participants were assessed at pre- and posttreatment on dietary intake, including daily fat intake, daily saturated fat intake, percentage of daily calories from fat, and daily cholesterol intake. Results showed significant differences between the treatment and control mothers for daily saturated fat intake and percentage of calories from fat. Differences among treatment and control groups were also noted for the daughters on percentage of daily calories from fat. Implications of the findings for developing culturally specific health risk reduction programs are discussed.
