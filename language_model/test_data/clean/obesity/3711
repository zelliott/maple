The aim of this study was to use E-Health to report on 12-month, 24-month and 36-month outcomes and late-stage complications of a cohort of Palestine refugees with diabetes mellitus (DM) registered in the second quarter of 2010 in a primary healthcare clinic in Amman, Jordan.

Retrospective cohort study with treatment outcomes censored at 12-month time points using E-Health in UNRWA's Nuzha Primary Health Care Clinic.

Of 119 newly registered DM patients, 61% were female, 90% were aged ≥40 years, 92% had type 2 DM with 73% of those having hypertension and one-third of patients were newly diagnosed. In the first 3 years of follow-up, the proportion of clinic attendees decreased from 72% to 64% and then to 61%; the proportion lost to-follow-up increased from 9% to 19% and then to 29%. At the three time points of follow-up, 71-78% had blood glucose ≤180 mg/dl; 63-74% had cholesterol &<00 mg/dl; and about 90% had blood pressure &<40/90 mmHg. Obesity remained constant at 50%. The proportion of patients with late-stage complications increased from 1% at baseline to 7% at 1 year, 14% at 2 years and 15% at 3 years.

Nuzha PHC Clinic was able to monitor a cohort of DM patients for 3 years using E-Health and the principles of cohort analysis. This further endorses the use of cohort analysis for managing patients with DM and other non-communicable diseases.
