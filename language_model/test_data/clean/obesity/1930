In addition to its interaction at hypothalamic sites to affect feeding and energy expenditure, leptin has been shown to exhibit a proliferative response in erythropoietic cells. The functional leptin receptor is also present in pancreatic islets and we now demonstrate that a commonly used clonal insulin secreting beta-cell line, RINm5F, expresses high levels of the Ob-Rb mRNA. Leptin causes an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of intracellular proteins and a dose related (10 nM-200 nM) increase in expression of the immediate-early gene, c-fos. This precedes a leptin induced proliferative response in serum-deprived RINm5F cells, which suggests that leptin might be involved in the complex regulation of proliferation of the pancreatic beta-cell.
