Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is a popular bariatric procedure for treating morbid obesity. This study aimed to investigate the relation between SG and lipid metabolism in an obese diabetic rat model.

Forty-five male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats were divided into three groups: sham-operated (SO) control, gastric banding (GB), and SG. Six weeks after surgery, metabolic parameters, including plasma adiponectin level, small bowel transit, mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and PPARγ in the liver, skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue, and that of adiponectin in white adipose tissue, and triglyceride (TG) contents in the liver and skeletal muscle were measured.

Metabolic parameters in the GB and SG groups were significantly improved compared with those in the SO group. However, plasma total cholesterol (TC) and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations were significantly lower while the plasma adiponectin level was significantly higher in the SG group than in the GB and SO groups. In addition, small bowel transit time was significantly shorter in the SG group than in the other two groups. Furthermore, in the SG group, mRNA expression of PPARα in the liver and skeletal muscle and that of adiponection and PPARγ in white adipose tissue were significantly higher, while TG in the liver and skeletal muscle were significantly lower, compared with those in the other two groups.

These results suggest that SG improves lipid metabolism compared with GB, although there were no significant differences in the effect on weight loss between the two procedures.
