Targeted gene disruption has produced knockout (KO) mice globally deficient in the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). These SF-1 KO mice lacked adrenal glands and gonads, and also had impaired expression of gonadotropins in pituitary gonadotropes and marked structural abnormalities of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH). To define the roles of SF-1 within discrete sites of the hypothalamic-pituitary-steroidogenic organ axis, we have sought to make tissue-specific SF-1 KO mice (as reviewed here). We first used adrenal transplants to restore adrenal function in global SF-1 KO mice, providing a physiological form of a "VMH-specific" KO to study the roles of SF-1 in weight regulation. These adrenal-transplanted SF-1 KO mice became obese due to decreased locomotor activity, providing a novel model of hypothalamic obesity. Mice with a pituitary-specific KO of SF-1 mediated by the Cre-loxP recombination strategy exhibited hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, revealing essential roles of SF-1 in pituitary function in vivo. Ongoing studies seek to inactivate SF-1 in the brain or specific gonadal cell types, thereby defining its roles in development and function at these sites. In addition, we review our use of bacterial artificial chromosome transgenesis to develop a fluorescent marker for cells that express SF-1.
