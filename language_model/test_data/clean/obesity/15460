The aim of this paper is: (1) To describe a long-term multidisciplinary group approach to the treatment of morbidly obese persons; and (2) to present, in a preliminary report, results at three months in 30 obese women.

Prospective study with evaluation at the start of therapy and after three months of therapy.

Thirty obese women, initial mean BMI 35.3 kg/m2, age 28-67 y.

Body weight decreased significantly (-6 kg) with 74% of weight loss as fat mass. This moderate decrease in body weight resulted in a significant improvement of VO2max/kg body weight. Resting metabolic rate and metabolic parameters remained unchanged. Among psychological variables, participating in the therapy resulted in a more pronounced restrained eating behaviour, an improvement of body image and a higher expression of positive feelings and actions.

Preliminary results of the program are encouraging. However, continuous evaluation and improvement of the program in the long-term (at least several years) are extremely important.
