To analyze the changes in the prevalence of obesity and abdominal obesity in the middle-aged Chengdu residents during 1992 and 2007.

In 1992, a cohort of 1365 Chengdu residents were selected using a combination of nonrandom cluster sampling and intra-cluster random sampling stratified by age and gender for cardiovascular disease risk factor surveys. In 2007, 1061 of the selected residents completed a second survey. We analyzed the changes in the prevalence of obesity and abdominal obesity in the middle-aged residents using BMI and waist circumference as indicators.

From 1992 to 2007, the BMI, waist circumference, prevalence of obesity and abdominal obesity of this cohort of respondents increased significantly (P &<0.05). The 2007 survey found significant higher BMI, waist circumference, and prevalence of obesity and abdominal obesity in the residents of 50-64 years old than those with the same age in 1992 (P &<0.05). The female respondents had consistently greater standardized prevalence of obesity and abdominal obesity than their male counterparts except for the abdominal obesity in the 2007 survey.

Both prevalence of obesity and abdominal obesity are increasing in Chengdu residents, even after adjustment of age.
