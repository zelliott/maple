Basal excretion of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and its basal level in blood plasma in breast cancer (BC) patients and those with fibroadenomatosis did not differ essentially. However, intravenous injection of parathyroid hormone (100 U) and insulin (0.08 U/kg body weight) was followed by a much less rise in urine-cAMP excretion and blood-cAMP levels in BC patients than in benign process in mammary gland. A substantial correlation between changes in plasma cAMP level and the degree of insulin-induced hypoglycemia was not observed. There was a negative correlation between reponse to parathyroid hormone and insulin and body overweight in BC patients. It was suggested that body fat content may influence the peculiarities of metabolism of extracellular cAMP in cancer patients considerably.
