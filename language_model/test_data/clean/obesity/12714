The higher prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in US blacks as compared with whites may be due to a higher frequency of NIDDM risk factors in blacks, a higher inherent susceptibility to NIDDM among blacks, or the risk factors' having a greater effect in blacks. The authors evaluated 4,379 subjects from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1976-1980) for whom NIDDM was ascertained by medical history and oral glucose tolerance test, and for whom data on a number of risk factors were available. The prevalence of NIDDM was 60% higher in blacks than in whites (p &<0.001) and was highest in black women. Although most risk factors for NIDDM were more common in blacks, this higher frequency did not completely explain the racial disparity in the prevalence of NIDDM. After adjustment for all risk factors by logistic regression, an elevated risk of NIDDM was particularly evident at higher obesity levels in blacks as compared with whites; the odds were 70% higher for blacks at a percentage of desirable weight of 150 (95% confidence interval 1.1-2.8). The risk of NIDDM associated with obesity was greatest in black women: The odds in this group were sevenfold higher at a percentage of desirable weight of 150 versus 100 (95% confidence interval 2.6-18.8). The possibility of racial differences in metabolic adaptation to obesity highlights the importance of preventing this condition in blacks, particularly in black women.
