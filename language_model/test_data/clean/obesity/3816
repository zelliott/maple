To investigate the presence of early indicators of the dysmetabolic syndrome (DS) in young survivors with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in childhood.

We enrolled 80 patients with ALL (50 males, median age 13.9 y, median interval since completion of chemotherapy 6.3 y). Sixty-two patients (group A) received chemotherapy only, whereas 18 patients (group B) received chemotherapy and cranial irradiation (18 Gy).

Frank obesity [25%; confidence interval (CI) 95%, 16.7%-35.6%], increased blood pressure (21%; CI 95%, 13.6%-31.5%), increased serum triglycerides (21%; CI 95%, 13.6%-31.5%), reduced serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (12%; CI 95%, 6.7%-21.7%), increased fasting insulin (8%; CI 95%, 3.2%-15.7%), and osteopenia (71%; CI 95%, 60.5%-80.1%) were detected in groups A and B. Reduced IGF-1 (15%; CI 95%, 8.6%-24.6%) and thyroid hormone abnormalities (11%; CI 95%, 5.8%-20.2%) were detected only in group B. In group B, there was a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of obesity (P=0.024), hyperinsulinemia (P=0.004), and the full DS (22%; CI 95%, 8.6%-45.9% vs. 8%; CI 95%, 3.1%-18.0%; P=0.017) compared with group A.

Young survivors of childhood ALL, especially those treated with cranial irradiation, are at risk for obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypertension, and the full DS early after the completion of therapy.
