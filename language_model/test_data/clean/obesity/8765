Obesity is increasing throughout the industrialised world. If left unchecked it will have major implications for both population health and costs to health services. Health professionals have a key role to play in tackling the obesity problem, but little is known about how they may be encouraged to work more effectively with overweight and obese people.

The main objective was to determine whether health professionals' management or the organisation of care for overweight and obese people could be improved.

We searched the specialised registers of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (May 1997), the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (August 1997), the Cochrane Diabetes Group (August 1997), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (September 1997), MEDLINE to January 1998, EMBASE to December 1997, Cinahl (1982 to November 1997), PsycLit (1974 to December 1997), Sigle (1980 to November 1997), Sociofile (1974 to October 1997), Dissertation Abstracts (1861 to January 1998), Conference Papers Index (1973 to January 1998), Resource Database in Continuing Medical Education. We also hand searched seven key journals and contacted experts in the field.

Randomised trials, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series analyses of providers' management of obesity or the organisation of care to improve provider practice or patient outcomes. We addressed three a priori comparisons and a fourth post hoc comparison. 1. Interventions aimed at improving health professionals' management or the delivery of health care for overweight/obese patients are more effective than usual care. 2. Interventions aimed at redressing negative attitudes and related practices towards overweight/obese patients are more effective than usual care. 3. Organisational interventions designed to change the structure of services for overweight/obese people are more effective than educational or behavioural interventions for health professionals. 4. Comparisons of different organisational interventions.

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality.

Twelve studies were included involving more than 393 providers and 3392 patients. Four studies were identified for comparison 1. Three were professional-oriented interventions (the use of reminders and training) and the fourth was a study of professional and organisational interventions of shared care. No studies were identified for comparisons 2 or 3. Eight studies were identified for post hoc comparison 4. These compared either the deliverer of weight loss interventions or the setting of interventions. The included studies were heterogeneous and of generally poor quality.

At present, decisions about improving provision of services must be based on the evidence of patient interventions and good clinical judgement. Further research is needed to identify cost effective strategies for improving the management of obesity.
