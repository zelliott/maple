This study examined trends in fruit and vegetable consumption among adults in 16 US states.

Data from telephone surveys were used to stratify respondents by sociodemographic and health-related characteristics.

The proportion of adults who consumed fruits and vegetables at least 5 times daily was 19%, 22%, and 23% in 1990, 1994, and 1996, respectively. While the proportion increased among those with active leisure-time physical activities and normal weight, it remained almost the same among inactive people and dropped among the obese.

Progress in fruit and vegetable intake from 1990 to 1994 was encouraging, but it changed little between 1994 and 1996.
