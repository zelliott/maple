Goldthioglucose induces in mice a significant increase in body weight, glucose, insulin and lipid levels. Treatment with 250 mg/kg of methanol and ethyl acetate extracts of Zingiber officinale for 8 weeks produces significant reduction in body weight, glucose, insulin and lipid levels as compared to obese control mice. The reduction in elevated glucose along with elevated insulin levels indicates that the treatment with Z. officinale improves insulin sensitivity.
