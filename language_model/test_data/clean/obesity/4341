Adipose tissue development is associated with angiogenesis, adipogenesis and extracellular matrix degradation. The class of matrix metalloproteinases contributes to these processes, but little information is available on the role of individual proteinases. We report that stromelysin-2 (MMP-10) deficiency has no significant effect on total body weight or on subcutaneous (SC) or gonadal (GON) adipose tissue mass of mice kept on a high fat diet for 15 weeks. The adipocyte size and density in SC and GON adipose tissues were also comparable in MMP-10 deficient and wild-type control mice. Similarly, blood vessel size and density in obese SC and GON adipose tissues was not affected by MMP-10 deficiency. Metabolic parameters and blood cell composition were similar for both genotypes. Stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) expression was significantly reduced in adipose tissues of the deficient mice as compared to the wild-type controls. These data indicate that MMP-10 does not significantly contribute to adipose tissue development and associated angiogenesis in a mouse model of nutritionally induced obesity.
