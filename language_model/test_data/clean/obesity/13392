Sugar and fat metabolism were studied in a group of obese women without diabetes. Blood triglicerides and cholesterol were, on average, within normal limits, though endogenous hypertriglyceridaemia was noted in a few cases. Triglycerides were significantly related to blood sugar (baseline and after glucose loading), whereas there was no significant connection with blood insulin. The meaning of these results is discussed.
