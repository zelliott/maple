To explore the relation of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) of the aged with clustering of other cardiovascular risk factors.

Total 654 old people were checked up, and the systolic blood press (SBP), diastolic blood press (DBP), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of them were investigated according to different BMI and WC, then the other cardiovascular risk factors analysis was carried out on the detection rates of SBP, DBP, TC, HDL-C, FPG level and high blood pressure, high TC, high TG. The clustering of the other cardiovascular risk factors was analyzed.

The rising of BMI and WC was regular cardiovascular risk factor in the aged. The average level of SBP, DBP, TC, TG, and FPG of the aged was obviously rising along with BMI and WC increasing, meanwhile the HDL-C was obviously decreased, and the detection rates of high blood pressure, high TC, TG and diabetes mellitus were obviously increased. When the BMI was 24 kg/m(2)-27.9 kg/m2, the detection rates of high blood pressure, high TC, TG and diabetes mellitus were 59.74%, 3.89%, 28.57%, 10.06% respectively, and their risks of suffering high blood pressure, high TC and TG were 1.65, 1.88, 1.85 times of those with normal BMI. When the BMI&> or = 28.0 kg/m2, the detection rates of high blood pressure, high TC, TG and diabetes mellitus were 83.05%, 5.08%, 35.59%, 15.25% respectively, and their risks of suffering high blood pressure, high TC and TG were 5.44, 2.60, 2.98 times of those with normal BMI. When the man WC&> or = 85 cm or women WC&> or = 80 cm, the detection rates of high blood pressure, high TC, TG and diabetes mellitus were 66.15.%, 4.47%, 29.57%, 10.12%, and their risks of suffering high blood pressure, high TC and TG were 3.52, 6.51, 1.68 times of those with normal BMI. The rate of the aged with several cardiovascular risk factors was significantly increased for those with BMI&> or = 24.0 kg/m2 or man WC&> or = 85 cm or women WC&> or = 80 cm.

The rising of BMI and WC should be important factor for the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors in the aged.
