A brief presentation is given of granulocyte physiology, as well as some techniques in use for assessing the adherance, the migration, the uptake and bacterial killing and finally the metabolic activity of these cells. Also the activities of the reticuloendothelial system and an in vivo method to measure the phagocytic and metabolic function of macrophages are described. A change, most often a decrease, in phagocytic function has been noted in several circumstances common in surgical practice. So is the case after open heart surgery, during infusion with colloids for blood replacement, and during treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. Further, various forms of malnutrition, such as total starvation, obesity and the hypertriglyceridemia following excessive infusion of fat emulsions may impair granulocyte function.
