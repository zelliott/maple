To determine whether a microsatellite polymorphism located towards the 3' end of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR) is associated with obesity.

A cross-sectional case-control study.

One hundred and seven obese individuals, defined as a body mass index (BMI)&> or = 26 kg/m2, and 163 lean individuals, defined as a BMI &<26 kg/m2.

BMI, blood pressure, serum lipids, alleles of LDLR microsatellite (106 bp, 108 bp and 112 bp).

There was a significant association between variants of the LDLR microsatellite and obesity, in the overall tested population, due to a contributing effect in females (chi 2 = 12.3, P = 0.002), but not in males (chi 2 = 0.3, P = 0.87). In females, individuals with the 106 bp allele were more likely to be lean, while individuals with the 112 bp and/or 108 bp alleles tended to be obese.

These results suggest that in females, LDLR may play a role in the development of obesity.
