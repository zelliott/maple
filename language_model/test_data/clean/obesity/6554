Perfusion of CNS intact pancreases with 200 mg/dl glucose with concomitant lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) stimulation significantly inhibited insulin secretion both in normal and obese rats. Sprague-Dawley, Zucker lean (FaFa) and Zucker obese (fafa) rats all responded in a similar manner, suggesting a general effect unrelated to metabolic state. Insulin secretion during mins 25-40 of perfusion was inhibited in Sprague Dawley, lean Zucker and obese Zucker rats by 31%, 42% and 33%, even though LHA stimulation took place from mins 20-25. Thus, the duration of inhibition was greater than the period of LHA stimulation, indicating that this pathway can induce prolonged changes in the responsiveness of the pancreas. The data presented in this study demonstrate that LHA stimulation, in the absence of humoral factors, results in a direct CNS-mediated suppression of insulin secretion which is relatively long lasting. This effect may illustrate a basic control mechanism by the CNS to regulate the endocrine pancreas.
