The records of 686 patients who underwent herniorrhaphy for primary or initially recurrent inguinal hernia during the years 1975 through 1985 were reviewed. Patients were divided into groups according to percentage of ideal body weight. Analysis showed that, compared with the patients with primary hernia, a larger proportion of patients with recurrent hernia were near or below ideal body weight. A follow-up survey of 64 patients who underwent primary repair of hernia indicated that the percentage of ideal body weight of a patient had no apparent effect on the recurrence rate of inguinal hernia.
