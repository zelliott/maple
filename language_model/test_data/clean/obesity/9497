Plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) and platelet count were studied in 69 control subjects, 19 patients with operable abdominal malignancy, and 9 patients with acute bacterial infection. In control subjects there was a significant rise in BTG and fall in platelet count with age, and a negative correlation of BTG with obesity. BTG and platelet count were normal in patients with operable malignancy, but significantly increased in patients with acute bacterial infection. These effects must be considered in studies of BTG and thrombosis.
