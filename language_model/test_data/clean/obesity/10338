Overweight is nowadays a major problem of public health in Switzerland. Swiss people eat too much, too much fat, sugar and salt! Most efficient public health strategies are global and also apply to environmental modifications, an important determinant to change individual behaviours. Today, our environment is "obesogenic": unlimited access to food, food industry marketing, lifestyle changes. As global programmes for smoking cessation and cardiovascular diseases prevention, it is urgent to propose interventions taking into account all environmental factors which could support individuals in their efforts of changes.
