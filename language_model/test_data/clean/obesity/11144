obesity is a well-known risk factor for endometrial cancer, and both diseases are rising in Mexico. However, in our country some data indicates low influence of obesity on this neoplasm, and this is contradictory. Therefore, we explore the prevalence of obesity on women affected with this malignant tumor.

this was a pilot case-control study in a general hospital at Mexico City. The analysis involved obesity (a body mass index â‰¥ 30 kg/m(2)) diabetes mellitus and systemic arterial hypertension.

the sample was of 66 women: 22 cases and 44 controls. In cases, obesity occurred in 77 % (odds ratio [OR] 8.1, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2.46-26.6); diabetes mellitus in 41 % (OR 4.3, CI 1.31-14.7); and systemic arterial hypertension in 41 % (OR 2.3, CI 0.78-7.1).

these preliminary results suggested that obesity was the most frequent risk factor for these women with endometrial cancer.
