To analyze the impact of snoring, independent of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome on patients referred for home sleep studies and to report a new technology for the reporting of snoring, using sophisticated sound collection and noise-canceling technology.

A retrospective statistical review of consecutive anonymous data compiled from questionnaires and digital data of snoring loudness and duration measured at the upper lip during unattended home sleep studies in 4,860 patients referred for snoring and sleep-disturbed breathing.

A strong relationship exists between a history of snoring and complaints of daytime sleepiness (80%), obesity (73%), and chronic fatigue (78%) (all yield P&<.001). By contrast, only 42% to 48% of patients without these symptoms complain of snoring. In 3 multiple-regression analyses, the percent of time snoring, average loudness, and peak loudness are all significantly predicted by the apnea hypopnea index (all P&<.003), body mass index (all P&<.001), and age (P=0.014). Daytime sleepiness was strongly predicted by percent time snoring (P=0.014), weakly by average loudness (P=0.046), and not at all by peak loudness (P=0.303).

By using a pair of microphones placed at the upper lip, one that samples breath sounds and the other ambient sound and artifact noise, the NovaSOM QSG measures snoring while canceling ambient noise. The clinical impact of snoring on the patient as well as the bed partner, independent of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, is an unrecognized factor in sleep-disturbed breathing.

Measurable criteria to define snoring are suggested. Snoring loudness is not measured in most laboratory Polysomnograms.
