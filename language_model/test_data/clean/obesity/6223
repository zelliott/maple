A study was made on the mechanism of increased glucose metabolism in enlarged adipocytes from 13-week-old obese Zucker rats showing hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia. Glucose metabolism was assessed by measuring CO2 production from glucose and the concentration of glucose transporters was estimated by immunoblotting. In comparing adipocytes from obese rats with those from lean rats, the basal rates of glucose oxidation at 0.02 mmol/l glucose increased 2.6-fold per unit cellular surface area and the transporters in the plasma membrane increased 1.4-fold per protein, while that in low-density microsome was 67% of the value in lean rats. The increase of glucose oxidation rates observed in basal cells from obese rats could be partly explained by translocation of the transporters from the intracellular site to the plasma membrane. In the presence of insulin, as the basal rates of glucose oxidation increased in obese rats, maximally insulin-stimulated oxidation increased 4-fold in lean rats and 1.7-fold in obese rats. Thus, the rates of insulin-stimulated oxidation on a per unit cellular surface area as well as the transporters on a per protein basis in the plasma membrane became almost similar in cells from both groups of rats. Since protein content per cell increased with cell enlargement, increased glucose metabolism per cell which was observed in adipocytes from the obese rats was mainly due to an increase of glucose transporters accompanied by a similar degree of cellular protein increase.
