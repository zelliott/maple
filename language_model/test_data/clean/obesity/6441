Failure of clients to initiate closure and move out of weight management programs after it is considered they should have reached the stage of maintenance in their health behavior change has implications for clients' self-management, provision of health promotion programs and their cost-effectiveness. This study aims to identify factors that enable and inhibit class attendees' transition from a weight management program. Six short-term attendees who had left the program after two terms and six long-term attendees who had attended four or more terms of the program volunteered to participate in in-depth interviews. Enabling factors were identified to be program knowledge and attainment of set goal weight, and inhibiting factors were the perceived need to come to classes, concern about keeping in control, recognition of the potential to lapse and being involved with a group. Recommendations are made for the program to include a component addressing relapse prevention training and to trial some form of follow-up support strategy. Additionally, further research is needed into transition from weight management programs.
