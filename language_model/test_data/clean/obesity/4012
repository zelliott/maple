The authors mention the previous conditions to the prescription of a diet for primary hyperlipoproteinemia : definition of the metabolic disease and of its nutritional dependence, precise knowledge of earlier nutritional uses, demonstration of vascular risk factor linked to the hyperlipoproteinemia, i.e. obesity which always requires a hypocaloric diet. A low cholesterol and saturated fatty acid diet reduces by 10% the cholesterolemia, and sometimes exempts from use of medical drugs in moderate hypercholesterolemia. The exceptional hyperchylomicronemia are reduced by drastic reduction of the lipid fraction of the diet, which is compensated by use of MCT. The dietetic treatment of endogenous hypertriglyceridemia depends on their nutritional dependence : an alcohol dependence implies a complete suppression of alcoholic drinks. A glucid dependence implies the suppression of simple carbohydrates and a reduction of the glucidic fraction of the diet.
