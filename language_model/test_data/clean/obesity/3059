Previous studies demonstrated decreases in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in obese subjects. Studies were carried out to determine whiter serum vitamin D is low in obesity. The results indicate that serum vitamin D is significantly lower in obese than in nonobese individuals and may contribute to lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in obesity.
