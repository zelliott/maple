Fourteen morbidly obese women who were candidates for intestinal bypass surgery were compared in terms of psychosocial functioning and dietary behavior to 14 morbidly obese women who elected not to undergo the bypass procedure. Each patient underwent a psychiatric evaluation which included a developmental and dietary history, a mental status exam, and the administration of the MMPI. Diagnoses were based on the DSM-III multi-axial system. There was no difference between the bypass group and the non-bypass group on the Axis I diagnoses, however the bypass group did have a significantly higher frequency of Axis II diagnoses. The bypass group demonstrated significantly higher levels of psychosocial stressors (Axis IV) and lower levels of adaptive functioning (Axis V) when compared to the non-bypass group. The bypass patients also had a significantly higher frequency of past suicide attempts. On the MMPI, the bypass group had significantly higher elevations on scales 2 (depression), 4 (psychopathic deviate), 6 (paranoia), and 0 (social introversion). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of dietary history and behavior, except that significantly fewer bypass patients could place a numerical estimate on their daily energy intake. These results were discussed in terms of their implications for the assessment and treatment of morbidly obese patients.
