Obesity is the most prevalent nutritional disease in people of less than 20 years old.

To report biological, familial and metabolic characteristics in obese children.

A retrospective review of 187 children seen at obesity clinics and that had a complete metabolic study.

Ninety five prepuberal and 92 puberal children, aged 8.7 +/- 2.2 and 12.6 +/- 2.2 years old respectively, were studied. Body mass index was over 4 standard deviations in 48.4% of prepuberal children and in 39.1% of puberal children. Paternal obesity was twice more prevalent (30.2%) than in the general population. The daily caloric intake and basal metabolic rate (BMR) were within the normal range; nevertheless there was a positive caloric balance due to minimal physical activity. The mean daily fat intake was normal (26.4 +/- 8.5 and 25.3 +/- 9.1% of total calories in prepuberal and puberal children respectively). The daily fiber intake was under 70% of recommendation. The total cholesterol was over 200 mg/dl in 26.6 and 23.9% of prepuberal and puberal children. LDL cholesterol was over 130 mg/dl in 27.3 and 26.6% and triacylglycerol was over 150 mg/dl in 16.9 and 25% of prepuberal and puberal children respectively. Basal serum insulin was over 20 uIU/ml in 27.7 and 42.2% of prepuberal and puberal children, respectively. Post glucose serum insulin was over 60 uIU/ml in 40 and 63% of prepuberal and puberal children, respectively.

Infantile and juvenile obesity is a chronic disease with a high incidence of metabolic alterations.
