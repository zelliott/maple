Obesity is arguably the most important medical problem in America today. About 25% of children are considered either overweight or obese, according to newly established national criteria. These teenagers are at significant risk for becoming obese adults, and adolescent obesity predisposes to a range of short- and long-term medical, and psychosocial problems. Despite the enormous medical and economic implications of obesity, effective prevention and treatment strategies are lacking. This review summarizes the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of adolescent obesity, focusing on promising treatment strategies for the future.
