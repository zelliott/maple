To determine modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for term large for gestational age (T-LGA) births in Northern and Central Alberta and their public health importance, a retrospective cohort study (n = 115,198) of singleton live births (1996-2003) was conducted using maternal and newborn data from a provincial perinatal database. After adjusting for potential confounders, predictors of T-LGA births included prepregnancy weight 91 kg or greater, multiparity, and previous LGA birth. The strongest modifiable predictor was prepregnancy weight 91 kg or greater (OR = 2.52; CI 2.39, 2.65). The population-attributable risk percentage for prepregnancy weight 91 kg or greater was 10%.
