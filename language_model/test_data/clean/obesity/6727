The Weight Loss Maintenance Trial tested strategies for maintenance of weight loss. Personal contact was superior to interactive technology and self-directed conditions.

We aimed to identify behavioral mediators of the superior effect of personal contact vs. interactive technology and of personal contact vs. self-directed arms.

Overweight/obese adults at risk for cardiovascular disease (n = 1,032) who lost at least 4 kg were randomized to personal contact, interactive technology, or self-directed. After 30 months, 880 participants had data on weight and behavioral strategies.

Reported increase of intake of fruits and vegetables and physical activity and more frequent self-weighing met criteria as mediators of the better outcome of personal contact vs. interactive technology. Increased intake of fruits and vegetables, more frequent self-weighing, and decreased dessert consumption were mediators of the difference between personal contact vs. self-directed.

Inducing changes in the identified behaviors might yield better outcomes in future weight loss maintenance trials.
