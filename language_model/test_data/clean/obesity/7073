Astaxanthin is a natural antioxidant carotenoid that occurs in a wide variety of living organisms. We investigated the effects of astaxanthin supplementation in obese mice fed a high-fat diet. Astaxanthin inhibited the increases in body weight and weight of adipose tissue that result from feeding a high-fat diet. In addition, astaxanthin reduced liver weight, liver triglyceride, plasma triglyceride, and total cholesterol. These results suggest that astaxanthin might be of value in reducing the likelihood of obesity and metabolic syndrome in affluent societies.
