We describe the association between the obesity and the use of antipsychotic drug (APD) in patients attended by five primary care teams.

Multicenter-retrospective design, carried out between July 2004 and June 2005, in patients who consumed APD treatment. A Body Mass Index (BMI)&>29 kg/m2 was considered obesity. The main measurements were: consumption of APD, generals (gender and age), comorbidities and clinical parameters. Regression logistic analysis and ANCOVA (Bonferroni-adjustment) were applied to correct the model.

From a total of 42,437 attended patients (mean age: 50.9 (SD: 17.8) years; women: 59.9 %; with obesity: 27.3% [confidence interval [CI] of 95 %: 26.9- 27.7]), the 1.3% received APD treatment (typical: 48.8%; atypical: 51.2%; p=not significant). In the logistic-model the obesity was related with the ADP use (odds ratio [OR]: 1.5; CI: 1.3-1.8), hypertension (OR: 2.4; CI:2.2-2.5), diabetes (OR: 1.4; CI: 1.3-1.5) and dyslipidemia (OR: 1.3; CI: 1.2-1.4); p=0,000. The adjusted BMI, in presence of APD, was 27.8 kg/m2 vs. 27.4 kg/m2; p=0,002.

Obesity was associated with the use of APD and with the presence of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia. Differences could not be observed between the use of typical or atypical APD.
