The efficacy of simple dietary advice in 65 patients followed for 3 years at one centre participating in the UK prospective study of maturity onset diabetes was assessed. Whereas normal weight patients tended to keep to the prescribed calories, overweight patients tended to eat more. Total carbohydrate content was unchanged but there was a significant increase in unrefined carbohydrate and fibre.
