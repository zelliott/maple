Intertrigo is a common inflammatory disorder of various origins. It can represent a single skin manifestation or be part of a disorder possibly exhibiting specific manifestations on other parts of the body. Hence, intertrigo may represent a sign of a peculiar disease. It may also result from physicochemical aggressions of the skin following occlusion of the large skinfolds particularly in case of stoutness. In this intance, a treatment similar to that of diaper dermatitis can be offered. A paste enriched or not with miconazole nitrate is indicated to prevent or treat most presentations of intertrigo.
