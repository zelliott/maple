Adiponectin and its receptors are inversely related to the degree of obesity and have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of hydrodynamic delivery of adiponectin and/or its receptor 2 (adipoR2) genes on controlling the development of obesity and insulin resistance in AKR/J mice fed a high-fat diet. An increase in adiponectin and adipoR2 gene expression by hydrodynamic gene delivery prevented diet-induced weight gain, reduced fat accumulation in liver and adipose tissue, and improved insulin sensitivity. Beneficial effects were seen with reduced gluconeogenesis in the liver and lipogenesis in the liver, white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated overexpression of adiponectin and adipoR2 significantly suppressed transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck), glucose-6-phosphatase (g6pase), stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (scd-1) and fatty acid synthase (fas) gene. Inhibition effects were mediated by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). These results prove that elevation of adiponectin and/or adipoR2 expression via gene transfer is an effective approach in managing obesity epidemics.
