To validate a Japanese version of Power of Food Scale (PFS-J), and to describe characteristics in appetitive motives among current Japanese young adults, the original English PFS was translated into Japanese and translated back into English, to confirm conceptual and linguistic equivalence, and administered to university students. Test-retest reliability of the PFS-J was evaluated in additional experiments. The PFS-J demonstrated good internal consistency and stability over time. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the PFS-J has acceptable factor structure. Criterion validity was suggested, in that the relationship between the original PFS and Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised-21 was similar to that between the Japanese versions of the scales. While no association was observed between the scores of PFS-J and Body Mass Index, the scores were higher in women than in men. Characteristics of the appetitive motives in Japan might be different from those in western countries.
