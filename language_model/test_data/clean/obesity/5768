The purpose of our research was to compare the body mass index (BMI) and selected anthropometric parameters in asthmatic and non-asthmatic pubescents.

The study group consisted of 64 asthmatic boys and 45 girls; the control group consisted of 68 nonasthmatic boys and 48 non-asthmatic girls. All the children were 12-14 years old. We measured anthropometric parameters by a standardized method and the percentage of fat using the simple 2-site skinfold method. Additionally, we calculated the percentage of body composition (Matiegka) and the components of somatotype (Heath-Carter). Statistical significance was estimated at the level of p&<.05 by ANOVA test.

The asthmatic boys were significantly shorter than the non-asthmatic (p=0.015), however, we did not find any significant differences in weight and/or BMI in boys nor girls. The asthmatic boys had significantly higher fat mass % than the non-asthmatic ones (p&<.001). Moreover, they had significantly lower muscle mass % (p&<.001) as well as the bone mass % (p&<.001). The asthmatic girls had higher fat mass % than the non-asthmatic ones (p=0.028) and lower muscle mass % (p&<.001). The simple 2-site skinfold method also showed higher fat % in the asthmatic boys (p&<.001) but not in the girls. Examining the Heath-Carter somatotype components, the higher endomorphy was the only significant difference in asthmatic boys (p&<.001) and near significant in asthmatic girls (p=0.053).

Examination of the BMI alone is not sufficient in asthmatic children because of their high percentage of fat. That is why additionally testing fat % is recommended.
