The purposes of the present study were to examine the possibility of a familial tendency for binge eating disorder (BED) among the obese, to clarify the relationship between BED and other eating disorders, and to test the relationship between BED and other psychiatric disorders.

We studied 32 female BED outpatients and 23 obese females without BED. A possible history of eating disorders was assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R-Eating Disorders section administered by telephone interview. Family history information for other psychiatric disorders was collected using the Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria

The frequency of all eating disorders and the risk for other psychiatric disorders were not significantly different between the relatives of the two groups. These results were consistent across generation and gender.

This study failed to show a familial tendency for BED, or any significant familial relationship between BED and other eating disorders, and did not support the hypothesis of coaggregation of other psychiatric disorders with BED.
