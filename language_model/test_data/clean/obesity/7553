To assess any clustering between obesity, dental health, and lifestyle factors (dietary patterns, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption) among adolescents.

A cluster sample of 15-year-old Danish adolescents (DA) from eight municipalities was selected. Self-reported questionnaires for adolescents and their mothers to assess body-mass index (BMI), socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, and clinical examinations to examine adolescents' dental status (DMFT) were used. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and factor analysis were applied.

The mean DMFT was 2.03 and mean BMI was 21.30 among DA.Of the whole sample, 62% experienced caries (DMFT&> 0) and 16% were classified as obese. No association appeared between obesity and DMFT (p&> 0.05). Most adolescents were likely to have breakfast every day (76%), but their daily consumption of fruit was lower (38%). More than half of adolescents reported having physical exercise (66%) and no alcohol consumption (57%). Smokers were more likely to consume alcohol (80%) but less likely to exercise (44%) than nonsmokers (alcohol consumption, 55%; exercise, 68%), (P &<0.05). Principal component analysis revealed that DMFT and obesity were interrelated in DA.

In line with earlier studies, obesity and dental caries share common lifestyle factors among adolescents, regardless of nationality and different health-care systems. Thus, it seems that dental health is a global health concern. There is a need for collaboration between dental and general health-care providers to manage both obesity and dental caries in adolescents by using a holistic approach.
