Bone localisations of amyloidosis are rare, usually diffuse and associated with myeloma. We report the case of a patient with massive obesity complicated by diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea and liver steatosis, who complained of rapidly worsening bilateral polyradiculalgia of the lower limbs. After sufficient weight loss made nuclear magnetic resonance imaging feasible, a spinal tumour was visualised on the 5th lumbar vertebra, extending to soft tissues. Total excision was performed, and pathological studies revealed an amyloid bone tumour with no evidence of myeloma.
