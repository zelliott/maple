Weight gain is common among postobese individuals, providing an opportunity to address the cost of weight regain on energy expenditure. We investigated the energy cost of weight regain over 1 yr in 28 women [age 39.5 +/- 1.3 (SE) yr; body mass index 24.2 +/- 0.5 kg/m(2)] with recent weight loss &>12 kg). Body composition, total energy expenditure (TEE) using doubly labeled water, resting metabolic rate (RMR), and thermic effect of a meal (TEM) were assessed at 0 and 12 mo. Metabolizable energy intake (MEI) was calculated from TEE and change in body composition. Fourteen women had a weight gain of 13.2 +/- 2.1 kg. Twelve-month cumulative excess MEI, calculated as the intake in excess of TEE at month 0, was 749 +/- 149 MJ. Of this, 462 +/- 83 MJ (62%) were stored as accrued tissue, and 287 +/- 72 MJ (38%) was increased TEE. Expressed per kilogram of body weight gain, the energy cost of weight gain was calculated to be 54.8 +/- 4.6 MJ/kg. Interestingly, weight regain time courses fell into three distinct patterns, possibly requiring varying countermeasures.
