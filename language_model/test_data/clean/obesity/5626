Effects of acupuncture on the spontaneous discharge of nerve cells and levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus (VMH) of the obese rats were investigated. Results indicated that the levels of tyrosine (Tyr) and dopamine (DA) were lowered, the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydoxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) increased, and the frequency of the spontaneous discharge of nerve cells in VMH lowered in the obese rat group as compared with the normal group. When acupuncture obtained the effect of weight reduction, the frequency of spontaneous discharges of nerve cells in VMH were markedly increased, and the levels of Tyr, DA and tryptamine (Typ) and 5-HT/5-HIAA ratio elevated, and the 5-HT level lowered. It is suggested that the virtuous regulative action of acupuncture on VMH might be one of the key factors in acupuncture for weight reduction.
