Jejunoileostomy has been performed for several years in extreme obesity and leads to a decrease of several microelements in blood serum. Mainly zinc, copper, and calcium are concerned. But the increasing adaptation of the active parts of the short bowel within a few months is followed by extensive normalization of the other disturbances after jejunoileostomy. As our experience shows, microelements have to be controlled and substituted after jejunoileostomy for at least 2 years, and in some cases we had to go on even after this time.
