Previous studies demonstrated elevated plasma leptin and angiotensinogen (PRA) levels in essential hypertension. However, a few studies investigated the relationship between leptin and angiotensinogen levels in both lean and overweight/ obese hypertensives. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the relationship between blood pressure, leptin and plasma renin activity in normotensives and in both lean and overweight/obese patients with essential hypertension. Two groups of subjects who were carefully matched for age, gender, waist:hip ratio and body mass index (BMI) were studied: 28 normotensives (NT) (age: 40.1+/-9.1 years old, BMI: 28.1+/-3.6 kg/m2, male/female: 18/10) and 33 newly diagnosed mild to moderate essential hypertensives (EHT) (age: 38.9+/-10 years old, BMI: 27.9+/-4.8 kg/m2, male/female: 22/11). No significant differences in age, gender, waist:hip ratio, fasting blood glucose and BMI were detected between EHT and NT groups. However, systolic and diastolic pressures, mean arterial blood pressures, plasma leptin levels and PRA were significantly higher in EHT group than in NT group (P = 0.001). Plasma leptin levels were strongly correlated with BMI in EHT (r=0.67, P = 0.001) and NT groups (r=0.44, P = 0.001). Plasma leptin levels were correlated with plasma PRA levels in both EHT and NT groups (r = 0.66 and r = 0.44; both P &<0.05, respectively). There was no correlation between leptin or PRA and systolic, diastolic pressures, or mean arterial blood pressures. Furthermore, the patients were divided as lean (n=16) and overweight/obese (n = 17) and compared with BMI-matched controls. In both subgroups, plasma leptin and PRA levels were also higher than those of controls. Our results showed that elevated plasma leptin and PRA are associated with hypertension in both lean and overweight/obese hypertensives. Moreover, plasma leptin was significantly correlated with plasma angiotensinogen levels. These findings suggest that adipose mass is an important determinant of blood pressure, although the mechanism is not clear.
