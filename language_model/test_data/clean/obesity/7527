Increasing evidence suggests that rapid postnatal weight gain is associated with increased risks of being overweight or obese later in life and of co-morbidities, such as diabetes, the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. In children as young as two years of age, as well as in adults, an appetitive system-linked impulsivity trait has been demonstrated to be linked with increased overweight, and postulated to act via increased food intake, through greater responsiveness to food and lower self-inhibitory control skills. In this study, we hypothesized that growth in infancy, a critical window for metabolic programming, would be predicted by measures of infant surgency/extraversion, assessed using the Rothbart Infant Behaviour Questionnaire (revised version). Anthropometry was measured at birth and at 3, 6 and 12 months, and weight gains expressed as increases in standardized scores, allowing for adjustment for gender and age, including gestational age. We used conditional weight (CW), a residual of current weight regressed on prior weights, to represent deviations from expected weight gains, from 0 to 3, 3 to 6 and 6 to 12 months. Controlling for significant sociodemographic correlations, multiple regression analyses showed significant prediction of CWs at 3 months but not of CWs at 6 or 12 months by surgency/extraversion. These pilot findings of association between infant growth, during a critical period, and surgency/extraversion, early correlates of impulsivity, warrant further investigation, to ascertain implications for childhood and later weight and body composition.
