It is reported of 726 patients incidentally elected and mainly with life-shortening risk factors. 341 (47.1p.c.) showed an increased concentration of neutral fats and/or total cholesterol in the serum. Type IV (49.8 p.c.) according to Fredrickson was observed most frequently, followed by type IIb (31.1 p.c.) and by type IIa (19.1 p.c.). Most of the patients with hyperlipoproteinemia were overweight (53.1 p.c.), 33.6 p.c. suffered from arterial hypertension, 25.3 p.c. from diseases of the liver, 10.9 p.c. from coronary heart diseases, and 8.7 p.c. from manifest diabetes mellitus. The distribution of different types of hyperlipoproteinemia among the various diseases deviates from that of the total number of patients observed in this study. Cases of hyperlipoproteinemia were observed most frequently in diseases of the kidney with arterial hypertension (62.7 p.c.), coronary heart diseases (60.8 p.c.), manifest gout (60.0 p.c.), manifest diabetes mellitus (58.7 p.c.), and hyperuricemia without symptoms (55.8 p.c.). Type-IV-hyperlipoproteinemia was observed most frequently within the different groups of patients with life-shortening risk factors. An exception was the group of patients suffering from malignancies. Type IIb was found most frequently within the group of patients suffering from malignancies.
