Mulberry therapies on type 2 diabetic patients or streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats have been reported to improve fasting blood glucose levels. We investigated the effects of dietary consumption of mulberry-leaf powder and purified quercetin 3-(6-malonylglucoside), the quantitatively major flavonol glycoside in mulberry leaves, on glucose and lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6J mice aged 8 weeks were assigned to three groups (control, mulberry leaf powder (MLP), and quercetin 3-(6-malonylglucoside) (Q3MG)) and treated with their respective diets for 8 weeks.

We found that dietary supplementation of 10 g MLP kg(-1) or 1 g Q3MG kg(-1) in high-fat diet effectively suppressed blood glucose levels. We also noted increased expression of glycolysis-related genes and suppression of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentrations in the liver of Q3MG group compared to control mice.

Dietary consumption of Q3MG, the quantitatively major flavonol glycoside in mulberry leaves, improved hyperglycemia in obese mice and reduced oxidative stress in the liver.
