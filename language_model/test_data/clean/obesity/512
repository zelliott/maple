Anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) has been proposed as a clinical predictor of improvements in reproductive function following weight loss in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study aimed to assess whether baseline and/or change in AMH levels with weight loss predict improvements in reproductive function in overweight and obese women with PCOS.

Fifty-two overweight and obese women with PCOS and reproductive impairment (age 29.8 +/- 0.8 years, BMI 36.5 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) followed a 20-week weight loss programme. AMH, weight, menstrual cyclicity and ovulatory function were assessed at baseline and post-intervention.

Participants who responded with improvements in reproductive function (n = 26) had lower baseline AMH levels (23.5 +/- 3.7 versus 32.5 +/- 2.9 pmol/l; P = 0.03) and experienced greater weight loss (-11.7 +/- 1.2 versus -6.4 +/- 0.9 kg; P = 0.001) compared with those who did not respond (n = 26). Logistic regression analysis showed that weight loss and baseline AMH were independently related to improvements in reproductive function (P = 0.002 and P = 0.013, respectively). AMH levels did not change with weight loss in both responders and non-responders.

In overweight and obese women with PCOS and reproductive dysfunction, a 20-week weight loss intervention resulted in improvements in reproductive function but no change in AMH levels.
