To determine whether a first degree family history (FH) of diabetes and/or a first degree FH of cardiovascular disease (CVD), can predict prevalent cases of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Also, to establish if the association is different for South Asians compared to White Europeans, and for obese compared to non-obese individuals.

Cross-sectional data were analysed for a mixed-ethnic cohort of 3094 at-risk individuals, aged 40-75 years (29% South Asian), who were screened in Leicestershire (UK) for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes using an oral glucose tolerance test. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between FH and prevalent MetS, including adjustment for potential confounders.

Prevalence of MetS was 39%. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) showed that only a FH of CVD (OR 1.41, 95%CI: 1.18-1.68, p&<.001) was significantly associated with prevalent MetS. Interaction analysis showed no effect modification for obesity and ethnicity. We did not find any association for a FH of diabetes.

These findings suggest that a first degree FH of CVD predicts prevalent cases of MetS in a mixed-ethnic population. Evidence of an association may help to identify individuals who should be targeted for screening and early prevention of type 2 diabetes and CVD.
