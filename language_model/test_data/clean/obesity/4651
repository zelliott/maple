This article aims to identify socio-demographic and behavioral determinants of overweight among Brazilian adults living in State capitals and the Federal District, using data collected by a telephone survey for surveillance of risk and protective factors in 2008. The outcome variable was overweight, and the independent variables were socio-demographics, behavioral factors, and nutritional status at 20 years of age. The overweight rate was 44.4%. Socio-demographic factors associated with overweight were age and marital status (married) in both genders, higher schooling in men, and lower schooling in women. With the exception of overweight at 20 years of age, behavioral factors were associated differently with overweight according to gender (leisure-time physical inactivity in males and dietary patterns and watching television among females). The behavioral determinants of overweight differed between men and women, thus indicating the need for diverse gender-specific strategies.
