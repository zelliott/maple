To compare health related quality of life (HRQoL) of obese adolescents with normal weight controls and to explore the relation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and HRQoL.

Cross-sectional study in 31 adolescents (12-18 years), referred for obesity, in comparison with 62 age and sex matched normal weight controls. HRQoL was assessed using the PedsQL 4.0 and Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). The main outcome measure was difference in HRQoL between obese and control subjects.

Mean BMI (SD) in patients versus controls was 34.9 (8.8) versus 19.5 (2.2) kg/m2. In obese adolescents, lower HRQoL in three PedsQL and seven CHQ scales was found (p &<0.05). Variance in HRQoL scales explained by obesity ranged from 8% (CHQ Physical Functioning) to 28% (CHQ Global Health). BMI z-score was inversely correlated with five PedsQL and 10 CHQ scales while the percentage of scale variance explained by BMI z-score ranged from 7% (CHQ Physical summary scale) to 33% (CHQ Global Health).

HRQoL in obese adolescents is less than in normal weight controls, and is partially explained by obesity-related comorbidity. Overall HRQoL was inversely associated with BMI. Hence, HRQoL is an important indicator of impact of obesity and effect of interventions, complementary to clinical variables.
