Obesity in the abdominal area causes difficulty not only with the placement of an ileal conduit stoma and conduit length but also with surgical exposure during radical surgery to the pelvis. Such problems may be ameliorated by using a horizontal abdominal dermolipectomy in conjunction with a midline fascial and peritoneal incision and the Turnbull ileal stoma in selected obese patients. The advantages of this technique far outweigh the limited complications which may be encountered.
