Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) is a novel regulator for metabolic syndrome (MetS), diabetes, and obesity. However, no study has been performed on the association of these diseases with FGF-21 gene polymorphism. The aim of the study was to investigate the association of 3' untranslated region (UTR) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FGF-21 gene with MetS, obesity, and diabetes in the Han Chinese population. A total of 291 subjects were recruited from the Han Chinese population in Sichuan province. The genotypes of FGF-21 were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotypes were confirmed by sequencing. No polymorphisms were found in rs11665841 (1 of 291) and rs3745706 (2 of 291). We did not find an association between genotype frequencies of SNP rs11665896 and lipid concentration, glucose concentration, or blood pressure. The TG/GG genotype relative to the TT genotype had an age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio of 1.41 for MetS (p=0.149), 1.84 (p=0.016) for obesity (body mass index ≥25 kg/m(2)), and 1.19 (p=0.492) for diabetes. Genetic variation of the 3' UTR of the FGF-21 gene was associated with obesity, however, not with MetS or diabetes.
