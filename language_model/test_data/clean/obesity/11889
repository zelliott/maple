Bariatric surgery is the most effective modality of achieving weight loss as well as the most effective treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is an incretin and is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and T2DM. Its role in weight loss and resolution of T2DM after bariatric surgery is very controversial. We have made an attempt to review the physiology of GIP and its role in weight loss and resolution of T2DM after bariatric surgery. We searched PubMed and included all relevant original articles (both human and animal) in the review. Whereas most human studies have shown a decrease in GIP post-malabsorptive bariatric surgery, the role of GIP in bariatric surgery done in animal experiments remains inconclusive.
