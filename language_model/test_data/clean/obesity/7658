The infections of odontogenic origin, set in the soft tissues region of the viscerocranium are among the most frequent conditions specific to this anatomical level. A distinct category among these, represented by the conditions with diffuse character, may have serious forms, developing systemic septic metastases. The current paper displays a study approaching seven cases of odontogenic diffuse infections with metastases at distance. The ways in which the septic metastases appeared, as well as the topic and general prescribed treatment have been analyzed. The expanding at distance of the suppuration occurred at those patients who were suffering from cervical necroziting fasciitis associated to some immunodepressing conditions. Out of the 7 patients involved in the study, 4 were suffering from uncompensated diabetes and obesity. All those 7 patients had septic conditions localized in mediastinal region, and in 3 cases hepatic septic affections were observed. The best treatment possible for these conditions proved to be the surgical one associated with that concerned with the sustenance of the general state of health, the rebalancing of the homeostatic constants and the antibacterial one. The post-surgical evolution in case of 5 patients was a good one, in case of 2 patients being unfavourable because of the appearance of the multiorganic insufficiency and of death.
