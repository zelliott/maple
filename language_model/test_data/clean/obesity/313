To evaluate the impact of abdominal fat and insulin resistance on arterial hypertension of non-obese women.

Thirty-five non-obese women (NO), age 35-68 years were studied, and divided into two groups according to the presence of hypertension (BP&>or= 140 x 90 mmHg) (HT = hypertensive; NT = normotensive). Leptin measurement and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to assess insulin were performed in these patients. A CT-scan was used to evaluate visceral (VF) and subcutaneous abdominal fat (SCF). The Central fat distribution index (CDI) was proposed to evaluate the impact of subcutaneous abdominal fat on central fat distribution in hypertensive patients.

When compared to NT-NO (n = 17) group, HT-NO (n = 18) showed higher blood pressure levels (systolic and diastolic), greater VF area (84.40 +/- 55.70 versus 37.50 +/- 23.00 cm(2); p = 0.036), greater SCF area (174.30 +/- 83.00 versus 79.80 +/- 27.40 cm(2); p = 0.030), higher HOMAr index (1.59 +/- 0.72 versus 0.93 +/- 0.48 mmol*mU/L(2); p = 0.006), higher CDI index (12.67 +/- 7.04 versus 6.19 +/- 2.57 cm(2)/kg) and higher leptin level (19.1 +/- 9.6 versus 7.4 +/- 3.5 ng/mL; p = 0.028).

Arterial hypertension in non-obese women is associated with insulin resistance, central fat distribution and higher leptin levels.
