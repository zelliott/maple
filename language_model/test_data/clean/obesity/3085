Lipid metabolism indices were followed up in 62 patients with diabetes mellitus type II and in 20 healthy persons as controls. An increase of serum triglycerides, very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins, a decrease of high density lipoproteins and cholesterol in the upper reference range were found. Following diabetes compensation these indices became normal. In decompensated diabetes apoprotein A increased, apoprotein B decreased. Diabetes compensation lead to normalization of these indices. A comparative study of these indices in diabetics with and without ischemic heart disease was carried out. It showed a considerable decrease of the high density lipoproteins and a parallel increase of the very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins in the diabetics with ischemic heart disease. The results of the study lead to the conclusion that criterion for diabetes compensation should be not only the blood sugar normalization bur also the correction of the lipid fractions changes.
