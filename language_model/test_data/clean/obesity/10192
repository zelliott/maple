We looked at the relationships among posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), body mass index (BMI) and socioeconomic status (SES) in a newly formed PTSD program at the Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Richmond, VA.

We reviewed 265 records and then selected only black and white male veterans (n=252) for study. Variables were: 1) age, 2) decade of life, 3) height, 4) weight, 5) sex, 6) race, and 7) SES (estimated using priority group status). Low income is an important variable determining priority group status.

About two-thirds of the veterans were in the age range of 50-59 years (Vietnam veterans). Their mean BMI was 30.2 +/- 5.6 kg/m2, and this value did not separate by race. Far exceeding national numbers, 84.1% of our veterans were either overweight or obese. Veterans in the lower priority groups had greater (p=0.029) BMIs than their counterparts in higher priority groups.

The pervasiveness of overweight and obesity in our PTSD population was profound. Our observations suggest that low SES is a likely contributor to veterans in lower priority groups having greater BMIs than veterans in higher priority groups.
