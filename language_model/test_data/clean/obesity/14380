Relationships have been observed between lipoprotein concentrations and insulin action. These relationships may be important in explaining the association of insulin resistance and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism found in obesity, diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. We have measured plasma lipoprotein concentrations and indices of insulin action in 85 men and 56 women, all of whom were normolipidemic and had normal glucose tolerance. The subjects were obese Southwestern American Indians (body mass index 34 +/- 1). Insulin action was measured via the hyperinsulinemic clamp with simultaneous indirect calorimetry. Triglyceride concentrations were inversely related to rates of total insulin-mediated glucose disposal (in men and women, respectively, r = -.37, P less than .01; r = -.24, P less than .10), glucose storage (r = -.31, P less than .01; r = -.25, P less than .10), increase in glucose oxidation (r = -.29, P less than .01; r = -.24, P less than .10), and, in men only, suppression of endogenous glucose production (r = -.32, P less than .01). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration was positively related to rates of total insulin-mediated glucose disposal (r = .35, P less than .01; r = .33, P less than .05), increase in carbohydrate oxidation (r = .40, P less than .001; r = .39, P less than .001), suppression of endogenous glucose production (r = .24, P less than .05; r = .29, P less than .05), and, in men only, glucose storage (r = .35, P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
