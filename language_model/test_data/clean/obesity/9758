Microalbuminuria is an early sign of kidney and cardiovascular damage. Therefore, early detection in asymptomatic individuals may be helpful in preventing deterioration in renal function.

We carried out a cross-sectional study of 820 secondary school students aged 10 - 19 years from September to November 2008. The urine samples of 615 (75.0%) without overt proteinuria and haematuria were tested for microalbuminuria using the micral test strips. Values of greater than 20mg/L were considered positive.

There were 299 (48.6%) males and 316 (51.4%) females, with a M:F ratio of 1:1.1. The prevalence of microalbuminuria as seen in 214 of the students was 33.2%. It was significantly higher in females (45.3%), obese subjects (35.4%), those with hypertension (70.6%), those with positive family history of hypertension (59.5%), and diabetes mellitus (46.4%). Microalbuminuria was found in 1 of the 2 subjects who had features of DM and in one subject with sickle cell anemia.

The prevalence of microalbuminuria in Nigerian adolescents is high. We recommend routine screening for microalbuminuria in adolescents for early detection and prevention of renal damage.
