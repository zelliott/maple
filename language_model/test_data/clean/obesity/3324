Several experimental data have documented the ability of both opiates and opioid peptides to stimulate food intake. On the other hand, the plasma beta-endorphin levels found in obese patients are higher than those observed in normal-weight controls, which may have pathogenetic implications. We have investigated the responses of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon to an infusion of human beta-endorphin in formerly obese subjects who had obtained by dieting the normalization of body weight and in lean controls. The data show that: a) the increased plasma beta-endorphin concentrations found in human obesity are not corrected by normalization of body weight; b) formerly obese subjects behave as obese subjects in their metabolic and hormonal responses to beta-endorphin.
