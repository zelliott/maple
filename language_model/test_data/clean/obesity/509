Clinicians and health professionals are increasingly challenged to understand and consider the different health needs of women and men. The increase of gender awareness and the expanding science of gender medicine will affect more and more clinical practice. This review addresses gender-specific aspects in metabolic disorders and related complications, which represent an increasing burden of this century and a great challenge to public health.

There is increasing evidence of gender-related differences in risk factors, clinical manifestation and sequelae of obesity and diabetes and increasing knowledge that prevention, detection and therapy of illness affect men and women differently.

Some gender-specific aspects, especially regarding cardiovascular disease, have been studied in more detail, but for many complications sex-related analyses of the results of both clinical trials and basic science are still missing or disregarded. Impaired glucose and lipid metabolism as well as dysregulation of energy balance and body fat distribution have a great impact on overall health via neuroendocrine changes and inflammatory pathways and deteriorate the course of many diseases with particular harm for women. Metabolic diseases dramatically affect life of men and women from infancy up to old age and are a major challenge for women during pregnancy. Great impact is attached to the intrauterine period and the lifelong implications of fetal programming.

Initiation of prospective studies on the impact of gender as primary outcome and investigation of gender-related pathophysiological mechanisms of chronic diseases will help to improve patient care and to implement evidence-based gender-specific prevention programs and clinical recommendations in future.
