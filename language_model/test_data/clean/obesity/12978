Health and fitness professionals most often approach health care for large people in the context that health improvement can only be attained through weight loss. Unequivocal acceptance of the notion that thinness equals health and fitness presents an obstacle for large people who want to improve their health through lifestyle changes in eating and activity patterns and also weakens the working relationship between the health care professional and the large client. Since the health benefits of exercise and sound nutrition are significant for people of all sizes, the strategy for health care professionals should be to assist people of all sizes in eating healthier and becoming more active. Because large people face even more barriers to exercise than smaller people, we address the special needs of large people trying to become more physically active, outline an approach sensitive to their needs, and suggest how health and fitness professionals can improve their effectiveness with this population.
