Presented is an epidemiologic study on predisposing factors in telangiectatic and varicose leg veins on 500 female patients. Genetic predisposition, hyperestrogenemic states, standing vocations, and obesity were found to be the major predisposing factors. Recognition of these factors may help to prevent further progression of proliferative venous disease after sclerotherapy in susceptible individuals.
