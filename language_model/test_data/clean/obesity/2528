Relationships between increased adiposity and fat-soluble vitamin storage and metabolism are poorly understood. To examine these associations, 6% or 21% dietary fat was fed to rats for 11 weeks and tissue vitamin A storage determined. Two levels of supplemental vitamin A were administered. At the end of the tenth week, 3,4-didehydroretinol (DR) was administered orally, and its kinetics were followed for 1 week in serum and tissues. Model-based compartmental analysis was applied to these data. Kidney total retinol (R) concentrations were elevated in rats fed 6% compared with 21% dietary fat (n = 24/group). The fractional transfer coefficient (FTC) describing the movement of tracer from plasma to extravascular stores was two times higher in the 6% compared with the 21% fat group. Consistent with the elevated renal R in 6% fat fed rats, there was a 2-fold increase in the FTC representing tracer distribution from plasma to kidney in the 6% compared with 21% fat group. Taken together with a fat main effect on renal vitamin A, our data support the evidence that faster turnover of kidney R may help set the mechanism governing vitamin A tissue distribution during deficiency. Rats fed 21% versus 6% dietary fat conserved hepatic R more efficiently.
