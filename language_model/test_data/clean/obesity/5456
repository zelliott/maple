The high prevalence of obesity and cardiovascular risk factors in hypopituitarism affirms the need for effective weight loss intervention. In this study, we investigated the combined effect of sibutramine, diet, and exercise in obese hypopituitary patients (HPs).

In an open-label prospective intervention trial, 14 obese well-substituted nondiabetic HPs and 14 matched simple obese controls were allocated to 11-month treatment with sibutramine (10 to 15 mg), diet (600 kcal/d deficit), and exercise. Anthropometric indices and body composition (obtained from DXA scan) were assessed monthly for the first 5 months and thereafter every second month for the next 6 months.

Mean (+/-SD) weight loss at 11 months was 11.3 +/- 4.8 kg in patients vs. 10.7 +/- 4.7 kg in controls. The HPs exhibited the same improvements in body composition, waist circumference, blood lipids, and fasting glucose as the simple obese. In a multivariate model, baseline weight, duration of growth hormone replacement therapy, and duration of pituitary disease explained 79% (p = 0.001) of the variation in weight loss at 4 months in the HPs. Only baseline weight and waist circumference could predict weight loss at 11 months.

HPs are not resistant to weight loss therapy. Almost all will achieve at least 5% weight loss, and 60% can lose&>10% weight within 11 months. However, the long-term effect on risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease as well as on mortality needs to be established.
