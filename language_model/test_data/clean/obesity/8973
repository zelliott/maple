To study the effect of conjugated linoleic acid on gene expression of fatty acid binding proteins (ap2) in white obesity tissue of rats with insulin resistance, and explore the mechanism of resisting diabetes by CLA.

Male Wistar rats were randomly separated to control group, high-fat group and high fat + CLA group (0.75g, 1.50g, 3.00g by diet weight), Using reverse transcription polymerse chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique to measure the expression level of ap2 and Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor--gamma (PPARgamma) mRNA expression.

The FFA, serum insulin and glucose levels of rats with insulin resistance were higher than that of rats fed with basic diet, supplement of CLA can decrease FFA, serum insulin and glucose levels of rats with insulin resistance, and CLA can increase the expression of ap2 and PPARgamma mRNA in adipose tissue of rat with insulin resistance.

CLA can improve insulin resistance of obese rat and increase the expression of ap2 mRNA,possibly acting through activing PPARgamma.
