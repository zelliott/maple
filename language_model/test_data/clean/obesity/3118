In order to explore the expression of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA in white adipose tissue of diet-induced obesity-resistant (DIO-R) rats.

Fifty male Sprague-dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into control group and high-fat group and they were fed with basic diet and high-fat diet respectively for 13 weeks. DIO-R and DIO rats were selected according to their body weight and the quantity of energy intake, then observing changing of the body fat content, the level of serum growth hormone was determined by radioimmunoassay and the level of the HSL mRNA in white adipose tissue was determined by RT-PCR.

The body fat content of DIO-R rats were lower than those of DIO rats (P &<0.05). The level of serum growth hormone of DIO-R rats were higher than those of DIO rats (P &<0.05). High fat diets increased the level of the HSL mRNA in DIO-R rats.

Increasing expression of HSL in white adipose tissue may play a part of role in resisting diet-induced obesity of rats.
