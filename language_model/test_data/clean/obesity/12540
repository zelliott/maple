The objective of this study was to show gaps and inconsistencies in selected literature on the cost-effectiveness of preventing weight gain and obesity and to set an agenda for future research. A review and qualitative analysis of the literature was carried out on the cost-effectiveness of preventing weight gain and obesity, with a primary focus on programs that influence health outcomes and directly change individual behavior through physical activity promotion (i.e., energy expenditure increase). A literature search reveals that computer simulation models on the lifetime cost of obese versus normal-weight persons show conflicting results. Studies on programs to promote physical activity as a means to prevent obesity also show varying cost-effectiveness ratios, with a key variable from a societal perspective being the cost of time required to exercise. In particular, this review found a need for more parsimonious simulation models and more information on the comparative cost-effectiveness of programs to prevent weight gain/obesity.
