Fetal takings still concern about 6 to 7% of the pregnancies. If, in the majority of the cases, the taking does not present difficulty for a trained operator, particular circumstances related to maternal context (anticoagulating treatment, vaginal bleeding, feverâ€¦) may make the taking become more difficult. From a questionnaire sent to the French multidisciplinary centers for prenatal diagnosis and a review of the literature, we establish guidelines for fetal taking in these circumstances.
