Obesity rates in the United States have been rising over the past 35 years, resulting in a subsequent increase in nutrition-related chronic disease morbidity and mortality and significant burdens to families, communities, and health care systems. In working to formulate effective public health policy solutions that address the obesity epidemic, it is important to analyze how obesity has been defined and accepted as a social problem. This article applies Hilgartner and Bosk's public arenas model to examine how obesity is defined in the public arena, how competition plays a role in "framing" the obesity issue, and how operatives influence the ways in which obesity is viewed and understood. Implications for nurses and policy makers are addressed in the context of using the public arenas model as a tool to analyze the social problem of obesity.
