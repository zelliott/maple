Can normal nutritional status, as indicated by albumin, transferrin and lean body mass values, be maintained during a 100 lb weight loss after gastric partitioning? Fifteen morbidly obese patients with normal nutritional status were fed three diets before (diet A) and after (diets B and C) gastric partitioning, and changes in albumin, transferrin, and lean body mass were monitored. Diets A and C were compositionally equal and contained 40 to 60 g of protein and 600 to 900 calories administered in six to eight equally divided portions per day. Diet B contained 20 to 40 g of protein and 600 to 800 calories per day and was given through a gastrostomy tube for three months after surgery while oral input was limited to noncaloric liquids. Results showed that weight loss was more rapid before surgery with diet A, than after surgery with diet B or C (diet A versus diet B, p less than 0.05; diet A versus diet C, p less than 0.05). Lean body mass was maintained with each diet, but transferrin (p less than 0.01) and albumin (p less than 0.05) decreased while patients were fed diet B. When gastrostomy tube feedings were discontinued, diet C restored albumin and transferrin to preoperative values (diet C versus diet B, p less than 0.05, diet C versus diet A, p greater than 0.1). Total postoperative weight loss averaged 106 +/- 20 lb after 2 years. These data show that in carefully selected patients with morbid obesity who demonstrate compliance to diet A before surgery, a 100 lb weight loss may be achieved while nutritional competence is maintained.
