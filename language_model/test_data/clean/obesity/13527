To investigate whether there is a relationship between hiatus hernia (HH) and kyphosis or obesity in elderly Japanese persons.

The causes of HH in the elderly are unclear.

We enrolled 147 consecutive patients aged over 50 years in this study. Endoscopic assessment of the size of HH was performed by using a modified Makuuchi classification with grades from 1 (no HH) to 4 &>3 cm). The gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV) was also graded from I to IV. Kyphosis was evaluated from a lateral photograph by measuring the modified Cobb angle (CA) and calculating the kyphosis index (KI). Body mass index (BMI) was used to evaluate obesity.

In women, there were significant differences of both the CA (analysis of variance, P&<.0001) and KI (Kruskal-Wallis test, P&<.01) between each grade of HH. Differences of the CA (P&<.001) and KI (P&<.001) were also seen between the grades of GEFV. None of these differences were detected in men. In women, the CA (r=0.556, P&<.0001) and KI (P&<.0001) were positively correlated with age, but this was not so in men. Neither sex showed an association between BMI and the grade of either HH or GEFV. However, there was a weak negative correlation between age and BMI in women (r=-0.223, P&<.05) and men (r=-0.334, P&<.05).

The size of HH is associated with the severity of kyphosis, not with obesity, in elderly Japanese women. Age is a risk factor for both kyphosis and HH.
