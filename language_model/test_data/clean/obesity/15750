Worldwide, the rates of obesity are rapidly rising. Abdominal obesity in particular is associated with increased cardiovascular risk factors, namely increased triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, elevated blood pressure and increased plasma glucose. The cluster of these obesity-related metabolic disorders identifies individuals with the cardiometabolic syndrome, who are at particular risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The accumulation of intra-abdominal fat and the subsequent development of visceral obesity rely on the body's mechanisms to store energy and to stimulate appetite. The endocannabinoid system has been implicated in the regulation of energy balance and has emerged as a critical target for the modulation of visceral obesity and insulin resistance. Its overactivity appears to be associated with the development of obesity. The current review examines the role of the endocannabinoid system in cardiometabolic disease and its basis as a target for modulating cardiovascular risk.
