The authors evaluate the incidence of the main risk factors in endometrial cancer by comparing a continuous series of 101 patients with a matched reference series. Among these factors, obesity and multiparity are significantly more frequent in patients with endometrial cancer. All of these risk factors are related to a hyperestrogen level. Their knowledge may contribute to a policy of prevention of endometrial cancer, but does not permit its screening by limiting to women presenting these risk factors.
