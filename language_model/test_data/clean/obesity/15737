Visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor (vaspin) is an interesting novel adipocytokine with insulin-sensitizing effects. Some studies have suggested that vaspin could play an important role in the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. The induction of vaspin mRNA expression could represent a compensatory mechanism associated with obesity, severe insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, however it is unclear whether a correlation exists between human vaspin serum levels and markers of insulin sensitivity and glucose or lipid metabolism. Vaspin serum concentrations have been shown to be lower in lean subjects and competitive sportsmen with long-term physical training, but they are increased with weight loss associated with a physical training programme. In conclusion, there is at present no clear proof of a causal link between vaspin and visceral fat accumulation, or insulin resistance. This article reviews the role of vaspin in obesity-associated diseases and its potential as a new biomarker for obesity and impaired insulin sensitivity.
