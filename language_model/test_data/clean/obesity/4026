To examine whether or not obesity in later life is related to feeding practice in early infancy, daily nutrient intake was studied in relation to relative weight in a cohort of 170 healthy infants from birth to 3 yr of age. Dietary records were made monthly for the first 6 months and at 3-monthly intervals thereafter, always covering the week preceding anthropometric measurements. The frequency distribution of relative weight varied according to age and sex; the infants did not remain in the same relative weight group during the observed period. When comparing the relative weight at 6 and 36 months, the coefficients of correlation were rather weak for both sexes (r = 0.33 and 0.35). There were no significant differences in the history of breast-feeding according to relative weight. The mean energy intake per kg of body weight was always lower in infants with relative weight above 105% of expected weight and fats and carbohydrates were consumed less in the same group. There were no differences in protein intake according to relative weight, although this intake was always higher than the recommended nutrient intake. Daily intake of zinc was comparable in all weight groups. Results indicate that the infants with above-average relative weights did not consume greater quantities of principal nutrients. The results, therefore, do not support the hypothesis that implicates overfeeding in early infancy as a major cause of obesity in later life.
