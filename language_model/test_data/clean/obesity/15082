This review addresses the increasingly prolific literature from studies in man and animals suggesting that maternal obesity, a diet rich in calories or excess gestational weight gain may, through perturbation of the intrauterine environment, lead to lifelong risk of obesity and related disorders in the child. In addressing maternal- child obesity relationships it remains a challenge to distinguish the influence of the intrauterine environment from the contribution of shared genetic traits, and to adequately adjust for postnatal determinants of childhood obesity. Studies in genetically identical rodents convincingly show that maternal obesity, as well as elements of a hypercalorific diet can permanently influence offspring risk of obesity, and are these are supported by studies in larger mammals. Importantly, dissection of the mechanism in animals has led to description of novel interactive pathways between maternal environment and fetus which are amenable to investigation in humans.
