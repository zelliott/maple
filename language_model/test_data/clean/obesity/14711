We hypothesized that the loss of glucose homeostasis in ob/ob mice is associated with upregulation of islet uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) expression, leading to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Changes in glucose homeostasis in lean and ob/ob mice from 5 to 16 weeks were assessed by fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin, oral glucose tolerance, and tissue insulin sensitivity. In vitro GSIS and ATP content were assayed in isolated islets, while UCP2 expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting. Short-term reduction of UCP2 expression was achieved through transfection of islets with specific small interfering RNA. Insulin resistance was detected in 5-week-old ob/ob mice, but GSIS and blood glucose levels remained normal. By 8 weeks of age, ob/ob mice displayed fasting hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance, and also had elevated non-esterified fatty acid concentration in plasma. In vitro, GSIS and ATP generation were impaired in ob/ob islets. Islet UCP2 expression was elevated at 5 and 8 weeks of age. Short-term knockdown of islet UCP2 increased GSIS in islets of lean mice, but had no effect in islets from ob/ob mice. Loss of glucose homeostasis and impairment of insulin secretion from isolated islets at 8 weeks in ob/ob mice is preceded by an increase in UCP2 expression in islets. Moreover, the glucolipotoxic conditions observed are predicted to increase UCP2 activity, contributing to lower islet ATP and GSIS.
