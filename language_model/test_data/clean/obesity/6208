Obesity is becoming an important public health problem given its strong association with insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Previously considered an inert depot, fat is now regarded as a highly metabolically active tissue in many pathophysiological processes. In humans, the accumulation of omental rather than subcutaneous adipose tissue appears to be tightly linked to cardiovascular disease and other important comorbidities. Proteomics has emerged as a method for the large-scale study of proteins in biological samples, for instance, fluids, cells or tissues, which encompasses not only the identities of the proteins present, but also quantification and post-translational modification events. Human adipose tissue proteome analysis, still in its early stages, may help understand the molecular mechanisms of obesity and the role of omental fat in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated diseases. This review covers recent advances in human adipose tissue proteomics, focusing on the analysis of the omental and the subcutaneous fat.
