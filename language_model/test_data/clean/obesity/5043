There is growing evidence that the type of carbohydrate consumed is important in relation to metabolic disease risk, and there is currently particular interest in the role of low-glycaemic-index (GI) foods. Observational studies have associated low-GI diets with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and CHD, and improvements in various metabolic risk factors have been seen in some intervention studies. However, findings have been mixed and inconsistent. There are a number of plausible mechanisms for the effects of these foods on disease risk, which arise from the differing metabolic responses to low- and high-GI foods, with low-GI foods resulting in reductions in hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and late postprandial circulating NEFA levels. Low-GI foods may also increase satiety and delay the return of hunger compared with high-GI foods, which could translate into reduced energy intake at later time points. However, the impact of a low-GI diet on body weight is controversial, with many studies confounded by dietary manipulations that differ in aspects other than GI. There is currently much interest in GI from scientists, health professionals and the public, but more research is needed before clear conclusions can be drawn about relationships with metabolic disease risk.
