Population awareness of their parameters of height and body mass was studied on a representative random population of the Lithuanian SSR. Statistical analysis showed great awareness of the population of the Republic of these parameters permitting the use of the answers of the study population for the determination of excess body mass. However, since the interview method to determine excess body mass is entirely dependent on the awareness of the population of a given district, it can be used only after preliminary epidemiological surveys.
