To compare hemoglobin A1c (A1C) values at baseline with those after 1 year of insulin glargine therapy and, secondarily, to compare insulin dosage and patients' body weight at baseline and at 1 year.

Retrospective study.

Private endocrinology practice.

One hundred ninety-seven patients with diabetes mellitus who were first prescribed insulin glargine from May 2001-April 2002 and were evaluable after 1 year of therapy

Patients received insulin glargine instead of NPH insulin or in addition to their oral drug therapy

Patients with diabetes type 1 (receiving insulin therapy) or type 2 (receiving oral drug therapy only, a combination of oral drug therapy and insulin, or insulin only) who had been treated with insulin glargine for 1 year were evaluated. Overall, A1C values decreased significantly (p&<.001) by 0.53 +/- 1.4% from a baseline mean of 8.1 +/- 1.7%. In 129 patients with type 2 diabetes previously treated with NPH insulin, A1C decreased significantly (p&<.001) 0.57 +/- 1.5% from baseline. The A1C decreased by 0.71 +/- 1.3% (p=0.0043) from baseline in 33 patients with type 2 diabetes who previously received oral agents only Thirty-five patients with type 1 diabetes demonstrated no significant change in A1C (-0.22 +/- 1.0%, p=0.217) from baseline. In patients receiving insulin at baseline, the number of daily injections increased significantly (p&<.0001) from a median of two at baseline to three at 1 year. Overall, no significant change was noted in total daily insulin requirement or in body weight in any of the patient groups over the 1-year period.

Compared with baseline, insulin glargine therapy at 1 year was associated with an overall significant reduction in A1C of 0.53 +/- 1.4%.
