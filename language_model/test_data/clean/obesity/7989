The prevalence of obesity is particularly high in Black and Latino pediatric populations. A limited number of metabolic studies suggest that race plays a role in the development of obesity-related co-morbidities. We evaluated clinical and metabolic characteristics of 428 obese (mean BMI z-score 2.63) children and adolescents ranging in age from 2-20 years, of primarily Dominican ancestry attending the obesity clinic at Children's Hospital of New York Presbyterian over a 5-year period (1998-2003). Of 193 patients available for detailed metabolic analysis, abnormalities were found for elevated systolic blood pressure (19%), diastolic blood pressure (11%), total cholesterol (18%), LDL (12%), triglycerides (10%), AST (&<%), ALT (4%), low HDL (47%), impaired fasting glucose (5%), impaired glucose tolerance 7%, diabetes mellitus by fasting criteria(&<%), and metabolic syndrome (14%). Despite extraordinary family histories of obesity and diabetes mellitus, the metabolic syndrome and abnormalities of glucose regulation were relatively infrequent compared to studies of obese, pediatric Latino patients of primarily Mexican and Puerto Rican ancestry. This finding suggests that Latinos from different areas of origin may have different risks of obesity-related conditions.
