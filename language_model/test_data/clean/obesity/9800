Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetic disorder with obesity as one of the major phenotypic criterion, which is proposed to be of neuroendocrine origin. Therefore, disturbances in appetite-regulating hormones have been considered as causative factors. Acyl ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone, whereas its desacylated form, obestatin, and leptin have the opposite functions. Ghrelin is negatively regulated in relation to nutritional status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hormone alterations on obesity development in BBS patients.

Total and acylated ghrelin, obestatin, leptin and adiponectin were measured in eight children with BBS. The results were analyzed in relation to auxological parameters [body mass index (BMI), height].

The mean BMI was significantly increased in BBS patients compared to the controls. Plasma levels of acylated ghrelin, total ghrelin and obestatin were slightly elevated in BBS patients compared to controls, as was the acyl/total ghrelin ratio. Leptin levels were significantly elevated in BBS patients.

BBS patients lack the negative regulatory mechanisms of appetite-regulating hormones with respect to nutritional status and exhibit resistance to anorexigenic leptin. This results in a shift towards the orexigenic effects of this self-regulating system. These alterations may in part be responsible for the disturbed appetite regulation in BBS patients.
