Overweight and obesity are recognised as significant risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). Weight reduction leads to reduction in associated CHD risk factors. The discovery that endocannabinoid system is involved in regulation of food intake and other reward behaviours has led to development of cannabinoid receptor antagonists. Recent studies with rimonabant, a cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB(1)) antagonist, demonstrate clinically significant weight loss as well as reduction in metabolic syndromme burden in obese patients.
