Obesity is a common disease in Germany. Although care facilities are confronted with an increasing number of obese people, the care of them in nursing homes is barely investigated. The present study examines the amount of work using the example of the activity of dressing obese and non-obese nursing home residents and discloses with its temporal and structural differences. In five nursing homes in Berlin a fully structured observational study based on a convenience sample was conducted. 48 nurses were observed while performing the activity of dressing 70 residents aged 65 years and older. The residents' demographic data and medical diagnoses were taken from the nursing records. Information about the functional/cognitive status and pain events were collected by using the interRAI Contact Assessment. Further data regarding the nurses were obtained through face-to-face interviews. The results show a significant correlation between Body Mass Index and the required time of dressing. No correlations exist between age, qualifications and nurses' level of education and the time of dressing. Structural differences in the care of obese and non-obese residents appear by changes of, single activity sequences. The care of the obese residents is associated with increased time requirements and structurally differs from the care of the non-obese residents. This should lead to further research because it has implications for staffing in nursing homes.
