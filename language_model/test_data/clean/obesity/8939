Previous studies have suggested that hyperhomocysteinaemia (Hcy) could be a strong and independent cardiovascular risk factor. Many factors could influence the serum concentration of Hcy such as vitamin B 12, folic acid, renal failure, hypothyroid status, ovarian failure and cancers. So the aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinaemia among 54 type 2 diabetic patients and to study, its relationship with vitamin B12, folic acid and Metformin. Were excluded all patients with an evident cause of hyperhomocysteinaemia. Mean age of patients was 52.8 years. Mean Hcy was 11.7 + 6.9 micromol/l. The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinaemia was 27.8% in our group. There were eight (14%) patients with vitamin B12 deficiency and three among them had hyperhomocysteinaemia. There was no folic acid deficiency and no relationship with Metformin treatment. We suggest a wide screening of hyperhomocysteinaemia in type 2 diabetic patients and folic acid or vitamin B12 supplements if necessary.
