A study of adipose cell metabolism was made at ages 5, 7, 10, and 14 wk of age in genetically obese Zucker rats. Adipose samples were surgically removed and used for in vitro adipose cell incubations and for characterization of enzyme patterns. Lipogenic capacity from glucose and enzymes normally associated with lipogenesis (malic enzyme, citrate cleavage enzyme and glucose-6-PO4 dehydrogenase) followed the same pattern of development. At 5 wk of age, the adipose cells of obese animals had a greater capacity for fat synthesis than the lean rats. At all other ages lipogenic activity and enzyme levels were either similar or less than the pair-fed lean littermates. Glycerol utilization by isolated fat cells was similar; however, adipose tissue glycerokinase was elevated in obese rats at 14 wk of age. It was concluded that there was no apparent change in specific lipogenic capacity of fat cells from the obese rat when compared to its lean littermate. It was also concluded that increased adipose glycerokinase activity in obese rats represented a secondary shift in metabolism.
