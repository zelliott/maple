This study investigated the effect of a herbal anticellulite pill on visible cellulite in the thighs. Sixty female volunteers took a herbal anticellulite pill or a herbal anticellulite pill plus supplements of conjugated linoleic acid for 60 days. The combination treatment had a beneficial effect in as many as 75% of the women. The appearance of the skin improved significantly, and thigh circumference was reduced by an average of 0.88 inch. Further investigation in a larger, longer placebo-controlled trial is warranted.
