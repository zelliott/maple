Insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) has the potential to explain a large group of common metabolic and cardiovascular disorders [e.g., obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, hypercoagulability] which are all in themselves cardiovascular risk factors. This contribution firstly reviews the convincing evidence from glucose-clamp studies that all of these conditions are characterised by the presence of combined insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, and secondly examines the relationships of the components of this syndrome to coronary artery disease and to the rational choice of antihypertensive therapy.
