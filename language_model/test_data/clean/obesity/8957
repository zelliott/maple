We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study to evaluate the possible involvement of adiponectin and resistin in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Seventy-six PCOS patients and 40 non-hyperandrogenic women matched for BMI and degree of obesity were included. Serum adiponectin and resistin levels, anthropometrical and hormonal variables, the 45 T-&>G and 276 G-&>T polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene, and the -420 C-&>G variant in the resistin gene, were analysed.

Serum adiponectin concentrations were reduced in PCOS patients compared with controls (P = 0.038) irrespective of the degree of obesity, whereas serum resistin levels were increased in overweight and obese women compared with lean subjects (P = 0.016), irrespective of their PCOS or controls status. The adiponectin and resistin polymorphisms were not associated with PCOS and did not influence serum levels of adiponectin, resistin and other clinical and hormonal variables. In a multiple regression model, the waist-to-hip ratio, free testosterone levels and age, but not insulin resistance, were the major determinants of hypoadiponectinaemia.

PCOS patients present with hypoadiponectinaemia, in relation with abdominal adiposity and hyperandrogenism. Our present results suggest that hyperandrogenism and abdominal obesity, by reducing the serum levels of the insulin sensitizer adipokine adiponectin, might contribute to the insulin resistance of PCOS.
