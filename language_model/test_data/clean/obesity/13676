Resistin is thought to be involved in the development of obesity and insulin resistance. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding resistin could contribute to this link, but different studies have yielded contradictory results. In this study, we investigated whether polymorphisms in resistin are involved in the development of obesity in a Belgian female population. We selected three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs1862513, rs3745367, and rs3745369) and compared their genotype and allele frequencies between female obese patients (N = 541) and control individuals (N = 235). This analysis showed association with neither obesity for any of the variants nor with the haplotypes of these SNPs. Furthermore, we also investigated whether these variants have an influence on BMI. After Kruskal-Wallis analysis, we found that there was no difference in BMI between the genotypes for all variants. Together, these results suggest that these variants in resistin are not associated with obesity in the female population.
