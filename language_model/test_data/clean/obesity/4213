An assessment of the risk or diagnosis of diabetes in a random sample of 386 adult border residents found 46% obese, 12% at risk for diabetes, and 18% diagnosed with diabetes. While obesity was associated with greater diabetes risk,&> 50% of obese adults reported not being told of their diabetes risk. Independent of other characteristics, boomers were at increased risk (OR 3.88) for diabetes. Comorbidities increased the risk for actual diabetes diagnosis (OR 4.79). Skipping medications increased risk of developing diabetes (OR 2.98). Disadvantaged obese boomers are at particular risk, warranting culturally appropriate interventions before onset of chronic illnesses.
