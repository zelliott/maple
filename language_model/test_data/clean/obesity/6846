Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) associate with increased oxidative stress. Malondialdehyde acetaldehyde (MAA) adducts have been suggested to be one of the antigenic epitopes in MDA-LDL responsible for the antibody recognition. Our aim was to investigate the associations between plasma IgA antibodies to MAA-LDL, inflammatory markers, adipokines, obesity, and T2D.

IgA to MAA-LDL were measured in a subsample (n = 1507) of the Finnish Health 2000 survey. The associations between antibody levels, obesity, TNF-α, IL-6, high-sensitivity (hs) CRP, resistin, adiponectin, fasting plasma (fp) glucose, fp-insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb-A1C), and T2D were investigated.

IgA to MAA-LDL associated positively with fasting plasma insulin. IgA to MAA-LDL were higher among subjects with T2D (P &<0.001) compared to subjects with normal glucose metabolism. IgA to MAA-LDL associated with obesity, but was not independently (P = 0.002, not significant after correction for multiple tests) associated with T2D in logistic regression analysis. IgA to MAA-LDL, obesity, and TNF-α all associated with markers of glucose metabolism.

T2D subjects had increased IgA to MAA-LDL compared to subjects with normal glucose metabolism. The data suggest that the associations between IgA to MAA-LDL and markers of glucose metabolism were independent of TNF-α but dependent on components of the metabolic syndrome.
