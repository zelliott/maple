Male Osborne-Mendel (OM) and S 5B/P1 rats were overfed from birth to 24 or 105 days. The effects of feeding a diet with 44 per cent or 3 per cent (w/w) fat, supplementary feeding during the suckling period, and reduced litter size, on body weight and on the weight and cellularity of the heart, liver and kidneys were evaluated. Three overfeeding techniques were used: (1) feeding a high fat diet, (2) reducing litter size, (3) force-feeding from 1-24 days. The overfeeding technique which exerted the greatest effect on growth was feeding a high-fat diet. In comparison to OM rats that suckled dams fed the low-fat diet, body weight as well as organ weight, DNA, protein and lipid were significantly elevated in 24-day-old OM rats that suckled dams fed the high-fat diet. In comparison to OM rats not overfed, the organs of the rats fed the high-fat diet contained significantly more cells at both 24 and 105 days, except for the heart which by 105 days contained more protein, but not DNA. Liver weight and growth in S 5B/P1 rats was similar, regardless of dietary manipulation. Compared to S 5B/P1 rats that suckled dams fed the low-fat-diet, kidneys were 12 per cent larger at 24 days and 19 per cent larger at 105 days in rats that suckled dams fed the high-fat diet and were thereafter fed a high-fat diet. Hearts of the latter rats were larger than the former rats at 24 days, but not at 105 days.
