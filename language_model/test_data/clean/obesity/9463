Childhood obesity is increasing throughout the world and increases in adipose tissue are related to insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases and metablic syndrome. Adipose tissue is not simply a storage depot for surplus energy but rather, is an active organ that modulates various biological functions and synthesizes and secretes multiple cytokines into the circulation. Adiponectin and visfatin are two cytokines which are considered to be possible links between obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. In turn, concentrations of adiponectin and visfatin are mainly influenced by the overall body fat mass which is one of the main determinants of insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, physical activity and exercise are negatively related to body fat mass and also have an influence on cytokine concentrations in the blood. It is of particular interest whether physical activity or lifestyle interventions have a positive effect on adiponectin and visfatin concentrations in the blood. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the contribution of vistafin and adiponectin to various metabolic parameters and their relationship with different physical activity patterns in children and adolescents.
