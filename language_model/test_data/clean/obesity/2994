In countries with unrestricted access to food, obesity is common and is associated with enhanced mortality. Morbidity is difficult to assess, but must be a cause for much concern. The mechanisms concerened in the development of obesity have been studied intensively, but any single factor which might distinguish the obese from the lean remains elusive. The management of obesity must be based on altering the eating habits of the patient, and this, in turn is still an exercise in persuasion rather than a pharmacological operation.
