Review of the literature that formed the basis for drafting the guideline on the sub-uretral sling in the first-line surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence. Medline database query since the introduction of TVT on the questions of various chapters and sub-chapters of the present article. The use of tapes made of polypropylene monofilament exclusively, knitted, is recommended to the exclusion of any other material. Regarding the choice of procedure, the objective cure rate of transobturator and retro-pubic routes cannot be evaluated clearly because of vague evaluation criteria from one study to another. Without adequate clinical trials proving their efficacy and safety, the mini-bands can so far be recommended to treat female stress urinary incontinence. Moderate overweight does not affect the results of laying tape. In patients with severe obesity, surgery to correct obesity is even better than surgery for incontinence. Age is not a contra-indication. If the patient is young and nulliparous, it is reasonable to advise her to postpone surgery after her last pregnancy. In case of multiparous patient, the risk of vaginal delivery does not seem sufficient to suggest a cesarean section. To conclude, sub-urethral slings are the first-line surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence.
