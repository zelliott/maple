Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of premature mortality of women and men in Slovak republic.

The occurrence and mean values of major CVD risk factors were assessed in a population of 2480 Bratislava citizens (2/3 of them were women) interested in health promotion and primary CVD prevention activities in Community Health Promotion Center.

Major CVD risk factors were assessed, using standard methods, and criteria, in accordance with the guidelines of European and national medical societies.

The greatest proportion of visitors, both women and men, were in their forties. 73% of all women and 70% of all men were aged 30-59 yrs. The most frequent risk factors, were overweight and obesity, present in 64% of men and 59% of women. Of them, central type obesity was found in 30% of men, 15% of women. In 52% of men and 32% of women elevated casual blood pressure was assessed at the first visit. Of the total, in 27% of men and 21% of women, the BP elevation was within the range of borderline hypertension. In 25% of men and 11% women the BP values were within the mild to severe hypertension range. Elevated blood cholesterol was assessed in 53% of men and 54% of women, lowered HDL cholesterol in 55% of men and 43% of women. Elevated TC/HDL-C ratio was found in 60% of men and in 35% of women. Triglyceride level elevation was assessed in 24% of men and in 17% of women, with TGL/HDL-C ratio raised in 66% of these men and in 40% of these women.

In assessment of CVD risk factors clustering, our results are different from the results of CINDI SR screening from 1992. In our study, only 13% persons were free of any CVD risk factors. One risk factor was found in 21.1%, two of them in 29.9%, three in 29.8% and four in 6.2% of the population screened. Evaluation of the effect of complex individual intervention in our center will be the subject of our next study. (Fig. 5, Tab. 5, Ref. 11.)
