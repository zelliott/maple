We studied the coefficients of correlation between weight and height and four adiposity indices (weight/height 0,5; weight/height; weight/height2; weight/height3), year to year, in 1676 schoolchildren of both sexes (663 boys and 1,013 girls), aged between 3 and 17 years. Weight-for-height index should be uncorrelated with height and highly correlated with weight. In our study, Quetelet index (w/h2) in females and Rohrer index (w/h3) in males, are independent from height. Between two indices, Quetelet index had better correlations with weight.
