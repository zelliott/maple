The pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral propranolol have been compared in six obese and six normal subjects matched for age and sex. After intravenous administration there was no difference in plasma clearance but the volume of distribution was greater (V = 339 l vs 198 l) and the half-life was longer (t1/2 = 5.0 h vs 3.0 h) in the obese group. No important difference in the rate of oral absorption was observed. A trend towards higher systemic availability in the obese group (35% vs 27%) was not statistically significant.
