Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) is a syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure (IIP) without focal signs of neurological dysfunction. The diagnosis is essentially made by exclusion of various causes of IIP. The classic presenting symptoms of BIH are headache and/or visual disturbances. Otologic manifestations of this syndrome have not been described in detail. In this thesis, 20 BIH patients with associated otologic symptoms were thoroughly studied over a 5-year period. The author concludes that 1. objective pulsatile tinnitus and low frequency hearing loss can be the major or only manifestation of this syndrome; 2. diagnosis is established by lumbar puncture and elimination of other causes of IIP; 3. medical management is very effective with surgery reserved for patients with deteriorating vision or with disabling tinnitus.
