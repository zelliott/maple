We debunk three likely misperceptions about childhood obesity: (1) the epidemic thereof is caused by poverty, (2) information campaigns alone would be effective at reducing childhood obesity rates, and (3) obesity-reducing interventions would necessarily save money. We then discuss policies that could be effective at reducing childhood obesity rates and propose a tax/subsidy strategy that would provide the right incentives for governments, schools, and households to make appropriate investments in obesity prevention efforts.
