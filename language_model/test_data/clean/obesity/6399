To evaluate the efficiency of 6-month therapy with xenical (gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor) in combination with diet in patients with stable angina pectoris associated with obesity and hyperlipemia.

An open comparative randomized study of the efficiency of xenical in combination with diet was carried out in patients with stable angina pectoris concomitant with obesity and hyperlipemia. Thirty coronary patients aged 45-65 years with stable angina of effort (functional class I-II) with body weight index 28.1-45.6 kg/m2 (mean 33.5 kg/m2) were examined. All patients presented with dyslipemia (low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol more than 4.14 mmol/liter, triglycerides (TG) more than 2.2 mmol/liter). Controls (n = 15) were treated with diets alone for 6 months. In the main group diets were supplemented by xenical in a dose of 360 mg/day.

Body weight index decreased in both groups (by 9.9% in the main group and by 4.2% in the control). Body weight stabilization during 6 months of treatment and the fact that it was slow and gradual were essential. In patients treated with xenical total cholesterol level decreased by 10.9% and of LDL cholesterol by 12.2% after 6 months (p &<0.05). Changes in the levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and TG were insignificant. The drug did not affect the incidence of angina attacks and improved exercise tolerance after 6-month therapy. Blood biochemistry (transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, and creatinine) changed negligibly. No side effects were observed; all patients received a complete 6-month course.

The results confirm that xenical (orlistat) can be used for long therapy of patients with stable angina of effort concomitant with obesity and hyperlipemia.
