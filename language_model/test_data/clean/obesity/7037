To test the hypothesis that short stature is associated with abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and lipid profile changes.

Anthropometric data were collected from 237 women (18-60 years old), residents of a shantytown in Macei√≥. Biochemical profiles of 60 individuals drawn from this population were determined.

Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and insulin resistance rose with increasing waist : hip circumference ratio, particularly in women. Short, overweight individuals exhibited larger biochemical alterations than overweight individuals of average stature.

Short stature, when associated with overweight, is a risk factor for increased insulin resistance and alterations in lipid profile.
