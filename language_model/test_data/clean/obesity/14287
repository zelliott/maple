The vascular protective effects of estrogens are mediated by their binding to the two known estrogen receptors. In this study, we examine the association of stroke with two common polymorphisms of the ESR1 gene in patients with metabolic syndrome.

DNA from 130 patients hospitalized for ischemic stroke and 240 healthy controls were genotyped for ESR1 PvuII and XbaI polymorphisms. Results - Comparing female and male patients, it was found that CCGG diplotype is more frequent in male patients (P = 0.03). In addition, the AA genotype is associated with the onset of stroke at a younger age in the male patient group (P &<0.05).

These findings suggest that PvuII and XbaI polymorphisms may affect the age at onset of the first stroke and the probability of developing cerebrovascular disease.
