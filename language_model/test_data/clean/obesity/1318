Central obesity in association with insulin resistance is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD) in South Asians; however the prevalence of central obesity and insulin resistance in Indians are unknown. Anthropometric measurements, dietary intakes, physical activity and prevalence of risk factors and CAD were obtained in 152 adults between 26-65 years of age (80 males, 72 females) selected by random sampling from urban population of Moradabad. The overall prevalence of central obesity was 539 per 1000 adults including 56.2% in males and 51.3% in females. The prevalence of glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and CAD were significantly higher in the higher quintiles of WHR above 0.88 compared to lower quintiles. Fasting and postprandial glucose, plasma insulin and triglycerides as well s total cholesterol and blood pressure were significantly higher in each of the upper quintile of WHR with increase in WHR compared to lowest quintile of WHR below 0.81. These findings indicate the existence of a modest degree of insulin resistance with a modest tendency to central obesity in the urban population of North India. The prevalence of CAD was significantly (p &<0.01) higher among subjects with central obesity than in non-obese subjects (21.5 vs 3.2%). Underlying these findings, the prevalence of central obesity was significantly greater among sedentary and mild activity group compared to moderate and heavy activity group and per day energy expenditure during activity in the upper quintiles with WHR&> 0.88 was significantly less compared to energy expenditure in lower quintiles of WHR. Similarly dietary fat intake in the upper quintiles of WHR was also significantly higher than in the lower quintiles of WHR. These findings suggest that populations with higher prevalence of central obesity and CAD may be benefited with an aim to decrease central obesity.
