Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of pharmacological and lifestyle compliance among hypertensive patients. Patients attending health insurance clinics for prescription refills were randomly selected and interviewed (n = 316). Blood pressure was controlled for 53.2% of patients but 25.9% were non-compliant with medication. Common barriers to compliance were: feelings of normal blood pressure, forgetfulness, drug holidays and drug side-effects. Patients were non-compliant with smoking cessation (43.6%), weight reduction (59.3%), and dietary salt (22.4%) and fat restriction (26.5%). Misconceptions about smoking cessation and costs of preparing special dishes were common. Independent predictors of compliance were: controlled blood pressure, diet modification, drug side-effects, and perceptions of management benefits and susceptibility to related complications.
