Various epidemiological evidences have shown the increased incidence of hyperuricemia in the subjects with hyperlipidemia and/or obesity. Our clinical study indicated the association was more close in hypertriglyceridemia to hyperuricemia than in hypercholesterolemia. Serum uric acid level increased more in Type IIb with elevated lipoprotein lipase (LPL) than those with low or normal LPL. Elevated LPL may be involved in the retarded uric acid clearance due to increased free fatty acids (FFA) in the serum, resulting in the elevation of uric acid and may be linked to the obesity-insulin resistance syndrome. Increased FFA may play an important role on the association of hyperuricemia with hypertriglyceridemia.
