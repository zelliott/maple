Glutathione transferase Kappa (GSTK1-1) also termed disulfide bond-forming oxidoreductase A-like protein (DsbA-L) has been implicated in the post-translational multimerization of adiponectin and has been negatively correlated with obesity in mice and humans. We investigated adiponectin in Gstk1(-/-) mice and surprisingly found no difference in the levels of total serum adiponectin or the level of high molecular weight (HMW) multimers when compared with normal controls. Non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting also showed a similar distribution of low, middle and HMW multimers in normal and Gstk1(-/-) mice. Variation in adiponectin has been correlated with glucose tolerance and with the levels of phosphorylated AMP-kinase but we found similar glucose tolerance and similar levels of phospho 5-AMP-activated protein kinase in normal and Gstk1(-/-) mice. Consequently, our findings suggest that GSTK1-1 is not absolutely required for adiponectin multimerization in vivo and alternate pathways may be activated in GSTK1-1 deficiency.
