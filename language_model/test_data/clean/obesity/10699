A review of the literature on the health hazards of obesity and weight control in children indicates: 1) methodological flaws tend to invalidate the assumption that obesity is a risk factor for this age group; 2) weight control by children and adolescents may cause a variety of health problems including retardation of growth, development, mental functioning, and reproductive capacity; and 3) preoccupation with weight control in this society makes it likely that weight control-related-health problems are common phenomena. Further research into the short and long-term consequences of obesity and weight control is necessary before enlightened clinical practice in this area is possible.
