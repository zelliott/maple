In the late 1960's, preventive health care began to gain in popularity in the United States and the movement carried over into the 1970's. During this time, sizable decreases in deaths from heart disease, strokes, and accidents have been noted. As a result, the lowest death rate in the history of this country (8.9 per 1000) occurred in both 1975 and 1976. Since 1970, an increase in longevity has been documented and it can be said that Americans are living longer--not just longer but hopefully better! People are beginning to learn that "it is not so much that we die, we kill ourselves!" With proper weight, diet, and exercise, avoiding tobacco, early detection and treatment of high blood pressure, use of seat belts, and control of stimulants and drugs, thousands of lives are being saved annually. In today's busy and demanding society, success in any field requires more than just education and hard work. It requires good health, both mental and physical. Pursue these goals vigorously and remember, "It is always cheaper and much easier to maintain good health than it is to regain it once it is lost!"
