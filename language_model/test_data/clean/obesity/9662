Ovariectomy leads to significant increase in body weight, but the possible peripheral mechanisms involved in weight gain are still unknown. Since exercise and thyroid hormones modulate energy balance, we aimed to study the effect of swimming training on body weight gain and brown adipose tissue (BAT) type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase responses in ovariectomized (Ox) or sham-operated (Sh) rats. Rats were submitted to a period of 8-week training, 5 days per week with progressive higher duration of exercise protocol. Swimming training program did not totally prevent the higher body mass gain that follows ovariectomy in rats (16.5% decrease in body mass gain in Ox trained rats compared to 22% decrease in sham operated trained animals, in relation to the respective sedentary groups), but training of Ox animals impaired the accumulation of subcutaneous fat pads. Interestingly, swimming training upregulates pituitary type 1 (p&<.001 vs. all groups) and BAT type 2 iodothyronine deiodinases (p&<.05 vs. ShS and OxS) in sham operated but not in Ox rats, indicating an impaired pituitary and peripheral response to exercise in Ox rats. However, BAT mitochondrial O2 consumption significantly increased by swimming training in both sham and Ox groups, indicating that Ox BAT mitochondria responds normally to exercise stimulus, but does not result in a significant reduction of body weight. In conclusion, increased body mass gain produced by Ox is not completely impaired by 8 weeks of high intensity physical training, showing that these animals sustain higher rate of body mass gain independent of being submitted to higher energy expenditure.
