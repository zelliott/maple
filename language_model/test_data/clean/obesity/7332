N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) is an established biomarker for heart failure in adults, while its plasma concentrations are altered in adult obesity. Plasma adiponectin concentrations are decreased in obesity and low levels are associated with disorders with an increased cardiometabolic risk. A few studies support an association between these two markers in adults with coronary heart disease. Such relations have not been investigated in children with obesity, which is the most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Ninety-six children, 24 obese/25 normal BMI boys, and 23 obese/24 normal BMI girls, aged 10-16, were studied. Plasma NT-proBNP was measured using electrochemiluminescence, and adiponectin and other metabolic risk factors, such as glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), HDL, and LDL using standard methodology. The findings were gender dimorphic. In overweight and obese females (mean BMI z-score: 2.65+/-1.69), plasma NT-proBNP concentrations correlated significantly with adiponectin levels (r=0.4, r(2)=0.05, p=0.013), while in those with obesity defined as BMI z-score&>2.5 (mean BMI z-score: 3.67+/-1.08, n=20) this association was stronger (r=0.6, r(2)=0.22, p=0.005). Adiponectin also correlated significantly with BMI z-scores, TG, HDL, and insulin levels. In boys, there was no correlation between NT-proBNP and adiponectin. NT-proBNP correlated significantly with HDL, while adiponectin correlated with TG, fasting insulin, and the Homeostasis Assessment Model (HOMA) Index. The positive association between NT-proBNP and adiponectin depends on the severity of obesity and is gender dimorphic. This positive correlation in females might be a potential protective mechanism against atherosclerosis in later life.
