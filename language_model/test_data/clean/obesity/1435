Factors that may be associated with successful weight loss in the obese are of clinical and theoretical significance. Although perceived behavioral control (PBC) had been shown to predict weight loss in a nonclinical population, it had not been used to predict weight loss in the obese. We studied obese women enrolled in a 15-week structured weight loss program and hypothesized that PBC would predict weight loss for low binge eaters better than for high binge eaters. Results indicated that the ability of PBC to predict weight loss immediately posttreatment and 6 months posttreatment depended on binge eating severity, whereas prediction of group attendance was independent of binge eating status.
