An activity that enhances insulin release from perifused rat pancreatic islets has recently been isolated from human serum fractions (molecular weight 1,000-5,000 daltons). To characterize this activity we have studied the insulin-releasing effect of serum subfractions from obese and non-obese children obtained by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The serum insulin-releasing activity eluted in the HPLC system at 12-13 minutes, which corresponded to the retention time of the tridecapeptide insulin-glucagon liberin isolated from bovine hypothalamus. Insulin-releasing activity was found in serum subfractions from both obese and normal-weight children. The relative insulin-releasing potency of the active subfractions was higher than that of the original total serum fractions, indicating the presence of some substance(s) which inhibit insulin secretion in the total serum fractions. Oral glucose loading increased the relative insulin-releasing activity in the HPLC subfractions from obese children. This study suggests that the insulin secretagogue in human serum might be identical to hypothalamic insulin-glucagon liberin as these substances behave similarly on reversed-phase HPLC and have parallel insulin-releasing properties.
