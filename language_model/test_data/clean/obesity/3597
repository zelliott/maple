Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived plasma protein with cardio-vasculo-protective and anti-diabetic properties. Plasma adiponectin levels are low in patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome (a cluster of multiple risk factors based on visceral fat accumulation). Routine measurement of plasma adiponectin may be useful to encourage life-style changes.
