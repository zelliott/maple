Polymorphisms in the beta-2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene have been studied in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity, risk factors that have received increased attention in relation to breast cancer. We evaluated the hypothesis that ADRB2 variants (rs1042713, rs1042714) are associated with breast cancer risk in non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Hispanic (H) women using data from a population-based case-control study conducted in the southwestern United States.

Data on lifestyle and medical history, and blood samples, were collected during in-person interviews for incident primary breast cancer cases (1,244 NHW, 606 H) and controls (1,330 NHW, 728 H). ADRB2 genotypes for rs1042713(G/A) and rs1042714(G/C) were determined using TaqMan assays. The associations of each variant and corresponding haplotypes with breast cancer were estimated using multivariable logistic regression.

Two copies compared to one or zero copies of the ADRB2 G-G haplotype were associated with increased breast cancer risk for NHW women [odds ratio (OR), 1.95; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 1.26-3.01], but with reduced risk for H women [OR, 0.74; 95 % CI, 0.50-1.09]. Effect estimates were strengthened for women with a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m(2) [H: OR, 0.50; 95 % CI, 0.31-0.82; NHW: OR, 3.85; 95 % CI, 1.88-7.88] and for H women with a history of diabetes [H: OR, 0.32; 95 % CI, 0.12-0.89].

These data suggest that ethnicity modifies the association between the ADRB2                            G-G haplotype and breast cancer risk, and being overweight or obese enhances the divergence of risk between H and NHW women.
