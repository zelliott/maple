The authors evaluated the history of treatment in a population of patients awaiting gastric bypass surgery.

A standard questionnaire was used to evaluate the history of different therapeutic methods for weight loss in 312 patients between 13 and 70 years of age: 247 (79.2%) women and 66 (20.8%) men.

BMI varied between 33.0 to 100.0 kg/m2. The most common therapeutic method for losing weight was the use of formulae containing amphetamines, n=270 (86.5%). Only a tendency could be found towards a difference between women and men regarding amphetamine utilization respectively: 218 (88.3%) vs 52 (80.0%); P=0.066. Patients used formulae for the first time at an average age of 22.5+/-8.0 years old (from 8 to 57 years old). 43.7% (n=118) of the patients who used amphetamines have never received any information about the drug, and 80.6% (n=216) regret using this option. Dry mouth was the most common side-effect reported, n=205 (81%). Women had more frequent reports of depression and tremors than men, 58.6% vs 40.0% (P=0.017) and 44% vs 25% (P=0.011) respectively.

Amphetamines were used on a large scale in this population and a high level of side-effects were observed. Women used them more frequently than men, and noted a higher level of side-effects.
