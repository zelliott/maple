Creatinine-adjusted levels of estrone, estradiol, and estriol were determined in luteal phase urine specimens of 200 premenopausal women from rural areas of Greece. The relation of each estrogen to height, weight, obesity index, and serum cholesterol was studied by multiple regression, controlling for age, age at menarche, and ovulation status (ovulation, anovulation, undetermined). No consistent relation between any of the somatometric variables and any of the urine estrogens emerged from the statistical analysis, but among older women (30-40 years old) both estrone and estradiol were positively associated with serum cholesterol (p less than 0.05). The data provide no support for the hypothesis that the relationship between body weight and breast cancer risk is mediated through an influence of body weight on estrogen levels--at least in premenopausal women. On the other hand the data on serum cholesterol levels are consonant with the idea that qualitative aspects of nutrition may affect breast cancer risk among older (e.g., postmenopausal) women.
