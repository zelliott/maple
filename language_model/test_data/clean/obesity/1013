Effect of nicotine on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression in various hypothalamic regions was investigated in rats via nicotineamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the fed group, the fed and nicotine-treated group, the food-deprived group, and the food-deprived and nicotine-treated group. The fed groups received abundant food and water, while food was withheld from the food-deprived groups for 48 h. The nicotine-treated groups were injected with nicotine. Following food deprivation, enhanced NAPDH-d expression was detected in the paraventricular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, and lateral hypothalamic area of the hypothalamus. Nicotine administration to the food-deprived rats resulted in decreased NADPH-d positivity. The present results indicate that nicotine administration is effective in limiting the enhancement in NOS expression following food restriction.
