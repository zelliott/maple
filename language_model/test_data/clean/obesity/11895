Obesity is a risk factor for the development of esophageal malignancy. We report a case of the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma after placement of an adjustable gastric band for obesity. A 66-year-old male was referred to our clinic for findings of an obstructing mass at the gastroesophageal junction after previously undergoing a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band placement. Investigations confirmed a locally advanced poorly differentiated esophageal adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent chemotherapy and gastric band removal with improvement of his dysphagia. However, his disease progressed and he died of metastatic disease. We discuss the diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma after gastric banding procedure.
