Obesity is a symptom of impaired fat metabolism, organs and system of which are: the liver where fat synthesis and oxidation occur and the adipose tissue with a storage function. Obesity in NIDDM, insulism and suprarenalism is due to an increased synthesis in triglycerides and their deposit in fat cells. Aetiologic factors of primitive obesity act on the fat tissue promoting lipogenesis (hypertrophic or hyperplastic action) and/or reducing fat release.

Thirty-two women suffering from obesity but without cardiovascular pathologies were investigated. Obesity degree and type were defined by the anthropometric method. The following tests were carried out: glycemia, insulinemia, C-peptide in OGTT, tryglicerides, cholesterolemia and cortisolemia. Plasma viscosity (V) and whole blood V were determined with rotational microviscosimeter; erythrocyte V and plasma-erythrocyte V were performed with double filtering method and values expressed in cP. Deformability was calculated as a ratio between viscosities determined with both filtering methods.

On the basis of the type of obesity three groups were characterized: gynoid, intermediate and android. Rheological parameters are increased in all women: increase of plasmatic V, increase especially of erythrocytic viscosity with a considerable decrease in deformability. There are interesting differences among the three groups.

The relationship between obesity and cardiovascular disease is well known and the early rheological impairment could be the factor linking both pathologies. Some factors involved in obesity, such as hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, are also suspected of impairing hemorheology promoting changes in the microcirculation.
