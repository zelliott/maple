Obesity-related diseases, especially diabetes mellitus and hypertension, have huge impact on mortality in obese patients. The aim of the study was the assessment of relationship between postoperative weight loss and further management of concomitant, obesity related diseases (hypertension and diabetes). The group of 106 patients who underwent restrictive procedures for morbid obesity at our department was retrospectively analyzed. Data were collected on follow-up visits according to designed questionnaires. Nine of thirty-two diabetic patients (28.13%) did not require any treatment after surgery, while in fourteen cases (43.75%) previous dosages of insulin were modified (reduced). Nine diabetic patients (28.13%) required the same treatment as before. Bariatric surgery had significant impact on patients with arterial hypertension. Antihypertensive drugs dose was reduced in 43.9% of patients, whereas 31.5% became normotensive in postoperative course (statistically significant). None of the operations appeared to be superior to others in terms of diabetes mellitus and hypertension control in postoperative course. Improvement in concomitant diseases management was markedly better for patients with lower preoperative BMI. Restrictive operations had positive impact on concomitant obesity-related diseases and cured about 30% of patients with preoperative diagnosis of diabetes or arterial hypertension.
