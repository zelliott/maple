We controlled, after nine months, 29 obese children, who attended the primary school, and to whom it was advised a good balanced base diet of 1200 kcal. One child wasn't obese anymore, and in 13 cases there was a sensible reduction of overweight percentage. We consider these results positively, because our aim was to obtain a gradual resolution of the overweight, trying to avoid some very dangerous relapses for the young's future. Finally, we underline the necessity to begin some conferences about the young's and family's alimentary education, as soon as possible. These conferences have to be addressed to all the teachers, parents and pupils, from the primary school.
