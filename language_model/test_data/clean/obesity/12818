The research literature pertaining to behavior therapy for obesity is reviewed. Procedures used in behavioral treatment programs are described, and treatment outcome research is reviewed. During the past 30 years, average weight loss has increased, but the problem of regaining body weight following treatment has persisted. It was concluded that obesity should be treated as a chronic health problem and that behavior therapy may have an important role in assisting some obese persons to maintain weight loss if they are enrolled in very long-term treatment programs.
