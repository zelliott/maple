Sixty obese outpatients participated in a double-blind comparison of diethylpropion hydrochloride and placebo in conjunction with a behavior modification program for weight reduction. Assessments of efficacy and program acceptance included total weight loss, percent of initial (baseline) weight loss, percent excess weight lost, effectiveness of overall program, and helpfulness of medication. Diethylpropion was significantly better than placebo in all five assessments. An added behavioral technique, a substantial refundable deposit of money, reduced the attrition rate of all study entrants from 50% to 10%; thus patient compliance was greatly enhanced.
