To evaluate inappropriate gonadotropin secretion in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Retrospective study.

Academic tertiary center.

A total of 373 women were classified into three groups: [1] healthy control women (n = 48); [2] women who were positive for PCOS risk factor; and [3] women with PCOS (n = 251).

None.

Gonadotropin levels, LH-FSH ratio, body mass index, and clinical and/or biochemical presentations of PCOS.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, used to predict PCOS for the LH-FSH ratio, showed similar diagnostic performance to total T and average ovarian volume. The LH-FSH ratio exhibits greater observed accuracy than total T and average ovarian volume for evaluation of women with oligomenorrhea or anovulation. An LH-FSH ratio of&>1 presented the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. Body mass index was positively correlated with total T in non-PCOS and PCOS groups; however, body mass index was negatively correlated with LH in PCOS but showed no correlation in non-PCOS subjects.

The LH-FSH ratio is a valuable diagnostic tool in evaluating women with PCOS and oligomenorrhea or anovulation, and an LH-FSH ratio of&>1 may be used as a decision threshold. The link between body mass index and LH may provide clues for further understanding the pathological milieu of PCOS.
