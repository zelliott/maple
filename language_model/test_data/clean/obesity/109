Plasma levels of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were studied in a group of 22 normal and 22 obese subjects after an overnight fast. In a second group of 10 normal and 13 obese adults, PP secretion was stimulated by a protein-rich meal. The results indicate lower fasting PP values in the obese subjects and a decreased response during the second phase of the meal-induced secretion. This could suggest a possible role of PP in obesity.
