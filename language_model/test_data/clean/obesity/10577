The prevalence of 15 common obesity-related chronic health conditions was examined in a convenience sample of adolescents, ages 12-18 years old, with mobility and non-mobility limitations (n = 208 and 435, respectively). In both groups, overweight adolescents (BMI â‰¥ 85th %ile) had a significantly higher number of obesity-related chronic health conditions than their counterparts with healthy weight status (2.74 versus 1.74 for the mobility limitation group, and 1.79 versus 1.45 for the non-mobility limitation group). Prevalence of high blood cholesterol was significantly higher among overweight adolescents than healthy weight adolescents across the two groups. While prevalence of asthma and early maturation appeared to increase as a function of body weight for both groups, a significant difference was found only in the group with non-mobility limitations. Across the two groups, there was a clear tendency toward a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions in overweight adolescents compared to their healthy weight counterparts. Greater efforts must be made to address the higher rates of obesity-related health conditions in youth with disabilities during childhood and adolescence to avoid significant health consequences and health care costs in adulthood.
