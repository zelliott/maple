The effect of semipurified diets containing either casein or soy protein on serum lipids, lipoprotein composition and liver cholesterol was studied in genetically obese Zucker rats. The ingestion of a cholesterol-enriched semipurified diet containing casein resulted in elevated levels of serum cholesterol and phospholipids compared to the feeding of a soy protein diet. No differences in serum triglycerides were observed. Differences in serum cholesterol and phospholipids were mainly reflected in the very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins and to a minor extent in the high density lipoproteins. Liver cholesterol paralleled the levels of cholesterol in the serum, the rats fed casein exhibited markedly higher levels of liver cholesterol than those fed soy protein. Furthermore, the rats fed casein also had enlarged livers. Thus, this study clearly shows the differential cholesterolemic effect of dietary casein and soy protein in genetically obese Zucker rats.
