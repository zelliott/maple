We examined the galanin-like peptide (GALP) gene expression in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and posterior pituitary (PP) in 6- and 18-week-old male obese fa/fa rats. GALP mRNA in the ARC in fa/fa rats was significantly decreased in 6- and 18-week-old and GALP mRNA in the PP in fa/fa rats was significantly increased in 18-week-old compared to lean Fa/? rats. Insulin treatment in hyperglycemic fa/fa rats partially reversed those changes. These results suggest that the GALP gene expression in fa/fa rats might be regulated in part by leptin-independent mechanisms.
