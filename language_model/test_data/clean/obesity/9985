Metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemias, hyperuricemia, and hypervitaminosis A have often been mentioned in association with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). Production of bone under the influence of insulin or retinol has been suggested as a possible mechanism for this disease. We prospectively studied metabolic disorders in 25 patients with DISH and 25 controls matched for age, sex, and body mass index. Correlations between simultaneously evaluated parameters were looked for. Obesity was prevalent in both groups. Serum levels of glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, retinol, and retinol binding protein were similar in the two groups. A positive correlation was found between body mass index and serum insulin. We found no correlation between serum levels of insulin and retinol. None of the metabolic parameters studied showed alterations likely to explain the development of hyperostosis. Other growth factors such as retinoic acid or insulin-like growth factor 1, perhaps produced on a paracrine basis, may be the cause of increased bone at enthesis production.
