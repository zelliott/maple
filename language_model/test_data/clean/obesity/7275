Orlistat first became available (as 120 mg capsules [Xenical]) around 10 years ago as a prescription-only treatment for obesity. Earlier this year, orlistat 60 mg capsules (alli - GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare) became available for sale without a prescription to the public in the European Union. Orlistat 60 mg is available in the UK as a Pharmacy (P) medicine and so can be purchased over-the-counter (OTC) from pharmacies. OTC orlistat is promoted as a new weight loss aid, "boosting weight loss by 50%" when added to a reduced calorie, lower-fat diet. Here we review the place of OTC orlistat in tackling obesity.
