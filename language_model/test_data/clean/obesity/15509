Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance as well as impaired insulin secretion. Thus, the enhancement of insulin sensitivity is a possible treatment modality. The mechanism of insulin resistance is still unknown. However, some genetic backgrounds may be involved and modulated by environmental factors. Obesity is considered to be one of major factors to induce insulin resistance. Regarding mechanism of obesity-induced insulin resistance, the increased expression of Tumor necrosis factor alpha and abnormality in PTPase are postulated. Prolonged hyperglycemia also induces the impairment of insulin action, resulting in worsening glycemic control. Abnormal glucosamine biosynthesis and impaired receptor kinase are considered to be involved in the hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance.
