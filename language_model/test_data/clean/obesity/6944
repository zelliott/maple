Basal plasma gastrin levels were significantly higher in obese rats induced by ventromedial hypothalamic lesions (VMH rats) than in sham-operated controls. Gastrin secretion in response to insulin hypoglycemia and a liquid diet load was higher in VMH rats than in controls. The antral gastrin concentration was also elevated in VMH rats. Pair-fed rats with VMH lesions showed increased gastrin secretion as did the non-pair-fed group. These results show that gastrointestinal hormone secretions as well as pancreatic endocrine function are abnormal in obese rats with VMH lesions. Increased gastrin secretion is probably induced by factors other then hyperphagia, such as disturbance of the autonomic nervous system due to the VMH lesions.
