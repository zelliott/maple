An understanding of the mechanisms that regulate energy homeostasis is essential for understanding novel obesity therapies. The status of energy reserves is communicated to the brain by adiposity and satiety signals. These signals modify either anabolic or catabolic pathways and, consequently, alter food intake in line with signaled energy requirements. New antiobesity therapies are in development that target anabolic or catabolic regulatory networks to reduce food intake and/or increase energy expenditure to promote weight loss.
