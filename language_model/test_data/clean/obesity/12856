A highly conserved protein called 'leptin' was recently discovered to play a role in regulation of the energy balance in humans and rodents. This 167-amino-acid-containing protein is only produced and secreted by mature adipocytes. Absence of the protein in mutant ob/ob mice and resistance to its effects in db/db mice lead to extreme obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. No mutation of the ob-gene encoding for leptin has been found in obese humans so far. ob mRNA in adipocytes and serum leptin levels are positively related to adipose tissue mass. Receptors for leptin have been found in the choroid plexus and hypothalamus. A feedback inhibition of leptin on hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NY) production is postulated, as hypothalamic NY concentrations are increased in ob/ob mice and NY induces food intake, insulin secretion and autonomic nervous system activity. Insulin increases triglyceride stores in fat cells and could thereby stimulate leptin secretion. The ultimate intracellular pathway within the adipocyte that stimulates or shuts off ob mRNA expression and consequent leptin production and secretion remains to be elucidated. Whether leptin will ever come to play a role in the treatment of human obesity remains an unanswered question at the present time.
