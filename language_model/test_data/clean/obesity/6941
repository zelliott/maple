The diurnal profiles of pancreatic glucagon, insulin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and enteroglucagon were studied in five obese non-diabetic subjects (195 +/- 11 per cent of ideal body weight) and in six age matched controls. All the subjects were served with ordinary mixed meals five times during the day. The obese subjects were normoglycemic but hyperinsulinemic. Both groups showed rapid increases in PP to all meals, but the PP-response was significantly impaired in the obese group during the first part of the day. Normal subjects showed significant enteroglucagon responses to all meals, and had elevated levels throughout the day. In obese subjects, levels and responses were much lower at all times. Pancreatic glucagon profiles were similar. It is concluded that the possible role of abnormalities of PP and enteroglucagon secretion in the pathogenesis of human obesity deserves further study.
