The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central organelle for protein biosynthesis, folding, and traffic. Perturbations in ER homeostasis create a condition termed ER stress and lead to activation of the complex signaling cascade called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Recent studies have documented that the UPR coordinates multiple signaling pathways and controls various physiologies in cells and the whole organism. Furthermore, unresolved ER stress has been implicated in a variety of metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, intervening in ER stress and modulating signaling components of the UPR would provide promising therapeutics for the treatment of human metabolic diseases.
