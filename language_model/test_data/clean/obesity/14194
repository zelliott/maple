The aim of the present study was to describe a large cohort of fenfluramine-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (fen-PAH) and its possible prognostic markers. The records of all patients with a diagnosis of fen-PAH evaluated at the present authors' centre from 1986-2004 were retrospectively studied. Baseline clinical and haemodynamic data were collected, as well as survival times. The median duration of fenfluramine exposure was 6 months, with a median of 4.5 yrs between exposure and onset of symptoms. Nine (22.5%) out of 40 patients evaluated resulted positive for the presence of germline bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR) type 2 mutations. In these patients, the duration of exposure to fenfluramine was significantly lower than in patients without mutation. The median survival was 6.4 yrs, without significant difference between fen-PAH and a control group of idiopathic and familial pulmonary arterial hypertension patients referred to the present authors' centre during the same time frame and treated identically. Duration of fenfluramine exposure showed no relation to survival, while cardiac index was the only independent predictor of multivariate analysis. Fenfluramine-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension shares clinical, functional, haemodynamic and genetic features with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as overall survival rates. Therefore, the present authors conclude that fenfluramine exposure characterises a potent trigger for pulmonary arterial hypertension without influencing its clinical course.
