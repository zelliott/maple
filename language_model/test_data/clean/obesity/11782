The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of plasma leptin levels with respect to obesity, gender, age and insulin levels in the native Aymara population. The Aymara natives live at high altitudes in isolated regions in the north of Chile, and they maintain distinctive genetic and cultural characteristics. Plasma leptin and insulin levels were correlated with body mass index (BMI), sex and age in a sample of 147 adult Aymara subjects who participated in a cross-sectional study. Multivariate analysis showed significant differences in leptin levels (dependent variable: natural log of leptin) by gender (p &<0.0001), and by BMI (p &<0.001), without significant statistical interaction between gender and BMI. The effect of age achieved statistical significance in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.02). Gender, BMI and insulin are independently associated with plasma leptin levels. On the other hand, the multivariate analysis of the plasma insulin concentration (dependent variable: natural log of insulin levels) shows that insulin is strongly associated with BMI (p &<0.0001), although non-statistically significant differences of insulin levels by sex (p = 0.07) or age (p = 0.9) were detected at alpha 0.05 level. Thus, in the special ecosystem where the Aymara population live, a strong and independent association between sex, obesity and insulin levels with plasma leptin levels has been detected.
