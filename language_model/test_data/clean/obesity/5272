In an unselected collective of 100 employees of a big concern the knowledge with regard to body weight, nutrition and nicotine abuse was studied and the eating habits as well as the principles of education connected with them were ascertained. Nearly all questioned persons knew their body weight. Half of them were able to indicate their ideal weight with a precision of +/- 10%. The rate of the considerably overweight persons in the collective showed a dependence on higher age and female sex. Among the questionees with secondary education more normalweight persons were found. The test persons were well informed about the disadvantages of overweight and controlled their body weight in two thirds of the cases at least once a week. They stated to have met the term "diet" above all in the mass media. About half of them were able to define the term "calorie" approximately precisely. The questionees, however, often underestimated the required caloric quantity, apparently without drawing conclusions. The caloric content of alcoholic drinks was underestimated. Beer ranked first among the consumed alcoholic drinks. Only one fifth of the test persons "reward" their children with sweets and wish that they eat up their dinner. About half of the questionees were smokers. One fourth had never smoked, while another fourth had given up smoking. Mostly cigarettes were consumed, although nearly all test persons regarded inhaling smoking as harmful. The sole knowledge of factors that have a detrimental effect on the state of health (e.g. overweight, smoking) seems to be not sufficient to lead a healthy life. Since the test persons are, however, willing to do something for their health it would be useful to concentrate adipose persons and smokers into groups that should be treated by behaviour therapy and be positively motivated.
