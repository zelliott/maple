Adverse effects from medication vary with age. Weight gain with several psychotropics is well known in adults but less information is available related to extent and complications of psychotropic-induced weight gain in older psychiatric patients. We determined the relative incidence of 2 obesity-related conditions (diabetes and hypertension) in older psychiatric patients receiving antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers.

A population-based case-control study of all psychiatric patients aged 67 years or older in contact with either specialist services or primary care using administrative data from Nova Scotia.

We identified incident cases of diabetes (n = 608) and of hypertension (n = 1056), as well as an equal number of control subjects for each condition. Amitryptiline, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and olanzapine were associated with an increased risk of presenting with hypertension 6 months after initial prescription. By contrast, conventional antipsychotics were associated with a reduced incidence of hypertension. Olanzapine was also significantly associated with diabetes after 6 months (OR adj = 2.58, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.92). The findings for SSRIs and olanzapine remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders such as sociodemographic characteristics, schizophrenia, beta blockers, thiazide diuretics, and corticosteroids.

Our results suggest that the association of psychotropics and 2 obesity-related conditions, hypertension and diabetes, applies to older psychiatric patients as well as younger populations. Within drug classes, there are drugs that have a greater association than others, and this may be a factor when choosing a specific agent.
