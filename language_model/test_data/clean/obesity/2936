A 26-year-old woman who had been taking an oral contraceptive preparation for two years developed malignant hypertension. Investigation failed to elicit any renal or other cause for her hypertension, but control of blood pressure was obtained by withdrawal of the oral contraceptive agent and antihypertensive therapy. Subsequently, after withdrawal of therapy, the blood pressure remained near normal. The patient had a previous history of hypertension during pregnancy; she was also overweight.
