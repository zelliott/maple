Gene PPARgamma is one of the pivotal factors that influence adipocyte differentiation. It is transcriptional factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of genes involved in lipid utilisation and storage as well as insulin action. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether PPARgamma Pro12Ala and Pro115Gln polymorphisms are connected with obesity and its anthropological parameters.

we investigated 93 subjects: 72 women (37 non-obese and 35 obese) and 21 men (8 non-obese and 13 obese). We performed anthropological examination: BMI, WHR and total-body densitometry in the whole group. PPARg polymorphism was studied using PCR and RFLP.

Pro12Pro ("wild" type) variant was present in 57 subjects (32 obese and 25 non-obese): 45 women (26 obese and 19 non-obese) and 12 men (6 obese and 6 non-obese). Heterozygosity Pro12Ala was observed in 20 subjects (8 obese and 12 controls): 15 women (4 obese and 11 lean) and 5 men (4 obese). Homozygosity Ala12Ala was discovered in 16 subjects (8 obese and 8 controls): 12 women (5 obese and 7 non-obese) and 4 men (3 obese). Pro115Gln variant was not found in any of the studied subjects.

The frequency Ala allele (pro12Ala and Ala12Ala variant) was 28% in the whole group and 25% in the obese subjects. However the Pro12Ala polymorphism is quite common, it does not seem to be directly connected with onset of obesity. But it is interesting that the Ala allele is more frequent in non-obese women comparing to obese women (33 vs 20%). Reverse tendency was seen in men. Pro12Ala and/or Ala12Ala polymorphism is twice more frequent in obese subjects comparing to non-obese ones (38 vs 19%).
