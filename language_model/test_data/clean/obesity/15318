In the material of the Diabetic Outpatient Department and Consulting Unit of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Debrecen, Medical University, the author studied the effects of gestational diabetes on pregnant women and their fetuses in 75 cases with repeated gestations. The author observed that 13 out of the 75 prior gestational diabetic women had manifest diabetes during the second pregnancy. Insulin demand increased gradually during the gestational period and where therapy was needed the treatment had to be started at the 20th week of gestation, instead 27th. In the next pregnancy a higher dose of insulin is required (18 and 23 U/day). Finally the author emphasized on the regular follow-up of such high-risk population.
