This study aims to test the effect of combining the degree and the duration of obesity into a single variable-obese-years-and to examine whether obese-years is a better predictor of the risk of diabetes than simply body mass index (BMI) or duration of obesity. Of the original cohort of the Framingham Heart Study, 5,036 participants were followed up every 2 years for up to 48 years (from 1948). The variable, obese-years, was defined by multiplying for each participant the number of BMI units above 30 kg/m(2) by the number of years lived at that BMI. Associations with diabetes were analyzed by using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for potential confounders. The incidence of type-2 diabetes increased as the number of obese-years increased, with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.09) per additional 10 obese-years. The dose-response relation between diabetes incidence and obese-years varied by sex and smoking status. The Akaike Information Criterion was lowest in the model containing obese-years compared with models containing either the degree or duration of obesity alone. A construct of obese-years is strongly associated with risk of diabetes and could be a better indicator of the health risks associated with increasing body weight than BMI or duration of obesity alone.
