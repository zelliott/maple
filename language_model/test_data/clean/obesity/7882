To explore the clustering character of overweight and obesity with multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors such as blood pressure, serum lipids and glucose, and to provide evidence for intervention in childhood.

A cross-sectional study was conducted on 913 children aged 7-13 years in urban area of Shijiazhuang. Measurements included height, weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and fasting serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and serum glucose (GLU).

Overall prevalence rate of overweight and obesity was 29.24% (boys: 34.98% vs. girls: 24.23%). When compared with normal children, children with overweight or obesity had significantly higher levels of SBP, DBP, TC, TG but low HDL-C. The prevalence rates of high SBP, DBP, TC, TG, GLU and low HDL-C in overweight and obese children were higher than in normal children. After adjusted for gender and age, the odds ratios of overweight and obese children for high SBP, DBP, TC, TG, GLU and low HDL-C were 6.77, 3.22, 2.55, 6.42, 3.85 and 2.94 (95% CI: 4.15-11.04, 1.38-7.49, 1.59-4.11, 3.46-11.92, 1.69-8.78 and 1.83-4.73), respectively. Odds ratios of overweight and obese children holding any one, two or three of the selected six risk factors appeared to be 2.74, 13.15 and 15.33 (95% CI : 1.92-3.92, 6.69-25.87 and 4.17-56.39), respectively.

Childhood overweight and obesity increased the clustering of children's risk factors on cardiovascular diseases, as well as increasing the risk of children acquiring multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors. Controlling overweight and obesity would help early prevention on children from getting cardiovascular diseases.
