Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder of premenopausal women. These women have insulin resistance independent of obesity; and insulin resistance is now recognized as a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

We sought, therefore, to assess whether there was correlation between a simple fasting measure of insulin sensitivity (Homeostatic Model) and the Minimal-Model in this syndrome.

Thirty-three PCOS women (aged 22.7 +/- 6.2 years and body mass index (BMI) 29.1 +/- 5.4) underwent frequently sampled i.v. glucose tolerance test (Minimal-Model).

Seventeen patients (51.5%) had insulin sensitivity &<1.5 x 10(-4) min.-1.microU-1.mL-1. Patients with BMI&> de 27 was more resistant than the BMI &<or = de 27 (p = 0.004). The correlation in PCOS between Si (insulin sensitivity) and HOMA IR was found significant for all the group (p = 0.0001; RRANK = -0.76) and those women with BMI&> de 27 (RRANK = -0.77; p = 0.00006), but not significant correlation was found in those with BMI &<or = de 27 (RRANK = -0.43; p = 0.13).

We conclude that the HOMA IR may be useful as a screening test for insulin resistance in overweight and obese Mexican PCOS women but not in the lean ones.
