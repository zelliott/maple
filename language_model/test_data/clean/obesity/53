Unrecognized esophageal placement of endotracheal tubes during general anesthesia or in apneic unanesthetized patients is not an uncommon occurrence. Allowing this mishap to proceed to asphyxia and catastrophe is inexcusable. If one is uncertain, proper placement can be quickly verified by mouth-to-tube insufflation of a subject's lungs with one's own expired air immediately after intubation. This method of verification may be useful in areas other than the operating room, where intubations are performed for resuscitation or airway control.
