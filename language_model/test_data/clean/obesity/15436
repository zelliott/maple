The authors estimated abdominal fat distribution on the basis of measurements at computed tomography (CT). The attenuation range for fat tissue was defined as the interval within the mean plus or minus 2 SDs considered to be individual variation. Fat areas found with this method were closely correlated with those obtained by means of the computed planimetric method or with a fixed attenuation range from -190 to -30 HU as the standard of reference. Although the average CT numbers obtained with different scanners were distributed widely, the calculated fat areas were almost identical. This method might be a practical and standardized method at CT.
