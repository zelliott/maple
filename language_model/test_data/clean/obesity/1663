This review identifies studies describing interventions delivered across both the home and school/community setting, which target obesity and weight-related nutrition and physical activity behaviors in children. Fifteen studies, published between 1998 and 2010, were included and evaluated for effectiveness, study quality, nutrition/activity content, behavior change techniques, and theoretical basis, using validated assessment tools/taxonomies. Seven studies were rated as effective. Behavior change techniques used to engage families, and techniques associated with intervention effectiveness were coded. Effective studies used about 10 behavior change techniques, compared with 6.5 in ineffective studies. Effective interventions used techniques including providing general information on behavior-health links, prompting practice of behavior, and planning for social support/social changes. Different behavior change techniques were applied in the home and school setting. The findings of this review provide novel insights into the techniques associated with intervention effectiveness that can inform the development of public health obesity prevention strategies.
