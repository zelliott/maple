Adiponectin and resistin are hormones that may represent a link between obesity and insulin resistance. Genes for these hormones are new candidate genes of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms 45T&> G and 276T&> G of adiponectin gene and 62G&> A and -180C&> G of resistin gene in patients with obesity, anorexia nervosa and in lean women and to study the influence of particular genotypes on serum concentrations of these hormones.

Serum adiponectin, resistin, TNF-alfa and insulin levels were measured in 51 patients with obesity, 17 with anorexia nervosa and 17 lean women. DNA analysis was carried out by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with restriction analysis of PCR product (RFLP). Adiponectin levels were lowest in obese women and highest in anorexia nervosa patients. Resistin concentrations were lowest in anorexia nervosa and highest in obese patients. Genotype analysis within respective groups showed no differences in assessed parameters when comparing different adiponectin and resistin polymorphisms. The only difference detected was significantly higher BMI in G/G genotype relative to T allele carries in 276 position of ADP gene in control group (23.48 +/- 0.85 vs. 19,7 +/- 0.95, p &<0.05). In anorexia nervosa patients, frequency of G allele in RETN -180 polymorphism was significantly higher relative to control group (p &<0.05).

Polymorphisms 45T&> G a 276T&> G of ADP gene and 62&>A and -180C&> G RETN gene did not influence serum ADP and RETN concentrations. BMI was influenced by T allele presence in 276 position of ADP gene in control group only. Anorexia nervosa patients had higher frequency of G allele of RETN -180 polymorphism compared to healthy women.
