In a random sample of 211 primary-care physicians in Michigan, about 33% (n = 70) perceived their role in the prevention of obesity as coordinating and 39% (n = 82) as cooperative and of equal importance to that of other professionals. Perceived barriers to prevention of obesity were inadequate time to educate patients, method of reimbursement, and inadequate training in management of obesity. These results suggest that physicians' involvement in managing obesity can improve if they work closely with other health professionals.
