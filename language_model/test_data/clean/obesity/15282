Thirty percent of 51 obese adolescent girls seeking treatment for their obesity engaged in binge eating. Two psychometric measures, "disinhibition" and "happiness and satisfaction" predicted 63% of the variance in severity of binge eating. There was no difference in the history of dieting between obese subjects who binged and those who did not.
