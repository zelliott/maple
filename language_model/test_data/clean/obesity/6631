Improper body weight control is most critical to the development of morbid obesity, which is often associated with alternation in leptin (Ob) signaling in the central nervous system. Leptin acts to control fat mass through the regulation of both food intake and energy expenditure. In addition to the primary action in metabolic signaling, leptin has also been found to play a role in reproduction and even in breast tumorigenesis in obese patients. Interestingly, estrogen, a sex hormone, has also been recognized as another crucial factor for energy balance and breast tumorigenesis in obese subjects. Obesity in postmenopausal women has been associated with higher risk of breast cancer. There are substantial data in the literature on the connection of estrogen and leptin pathways in development of obesity and breast cancer. In this review, we discuss the cross-talk of leptin and estrogen signaling pathways in body weight control and breast cancer development.
