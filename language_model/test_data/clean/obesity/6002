The aim of this research was to investigate differential gene expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) in white adipose tissue (WAT) and liver from high-fat fed male Wistar rats with or without vitamin C (VC) supplementation (750 mg/kg of body weight). After 56 d of experimentation, animals fed on a cafeteria diet increased significantly body weights and total body fat. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies showed that cafeteria diet decreased p21 and p57 mRNA expression in subcutaneous WAT and increased p21 mRNA in liver. Overall, these data provide new information about the role of high fat intake on mRNA levels of several CKIs with implications in adipogenesis, cell metabolism and weight homeostasis. Interestingly, VC supplementation partially prevented diet-induced adiposity and increased p27 mRNA in liver without any changes in the other tissues and genes analyzed. Thus, hepatic mRNA changes induced by ascorbic acid indicate a possible role of these genes in diet-induced oxidative stress processes.
