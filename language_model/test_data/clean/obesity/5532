To investigate the association between the mutation of beta 3-adrenergoc receptor gene and obesity in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Body mass, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure and blood lipids were measured in 154 type 2 diabetic patients. Polymerase chain reaction and the restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were used to determine the wild, heterozygous and homozygous forms of beta 3-adrenergoc receptor gene.

The frequency of the Trp64Arg mutation was 42.5% and the frequency of Arg64 allele was 22.6%. The mutation frequency of the genetic types was significantly different between the obese and non-obese type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. The body mass, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol were significantly different, when those with Trp64Arg heterozygous were compared with those with Trp64 homozygous.

The genetic mutation of beta 3-adrenegoc receptor in patients with type 2 diabetes is probably related to obesity.
