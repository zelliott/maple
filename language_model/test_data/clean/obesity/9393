In recent years, the number of people described as being either overweight and obese has increased dramatically, and especially among children. Breakfast has long been recommended as part of a healthy diet and, for some time, evidence has been accumulating that people who eat breakfast regularly are slimmer than those who skip breakfast. This article examines the supporting evidence for this claim, in both adults and children, and discusses the importance of a healthy diet and plenty of exercise, as well as methods the nurse can use to help patients remain aware of their shape and weight.
