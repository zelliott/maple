1-(1-Acetyl-piperidin-4-yl)-3-adamantan-1-yl-urea 14a (AR9281), a potent and selective soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, was recently tested in a phase 2a clinical setting for its effectiveness in reducing blood pressure and improving insulin resistance in pre-diabetic patients. In a mouse model of diet induced obesity, AR9281 attenuated the enhanced glucose excursion following an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. AR9281 also attenuated the increase in blood pressure in angiotensin-II-induced hypertension in rats. These effects were dose-dependent and well correlated with inhibition of the sEH activity in whole blood, consistent with a role of sEH in the observed pharmacology in rodents.
