OGTT (75 g glucose) and IVGTT (25 g glucose) were compared in 20 extra-obese patients, both glycaemia and insulin levels being calculated. In only 2 out of 7 cases was the glucose intolerance revealed by OGTT confirmed by IGVTT and IVGTT was never able to identify the excessive insulin output revealed by OGTT. It can therefore be confirmed that in the extra-obese even more than in normal patients, IVGTT and OGTT investigate different functions of glucose tolerance and acute insulin output.
