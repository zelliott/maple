To determine whether ketosis at the time of presentation occurs among African-American adolescents with NIDDM.

We reviewed the charts of all islet cell antibody (ICA) negative patients diagnosed with NIDDM at Children's Hospital Medical Center (CHMC) between 1982 and 1995.

Between 1982 and 1985, 70 adolescents were diagnosed with NIDDM. Of these, ICA determinations were available and negative on 42 subjects (28 African-American, 12 white). Twelve of 28 (42%) African-American patients presented with ketonuria, and seven of 28 (25%) presented with DKA. In comparison, none of the 12 white adolescents with NIDDM had ketonuria at presentation or during their subsequent course. Mean follow-up time for patients with ketosis at presentation was 24 months. There was no difference between the age, BMI, or sex distribution of patients with and without ketosis. Previously diagnosed hypertension was present in 42% of patients presenting with ketosis, compared with 17% of the general NIDDM population at CHMC.

We conclude that ketosis may occur among African-American adolescents with NIDDM, as has been previously reported among African-American adults with NIDDM. Therefore, ketosis in obese young African-American patients with new-onset diabetes does not necessarily imply the presence of IDDM and insulin dependence.
