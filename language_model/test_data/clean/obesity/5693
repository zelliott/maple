Problem drinkers attending an outpatient alcoholism program and obese clients attending an outpatient weight program were compared with each other and with matched control groups on life-style characteristics and personality variables (Adjective Check List). While both treatment groups expressed high dissatisfaction with all aspects of their lives, relative to controls, problem drinkers experienced a greater variety of problems than weight clients. Problem drinkers and weight clients were both significantly differentiated from their respective control groups on 10 of 24 Adjective Check List scales. Moreover, the two treatment groups showed substantial similarity in overall personality profiles. Both groups indicated characteristics of impulsivity, dependency, and self-abasement. Problem drinkers uniquely showed high drive and unconventionality, whereas weight clients uniquely showed submissiveness and low ambition.
