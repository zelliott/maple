A case of pregnancy after jejunoileal bypass is presented. Fifty-six full-term pregnancies among 44 patients reported in the literature are reviewed. Pregnancy is not contraindicated after jejunoileal bypass, as it is accompanied by few more problems than those normally encountered in the obese woman. Somewhat smaller babies are born from these pregnancies and some minor disturbances of glucose, protein, and minerals may have to be adjusted during the pregnancy. A two-year interval is suggested after jejunoileal bypass before pregnancy is undertaken, to allow a weight-loss plateau to be established. The 7% incidence of severe congenital anomalies among these 57 pregnancies is higher than normal and suggests an added risk.
