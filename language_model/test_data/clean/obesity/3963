Cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD), is the leading cause of mortality in populations, particularly in the diabetic one. Individuals with diabetes have at least a two-fold to four-fold increased risk of having cardiovascular events and a double risk of death compared with age-matched subjects without diabetes. A decline in mortality from CVD has been shown, but decline due to CHD is consistently lower in individuals with diabetes when compared with non-diabetics. The presence of several factors in diabetes leads to high occurrence of CVD such as hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and classical and non-classical risk factors (systemic hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, proinflammatory condition and others). It is possible that the atherogenic role of obesity may be at least in part due to increased adipocyte production of cytokines. Considering the marked association of diabetes and CVD and unfavorable prognosis following an event, it is important to identify who is at high risk and how to screen. The American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association recommend risk stratification using diagnostic tests. However, the challenge is to accurately identify patients without a prior history of an event and those without symptoms strongly suggesting CVD, in whom additional testing would be indicated in order to achieve the most effective prevention. The benefits of glycemic control and the other risk factors have already been shown and justify optimization of the management of this high-risk population, aiming to reduce cardiovascular mortality disease and improve quality of life.
