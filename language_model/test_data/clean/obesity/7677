Two studies investigated the different contribution of positive and negative associations to the size of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) effect. A Many-Facet Rasch Measurement analysis was applied for the purpose. Across different IATs (Race and Weight) and different groups of respondents (White, Normal weight, and Obese people) we observed that positive words increase the IAT effect whereas negative words tend to decrease it. Results suggest that the IAT is influenced by a positive associations primacy effect. As a consequence, we argue that researchers should be careful when interpreting IAT effects as a measure of implicit prejudice.
