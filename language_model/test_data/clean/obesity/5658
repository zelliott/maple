The aim of this prospective study was to assess the outcome of laparoscopic colectomy for sigmoid diverticulitis in normal weighted, overweighted and obese patients.

From January 1995 to December 2000, all patients (n = 77) undergoing an elective colectomy for sigmoid diverticulitis were included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups: group 1 (n = 29): normal weighted patients (BMI: 18-24.9); group 2 (n = 27): overweighted patients (BMI: 25.0-29.9); group 3 (n = 21): obese patients (BMI: 30.0-39.9). Comparison between these three groups was only made during the per and postoperative period.

There were no differences in the three groups with regard to age, sex and ASA classification. Duration of operation did not differ between group 1 and 2 (187 vs 210 min, P = 0.6) but was shorter in group 1 than in group 3 (187 vs 247 min, P = 0.003). Conversion rate did not differ and was respectively in group 1, 2 and 3: 13.8, 14.8 and 14.3%. The postoperative period during which parenteral analgesics were required was not different for group 1 and 2 but was longer in group 3 than in group 1 (8.5 vs 5.7 days, p = 0.03). Morbidity rate was similar in group 1, 2 and 3: 15, 14 and 17%. There was no perioperative mortality. Duration of hospital stay was similar in the three groups.

Data from the present study suggest that laparoscopic colectomy for sigmoid diverticulitis can be applied safely to overweighted and obese patients.
