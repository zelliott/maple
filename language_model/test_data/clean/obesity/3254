The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is based on identification of the following parameters: abdominal obesity, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, fasting glycemia, as recommended by ATP III. In order to simplify the clinical practice, at least two parameters should be screened for. The most frequent couple, easy to be determined in practice, is hypertensive waist, followed by hypertriglyceridemic waist, hypertensive dyslipidemia, dysglycemic dyslipidemia and hypertensive dysglycemia. Based on these couples the next step would be to identify the triads that diagnose the metabolic syndrome. A global assessment of cardiovascular risk should be made. Suggested method is to apply the Framingham Score. Therapeutic intervention is structured according to levels of cardiovascular risk. Clinical management is structured on THEME Programs (therapy, education, monitoring, evaluation), applied to all risk factors.
