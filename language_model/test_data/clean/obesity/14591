Androgens and oestrogens have opposing effects on some adipocyte functions. Thus, the androgen to oestrogen balance may be as important as the individual hormones in determining the biological interaction between endogenous sex hormones and adipocyte-derived factors such as adiponectin and leptin. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the sex-specific, cross-sectional association of sex hormones and androgen to oestrogen ratios with serum adiponectin and leptin in older men and postmenopausal women.

Cross-sectional.

A total of 1510 community dwelling men and postmenopausal women aged 50-92 years.

Serum leptin, adiponectin and sex hormone levels.

Adiponectin and leptin levels were higher in women than men (P &<0.001). In both sexes, adiponectin concentrations were lower, and leptin levels higher, with increasing BMI and waist girth (all P &<0.001). Although the ratio of total testosterone to total oestradiol was significantly associated with both adipocytokines in both sexes, the strongest and most consistent hormone-adipocytokine associations were observed when the androgen to oestrogen ratio was expressed as total testosterone to bioavailable oestradiol. In linear regressions, the testosterone to bioavailable oestradiol ratio was positively related to adiponectin and inversely related to leptin, with nearly identical standardized beta-coefficients for men and women (all P &<0.001). The strength of the hormone ratio-adipocytokine associations was reduced, but not eliminated, after adjustment for age, adiposity and cardiovascular disease risk factors, including insulin resistance.

The striking similarity of the hormone ratio-adipocytokine associations for men and women, despite wide differences in sex hormone and adipocytokine levels, suggests these results reflect underlying physiological mechanisms common to both sexes.
