Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease, resulting from a predominantly gram-negative microbial infection within the sub-gingival dental plaque biofilm. The resulting inflammatory response in the periodontal tissues may facilitate intravascular dissemination of micro-organisms and their products, throughout the body. The total surface area of this inflammatory field is estimated to be the size of the palm of the hand. A skin lesion of this size would prompt immediate medical intervention. However, the intra-oral (and similar-sized) infection is frequently ignored by health professionals, despite the fact that it may be associated with a range of systemic diseases/conditions.
