The goal of this article is to review and discuss the various and numerous links between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and bladder, specially overactive bladder syndrome.

Pubmed/Medline analysis, without date or language limits, was conducted using the following keywords: "metabolic syndrome" and "bladder (or "incontinence" or "overactive bladder"). All types of papers were analysed (117).

MetS is defined as the presence of three or more of the following five characteristics: 1) waist circumference greater than 102 cm; 2) systolic blood pressure 130 mmHg or greater or diastolic blood pressure 85 mmHg or greater, or antihypertensive medication use; 3) HDL cholesterol less than 40 mg/dL or lipid medication use; 4) self- reported type 2 diabetes or increased blood sugar or diabetes medication use; 5) triglycerides greater than 150 mg/dL. In regard of epidemiolgy, there is a strong correlation between MetS and overactive bladder. Pathophysiological mechanisms to explain the relationship of storage symptoms rather than voiding phase symptoms with MetS include the influence of sustained hyperglycemia on the viability of parasympathetic neurons in the pelvic ganglion. A link or overlaps between MetS and alteration of autonomic nervous system can be hypothezised.

Links between Mets and urinary disorders are frequent and common pathophysiological factors can be frequently observed, particularly autonomic nervous system alterations.
