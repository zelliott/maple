Recent concerns over high incidences of obesity among various American Indian tribes and groups have been ignored by the psychological literature. Relationships between obesity and MMPI and I-E Scale scores have been reported without regard for ethnicity. This study compared urbanized obese and non-obese American Indians and Caucasians on the Mini-Mult MMPI and I-E Scale (N = 160). Major findings included such results as the fact that the Indian sample had higher Hypomania scale scores than the Caucasian sample and that males had higher Depression and Hypochondriasis scale scores than females. Mini-Mult and I-E Scale scores were similar across weight conditions. These results are discussed in terms of the complexity of obesity in general as well as ethnic/cultural and sex difference factors.
