There has been an increase in the incidence of obesity, which is a substantial component of metabolic syndrome. It is visceral obesity, which especially favours the occurrence of insulin resistance endothelial dysfunction and acceleration of atherogenesis. The influence of inflammation, neuro-humoral balance, genetic background and sleep apnoea on the metabolic syndrome development are discussed. Current opinions on the treatment of metabolic syndrome are shown.
