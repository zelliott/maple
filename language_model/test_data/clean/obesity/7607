Very high-intensity, low-volume, sprint interval training (SIT) increases muscle oxidative capacity and may increase maximal oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]), but whether circulatory function is improved, and whether SIT is feasible in overweight/obese women is unknown. To examine the effects of SIT on [Formula: see text] and circulatory function in sedentary, overweight/obese women. Twenty-eight women with BMI&> 25 were randomly assigned to SIT or control (CON) groups. One week before pre-testing, subjects were familarized to [Formula: see text] testing and the workload that elicited 50% [Formula: see text] was calculated. Pre- and post-intervention, circulatory function was measured at 50% of the pre-intervention [Formula: see text], and a GXT was performed to determine [Formula: see text]. During the intervention, SIT training was given for 3 days/week for 4 weeks. Training consisted of 4-7, 30-s sprints on a stationary cycle (5% body mass as resistance) with 4 min active recovery between sprints. CON maintained baseline physical activity. Post-intervention, heart rate (HR) was significantly lower and stroke volume (SV) significantly higher in SIT (-8.1 and 11.4%, respectively; P &<0.05) during cycling at 50% [Formula: see text]; changes in CON were not significant (3 and -4%, respectively). Changes in cardiac output ([Formula: see text]) and arteriovenous oxygen content difference [(a - v)O(2) diff] were not significantly different for SIT or CON. The increase in [Formula: see text] by SIT was significantly greater than by CON (12 vs. -1%). Changes by SIT and CON in HR(max) (-1 vs. -1%) were not significantly different. Four weeks of SIT improve circulatory function during submaximal exercise and increases [Formula: see text] in sedentary, overweight/obese women.
