To investigate the correlations between obesity index such as waist circumference, hip circumference, skin-fold thickness, body mass index, waist to hip ratio, waist to height ratio etc, and blood pressure among Kazak children living in Yili of Xinjiang.

In May-June 2009, 2438 Kazak children aged 7 to 14 at primary schools in Yili of Xinjiang, were investigated. Waist circumference, hip circumference, skin-fold thickness, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured to calculate the body mass index, waist to hip ratio and waist to height ratio. Analysis on the differences in age and gender, blood pressure (BP) between hypertensive or normal BP group under the standard set for children. SPSS 17.0 software was used for statistical analysis on its correlation.

The total prevalence of hypertension was 5.7% in Kazak ethnic school-age children in Yili, with 4.4% in the boys and 7.0% in girls. Data from waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-height-ratio, waist-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure showed gender and age differences (P = 0.000). Average systolic blood pressure was correlated to waist circumference, hip circumference, skin-fold thickness, body mass index and waist to hip ratio (P = 0.000), with hip circumference the most (man: r = 0.618, female: r = 0.655). The average diastolic blood pressure was correlated to waist circumference, hip circumference, skin-fold thickness, body mass index and waist to hip ratio (P = 0.000), with hip having the strongest relation (r = 0.489 for male and r = 0.548 for females). Significant differences were seen between Hypertension group and normal blood pressure group on waist circumference, hip circumference, skin-fold thickness, body mass index and waist-hip ratio (P &<0.05).

In Yili of Xinjiang, the prevalence of hypertension was at the low level in Kazak ethnic school-aged children when comparing to data from national and foreign standards. Indicators related to obesity as waist circumference, hip circumference, body mass index and waist to hip ratio were positively correlated with blood pressure, with hip in particular.
