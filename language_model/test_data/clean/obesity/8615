Usually, the occurrence of obesity is typical of some people and may result from genetic conditions or hormone disorders, but most frequently it is an effect of an inappropriate life style, negative health behaviours such as: inappropriate diet or the lack of elementary physical activity. The goal of the paper is the analysis and a life style evaluation of people suffering from obesity. The examination covered a group of 40 people who attend themselves for obese. The examinations were conducted by means of a survey questionnaire of own structure. The examinations problems included in the survey concerned the causes of obesity, life comfort, health behaviours and life style of obese people. From the conducted examinations it can be inferred that the main causes of obesity are inappropriate eating habits and the lack of physical activity.
