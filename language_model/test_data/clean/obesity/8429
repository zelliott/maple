Wide ranges in weight and fat gain in response to high-fat diets have been reported in rats. This study measured epinephrine-stimulated lipolysis in adipose tissue of normal weight, 3-mo-old, female Sprague-Dawley rats as a metabolic predictor of "efficient gain" before feeding them a high-fat (84% kcal) diet for 11 wk. Subcutaneous (inguinal) adipose tissue (1-1.5 g) was excised, and the glycerol release was measured after incubation with 0, 10(-7), 10(-5), and 10(-3) M epinephrine. Differences in gain efficiency explained much of the variation in lipid (r = 0.78) and weight (r = 0.83) gain. Low glycerol release by 10(-5) and 10(-3) M epinephrine was significantly correlated to high final fat accumulation. Low and high quartiles based on glycerol release were not different in numbers of adipocytes or food intake but were significantly different in gain efficiency (P = 0.011), final weight (P = 0.036), carcass lipid (P = 0.033), and carcass lean mass (P = 0.017). In conclusion, female Sprague-Dawley rats are preferentially predisposed to efficiency of adipose accumulation on a high-fat diet. This tendency is negatively correlated in the preobese state to the lipolytic response to epinephrine of subcutaneous adipose tissue in vitro.
