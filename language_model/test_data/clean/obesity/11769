This case report describes the presentation of a patient with Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Bardet-Biedl Syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition that includes retinal dystrophy, dystrophic extremities (commonly polydactyly), obesity, hypogenitalism, and renal disease. Cognitive deficit has also been considered part of the syndrome. The historically associated Laurence-Moon syndrome includes spastic paraparesis but not the obesity and polydactyly. They are now considered separate conditions. The most common feature of Bardet-Biedl syndrome is retinal dystrophy. The appearance of the retina in the condition is quite variable with typical retinitis pigmentosa being present in only a minority of cases. The associated optic atrophy can be primary in nature and might play a role in the decreased central vision. Diagnosis of the condition is important for visual prognosis and low vision management. The renal disease often goes undetected until specific radiological testing is done after diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. This is significant in that early death often occurs in this condition because of the renal disease.
