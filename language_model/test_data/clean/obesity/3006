In 13 obese children plasma triglyceride concentrations were found to be significantly elevated, while plasma cholesterol concentrations were normal. In the hypertriglyceridemic obese children, the plasma fractional triglyceride removal, measured by the intravenous fat tolerance test, was significantly reduced. These abnormalities reverted to normal in 8 patients retested after weight loss. Plasma postheparin lipoprotein lipase activity was found to be increased and significantly related to the degree of obesity. As to carbohydrate metabolism, a decreased glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemia were found. Hyperinsulinemia reverted to normal during dietary restriction, glucose intolerance did not.
