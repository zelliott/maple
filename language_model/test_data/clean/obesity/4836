A 70-year-old man had been obese since youth. He had been treated for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. An abdominal ultrasound showed a mass in the liver. He was admitted to St Marianna University School of Medicine Hospital for further evaluation. There was no history of alcohol use, and hepatitis viral markers and autoantibodies were all negative. Several imaging studies showed overt hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Transcatheter arterial embolization was performed, followed by surgical resection. Histopathological examination revealed moderately differentiated HCC. The non-tumor areas had pseudolobules in a diffuse pattern similar to alcoholic cirrhosis. The histological findings in the ectopic liver tissue attached to the gallbladder, which was also resected during surgery, were that there was no cirrhosis, but fine fibrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration of sinusoids. These findings were consistent with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). There was probably a progression of similar findings that had developed into cirrhosis. These findings confirmed a diagnosis of HCC, cirrhosis, and underlying NASH in this patient. The present case is important for investigation of the development into cirrhosis and carcinogenesis of NASH. The present case demonstrates the importance of evaluating obese patients with fatty liver for underlying NASH and ongoing follow up for development of cirrhosis and HCC.
