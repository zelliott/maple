Teasing and bullying incident levels have increased markedly in recent years according to international news reports. School and community-level action to stop and prevent bullying is a key focus of government education policy worldwide. Teasing is a usual facet of social interaction among youth and is related to bullying behavior. Although teasing and bullying are significant concerns, references for relevant concept analysis are lacking in the nursing field. To facilitate early screening to identify high-risk bullies and help victims effectively stop bullying events, concept analysis is needed to clarify and distinguish between the two concepts of teasing and bullying. The aim of this study is to integrate relevant published literature to determine the reasons for and relationships between teasing and bullying. We chose obesity as an example to construct a teasing and bullying conceptual model for adolescents and used this model to explore the related factors and health impacts of obesity. We found that both teaser intent and recipient perceptions correlated with bullying behavior. Duration and severity may induce teasing to become bullying. Because weight-based teasing is common among adolescents, we chose obesity as an example issue to demonstrate our adolescents teasing and bullying concept model. We then integrated the antecedent and consequential factors of teasing and bullying for obese adolescents. Weight-control strategies can stop school bullying if early interventions are performed in high-risk populations.
