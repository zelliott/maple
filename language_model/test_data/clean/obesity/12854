To determine whether the presence of insulin resistance in obese subjects would adversely affect the rate of ovulation induction by clomiphene citrate.

Fasting hyperinsulinemia was associated with the failure to ovulate in response to clomiphene. In addition, other parameters found to correlate with insulin resistance and clomiphene citrate non-response were elevations of total and free testosterone and lower serum sex hormone-binding globulin.

The existence of the presence of endocrine abnormalities associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance may serve as clinical indicators to help predict which obese patients are likely to respond to clomiphene citrate therapy.
