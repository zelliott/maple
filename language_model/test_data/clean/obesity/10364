The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) shell extracts (PSE) on lipases and to evaluate its potential development for the treatment of obesity. The peanut shells were extracted in 95% ethanol, and the extracts were screened for inhibitory effects on pancreatic lipase (PL) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activities as well as on lipolysis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We also examined in vivo whether PSE could prevent the body weight gain induced by feeding a high-fat diet to male Wistar rats for 12 weeks. PSE inhibits a number of lipases, including PL, LPL and, possibly, hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). PSE-treated Wistar rats showed increased fecal lipid excretion respect to the control group. Body weight and body weight gain, and liver size, were significantly lower in rats fed the high-fat diet with 1% of PSE (w:w diet) than in those fed the high-fat diet alone. The rats treated with PSE showed reduced triacylglycerol content in the liver, as well as the serum glucose and insulin. The inhibitory activity of PSE on the lipid metabolic enzymes and the increase in fecal fat excretion suggests that PSE might be useful as a treatment to reduce the dietary fat absorption. The observed reduction in intracellular lipolytic activity of cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes may reduce the levels of circulating free fatty acids. The observed effects are likely induced by more than one bioactive component of PSE. The PSE actions may, at least in part, be attributed to the inhibition of fat absorption in the digestive tract and the reduction of the adipocyte lipolysis.
