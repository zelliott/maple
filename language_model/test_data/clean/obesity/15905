Symptomatic chronic mesenteric ischemia is a rare condition. Several surgical and endovascular techniques have been described, but treatment is individualized according to the conditions of each patient. We report a successful superior mesenteric artery revascularization by using an S-shaped retrograde polytetrafluoroethylene ilio-mesenteric bypass graft in a young overweight patient with a history of two abdominal vascular operations and several comorbidities.
