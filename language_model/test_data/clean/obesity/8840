Food intake is regulated in both the short- and long-term by a complex physiological system that involves neuroendocrine pathways that are both distinct and overlapping. The underlying causes and mechanisms of the dysregulation of food intake in obesity is poorly understood; however, it is clear that dietary components interact with the physiological determinants of food intake and can cause profound alterations during the development of control mechanisms. The objective of this review is to discuss possible food solutions to the obesity epidemic based on our current understanding of food intake regulation and its interaction with dietary components. First, the physiology of long- and short-term food intake regulation is reviewed. The effects of dietary components on food intake, satiety and intake regulatory markers are then discussed with particular emphasis on macronutrient class and source. Finally, the impact of nutritional manipulations during the early stages of development on food intake and metabolic regulation is examined, followed by a brief description of the possible genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved.
