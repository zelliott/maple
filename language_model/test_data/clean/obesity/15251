1. The author studied 225 employed women in the New York Metropolitan area between the ages of 25 and 55 years. The Disinhibited Dieters in this study were overweight, depressed, anxious, and had a low self esteem. The Cognitive Controlled Dieters were not depressed or anxious, had a positive self esteem, and were not overweight. 2. The only significant variable between successful Cognitive Controlled Dieters and Disinhibited Dieters was exercise. 3. Nurses must examine their own beliefs and feelings concerning weight and eating and the connection with depression, anxiety, and self esteem before they can successfully relate to clients. 4. Attitude, cognitive changes, involvement in sports and exercise, and healthy eating are primary prevention interventions to be utilized by the nurse.
