To examine the prevalence of under and overreporting of energy intake in adolescents and their associated factors.

Cross-sectional study with 96 postpubertal adolescents (47 normal-weight and 49 obese), mean age of 16.6Â±1.3 years. Weight and height were measured, and body mass index was calculated. Body composition was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Dietary intake was evaluated by a 3-day dietary record. Biochemical assessment was performed (serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, plasma glucose, and insulin). Underreporters reported energy intake &<1.35 x basal metabolic rate (BMR), whereas overreporters reported energy intake&> 2.4 x BMR.

Energy intake misreporting (under or overreporting) was identified in 65.6% of adolescents (64.6 and 1% of under and overreporting, respectively). Obese adolescents were 5.0 times more likely to underreport energy intake (95%CI 2.0-12.7) than normal-weight participants. Underreporters showed higher rates of insufficient intake of carbohydrate (19.3 vs. 12.1%, p = 0.046) and lipids (11.3 vs. 0%, p &<0.001) than plausible reporters. Cholesterol intake was also lower in underreporters (p = 0.017). There were no significant differences in body composition and biochemical parameters in relation to misreporting.

The results obtained demonstrated a high percentage of misreporting of energy intake among adolescents, especially among obese subjects, which suggests that energy-adjusted nutrient intake values should be employed in diet-disease risk analysis in order to contribute to a reduction in errors associated with misreporting.
