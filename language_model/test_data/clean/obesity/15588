Alström's disease is a rare hereditary multiple-system illness, whereas a second-messenger defect can be assumed.

We describe a case-the first in Germany of 15 known cases in the world literature-, who suffers from all clinical features, such as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, retinitis pigmentosa, pancochlear damage of the ears, hypogonadism, obesity and chronic nephropathy, with the exception of acanthosis nigricans.

Because of the multiplicity of affected organs the diagnosis of Alström's disease is difficult.
