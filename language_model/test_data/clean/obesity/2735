To investigate the association between regional fat mass (FM) and insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia in obese women and men.

Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 109 obese women and 113 obese men. Insulin resistance was measured by (HOMA-IR); insulin sensitivity was estimated by metabolic clearance rate (MCRestOGTT) and insulin secretion by HOMAsecr. Serum lipids were assessed.

In women, leg FM was negatively (favourably) associated with HOMA-IR and cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio (p&<.05). Trunk FM was positively (unfavourably) associated with HOMA-IR. Leg/trunk FM ratio was negatively associated with HOMA-IR (p&<.001), cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio (p&<.001) and triglycerides (p&<.01); positively (favourably) with MCRestOGTT (p&<.01) and HDL-cholesterol (p&<.05). No associations were found in men. In women, multiple regression analysis demonstrated that leg/trunk FM ratio was the only explanatory FM for HOMA-IR and MCRestOGTT (R(2) = 0.23 and R(2) = 0.13, respectively; p&<.001), but postmenopausal status was also of importance (R(2) = 0.23, p = 0.019 and R(2) = 0.29, p = 0.015, respectively).

Leg FM has a favourable influence on insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia in obese women, but not demonstrated in this cohort of obese men.
