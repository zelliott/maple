Adiponectin is a 30-kDa polypeptide secreted primarily by adipose tissue and plays a key role in kidney disease. In obesity, reduced adiponectin levels are associated with insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease and obesity related kidney disease. The latter includes microalbuminuria, glomerulomegaly, overt proteinuria and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Adiponectin levels in type 2 diabetics also negatively correlate with early features of nephropathy. However, in patients with established chronic kidney disease, adiponectin levels are elevated and positively predict progression of disease. The mechanism of action of adiponectin in the kidney appears to be related to AMPK activation and NADPH oxidase. Further studies are needed to elucidate this pathway and investigate the role of potential targets of adiponectin-AMPK-Nox pathway for CKD as obesity-related CKD is increasing worldwide.
