The last years modified major our conceptions about nutrition. These revolutionary changes were produced by implementation of new techniques of functional genomics. The nutrigenomics and nutrigenomics provide powerful approaches to unravel the complex relationships between bioactive molecules, genetic polymorphisms and biological system and can give rise to personalized nutrition and dietary recommendations. In monogenic diseases (phenylketonuria, galactosemia, lactose intolerance etc.) diet influence phenotypic expression and nutrigenomics will improve the prevention or treatment by the early identification of specific mutations or haplotype combinations that modulate dietary response in affected subjects. In the multifactor diseases, like cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, type II diabetes mellitus or cancer, the nutrigenomics approach has begun to reveal that some of them are susceptible to dietary intervention and may modulate the onset and progression of disorders.
