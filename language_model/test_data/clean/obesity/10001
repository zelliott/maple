Plasma glucose and serum insulin during OGTT were measured in 33 patients with essential hypertension, 17 patients with simple obesity, 19 patients with acromegaly and 10 normal adults. Compared with control, serum insulin concentration increased in 33 patients with essential hypertension at 3 hour postload (P &<0.05) and in 17 patients with simple obesity at 1 hour postload (P &<0.05) during OGTT, 19 patients with acromegaly also had their insulin concentration increased at 1.3 hour postload (P &<0.05) during OGTT. The correlationships between diastolic blood pressure and integrated area under the curve for serum insulin concentration (r = 0.3838, P &<0.05) were observed in 33 patients with essential hypertension. Serum insulin concentration decreased in 10 patients with essential hypertension at 1 and 2 hour postload during OGTT after antihypertensive treatment with captopril or captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. The results indicated that the patients with essential hypertension, simple obesity and acromegaly are insulin resistant and hyperinsulinemic after an oral glucose load.
