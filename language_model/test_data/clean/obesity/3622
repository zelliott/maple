Obstructive sleep apnea often coexists with visceral adiposity and metabolic syndrome. In this study, we analysed gender-related differences in anthropometrics according to sleep apnea severity and metabolic abnormalities. In addition, the visceral adiposity index, a recently introduced marker of cardiometabolic risk, was analysed. Consecutive subjects with suspected obstructive sleep apnea (n = 528, 423 males, mean age ± standard deviation: 51.3 ± 12.8 years, body mass index: 31.0 ± 6.2 kg m(-2) ) were studied by full polysomnography (apnea-hypopnea index 43.4 ± 27.6 h(-1) ). Variables of general and visceral adiposity were measured (body mass index, neck, waist and hip circumferences, waist-to-hip ratio). The visceral adiposity index was calculated, and metabolic syndrome was assessed (NCEP-ATP III criteria). The sample included controls (apnea-hypopnea index &<0 h(-1) , n = 55), and patients with mild-moderate (apnea-hypopnea index 10-30 h(-1) , n = 144) and severe sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index&>30 h(-1) , n = 329). When anthropometric variables were entered in stepwise multiple regression, body mass index, waist circumference and diagnosis of metabolic syndrome were associated with the apnea-hypopnea index in men (adjusted R(2)  = 0.308); by contrast, only hip circumference and height-normalized neck circumference were associated with sleep apnea severity in women (adjusted R(2)  = 0.339). These results changed little in patients without metabolic syndrome; conversely, waist circumference was the only correlate of apnea-hypopnea index in men and women with metabolic syndrome. The visceral adiposity index increased with insulin resistance, but did not predict sleep apnea severity. These data suggest gender-related interactions between obstructive sleep apnea, obesity and metabolic abnormalities. The visceral adiposity index was a good marker of metabolic syndrome, but not of obstructive sleep apnea.
