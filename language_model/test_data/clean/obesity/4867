Obesity increases the risk of lifestyle diseases, poor quality of life, hospitalisation and shortening of life. Globally, obesity is on the rise, and as the current treatment options have generally been disappointing, many people argue that primary prevention is preferable. However, as yet documentation of effective primary prevention is lacking, and results indicate that one-sided intervention is ineffective. Despite the lack of documentation, many initiatives are being undertaken, both nationally and internationally, and it is recommended that Denmark also initiate a collaborative official effort.
