Over the last few decades, obesity has become a global epidemic in both developed and developing countries. Recent studies have indicated that obesity is closely associated with chronic inflammation characterized by abnormal levels of adipocytokines and inflammatory cytokines in adipocytes. The aim of this work was to study the effects of 21 polyphenolic compounds on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced changes of adipokines and oxidative stress in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The results showed that p-coumaric acid, quercetin, and resveratrol have greater inhibition (p &<0.05) of a TNF-α-induced increase in the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) among 21 tested polyphenolic compounds. p-Coumaric acid, quercetin, and resveratrol demonstrated inhibitions of TNF-α-induced changes in levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, p-coumaric acid, quercetin, and resveratrol increased levels (p &<0.05) of secreted adiponectin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in TNF-α-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results indicate that the inhibition of TNF-α-induced changes of adipokines and oxidative stress by some polyphenolic compounds might have further implications in preventing obesity-related pathologies.
