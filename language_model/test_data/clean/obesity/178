Seventy-four overweight psychiatric in-patients were treated with weight reducing diets for periods varying from 6 months to 34 months. Seventy per cent lost weight and 18 per cent attained an ideal weight. Weight reducing diets should be considered an important aspect of treatment for the majority of obese patients in psychiatric hospitals regardless of the cause of obesity.
