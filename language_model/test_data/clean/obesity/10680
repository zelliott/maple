Obesity and depression are significant characteristics of people living in a state of chronic stress.

Our aim was to determine the characteristics of depression in obese people living in an insecure unstable environment.

The case-control study was organized in two rural environments in Kosovo and Metochia, Serbia. The main criterion for selection of participants was that respondents were more than 18 years old and had a body mass index of 25 kg/m 2 or more. Other anthropometric parameters determined were body weight, height, body fat mass, hip and waist circumference and the waist/hip ratio. The sex, demographic characteristics, profession, marital status, social status, existence of comorbidity, and cigarette smoking habits were recorded, and the arterial blood pressure measured for all participants. In the form of an interview, all respondents answered 17 questions, based on the Hamilton scale for depression.

The group of depressed patients was dominated by women (P = 0.009). A significant difference (P = 0.007) was found in relation to profession. Depression was significantly more frequent in those without a regular income (P &<0.001). Depressed patients were significantly older (P = 0.017), more obese (P = 0.04), shorter (P = 0.0001), had a larger hip circumference (P = 0.039) and WHR index (P = 0.049) compared to patients in whom depression was not established.

Depression is a significant characteristic in people living in an insecure environment, more common in women, without a permanent financial income.
