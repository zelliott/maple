Recent evidences suggest that a number of chronic diseases seems to be associated with early prenatal and postnatal nutrition, even though the mechanisms underlying the link between early nutrition, health and well-being later in life have not been well understood. Considering that overweight and obesity derive from a condition of altered energy balance, one of the major interests of nutritional researchers is to provide breakthroughs in the understanding of hormonal patterns involved in energy balance regulation. Epidemiological surveys indicate that breastfeeding is protective against obesity in later life, even if the precise magnitude of this association remains not well defined. A lot of studies have shown the detection of hormones in breast milk, which have a role in energy balance regulation. In this review, we present a synopsis of previous and recent studies focusing on hormones in breast milk. It appears that promoting breastfeeding is an important factor in this process.
