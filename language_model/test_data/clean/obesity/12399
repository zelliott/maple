To analyze the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ1 and 2 (PPARγ1 and 2), 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD1), and leptin in adipose tissue (AT) of obese women during weight loss following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and to compare these levels with those obtained in AT of nonobese subjects.

Gene expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR prior to surgery and at 3, 6, and 12 months after RYGB.

All obese patients lost weight, reaching a mean BMI of 29.3 ± 1.0 kg/m(2) at 1 year after surgery (-33.9 ± 1.5% of their initial body weight). In obese subjects leptin and 11βHSD1 were over-expressed, whereas PPARγ1 was expressed at lower levels compared to controls. After surgery, leptin and 11βHSD1 gene expression decreased, whereas PPARγ1 expression increased. At 12 months after RYGB, these 3 genes had reached levels similar to the controls. In contrast, PPARγ2 gene expression was not different between groups and types of tissue and remained unchanged during weight loss. We found a positive correlation between BMI and levels of gene expression of leptin and 11βHSD1.

Gene expression of leptin, PPARγ1, and 11βHSD1 in AT is modified in human obesity. This default is completely corrected by RYGB.
