The type of dietary fat influences the blood lipid profile. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on circulating cholesterol levels and other lipids, when included in an energy-restricted diet to nutritionally treat obesity.

Thirty-five patients (BMI: 30.5 [1.3], age: 33 [6] years), were randomly assigned during 8 weeks one of the following diets: omega-3 fatty acids supplemented (EPA + DHA), enriched in salmon (150 g/day, 3 times/week) or control (placebo). Anthropometry and blood measurements were determined at baseline (day 0) and at endpoint (day 56).

Circulating total cholesterol statistically decreased after the slimming nutritional intervention in all experimental groups, being more pronounced in the enriched diet group (p &<0.001). The HDL-c levels decreased in both placebo (p = 0.004) and omega-3 supplemented (p = 0.053) dietary groups, while subjects who followed the salmon diet did not show such changes in HDL-c (p = 0.936).

These data suggest that a balanced hypocaloric diet enriched in salmon results in a beneficial effect on the plasma lipid profile that could be mediated by the salmon composition as a whole, and not only by the omega-3 content.
