High mass accuracy electrospray ionisation multistage tandem mass spectrometry (MS(n)) was applied to metabolite profiling studies on plasma samples derived from two strains of rat (the Zucker (fa/fa) obese strain and the normal wild type). Using a quadrupole ion trap time-of-flight (QIT-TOF) mass spectrometer, metabolite profiling software was applied to locate components of biological significance that could account for the differences between the two strains of rat and a formula prediction software tool was used to help identify individual components. The primary factor discriminating between the two populations was the concentration of endogenous lipids. In the Zucker (fa/fa) obese strain, the dominant ion signals and MS(n) spectra were in agreement with lysoglycerophosphocholine components such as palmitoyllysophosphatidylcholine, 1-oleoylglycerophosphocholine, 1-octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-stearoylglycerophosphocholine and these were found in relatively higher concentrations compared to the normal wild type. Components were identified using high mass accuracy MS(n) data, formula prediction software and by agreement with published mass spectra through internet databases, rather than using a conventional approach with authentic standards. This application shows that the use of high mass accuracy electrospray ionisation MS(n) together with a software tool can be used effectively to detect and characterise unknown analytes in complex matrices, and represents a promising approach for future profiling studies.
