We report the results of a study to assess the glomerular filtration rate in the elderly population seen at the center and to investigate the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and use of drugs in this age group. The glomerular filtration rate could be measured in 64.6% of the elderly population. In 94 (17.6%) of the 825 evaluated individuals the clearance values were 50 ml/min or lower. Only 6 of them had previously known chronic renal failure. A high prevalence of concomitant cardiovascular risk factors was found (48.7% were hypertensive, 25.1% diabetic, 19% smokers, 24.1% had hyperlipidemia and 38.8% were obese). The rate of drug use was also high (69.6% took two or more drugs sustainedly). These findings indicate the need to evaluate the renal function in elderly people before prescribing drug therapy.
