The relationships of relative weight to energy intake and to physical activity were studied among 141 females aged 34-59 y. As observed in previous studies Quetelet index (wt/ht2) was inversely related to energy intake (r = -0.11). However, obese women tended to be older (r = 0.16), exercise less (r = -0.30), and drink less alcohol (r = -0.16) than nonobese women. Older women had lower energy intake (r = -0.23) and exercised less (r = -0.12) than younger women. Energy intake and physical activity were positively related (r = 0.23). After adjustment for age, physical activity, alcohol, and smoking, the inverse correlation between relative weight and energy intake was significantly reduced (p = 0.04) from r = -0.11 to r = -0.02. Obese women reported higher intakes of total fat, and relative weight was significantly correlated with intakes of total fat (r = 0.20) and saturated fatty acids (r = 0.16). These data highlight the importance of considering factors that may confound the relationship between energy intake and obesity, and they suggest that fat intake may play a role in obesity that is independent of total energy intake.
