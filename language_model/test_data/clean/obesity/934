The JCR:LA-corpulent rat is a congenic strain that, if homozygous for the cp gene, is obese with a very low-density lipoprotein hyperlipidemia and is insulin resistant. The male corpulent rats develop atherosclerotic lesions of the major arteries and myocardial lesions. Corpulent and lean male rats were induced through mild food restriction to run intensively (approximately 6,000 m/day) from 6 wk to 6 mo of age. Food restriction, especially when coupled with running, lowered all classes of lipids in the whole serum of corpulent rats. The principal changes in lipid concentrations were in the very low-density lipoprotein fraction. Food restriction caused a significant drop in fasting insulin levels of corpulent rats and decreased beta-cell hyperplasia. Both effects were more marked in the running animals. There was a significant decrease in myocardial lesion frequency in the food-restricted corpulent rats and an absence of lesions in the running rats. The results indicate that intensive physical activity can largely correct the lipid abnormalities and insulin resistance of this atherosclerosis-prone strain, and these changes are associated with inhibition of the disease process. However, moderate food restriction has similar effects, and the greater effects seen with intensive running may simply reflect an effectively more severe metabolic restriction in the presence of the exercise.
