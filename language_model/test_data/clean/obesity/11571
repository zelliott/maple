Under resting conditions obese hypertensive patients have been described as having a greater cardiac output and lower total peripheral resistance than lean hypertensive patients. To evaluate the hemodynamic patterns under stress conditions, we determined the hemodynamic response to mental stress (first study) and during isometric exercise (second study) in hypertensive patients with a body mass index&> 27 kg/m2 (obese) and &<27 kg/m2 (lean). The cohort exposed to mental stress comprised 54 white male patients (30 were lean, 24 were obese) with untreated stage I or II essential hypertension according to the World Health Organization. Obese subjects responded with a higher increase in total peripheral resistance (p &<0.02) and lower increases in heart rate (p &<0.01), cardiac output (p &<0.01) and stroke volume (p &<0.02) when compared with their lean counterparts. This was independent of any differences in chemical or baseline hemodynamic characteristics at rest. The cohort exposed to isometric stress consisted of 57 patients (30 were lean, 27 were obese) with World Health Organization stage I or II essential hypertension. Obese subjects responded with exaggerated increases in systolic (p &<0.04) and diastolic (p &<0.01) pressures, and heart rate (p &<0.04) when compared with lean patients. Body mass index emerged as an independent determinant of the increase in systolic (r = 0.03) and diastolic (r = 0.01) pressure as well as of heart rate (r = 0.03). These results indicate that obese hypertensive patients respond to (1) mental stress with vasoconstriction instead of the expected vasodilation, and to (2) isometric stress with an exaggerated increase in arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
