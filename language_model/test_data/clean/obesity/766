To assess the benefit of sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate within a weight management program.

Prospective randomized controlled trial in a health maintenance organization.

Obese patients (n = 588) starting a weight management program were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to participate in the program alone or to participate in the program and receive sibutramine for 12 months. Outcome measures were change in weight, body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, serum lipids, serum glucose, and blood pressure.

At baseline, there was a younger age and higher weight, BMI, and waist circumference in the drug group. There was more degenerative joint disease in the nondrug group. The mean weight loss at 6 months was 6.8 kg (95% confidence interval [CI], -7.4 to -6.1 kg) in the drug group vs 3.1 kg (95% CI, -3.8 to -2.4 kg) (P &<.001) in the nondrug group. Weight loss was maintained at 12 months. Significant reductions in BMI, body fat, and waist circumference occurred in the drug group. There were no significant changes in laboratory values or blood pressure. Patients taking sibutramine experienced a significant increase in heart rate (1.7 beats/min [95% CI, 0.5-2.9 beats/min] vs -0.4 beats/min [95% CI, -1.5 to 0.8 beats/min]; P &<004).

In this managed care setting, the effectiveness and safety of sibutramine were similar to those observed in randomized, double-blind clinical efficacy trials.
