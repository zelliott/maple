The lipid profile of a Chinese population, which has a lower prevalence of coronary heart disease compared with Caucasians, is studied to determine whether lipid-modifying disease prevention programs are necessary. The study population consisted of 910 men (mean age 36.7 +/- 9.2 yrs) and 603 women (mean age 38.6 +/- 9.1 yrs), who were employees of a public utility company and non-medical staff of a district hospital. Indices of obesity, fasting cholesterol (TC), and its various subfraction, triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I), and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) concentrations were measured. Glucose tolerance was also estimated by measuring fasting and 2 h glucose after a 75 g oral glucose load. The lipid profile was similar to that of the North American population, with an overall prevalence of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)&> or = 4.1 mmol/L of 21% and 11% in men and women respectively. Similar variations with age, sex, smoking and glucose tolerance compared with Caucasian populations were observed. The high prevalence of subjects with "undesirable" lipid values in this Chinese population, which at present has a coronary artery disease prevalence of one-eighth to one-quarter compared with that in Caucasians, suggests that the incidence of the disease may well rise in the future to pose a similar problem to that in Caucasian populations. Cut off values of lipids conferring increased cardiovascular risks need to be determined in this population, so that public health strategies may be formulated.
