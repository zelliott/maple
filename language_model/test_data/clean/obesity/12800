A group of metabolic disorders including insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, visceral obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, hypercoagulability and microalbuminuria determine the risk for the development of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease and cerebral vascular disorders. Although available studies on the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome are equivocal, it is most frequently hypothesized that hereditary of insulin resistance leads to the remaining metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Despite pathogenetic controversies, there are convincing arguments for the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome and search for therapy improving insulin sensitivity and reducing hyperinsulinemia thus preventing the development of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.
