We studied changes of liver stiffness measured by SWE in animals with glutamate-induced obesity (GIO). We noted significant increase of LS on 63.6% compared to intact rats (P &<0.001). Histologically confirmed non-alcoholic steatosis diagnosed in 93.3% of animals with obesity. The AUROC of SWE for in animals with GIO was 0.983 (95% CI 0.955-0.999; P &<0.001). The optimal LS cutoff point for the prediction of steatosis were&> 6.25 kPa, with sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV 86.6; 100; 100 and 93.7% respectively.
