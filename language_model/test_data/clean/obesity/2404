Twenty obese patients were either given a caloric restricted diet (300 kcal/d) over 4 weeks alone or underwent an additional ergometer exercise programme for up to 2 hours daily. Combination therapy resulted in an improvement of physical performance by 26% despite weight loss of 11 kg. Blood pressure could be reduced both at rest and on exercise. Blood pressure regulation and heart rate under orthostatic conditions remained unchanged for both therapeutical approaches. The effect on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was also more favorable in patients on combination therapy than in those given a reduction diet alone. Combination of reduction diet and physical exercise is therefore superior to caloric restriction alone with regard to cardiovascular and metabolic considerations.
