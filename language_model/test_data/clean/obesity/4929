Obesity is an increasingly common disease, whose complex treatment often terminates with the patient's discontinuation of therapies. The authors suggest how to improve a multidisciplinary approach to the obese, to increase compliance with therapy. A characterization of obesity is a helpful initial step. It consists of an accurate anatomic definition of fat distribution, which can more accurately be performed by imaging (U/S, CT, MRI). The patient's obesity should also be identified based on the physical characteristics that we propose. The plastic surgeon's intervention is often required and beneficial in every type of obesity. Many body areas are appropriate for contouring. Apart from providing a gain in esthetic appearance, plastic surgery also results in several benefits for the patient's general health.
