Studies were carried out in 32 obese patients and 30 normal-weight control subjects to ascertain the response of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and insulin to (1) oral and intravenous glucose (10 obese and 10 control subjects), (2) oral fat and intravenous glucose (eight obese and six control subjects) and (3) mixed test meal (14 obese and 14 control subjects). Basal mean insulin was higher in the obese (99 pmol/l) than in the control group (40 pmol/l), but fasting blood glucose and GIP were not significantly different from normal. The total integrated response of insulin in obese subjects after oral glucose was 54.1 versus 33.3 nmol . l-1 . h-1 in control subjects; glucose and GIP responses were similar in both groups. After intravenous glucose the integrated insulin response was 8.8 in the obese versus 5.0 nmol . l-1 . h-1 in control subjects; GIP was unaffected by intravenous glucose and glucose levels were similar. Following oral fat and intravenous glucose, insulin secretion was again abnormal in the obese, 24.5 versus 7.3 nmol . l-1 . h-1 in controls, but GIP responses were normal. However, the control subjects became hypoglycaemic after this test: blood glucose 2.8 mmol/l at 150 min compared with 4.6 mmol/l in the obese group. The insulin response to a mixed meal was also abnormal in obesity.
