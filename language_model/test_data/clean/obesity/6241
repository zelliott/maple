The correlation of intraabdominal visceral fat accumulation and left ventricular performance was investigated in 37 obese patients who had 154 +/- 23% of ideal body weight. The left ventricle was studied noninvasively by means of echocardiography, whereas the distribution of body fat was determined by computed tomography. The end-diastolic left ventricular dimension and stroke volume were greater in obese patients than in non-obese control subjects. Not only the absolute values of these parameters, but also the diastolic left ventricular dimension index (calculated as end-diastolic dimension/cube root of body surface area) and stroke index were greater in obese patients. When the obese patients were divided into 2 groups according to the intraabdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area ratio (V/S) determined by computed tomography, the diastolic dimension index and the stroke index were significantly greater in visceral-type obesity (V/S greater than or equal to 0.4) than in subcutaneous-type obesity (V/S less than 0.4) (43.2 +/- 2.9 vs 40.3 +/- 3.1 mm/m2/3, p less than 0.01 and 49.3 +/- 6.1 vs 40.3 +/- 5.6 ml/m2, respectively). Multiple regression analysis with independent variables of age, body weight, duration of obesity and V/S ratio showed that diastolic dimension index and stroke index significantly correlated with the V/S ratio. Thus, the alteration of cardiac function in obese patients is attributable not only to excess body weight and duration of obesity but also to intraabdominal fat accumulation.
