To assess the distribution of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and C-reactive protein (CRP) according to the different definitions of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO).

A total of 881 obese (body mass index (BMI)&> or =30 kg/m2) subjects derived from the population-based CoLaus Study participated in this study. MHO was defined using six sets of criteria including different combinations of waist, blood pressure, total high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein -cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, homeostasis model, high-sensitivity CRP, and personal history of cardiovascular, respiratory or metabolic diseases. IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were assessed by multiplexed flow cytometric assay. CRP was assessed by immunoassay.

On bivariate analysis some, but not all, definitions of MHO led to significantly lower levels of IL-6, TNF-α and CRP compared with non-MH obese subjects. Most of these differences became nonsignificant after multivariate analysis. An posteriori analysis showed a statistical power between 9 and 79%, depending on the inflammatory biomarker and MHO definition considered. Further increasing sample size to overweight+obese individuals (BMI&> or =25 kg/m2, n=2917) showed metabolically healthy status to be significantly associated with lower levels of CRP, while no association was found for IL-1β. Significantly lower IL-6 and TNF-α levels were also found with some but not all MHO definitions, the differences in IL-6 becoming nonsignificant after adjusting for abdominal obesity or percent body fat.

MHO individuals present with decreased levels of CRP and, depending on MHO definition, also with decreased levels in IL-6 and TNF-α. Conversely, no association with IL-1β levels was found.
