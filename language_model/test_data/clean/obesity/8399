We reported the cases of 3 obese children who presented variously with costochondral beading, numbness of both hands and feet, and hypochromic-microcytic anemia. Serum ascorbic acid concentration, erythrocyte thiamin pyrophosphate effect, and serum hepcidin concentration were done to investigate these symptoms, respectively, with findings of ascorbic acid insufficiency, thiamin deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia from poor iron absorption due to a hyper-inflammatory state, respectively. This report indicated that obese children not only have energy excess but may also risk being micronutrient deficiencies; therefore, weight management with special attention to an adequate intake of vitamins and minerals should be provided.
