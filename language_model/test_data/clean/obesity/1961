Leptin is the product of OB gene. This 16 kDa protein is produced by mature adipocytes and is secreted in plasma. Its plasma levels are strongly correlated with adipose mass in rodents as well as in humans. Leptin inhibits food intake, reduces body weight and stimulates energy expenditure. It has been suggested that leptin could be the link between obesity and diabetes. Recent experiments in rodents have shown that leptin expression in adipocytes is also regulated at short-term by hormones and nutrients. Leptin expression increases after food intake and decreases during fasting and diabetes. Insulin and glucocorticoids increase leptin expression, whereas catecholamines, via beta-adrenergic receptors and cAMP, and long-chain fatty acids (and thiazolidinediones), via PPARy, inhibit leptin expression. Leptin is a cytokine that binds to transmembrane receptors similar to the receptors of cytokine family (type IL-6), and transmit their information inside the cell, after dimerisation. A short-form of leptin receptor (with a cytoplasmic domain of 34 amino residues) has been identified in the choroid plexus. This type of receptor should be used for leptin transport across the blood-brain barrier. Then leptin binds to a long-form of leptin receptor in the hypothalamus (with a cytoplasmic domain of 302 amino residues) and decreases the production of neuropeptide Y, a neuromediator of food intake. The long-form of leptin receptor, transmits its information via the Janus Kinases (JAK) who subsequently phosphorylate transcription factors of the STAT family. Intermediary forms of leptin receptor have been identified in other tissues: liver, heart, skeletal muscles, endocrine pancreas. The role of leptin receptors in these tissues remains obscure, but is of considerable interest. Recent studies have shown that leptin inhibits insulin secretion and have anti-insulin effects on liver and adipose tissue. If these effects are confirmed, leptin could play a role similar to TNF alpha and could participate in the insulin-resistance of obesity and type II diabetes.
