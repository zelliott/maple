The major causes of primary obesity include dietary errors (e.g. high-fat, high-energy diets) and low physical activity. Therefore, the aim of the present study was the quantitative evaluation of daily dietary allowances of students with overweight and obesity in the Medical Academy of Białystok. Questionnaire investigations were conducted in the years 1997-1999 and included 1050 students (701 women and 349 men). Basing on BMI overweight was revealed in 22 women (3.14%) and 82 men (23.5%). Obesity was found in only 2 women (0.3%) and 4 men (1.2%). The 24-hour dietary history of the preceding day was the method used for quantitative analysis. Low physical activity and low-energy food intake (below the recommended safe norm) were the characteristic features found in the majority of students with overweight or obesity. Their daily dietary allowances showed high protein content (above the safe norm in 75% of women and 87.2% of men) and low content of carbohydrates (below the safe norm in over 70% of those examined). Fat content above the safe norm was found in approximately 55% of men with overweight and obesity, the rest consumed low-fat foods. The incidence of overweight or obesity was higher in young men than women studying in the Medical Academy of Białystok. In some of them, this may be caused by a disturbed proportion in the consumption of the major food components (protein, fat, carbohydrates).
