The purpose of this report is to evaluate our experience with transvaginal application of a laparoscopic bipolar cutting forceps to assist vaginal hysterectomy in extremely obese women with endometrial cancer in whom obesity precluded LAVH/BSO and lymphadenectomy and vaginal obesity limited visualization and exposure.

We performed a retrospective review and identified 6 consecutive cases. No cases were excluded. A laparoscopic 33-cm Plasma Kinctic (PK) cutting forceps with a 5-mm diameter was applied transvaginally to coagulate and cut the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments, uterine vasculature, and ovarian ligaments. The uterus was delivered vaginally. Staging lymphadenectomy was not performed.

Median age was 51 years, median weight was 405 lbs, and median BMI was 66 kg/mÂ². Five of 6 cases were successfully performed vaginally (83%). Median operative time was 1 hour 10 minutes, median blood loss was 500 mL, and pain was only discomforting. All patients were discharged the day after surgery. There were no complications. At median follow-up of 1 year, all patients were alive with no evidence of disease.

It is our opinion that the transvaginal application of a laparoscopic bipolar cutting forceps can successfully assist vaginal hysterectomy in extremely obese endometrial cancer patients who cannot tolerate LAVH/BSO and lymphadenectomy and vaginal obesity limits visualization and exposure.
