Flow mediated vasodilation (FMD) evaluates the endothelium-dependent vasodilation, is a reliable marker of arterial endothelial dysfunction and is related to coronary artery disease. Visceral fat predicts an unfavorable cardiovascular and metabolic risk profile in humans and echocardiographic assessment of epicardial fat (EF) is a reliable marker of visceral adiposity. We measured the FMD and EF thickness in 77 subjects, 38 without idiopathic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (mean age 65.95 ± 16.29 years) and 39 with idiopathic DVT (mean age 65.49 ± 17.22 years). The purpose of this work is to investigate the presence of statistical association between FMD and DVT and between EF thickness and DVT. Furthermore, to account for possible atherosclerosis risk factor unbalances, comparison between FMD and DVT (and between EF and DVT) was assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model which included the following covariates: FMD, EF, age, sex, smoking and the presence of obesity. Subjects without DVT showed significant lower values of EF thickness (9.07 ± 1.89 mm vs 12.32 ± 1.73 mm, p=0.005) and borderline-significant greater values of FMD (9.01 ± 2.77 percent vs 7.47 ± 5.37 percent, p=0.058) as compared to those with DVT. In conclusion, the data presented indicate that subjects affected by spontaneous deep vein thrombosis may have an impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, a marker of arterial endothelial dysfunction related to coronary artery disease, and an increased epicardial adipose tissue, a marker of cardiometabolic risk.
