The aim of this study was to determine the validity of silhouettes in assessing genetic factors of obesity in school children aged 12-14.

290 primary school students aged 12-14 from Belgrade had undergone body height and weight measurements as well as answering questionnaires. Silhouette rating scales were used to assess the nutritional status of students (6-silhouette scale) and their parents (9-silhouette scale).

Significant differences in body mass index (BMI) were found among children whose parents had been rated "normal" and those rated "problematic". BMI status and gender significantly affected assessment of the nutritional status. An interaction between factors was found (F (1.230) = 7.017, p &<0.01). The majority of children from the normal BMI category (64.5%) selected silhouettes 3 and 4 to describe their current appearance. On the other hand, 70% of children with problematic BMI selected silhouettes 5 and 6. Girls generally selected significantly smaller silhouettes than boys. Girls within the problematic BMI category selected significantly bigger silhouettes for their mother's than the other children. Boys within the normal BMI category, selected significantly bigger silhouettes representing their father's body size.

According to the results, silhouette rating scales appear to be reliable in parallel assessment of the nutritional status of children and their parents. This subject can be further developed by acquiring data on parents' height and body mass.
