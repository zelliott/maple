This study examined in dietary obese and genetically obese rodents the effects of soy protein isolate (SPI) and its hydrolysate (SPI-H) on the rate of body-fat disappearance. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (4-16 wk old) and yellow KK mice (6-10 wk old) were made obese by feeding high-fat diets containing 30% fat. They were then fed energy-restricted, low-fat (5.0%), and high-protein (35% casein, SPI, or SPI-H) diets for 4 wk at 60% of the level of the energy intake of rodents on laboratory chow. The body-fat contents of rats and mice fed a high-fat diet were 27.3 and 33.6 g/100 g body weight, respectively, at the end of the obese period. For rats, the apparent absorbability of dietary energy and fat was significantly lower in the SPI and SPI-H groups than in the casein group, but vice-versa for nitrogen balance. Body-fat content in mice fed SPI and SPI-H diets was significantly lower than in those fed the casein diet. In rats, plasma total cholesterol level was lower with the SPI-H diet, and plasma glucose level was lower with the SPI and SPI-H diets than with the casein diet. These results indicate that SPI and SPI-H are suitable protein sources in energy-restricted diets for the treatment of obesity.
