A study to determine serum lipids and lipoproteins in 54 women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) who had varying body mass index (BMI) compared to the normal regular menstruating women was carried out. All patients had similar hormonal profiles of PCOD and differed from the control group. The significant observations were high level of triglyceride and low percentage of alpha lipoprotein in obese PCOD. The BMI was positively correlated with serum triglyceride level, beta and prebeta lipoproteins but inversely correlated with high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio and alpha lipoprotein. No significant correlation between lipids, lipoproteins and testosterone levels was observed. It appeared that the alteration of serum lipids and lipoproteins in PCOD is due to the effect of obesity.
