In a representative German population sample, the prevalence of eating disturbances was determined using the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire. Overall, 3,9% revealed eating disturbances. In particular, young women and obese persons had an increased likelihood of these disturbances, but men and older persons were concerned as well. Further research is warranted on eating disturbances across the life span, both sexes and weight status.
