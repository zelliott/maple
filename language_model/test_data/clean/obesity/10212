The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of GH on body weight, body composition and cardiovascular risk factors in android obese men. Forty non-diabetic subjects aged 20 to 50 years-old with android obesity (WHR&> 1) were divided in two groups, on a prospective randomized double-blind basis to receive treatment with GH (0.050 U/kg/day) or placebo for three months. Bioimpedance analysis, DEXA, indirect calorimetry and cardiovascular risk factors were done at the beginning and at the end of the study. Anthropometric measurements were evaluated monthly. Body weight was reduced (3.5 +/- 2.9 kg), as well as BMI (1.2 +/- 1.0 kg/m2), WHR (0.04 +/- 0.01) and fat mass (2.4 +/- 1.0 kg), total cholesterol (4.0 +/- 3.3 mg/dL) and LDL-cholesterol (5.7 +/- 2.7 mg/dL) in GH-treated patients. Percentual changes were statistically different from placebo. Benefits and risks of long-term GH use in obese patients are still largely unknown.
