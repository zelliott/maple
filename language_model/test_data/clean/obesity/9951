Obesity is a major Public Health problem in developed countries. It is frequently associated with psychological difficulties that may interfere with treatment.

22 obese female adolescents, aged 13 to 19 years, and 24 age-matched female controls, were compared with regard to emotional pathology (anxiety, depression), eating behaviors, self-esteem, body image and parental history of depression. The evaluation was both categorical (DSM III-R criteria) and dimensional for depression and anxiety. It also included a self-esteem scale and questionnaires.

The obese adolescents had more depressive symptoms, more prevalent anxiety disorders, more frequent histories of parental depression, eating behaviors characterized by over-eating and/or restricted intake, lower self-esteem and dissatisfaction with their body image, leading to avoidance behaviors in some of them.

Psychological manifestations, although they are still insufficiently documented, especially in adolescents, may aggravate obesity and interfere with treatment.
