We examined mechanisms leading to the impairment of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-dependent vasorelaxation in response to acutely administered leptin in rats with the metabolic syndrome.

Effects of leptin on blood pressure and NO and cGMP in the aortic wall were studied in four groups of rats: (1) lean control, (2) obese, fed "cafeteria diet" for 3months (hyperleptinemia and hyperinsulinemia), (3) hyperleptinemia induced by administration of exogenous leptin for 8days, and (4) fructose-fed, receiving 20% fructose in the drinking water for 8weeks (hyperinsulinemia with slightly elevated leptin).

Stimulatory effect of leptin on NO and cGMP production in the aortic wall was impaired in obese and hyperleptinemic groups but not in the fructose group. In contrast, EDHF-mimetic effect of leptin was impaired in obese and fructose-fed but not in the hyperleptinemic group. Leptin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in the aortic wall, and this effect was impaired in obese and fructose-fed animals. The EDHF-mimetic effect of leptin was abolished by phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, whereas its effect on NO was not. In addition, IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser(307) and Ser(612) was enhanced in obese and fructose-fed but not in hyperleptinemic rats.

These results indicate that: (1) long-term hyperleptinemia induces resistance to acute vascular NO-mimetic effect of leptin in obesity/metabolic syndrome, (2) leptin stimulates EDHF in IRS-1 and PI3K-dependent manner, and this effect is impaired in obesity due to excessive serine phosphorylation of IRS-1.
