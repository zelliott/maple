Obesity is epidemic in the United States, affecting 61% of adults and 14% of children. Today's health care providers should recognize obesity as a chronic disease and offer up-to-date information and management. Treatment options currently available are diet and behavior modification, medications, and surgical procedures. Implications for clinical practice include recognition of the problems associated with obesity, education of current patients as well as young women who may become patients, and appropriate diagnosis and management or referral.
