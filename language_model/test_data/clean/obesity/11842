Recently, the concept has emerged that persistent low-grade activation of proinflammatory pathways in vascular tissues promotes the progression of atherosclerosis and increases the cardiovascular events. Obesity and related metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death. A major manifestation of obesity-related metabolic diseases in the early phase is systemic low-grade inflammation, suggesting that identification of molecular mechanisms underlying low-grade inflammation could provide clues for development of effective preventive and therapeutic approaches to cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we focus on the roles of Angptl2 in inflammation, and discuss the possibility that Angptl2 could function as a molecular target for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
