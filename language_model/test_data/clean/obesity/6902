The Authors studied the effectiveness and safety of a commercial hypocaloric diet on 11 obese postmenopausal women. During the experimental period 1 meal/day has been replaced with a chemically defined low calories product. Different parameters have been evaluated to assess the nutritional status 1), anthropometric: weight, skinfold thickness, arm muscle circumference; 2) biochemical total plasma proteins, transferrin, vitamins A, E, C, B12, folic acid; plasma iron, hemoglobin, MCV, RBC; 3) immune status (T lymphocytes and immunoglobulins). Moreover blood sugar, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as blood pressure have been taken into account. All the possible side effects and the diet acceptance for all the patients have been scored. After 1 month all the abnormal conditions (weight, cholesterol, blood pressure) improved, while the nutritional status and immune response remained at an optimal level.
