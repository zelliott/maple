The efficacy and safety of treatment with troglitazone combined with an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, in obese type 2 diabetic patients who were previously administered alpha-glucosidase inhibitors alone, in improving glycaemic control and reducing insulin resistance were studied. Obese type 2 diabetic patients, poorly controlled with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, were randomized to receive either oral troglitazone 200 mg twice daily (22 patients: group A) or a placebo (20 patients: group B) in addition to their usual alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. In group A, significant decreases in the mean levels of haemoglobin A1c and basal plasma insulin levels were observed 6 months after the start of combined therapy. Serum triglyceride levels significantly decreased but serum lactic acid dehydrogenase and body weight significantly increased. New systemic oedema was observed in six patients. Combined therapy with troglitazone and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors may be effective for diabetic metabolic abnormalities, although the potential development of adverse effects such as body-weight gain and systemic oedema demands vigilance.
