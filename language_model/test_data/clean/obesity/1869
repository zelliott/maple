1. A missense mutation (Trp64Arg) in the beta 3-adrenoceptor (beta 3-AR) gene has been associated with weight gain, insulin resistance and earlier-onset non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), but the strength of these associations varies considerably between populations and the functional significance of Trp64Arg remains unclear. 2. The Trp64Arg mutation was investigated in obese NIDDM (n = 50) and obese non-diabetic (n = 53) subjects by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA and digestion of the 210 bp product by BstOI. The Arg allele was found in 22.3% of all subjects, but there were no homozygotes for the mutation. Non-diabetic subjects heterozygous for the mutation were more obese and Trp/Arg diabetics had a slightly younger age of onset of NIDDM (47 vs 51 years, respectively), but there were no significant differences in mutation frequency between the two groups. Metabolic parameters (e.g. fasting lipids and glycaemic control) were similar among diabetic subjects with and without the Trp64Arg mutation. 3. In conclusion, the frequency of the Trp64Arg mutation of the beta 3-AR was higher in this obese population compared with some previous studies, but there was no evidence that Trp64Arg confers an increased susceptibility to NIDDM among obese insulin-resistant subjects or that diabetics with the mutation fare worse in terms of lipid or glucose metabolism.
