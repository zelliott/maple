To determine if differences in the GH-IGF-I axis exist between children of high and low aerobic fitness who are obese or of normal weight.

124 children (ages 8-11) divided into four groups based on BMI and VO₂max (mL O₂/kg fat free mass(FFM)/min): normal weight--high-fit (NH), normal weight--low-fit (NL), obese--high-fit (OH), and obese--low-fit (OL). Height, weight, skinfolds, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage and predicted VO₂max (both ml/kg/min and ml/kg(FFM)/min) were assessed. Resting growth hormone (GH), total insulin-like growth factor 1 (total IGF-I), free insulin-like growth factor 1(free IGF-I), and insulin were measured using morning fasting blood samples.

GH was greater in the NH group compared to the OL group only (p&<.01). No group differences existed for either total IGF-I (p=0.53) or free IGF-I (p=0.189). Insulin was greater in the OH and OL groups than the NH and NL groups (p&<.01). With groups combined (or overall), insulin and free IGF-I were related to fitness (insulin--ml/kg/min: r=-0.226, p&<.05 and ml/kg(FFM)/min: r=-0.212, p&<.05; free IGF-I--ml/kg/min: r=-0.219, p&<.01 and ml/kg(FFM)/min: r=-0.272, p&<.05).

Fitness may contribute to the obesity related reduction of GH that may be involved with weight gain.
