An important national goal in Healthy People 2010 is to reduce the high prevalence of sedentary lifestyles and resultant overweight and obesity among girls.

The purpose of the present study was threefold: (a) to determine if pre-exercise self-efficacy predicted girls' perceptions of exertion during exercise, (b) to determine if these perceptions, in turn, influenced postexercise self-efficacy, and (c) to assess if exercise self-efficacy increased following completion of an exercise task.

A sample of 103 girls, 8 to 17 years of age, pedaled 20 minutes on a cycle ergometer at 60% of their predetermined peak VO2 in a climatic chamber (90 degrees F, 50% relative humidity). Ratings of perceived exertion were obtained every 4 minutes. Exercise self-efficacy was assessed before and after the exercise session.

Controlling for peak VO2 and percent body fat, pre-exercise efficacy exerted an independent effect on perception of exertion during exercise with girls high on pre-exercise self-efficacy reporting lower perceived exertion during exercise, than girls low on self-efficacy. Both pre-exercise efficacy and perceived exertion explained postexercise efficacy. Exercise self-efficacy increased significantly from pre- to postexercise.

Pre-exercise efficacy is an important factor influencing girls' perceptions of exertion during exercise and their postexercise efficacy. Increased exercise self-efficacy of girls following successful completion of an exercise challenge suggests possible strategies to increase physical activity.
