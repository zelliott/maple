In hypertensive patients with concomitant obesity observed decrease in activity of dopaminergic system in conjunction with increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Identified changes point to the advisability of appointing this group of patients the dopamine receptor agonist - bromocriptine-KV and antagonist of aldosterone - veroshpiron. As a result of treatment was an increase in dopamine levels in the urine, a decrease of aldosterone in the blood, normalization of the daily blood pressure monitoring.
