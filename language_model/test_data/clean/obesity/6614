The interplay between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and obesity represents the convergence of two of the most common contemporary clinical issues, and is of particular interest and significance in the context of the burden presented by each at present, and the dismal projections associated with both of these conditions for the future. That obesity leads to CKD through its association with other risks, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis, is well established; however, it is likely that obesity itself is an independent risk factor for the development of CKD. The aetiology of this obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG) is not clear, but it appears to be strongly influenced by chronic inflammation, manifest as a disturbance of the balance between pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators, adipokines and mononuclear cells. This review examines the association between obesity and CKD, the role of inflammation therein, and the potential for pro-resolving lipid mediators to restore homoeostasis and offer therapeutic potential in ORG.
