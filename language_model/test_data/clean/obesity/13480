Although circulating adiponectin has been inversely correlated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and serum glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in humans, contradictory reports on that subject exist. In this study, serum concentrations of adiponectin in obese non-diabetic and diabetic humans were measured to examine whether they were associated with levels of HbA1c. The WHO definitions of obesity and diabetes were used. One hundred and five obese euglycemic subjects and 49 obese diabetics (aged 51+/-6.9, and 52+/-6.7 years, respectively) were studied. Their BMI, HbA1c and % of body fat were measured. Adiponectin was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although the serum adiponectin concentrations differed between diabetics and non-diabetics ( P&<.01), they were not correlated with HbA1c (r=-0.0814; P=0.5823, and r=-0.1861; P=0.1099, for diabetics and non-diabetics, respectively). Both diabetics and non-diabetics were segregated into tertiles according to their HbA1c levels. Plasma adiponectin did not differ significantly between the high (H), intermediate (I), and low (L) HbA1c tertiles.

Concentrations of adiponectin were not correlated with levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in the diabetic and non-diabetic subjects examined.
