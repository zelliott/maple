In the adiponectin gene polymorphisms, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-45 and SNP276 have reportedly been associated with obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and other features of metabolic syndrome.

Whether these adiponectin SNP affect obesity-related parameters during caloric restriction in obese subjects.

Thirty- two obese Japanese women were treated by meal replacement with a low calorie diet for 8 weeks and asked to maintain their habitual lifestyle. Obesity-related parameters were measured before and after the treatment period. We determined four SNP (T45G, I164T, G276T, and C-11377G) using a fluorescent allele-specific DNA primer assay systemand FRET probe assay system.

After the treatment, the extent of decrease in waist circumference was greater in the subjects with the G/G or G/T genotype of SNP276 than in those with the T/T genotype (p=0.026). As for SNP45, the extent of decrease in triglyceride levels was greater in the subjects with the T/T genotype than in those with the T/G genotype (p=0.003). For SNP-11377, the extent of decrease in systolic blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose was greater in the subjects with the C/G or G/G genotype than in those with the C/C genotype (p=0.044).

Our findings indicate that each SNP in the adiponectin gene might modify the change in obesity-related parameters during meal replacement with a low calorie diet.
