To verify the influence of visceral and subcutaneous fat, as well adipokines in bone mineral density (BMD) in obese adolescents.

The study involved 125 postpubertal obese adolescents (45 boys and 80 girls). Anthropometric measurements, body composition, visceral and subcutaneous fat, and BMD were determined. Leptin, adiponectin, and insulin levels also analyzed.

Data demonstrated a negative relationship between BMD with insulin resistance, visceral fat and leptin concentration; and bone mineral content with visceral/subcutaneous ratio. Positive association between BMD and subcutaneous fat was observed.

Visceral fat and insulin resistance, as well as visceral/subcutaneous ratio and leptin concentration, were negative predictors of BMD in boys and girls, respectively. However, subcutaneous fat had a protective influence in BMD only in boys.
