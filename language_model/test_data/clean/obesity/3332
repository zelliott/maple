A new "active" system of monitoring and dietary education was experimented in a group of 20 obese adolescents waiting to start diet therapy. Each subject was requested to record all food and drink consumed during two separate periods, each lasting 7 days, at a distance of 15 days from each other, at home using an optic reader and book of bar codes. On the basis of answers to a questionnaire which was completed at the beginning and end of the study, aimed at assessing the level of knowledge of basic food hygiene, the majority of participants considered the experience useful and amusing and were willing to repeat it; in addition, a greater knowledge of nutritional principles and of the rations consumed was shown at the end of the study. The results of the study were analysed using the Food Meter-Miles computerised system and showed daily calorie intakes of 1514 +/- 524.0, M +/- DS (protein 18.3 +/- 5.1%, lipids 33.7 +/- 6.2%, glucose 47.9 +/- 8.6%, total fibre 14.4 +/- 4.6 g) in female subjects, and 2096.1 +/- 80.8 (protein 16.1 +/- 3.6%, lipids 38.2 +/- 2.9%, glucose 45.7 +/- 3.9%, total fibre 18.1 +/- 2.0 g) in male subjects. The number of foods chosen was very low considering the range of foods available (277) and the length of time studied: 35.7 +/- 11.8 and 35.0 +/- 6.0 respectively for female and male subjects. With regard to the number and type of meals eaten, a high number of snacks was observed which supplemented or replaced main meals.
