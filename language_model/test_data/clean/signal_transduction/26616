Integrins are ubiquitously expressed major cell surface receptors for extracellular matrix. Integrin interaction with their extracellular ligands triggers activation of the intracellular signaling pathways that control cell shape, motility, proliferation, survival, cell-type-specific gene expression. In this review, we summarize recent studies analyzing contribution of integrins to the control of the mammary morphogenesis and differentiation, function and maintenance of mammary stem and progenitor cells and resume the data from mouse models revealing the contribution of the integrin-mediated signaling to mammary tumorigenesis.
