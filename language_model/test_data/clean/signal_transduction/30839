The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum diverged from the line leading to animals shortly after the separation of plants and animals but it retained characteristics of both kingdoms. A GABA(B)-like receptor and a peptide, SDF-2, with homologs found only in animals, control sporulation, while cytokinins, which act as hormones in plants, keep spores dormant. When SDF-2 binds its receptor DhkA, it reduces the activity of the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA such that cAMP levels can increase. It has been proposed that the cytokinin discadenine also produces in an increase in cAMP but acts through a different histidine kinase, DhkB. We have found that discadenine and its precursor, isopentenyl adenine, not only maintain spore dormancy but also initiate rapid encapsulation independently of the SDF-2 signal transduction pathway. DhkB and the adenylyl cyclase of late development, AcrA, are members of two component signal transduction families and both are required to transduce the cytokinin signal. As expected, strains lacking the isopentenyl-transferase enzyme chiefly responsible for cytokinin synthesis are defective in sporulation. It appears that SDF-2 and cytokinins are secreted during late development to trigger signal transduction pathways that lead to an increase in the activity of the camp-dependent protein kinase, PKA, which triggers rapid encapsulation as well as ensuring spore dormancy.
