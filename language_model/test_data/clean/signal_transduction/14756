The intracellular signaling pathways responsible for extracellualr uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTPo)-induced chloride (Cl-) currents (I(Cl.UTP)) were studied in mouse ventricular myocytes with the whole-cell clamp technique. UTPo (0.1 to 100 microM) activated a whole-cell current that showed a time-independent activation, a linear current-voltage relationship in symmetrical Cl- solutions, an anion selectivity of Cl- > iodide > aspartate, and an inhibition by a thiazolidinone-derived specific inhibitor (CFTR(inh)-172, 10 microM) of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), but not by a disulfonic stilbene derivative (DIDS, 100 microM), these properties matching those of CFTR Cl- channels. The potency order of nucleotides for an activation of the Cl- current was UTP = ATP > uridine-5'-diphosphate (UDP) = ADP. Suramin (100 microM), a P2Y receptor antagonist, strongly inhibited the UTPo -activation of the Cl- current, whereas pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS, 100 microM), another P2Y receptor antagonist, induced little inhibition of I(Cl.UTP). The activation of I(Cl.UTP) was sensitive to protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, intracellular GDPbetaS (nonhydrolyzable GDP analogue) or anti-Gq/11 antibody. UTPo failed to activate the Cl- current when the cells were dialyzed with nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues (ATPS or AMP-PNP) without ATP, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is a prerequisite for the current activation. I(Cl.UTP) was persistently activated with a mixture of ATPgammaS + ATP in the pipette, suggesting the involvement of phosphorylation reaction in the current activation process. Our results strongly suggest that I(Cl.UTP) is due to the activation of CFTR Cl- channels through Gq/11-coupled P2Y2 receptor-PLC-PKC signaling and ATP hydrolysis in mouse heart.
