The lymphocyte-specific kinase (Lck), a member of the Src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, is expressed in T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Genetic evidence, including knockout mice and human mutations, demonstrates that Lck kinase activity is critical for normal T cell development, activation, and signaling. Selective inhibition of Lck is expected to offer a new therapy for the treatment of T-cell-mediated autoimmune and inflammatory disease. With the aid of X-ray structure-based analysis, aminopyrimidine amides 2 and 3 were designed from aminoquinazolines 1, which had previously been demonstrated to exhibit potent inhibition of Lck and T cell proliferation. In this report, we describe the synthesis and structure-activity relationships of a series of novel aminopyrimidine amides 3 possessing improved cellular potency and selectivity profiles relative to their aminoquinazoline predecessors 1. Orally bioavailable compound 13b inhibited the anti-CD3-induced production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in mice in a dose-dependent manner (ED 50 = 9.4 mg/kg).
