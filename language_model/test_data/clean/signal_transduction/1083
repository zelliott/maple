Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms play a major role in stimulating the replication, survival, and migration of myofibroblasts during the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases. During fibrogenesis, PDGF is secreted by a variety of cell types as a response to injury, and many pro-inflammatory cytokines mediate their mitogenic effects via the autocrine release of PDGF. PDGF action is determined by the relative expression of PDGF alpha-receptors (PDGFRalpha) and beta-receptors (PDGFRbeta) on the surface of myofibroblasts. These receptors are induced during fibrogenesis, thereby amplifying biological responses to PDGF isoforms. PDGF action is also modulated by extracellular binding proteins and matrix molecules. This review summarizes the literature on the role of PDGF and its receptors in the development of fibrosis in a variety of organ systems, including lung, liver, kidney, and skin.
