Cells from innate immune system are activated by the engagement of germ-line encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) in response to the microbial insult. These receptors are able to recognize either the presence of highly conserved microbial components called pathogen-associated molecular patterns or endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns. These danger signals are recognized by different types of (PRRs), including the receptor for advanced glycation end products. This new PRR share both ligands and intracellular signaling with Toll-like receptors and thus may cooperate with each other as essential partners to strength inflammatory response. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the promiscuity of this receptor as well as its role in the context of innate immunity by triggering an inflammatory response when innate immune cells detect infection or tissue injury.
