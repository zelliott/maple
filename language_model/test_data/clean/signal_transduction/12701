Shigella flexneri and other invasive bacteria rupture the phagosome membrane and escape to the host cytoplasm. Now, Dupont et al. address the fate and signaling functions of pathogen vacuole remnants and show that these membrane fragments trigger host-cell-signaling responses, including polyubiquitination, autophagy, and pyroptosis.
