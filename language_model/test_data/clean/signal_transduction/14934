The effects of monocarboxylic acid-derived Cl(-) channel blockers on cardiac depolarization-activated K(+) currents were investigated. Membrane currents in rat ventricular myocytes were recorded using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. 5-Nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB) and niflumic acid (NFA) induced an outward current at 0 mV. Both NPPB and NFA failed to induce any current when used intracellularly or after K(+) in the bath and pipette solutions was replaced by equimolar Cs(+). Voltage pulse protocols revealed that NPPB and NFA enhanced the steady-state K(+) current but inhibited the transient outward K(+) current. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor, inhibited NPPB- and NFA-induced outward current. Another PTK inhibitor, lavendustin A, produced a comparable effect. In contrast, the inactive analogue of genistein, daidzein, was ineffective. Orthovanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, markedly slowed the deactivation of the outward current induced by NPPB and NFA. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 inhibited NPPB-induced outward current at 0 mV. In contrast, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor H-7 was without significant effect on the action of NPPB. Pretreatment of the myocytes with genistein or H-89 prevented the enhancing effect of NPPB. Increasing intracellular Cl(-) from 22 to 132 mm slightly reduced NPPB-induced outward current at 0 mV. These results demonstrate that the monocarboxylic acid-derived Cl(-) channel blockers NPPB and NFA enhance cardiac steady-state K(+) current, and suggest that the enhancing effect of the Cl(-) channel blockers is mediated by stimulation of PKA and PTK signalling pathways.
