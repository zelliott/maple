Bile acids are increasingly being appreciated as complex metabolic integrators and signalling factors and not just as lipid solubilizers and simple regulators of bile-acid homeostasis. It is therefore not surprising that a number of bile-acid-activated signalling pathways have become attractive therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders. Here, we review how the signalling functions of bile acids can be exploited in the development of drugs for obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertriglyceridaemia and atherosclerosis, as well as other associated chronic diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
