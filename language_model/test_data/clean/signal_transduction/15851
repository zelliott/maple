Among plant-microbe interactions, root nodule symbiosis is one of the most important beneficial interactions providing legume plants with nitrogenous compounds. Over the past years a number of genes required for root nodule symbiosis has been identified but most recently great advances have been made to dissect signalling pathways and molecular interactions triggered by a set of receptor-like kinases. Genetic and biochemical approaches have not only provided evidence for the cross talk between bacterial infection of the host plant and organogenesis of a root nodule but also gained insights into dynamic regulation processes underlying successful infection events. Here, we summarise recent progress in the understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate and trigger cellular signalling cascades during this mutualistic interaction.
