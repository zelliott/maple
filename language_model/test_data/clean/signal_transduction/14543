A new pathway of testosterone (T) action in Sertoli cells was recently identified that may be required to support spermatozoa production (spermatogenesis) and fertility. Specifically, T acts via the androgen receptor (AR) to rapidly activate the MAPK cascade and the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor in Sertoli cells. In further characterizing the signaling pathway that transduces T actions, we now find that a population of AR is localized to the plasma membrane and that AR associates with Src kinase after T stimulation. In addition, we demonstrate that Src kinase is activated by T and that Src kinase activity is required for stimulation of the ERK MAPK and CREB. Furthermore, we determine that activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor downstream of Src contributes to the activation of the MAPK cascade and CREB. The elucidation of this nonclassical pathway of T action in the testis may provide new targets for the control of male fertility.
