Tissue factor is a cellular receptor for plasma clotting factor VII. In health, tissue factor is constitutively expressed in many cells, such as fibroblasts and keratinocytes, but is absent in vascular cells that come in contact with blood. However, tissue factor is induced in vascular cells in certain pathophysiological conditions. Thus, vessel wall injury or a disease condition allows blood to come in contact with tissue factor, resulting in factor VII binding to tissue factor. Once native factor VII complexed with tissue factor is converted to the enzyme factor VIIa, the complex triggers the clotting cascade that ultimately leads to fibrin formation. In addition to its established role in coagulation, molecular links between factor VIIa/tissue factor and various biological processes, such as development, inflammation, and tumor metastasis, are also evident. Recent studies suggest that factor VIIa/tissue factor affects various cellular processes by inducing intracellular signaling. Emerging evidence suggest that factor VIIa/tissue factor participates in cell signaling by two distinct mechanisms: proteolysis-independent signaling via the cytoplasmic domain of tissue factor, and proteolysis-dependent signaling, which is independent of tissue factor's cytoplasmic tail. In proteolysis-independent signaling, filamin 1 is recruited to tissue factor upon its ligation, and this probably provides an essential intracellular link in transmitting signals from tissue factor. In proteolysis-dependent signaling, factor VIIa/tissue factor activates one or more protease-activated receptors, which couple to G proteins, to impact multiple signaling pathways. In this chapter, we review various nonhemostatic functions attributed to factor VIIa and tissue factor, describe signaling mechanisms initiated upon factor VIIa binding to tissue factor, and discuss how factor VIIa/tissue factor-induced signaling could contribute to various pathophysiological processes. The relationship between increased clotting and manifestation of various diseases is well recognized. Although aberrant activation of the coagulation pathway is primarily the consequence of a disease, activation of the coagulation pathway during the disease process, in turn, could contribute to pathogenesis of the disease. Further, recent transgenic studies in mouse suggest that the coagulation system also plays a role in embryogenesis and development. Then the question arises, how do proteins involved in the clotting regulate cellular functions? The coagulant proteases can regulate cell behavior in a number of ways. They can function like hormones, activating multiple signaling pathways, as well as release bioactive fragments and growth factors by proteolysis of cell-surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. This chapter reviews our current understanding of the role of factor VIIa/tissue factor (VIIa/TF), an enzyme/cofactor complex that triggers the clotting cascade, in affecting various cellular functions not related to the clotting, and discusses potential mechanisms by which it regulates cellular functions.
