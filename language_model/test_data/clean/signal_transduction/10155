The presence of inositol phospholipids in the nuclei of mammalian cells has by now been well established, as has the presence of the enzymes responsible for their metabolism. However, our understanding of the role of these nuclear phosphoinositides in regulating cellular events has lagged far behind that for its cytosolic counterpart. It is clear, though, that the nuclear phosphoinositide pool is independent of the cytosolic pool and is, therefore, likely to be regulating a unique set of cellular events. As with its cytosolic phosphoinositides, many nuclear phosphoinositides and their metabolic enzymes are located at distinct sub-cellular structures. This arrangement spatially limits the production and activity of inositol phospholipids and is believed to be a major mechanism for regulating their function. Here, we will introduce the components of nuclear inositol phospholipid signal transduction and discuss how their spatial arrangement may dictate which nuclear functions they are modulating.
