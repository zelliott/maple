Current treatments for stroke, such as the use of thrombolytic agents, are often limited by a narrow therapeutic time window. However, the regeneration of the brain after damage is still active days even weeks after stroke occurs, which might provide a second window for treatment. Cell-based therapy can be categorized into two strategies. One is transplantation of exogenous cells into the injured brain to replace the lost cells or support the remaining cells. The other strategy is to enhance the proliferation, differentiation, migration of endogenous stem or progenitor cells. Recent development in adult stem cell research and advancement in the induction of pluripotent stem cells from somatic adult cells provide a tremendous opportunity for transplantation therapy. Understanding the mechanisms and regulations involved in the endogenous neurogenesis will also help develop novel therapeutic interventions to promote neurogenesis and functional recovery in stroke. This review describes up-to-date progresses in cell-based therapy for the treatment of stroke.
