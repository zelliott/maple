The nervous system encodes information relating chemical stimuli to taste perception, beginning with transduction mechanisms at the receptor and ending in the representation of stimulus attributes by the activity of neurons in the brain. Recent studies have rekindled the long-standing debate about whether taste information is coded by the pattern of activity across afferent neurons or by specifically tuned 'labeled lines'. Taste neurons are broadly tuned to stimuli representing different qualities and are also responsive to stimulus intensity and often to touch and temperature. Their responsiveness is also modulated by a number of physiological factors. In addition to representing stimulus quality and intensity, activity in taste neurons must code information about the hedonic value of gustatory stimuli. These considerations suggest that individual gustatory neurons contribute to the coding of more than one stimulus parameter, making the response of any one cell meaningful only in the context of the activity of its neighbors.
