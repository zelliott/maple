Beneficial soil-borne microorganisms, such as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and mycorrhizal fungi, can improve plant performance by inducing systemic defense responses that confer broad-spectrum resistance to plant pathogens and even insect herbivores. Different beneficial microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) are recognized by the plant, which results in a mild, but effective activation of the plant immune responses in systemic tissues. Evidence is accumulating that systemic resistance induced by different beneficials is regulated by similar jasmonate-dependent and ethylene-dependent signaling pathways and is associated with priming for enhanced defense.
