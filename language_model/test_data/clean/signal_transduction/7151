The aim of the present study was to analyze whether angiotensin II via the endocannabinoid system can induce gastric mucosal protection, since transactivation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors by angiotensin AT1 receptor in CHO cells was described. Experimental ulcer was induced by acidified ethanol given orally in male Wistar rats, CB1(+/+) wild type and CB1(-/-) knockout mice. The compounds were administered intracerebroventricularly. It was found, that 1. Angiotensin II inhibited the ethanol-induced gastric lesions (11.9-191pmol); the effect of angiotensin II (191pmol) was inhibited by the CB1 receptor inverse agonist AM 251 (1.8nmol) and the inhibitor of diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL), tetrahydrolipstatin (0.2nmol). 2. Angiotensin II exerted gastroprotection in wild type, but not in CB1(-/-) mice. 3. The gastroprotective effect of angiotensin II (191pmol) was reduced by atropine (1mg/kg i.v.) and bilateral cervical vagotomy. In conclusion, stimulation of central angiotensin AT1 receptors via activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors induces gastroprotection in a DAGL-dependent and vagus-mediated mechanism.
