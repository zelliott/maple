Calcium regulates the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes both in vivo and in vitro. Elevated extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) raises the intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) and activates differentiation-related genes. Cells lacking the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) fail to respond to [Ca2+]o and to differentiate, indicating a role for CaR in keratinocyte differentiation. These concepts derived from in vitro experiments have been tested and confirmed in two mouse models.
