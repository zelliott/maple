4,5-Diaminofluorescein, a fluorescence indicator for NO, was applied to detect the release of NO from plant cells. NO production was increased within 3 min when plant cell cultures (Arabidopsis, parsley, and tobacco) were treated by cytokinin and was dose-dependent and signal-specific in that other plant hormones and inactive cytokinin analog were not effective in stimulating of NO release. The response was quenched by addition of 2-(aminoethyl)-2-thiopseudourea, an inhibitor of the animal NO synthase, and by addition of an NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-1-oxy-3-oxide. These results imply that NO may act in cytokinin signal transduction.
