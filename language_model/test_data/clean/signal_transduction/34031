The transcription factor Forkhead box L subfamily member 2 (FOXL2) is involved in craniofacial development and ovarian function. Using 2-DE and immunoblotting, we show that it is highly modified post-translationally. The most outstanding feature of its migration profile is the presence of two distinct modification "trains" and the absence of intermediates. A theoretical analysis of the modification profile of FOXL2 suggests that it undergoes parallel processive/concerted modifications. The absence of intermediates is compatible with the recruitment of poorly modified FOXL2 into a post-translational "modification factory."
