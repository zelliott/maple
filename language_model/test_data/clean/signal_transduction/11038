Protein kinase C (PKC) has been proposed to regulate major egg activation events during mammalian fertilization. Most of the evidence supporting this assumption has first been obtained using pharmacological activation and inhibition of the kinase, while egg activation was assessed by checking for exocytosis of the cortical granules, extrusion of the second polar body and formation of pronuclei. However, results have been inconclusive and sometimes contradictory regarding the exact role of PKC in regulating egg activation events. The PKC family is composed of various isotypes, which differ in their modular structures and regulatory properties. Hence the need to re-examine the roles of egg PKCs more specifically. Mammalian eggs express many PKC isotypes, the roles of which have been investigated using immunodetection, isotype-specific inhibition and, more recently, live imaging of fluorescent chimaeras. Here, I review the recent development of PKC research in mammalian fertilization and the evidence for a specific role for certain PKC isotypes in fertilization-induced egg activation.
