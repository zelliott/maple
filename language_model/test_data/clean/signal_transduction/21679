Phosphatidic acid (PA) has emerged as a new class of lipid mediators involved in diverse cellular functions in plants, animals, and microorganisms. Considerable progress has been made recently on the production, cellular function, and mode of action of PA in the cell. The cellular levels of PA undergo dynamic changes in response to developmental and environmental stimuli. The production of signaling PA is mediated by families of multiple enzymes that regulate the timing, location, amount, and molecular species of PA. A number of PA target proteins have been identified, which include proteins involved in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins and lipids, as well as in G protein regulation, vesicular trafficking, and metabolism. PA mediates cellular functions through different modes of action, such as membrane tethering, modulation of enzymatic activities, and/or structural effects on cell membranes. The regulatory processes in which PA has been implicated include signaling pathways in cell growth, proliferation, reproduction, and responses to hormones and biotic and abiotic stresses.
