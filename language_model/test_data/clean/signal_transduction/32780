Recent studies have documented direct interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and key molecules in signal transduction pathways like Ras, Cbl, and protein kinases. In T cells, the 14-3-3tau isoform has been shown to associate with protein kinase C theta and to negatively regulate interleukin-2 secretion. Here we present data that 14-3-3tau interacts with protein kinase C mu (PKCmu), a subtype that differs from other PKC members in structure and activation mechanisms. Specific interaction of PKCmu and 14-3-3tau can be shown in the T cell line Jurkat by immunocoprecipitiation and by pulldown assays of either endogenous or overexpressed proteins using PKCmu-specific antibodies and GST-14-3-3 fusion proteins, respectively. Using PKCmu deletion mutants, the 14-3-3tau binding region is mapped within the regulatory C1 domain. Binding of 14-3-3tau to PKCmu is significantly enhanced upon phorbol ester stimulation of PKCmu kinase activity in Jurkat cells and occurs via a Cbl-like serine containing consensus motif. However, 14-3-3tau is not a substrate of PKCmu. In contrast 14-3-3tau strongly down-regulates PKCmu kinase activity in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of 14-3-3tau significantly reduced phorbol ester induced activation of PKCmu kinase activity in intact cells. We therefore conclude that 14-3-3tau is a negative regulator of PKCmu in T cells.
