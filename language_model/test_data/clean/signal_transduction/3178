Dendritic cells (DCs) are without a doubt important key skin cells that connect information from the environment with the innate and adaptive immune system. Their function is decisive for the initiation and inhibition of immune responses, and therefore they play a central role for both the healthy and diseased states of the skin. The type, maturation stage, and function of DCs, as well as the micromilieu in which they are located and their contact with cellular partners in the surrounding area, are important cofactors that direct maintenance of immune homeostasis or breakout of inflammatory reactions in patients with chronic inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis. Thus better knowledge about the exact proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties of DCs in patients with atopic dermatitis and the disease-specific roles of DC subtypes would allow us to target these important immune cells with versatile functions for therapeutic purpose.
