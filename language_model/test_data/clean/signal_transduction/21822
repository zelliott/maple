Our understanding of the molecular signaling pathways regulating the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis or remodeling in response to injury has begun to cross the boundaries from regulation of well-described canonical pathways to the interplay between these pathways. The focus of this review is to summarize our current understanding of a finite group of transcription factors and kinases involved in vascular injury and atherosclerosis, including nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1), activator protein-1 (AP-1), hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), homeobox, and T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (Tcf-Lef), as well as the kinases janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT), protein kinase C (PKC), p38, Rho, ERK5, JNK, p44/p42, and phosphoinositide 3 (PI3) kinase/AKT.
