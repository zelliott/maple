Fluorescent protein probes now permit spatial distributions of specific intracellular signaling molecules to be observed in real time. Mathematical models have been used to simulate molecular gradients and other spatial patterns within cells, and the output of such models may be compared directly with experiments if the binding of the fluorescent probe and the physics of the imaging technique are each incorporated. Here we present a comprehensive model describing the dynamics of 3' phosphoinositides (PIs), lipid second messengers produced in the plasma membrane in response to stimulation of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway, as monitored in the cell-substratum contact area using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. With this technique it was previously shown that uniform stimulation of fibroblasts with platelet-derived growth factor elicits the formation of axisymmetric 3' PI gradients, which we now characterize in the context of our model. We find that upper and lower bounds on the relevant dimensionless model parameter values for an individual cell can be calculated from four well-defined fluorescence measurements. Based on our analysis, we expect that the key dimensionless group, the ratio of 3' PI turnover and diffusion rates, can be estimated within approximately 20% or less.
