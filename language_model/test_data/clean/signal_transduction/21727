The neutrophil is pivotal to ANCA vasculitis pathogenesis. Fever frequently complicates ANCA diseases. This study investigated the effects of short-term heat exposure on apoptosis in neutrophils that were treated with LPS, GM-CSF, IL-8, and dexamethasone. All compounds delayed apoptosis. Heat abrogated the apoptosis-delaying effect of LPS without affecting constitutive apoptosis or delayed apoptosis by GM-CSF, IL-8, or dexamethasone. The heat effect was dose dependent over the 39 to 42 degrees C range. NF-kappaB but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt controlled LPS-delayed apoptosis. Furthermore, LPS-induced IkappaBalpha degradation, DNA binding, and NF-kappaB-dependent gene transcription activation were abrogated by short-term heat. When core temperatures were raised to 40.5 degrees C for 30 min in mice, LPS-induced neutrophil NF-kappaB activation also was prevented. Short-term heat removed heat-shock protein 90 from the IkappaB kinase complex, resulting in failure of LPS-induced IkappaB kinase activation. Despite delayed apoptosis, ANCA antigen expression was increased in LPS-treated neutrophils. ANCA antigen increase was prevented by p38 MAPK inhibition and by heat exposure. Heat exposure did not inhibit LPS-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Instead, apoptosis-mediated p38 MAPK degradation was accelerated, thereby decreasing the p38 MAPK that was available for LPS-mediated ANCA antigen upregulation. These data suggest that fever-like temperatures modulate neutrophil behavior in this disease.
