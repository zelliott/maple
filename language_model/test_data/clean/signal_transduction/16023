Folic acid (folate) is a vitamin of the B-complex group that is essential for cell replication. Folate is a major determinant of one-carbon metabolism, in which S-adenosylmethionine donates methyl groups that are crucial for neurological function. Many roles for folic acid have been reported, including neuroprotective and antidepressant properties. On the other hand, increased concentrations of corticoids have proven neurotoxic effects and hypersecretion of glucocorticoids has been linked to different mood disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential protective effect of folic acid on dexamethasone-induced cellular death in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and the possible intracellular signaling pathway involved in such effect. Exposure to 1 mM dexamethasone for 48 h caused a significant reduction of cell viability measured as 3-[4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells for 72 h to increasing concentrations of folate (1-300 μM) was not cytotoxic. However, pretreatment with folate (10-300 μM) reduced dexamethasone-induced toxicity in a significant manner. To explore the putative intracellular signaling pathways implicated in the protective effect of folate we used different protein kinase inhibitors. The protective effect of folic acid on dexamethasone-induced neurotoxicity was reversed by the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt, LY294002), Ca²⁺/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII, KN-93), and protein kinase A (PKA, H-89) inhibitors, but not the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK1/2, PD98059) and protein kinase C (PKC, chelerythrine) inhibitors. In conclusion, the results of this study show that folic acid can protect against dexamethasone-induced neurotoxicity and its protective mechanism is related to a signaling pathway that involves PI3K/Akt, CaMKII, and PKA.
