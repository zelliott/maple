For more than half a century, hormonal therapy has been one of the cornerstones of prostate cancer therapy. However, the position and timing of androgen deprivation therapy is continuously challenged. Nowadays, it is often combined with other types of treatment in a multi-modal approach, especially with radiation therapy. Besides the well-known luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists, several developments have been introduced (e.g., luteinising hormone-releasing hormone antagonists or improved depot formulations achieving a better pharmacokinetic slope and lower testosterone levels). Research developments include a better understanding of the different gonadotropin-releasing hormone isoforms, the ligand-independent transformation of the androgen receptor and androgen receptor overexpression in hormone-insensitive disease. Prostate cancer, previously thought to be chemotherapy insensitive, is now treated at the metastatic stage by taxane-based chemotherapies. The combination of hormonal therapy and chemotherapy is currently studied at various stages of the disease, as early as localised or locally advanced prostate cancer. It is very likely that, in the future, pharmacological treatment for prostate cancer will include combination therapies rather than monotherapies. The authors suggest an in-depth re-evaluation of the place of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.
