We have previously found that the CENP-B nuclear autoantigen, which is specifically targeted by autoantibodies in the limited cutaneous form of systemic sclerosis, behaved as a potent migratory factor for human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Other recent studies have shown that several disease-associated autoantigens induced cell migration by interacting with various chemokine receptors. Prompted by this hypothesis, we undertook this study to determine whether CENP-B interacts with chemokine receptors on the surface of human PASMCs, to explore the relevant signaling pathways, and to characterize the effects of anti-CENP-B binding on SMC stimulation.

To demonstrate the expression of specific chemokine receptors by human PASMCs at both the messenger RNA and protein levels, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry analyses were performed. Desensitization studies and specific inhibitors were used to further identify the CENP-B target on the surface of human PASMCs.

Our data strongly suggested that CENP-B used chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) to mediate human PASMCs signaling. Moreover, several lines of evidence indicated that CENP-B binding subsequently stimulated the cross-talk between CCR3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via a matrix metalloprotease-dependent mechanism that involved the processing of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor. Transactivation of the EGFR through CCR3 was found to be a critical pathway that elicits MAP kinase activation and secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-8. Finally, anti-CENP-B autoantibodies were found to abolish this signaling pathway, thus preventing CENP-B from transactivating EGFR and exerting its cytokine-like activities toward vascular smooth muscle cells.

The identification of CENP-B as a CCR3 ligand opens up new perspectives for the study of the pathogenic role of anti-CENP-B autoantibodies.
