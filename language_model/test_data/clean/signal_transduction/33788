In interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced human blood lymphocytes, the Na+/K+ pump function (assessed by ouabain-sensitive Rb+ influx), the abundance of Na+, K+-ATPase alpha1-subunit (determined by Western blotting) and the alpha1- and beta1-subunits mRNA of Na+, K+-ATPase (RT-PCR), as well as the phosphorylation of STAT5 and STAT3 family proteins and ERK1/2 kinase have been examined. A 3.5-4.0-fold increase in the expression of alpha1- and beta1-subunits mRNA of Na+, K+-ATPase was found at 24 h of IL-2 stimulation. The inhibitors of JAK3 kinase (B-42, WHI-P431) was shown to decrease both the phosphorylation of STATs and the rise in the oubain-sensitive rubidium influx as well as the increased abundance of Na+, K+-ATPase alpha1-subunit. The inhibition of the protein kinases ERK1/2 by PD98059 (20 microM) suppressed the alpha1-subunit accumulation. All the kinase inhibitors tested did not alter the intracellular content ofmonovalent cations in resting and IL-2-stimulated lymphocytes. It is concluded that MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways mediate the IL-2-dependent regulation of the Na+, K+-ATPase expression during the lymphocyte transition from resting stage to proliferation.
