Distribution of the potassium channel of Kv4.3 type was investigated in the central nervous system (CNS) of Helix pomatia by immunohistochemistry. Immunopositive neurons were found widely distributed in the CNS, present mostly in smaller groups in the different central ganglia but not in the visceral ganglion. Labeled fibers were characteristic for not only the neuropils of all ganglia but also the connective tissue sheath around the CNS and the aorta wall were richly innervated. Western blot analysis revealed a clear identity with the mammalian Kv4.3 subunit, suggesting an evolutionary conserved structure of this channel type. Our preliminary results provide a steady basis for further experiments aiming partly at the identification of other potassium channel types and partly the ultrastructural localization of Kv4.3.
