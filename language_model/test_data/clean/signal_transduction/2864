Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB are both involved in periodontal wound healing. Each of these growth factors exerts a positive proliferative effect on cells of the periodontium in vitro. However, in vivo the peptide bradykinin is one of a complex array of mediators present in addition to these growth factors. The purposes of this investigation were to: 1) evaluate bradykinin interactions with EGF and PDGF-BB altering cell proliferation in cultured human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), periodontal ligament cells (HPDL), and cells derived from alveolar bone (HOB); and 2) determine at the signal transduction level the mechanism of interaction between EGF and bradykinin in HGF. EGF and PDGF-BB stimulated DNA synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner, as measured by [3H] thymidine incorporation. Bradykinin alone did not alter significantly based DNA synthesis values; however, bradykinin in combination with EGF reduced DNA synthesis to nearly basal levels and bradykinin in combination with PDGF reduced the DNA synthesis over 50%. Examination of the interactions between bradykinin and EGF signal transduction pathways revealed that PGE2 release was increased in the presence of bradykinin and EGF (167 +/- 33% to 317 +/- 29%). The bradykinin-stimulated PGE2 release was completely abolished by indomethacin. Indomethacin also was found to block the bradykinin inhibition of EGF-induced DNA synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
