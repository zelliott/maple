Many bacterial pathogens use a specialized "type III" secretion system to deliver virulence effector proteins into host mammalian cells. In this issue of Cell, Alto et al. (2006) describe a new family of effectors that share a WxxxE sequence motif. These effectors directly stimulate host signaling pathways by mimicking activated Ras-like cellular GTPases.
