The molecular effect of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from porphyromonas gingivalis as well as Escherichia coli on the tyrosine protein phosphorylation in the splenic B lymphocytes from LPS-responsive C3H/HeN and LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice was examined. P. gingivalis LPS induced tyrosine phosphorylation of selected membrane proteins that included the phosphoproteins with apparent molecular masses of 24.8 kDa and 26.0 kDa (p24.8 and p26.) in the B lymphocytes from both strains of mice, while E. coli LPS induced p24.8 and p26.0 in C3H/HeN B Lymphocytes only. These findings suggest that through the same tyrosine phosphorylation pathway as observed in C3H/HeN B lymphocytes, P. gingivalis LPS induced the activation of C3H/HeJ B lymphocytes in which a trigger signal by E. coli LPS could not be transduced to initiate tyrosine protein phosphorylation.
