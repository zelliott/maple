RasGAP, a regulator of Ras GTPase family members, is cleaved at low levels of caspase activity into an N-terminal fragment (fragment N) that generates potent anti-apoptotic signals. At higher levels of caspase activity, fragment N is further cleaved into two fragments that strongly potentiate apoptosis. RasGAP could thus function as a sensor of caspase activity to determine whether a cell should survive or not. Here we show that fragment N protects cells by activating the Ras-PI3K-Akt pathway. Surprisingly, even though nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) can be activated by Akt, it plays no role in the anti-apoptotic functions of fragment N. This indicates that Akt effectors are differentially regulated when fragment N is generated.
