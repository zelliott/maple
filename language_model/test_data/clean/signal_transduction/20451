There is an increasing interest for oxidatively generated complex lesions that are potentially more detrimental than single oxidized nucleobases. In this survey, the recently available information on the formation and processing of several classes of complex DNA damage formed upon one radical hit including mostly hydroxyl radical and one-electron oxidants is critically reviewed. The modifications include tandem base lesions, DNA-protein cross-links and intrastrand (purine 5',8-cyclonucleosides, adjacent base cross-links) and interstrand cross-links. Information is also provided on clustered lesions produced essentially by exposure of cells to ionizing radiation and high energetic heavy ions through the involvement of multiple radical events that induce several lesions DNA in a close spatial vicinity. These consist mainly of double strand breaks (DSBs) and non-DSB clustered lesions that are referred as to oxidatively generated clustered DNA lesions (OCDLs).
