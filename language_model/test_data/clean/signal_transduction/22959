Recent studies have shown that the formation of boundaries between the segments - rhombomeres - of the vertebrate hindbrain depends on bidirectional signalling between neighbouring cells. This signalling is mediated by Eph receptors and their ligands, which has been found to restrict cell intermingling in vitro.
