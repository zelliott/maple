Fas-L expresses on a variety of tumors and is suspected to modify the dialog between tumor and the immune system. However, the cellular abnormality in tumor cells leading to an aberrant expression of Fas-L is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate the involvement of Ras signaling in the Fas-L expression in several ways. First, the activated Ha-rasval12 gene enhanced the Fas-L expression of primary human glial cells. Second, blocking the Ras signal pathway in glioma cells by lovastatin or the Ha-rasAsn17 dominant-negative mutant gene resulted in reduced Fas-L expression. Transfection of the Ha-rasAsn17 into glioma cells also inhibited the activation of NFKB, which is a downstream component of Ras signaling. Accordingly, the membrane-permeable NFKB competitor suppressed the Fas-L expression. Furthermore, the Fas-L expression coincided with the Ras activity in the murine 212 cells, in which the Ras activity could be induced by isopropyl 3-D-thiogalactoside. In summary, these results suggest that the enhanced Ras signaling with consequential NFKB activation, which is a frequent defect found in tumors, could mediate the Fas-L expression of tumors.
