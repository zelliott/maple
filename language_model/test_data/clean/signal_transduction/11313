Most studies on the origin of oligodendrocyte lineage have been performed in the spinal cord. By contrast, molecular mechanisms that regulate the appearance of the oligodendroglial lineage in the brain have not yet attracted much attention. We provide evidence for three distinct sources of oligodendrocytes in the mouse telencephalon. In addition to two subpallial ventricular foci, the anterior entopeduncular area and the medial ganglionic eminence, the rostral telencephalon also gives rise to oligodendrocytes. We show that oligodendrocytes in the olfactory bulb are generated within the rostral pallium from ventricular progenitors characterized by the expression of PLP: We provide evidence that these Plp oligodendrocyte progenitors do not depend on signal transduction mediated by platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), and therefore propose that they belong to a different lineage than the PDGFRalpha-expressing progenitors. Moreover, induction of oligodendrocytes in the telencephalon is dependent on sonic hedgehog signaling, as in the spinal cord. In all these telencephalic ventricular territories, oligodendrocyte progenitors were detected at about the same developmental stage as in the spinal cord. However, both in vivo and in vitro, the differentiation into O4-positive pre-oligodendrocytes was postponed by 4-5 days in the telencephalon in comparison with the spinal cord. This delay between determination and differentiation appears to be intrinsic to telencephalic oligodendrocytes, as it was not shortened by diffusible or cell-cell contact factors present in the spinal cord.
