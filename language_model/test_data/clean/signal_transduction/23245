The last decade has seen an increased focus on the development of adjuvants for vaccines, and several novel adjuvants are now in licensed products or in late-stage clinical development. These advancements have been aided by the discovery of receptors and signaling pathways of the innate immune system and an increased understanding of how these innate responses influence the adaptive immune response. Successful vaccine development relies on knowledge of which adjuvants to use and the proper formulation of adjuvants and antigens to achieve safe, stable and immunogenic vaccines. In this review, the authors focus on the current use of natural and synthetic lipopolysaccharide analogues that retain their adjuvant properties with reduced toxicity compared with the parent compound for use in emerging vaccines. The authors review how these compounds initiate signal transduction through Toll-like receptor 4, insights from structure-function studies and how formulation parameters can influence their effectiveness as vaccine adjuvants.
