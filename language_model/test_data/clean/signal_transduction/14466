We have studied the involvement of receptor interacting protein kinase-1 (RIP1) and dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) in external dsRNA-induced apoptotic and necrotic cell death in Jurkat T cell lymphoma. Our results suggest that RIP1 plays an imported role in dsRNA-induced apoptosis and necrosis. We demonstrated that contrary to necrosis, protein synthesis is inhibited in apoptosis. Here, we show that phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2-alpha)) and its kinase, PKR, occur in dsRNA-induced apoptosis but not in necrosis. These events are caspase-dependent and coincide with the appearance of the caspase-mediated PKR fragments, N-terminal domain (ND) and kinase domain (KD). Our immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both fragments could independently co-precipitate with full-length PKR. Expression of PKR-KD leads to PKR and eIF2-alpha phosphorylation and inhibits protein translation, whereas that of PKR-ND does not. Co-expression of PKR-ND and PKR-KD promotes their interaction with PKR, PKR and eIF2-alpha phosphorylation and suppresses protein translation better than PKR-KD alone. Our findings suggest a caspase-dependent mode of activation of PKR in apoptosis in which the PKR-KD fragment interacts with and activates intact PKR. PKR-ND facilitates the interaction of PKR-KD with full-length PKR and thus the activation of the kinase and amplifies the translation inhibitory signal.
