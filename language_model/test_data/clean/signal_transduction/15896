A genetic dissection approach was employed to determine whether the IL-2 receptor complex (IL-2R) comprised of α, β and γ chains is required for the suppression of Plasmodium chabaudi adami parasitemia. Blood-stage infections in IL-2Rγ(c)(-/y) mice failed to cure with parasitemia remaining elevated for > 50 days indicating the IL-2Rγ(c) through which all members of the γ(c) family of cytokines signal has an essential role in protective immunity against blood-stage malarial parasites. In contrast, the curing of parasitemia in IL-2/15Rβ⁻/⁻ mice, deficient in both IL-2 and IL-15 signalling was significantly delayed but did occur, indicating that neither cytokine plays an essential role in parasite clearance. Moreover, the observation that the time course of parasitemia in IL-15⁻/⁻ mice was nearly identical to that seen in controls suggests that the parasitemia-suppressing role of stimulating through the IL-2/15Rβ chain is owing to IL-2 signalling and not a redundant function of IL-15.
