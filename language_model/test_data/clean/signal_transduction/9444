While oestrogen is recognized to play a key role in regulating growth, particularly in relation to epiphyseal fusion, the mechanisms that mediate its effects are still unclear. We utilized an in vitro model of chondrogenesis, the RCJ3.1C5.18 cell line, to explore the effect of oestrogen on this process. We demonstrated the presence of oestrogen receptors (ER) α and β in these cells, with increased abundance of both receptor sub-types evident as the cells differentiated. ERα localized to the nucleus, suggesting it was signalling by genomic pathways, while ERβ was seen predominantly in the cytoplasm, suggesting it may be utilizing non-genomic signalling. While exogenous oestrogen had no effect on proliferation or differentiation, we found some evidence for the endogenous production of oestrogen (intracrinology), as suggested by the expression of aromatase in these cells. Selective ERα blockade with methyl piperidinopyrazole (MPP) led to a significant reduction in both proliferation and differentiation, while ERβ blockade with R,R tetrahydrochrysene (THC) led to an increase in these parameters. This is in keeping with results from mouse knockout models suggesting that unopposed ERβ signalling leads to an inhibition of skeletal growth. Our results are further evidence for the importance of differential ER signalling in regulating chondrogenesis. Future studies examining in vivo effects of these agents are required to extrapolate these findings to a mammalian model.
