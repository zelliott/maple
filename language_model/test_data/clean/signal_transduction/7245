Cancer is often caused by deregulation of normal developmental processes. Here, we review recent research on the aberrant activation of two hematopoietic cytokine receptors in acute lymphoid leukemias. Somatic events in the genes for thymic stromal lymphopoietin and Interleukin 7 receptors as well as in their downstream JAK kinases result in constitutive ligand-independent activation of survival and proliferation in B and T lymphoid precursors. Drugs targeting these receptors or the signaling pathways might provide effective therapies of these leukemias.
