Neutrophils express two types of receptor for the Fc region of IgG, FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIIIB. Via these receptors, neutrophils bind IgG complexes that contain more than one IgG molecule. This binding activates functional processes, such as the respiratory burst and chemotaxis. Neutrophils were treated with biotinylated anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibodies and chemotaxis toward streptavidin, a cross-linking agent, was determined. Cross-linking FcgammaRII and not FcgammaRIIIB induced neutrophil chemotaxis. Superoxide production in response to immobilized anti-Fc receptor antibodies was also examined. Anti-FcgammaRII Fab bound to ELISA plates induced superoxide production, while anti-FcgammaRIIIB Fab did not. Pretreatment of neutrophils with anti-FcgammaRII Fab reduced superoxide generated by immobilized anti-FcgammaRII antibody. The data demonstrate that FcgammaRII and not FcgammaRIIIB are responsible for neutrophil chemotaxis and superoxide production upon Fc receptor activation.
