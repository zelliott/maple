Memory T cells exhibit low activation thresholds and rapid effector responses following antigen stimulation, contrasting naive T cells with high activation thresholds and no effector responses. Signaling mechanisms for the distinct properties of naive and memory T cells remain poorly understood. Here, I will discuss new results on signal transduction in naive and memory T cells that suggest proximal control of activation threshold and a distinct biochemical pathway to rapid recall. The signaling and transcriptional pathways controlling immediate effector function in memory T cells closely resemble pathways for rapid effector cytokine production in innate immune cells, suggesting memory T cells use innate pathways for efficacious responses.
