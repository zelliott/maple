Signal transduction in T cells is a dynamic process involving a large number of membrane and cytosolic proteins. The TCR macromolecular complex (signalosome) is initiated by receptor occupancy and becomes more elaborate over time. This review describes how 'vertical' displacement mechanisms and lateral coalescence of lipid-raft-associated scaffold proteins combine to form distinct signalosomes, which control signal specificity.
