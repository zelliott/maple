The role of c-Ski, an oncoprotein encoded by the oncogene, c-ski, in Trichinella spiralis-infected muscle tissues during nurse cell formation, was investigated by following the expression kinetics and distribution of c-Ski (both protein and mRNA) in the infected muscle cell, as well as the expression kinetics of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway factor genes (TGF-beta, Smad2 and Smad4) which cooperate with c-Ski. Immunohistochemical analysis using an anti-c-Ski antibody indicated that in the early stages of infection (13 and 18 days post-infection (p.i.)) the increased expression of the c-Ski protein was limited to the eosinophilic cytoplasm and not the enlarged nuclei or basophilic cytoplasm. At a later stage of infection (23 and 28 days p.i.) the c-Ski protein was limited to the enlarged nuclei in the basophilic cytoplasm, rather than the eosinophilic cytoplasm. At 48 days p.i., the c-Ski protein was barely detectable. Real-time PCR analysis showed that expression of the c-ski gene increased from 13 days p.i., reached a peak at 23-28 days p.i. and then decreased to a low level by 48 days p.i. Expression kinetics for the TGF-beta signaling pathway factor genes (TGF-beta, Smad2 and Smad4) were similar to that of c-ski. These findings provide evidence that the c-Ski protein is involved in nurse cell formation through the TGF-beta signaling pathway process in the host cell nucleus.
