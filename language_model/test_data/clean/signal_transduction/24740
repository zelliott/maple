The inhibitory effects of caffeine on receptor-activated cytosolic Ca2+ signal generation in isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells were investigated. Using the ability of caffeine to quench Indo-1 fluorescence we measured simultaneously the free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the intracellular caffeine concentration ([caffeine]i). We also measured inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) production with a radioreceptor assay. When caffeine was added to the extracellular solution during a sustained receptor-activated increase in [Ca2+]i, [caffeine]i rose to its steady level within a few seconds. This was accompanied by a decrease of [Ca2+]i, which started only after [caffeine]i had reached an apparent threshold concentration (about 2 mM in the case of 0.5 microM acetylcholine (ACh) stimulation). Above this [caffeine]i level there was a linear relationship between [caffeine]i and [Ca2+]i. Throughout the caffeine exposure [Ca2+]i remained at a steady low level. Following removal of caffeine from the bath, [caffeine]i decreased to zero within seconds. There was no significant increase in [Ca2+]i until [caffeine]i had been reduced to the threshold level (about 2 mM at 0.5 microM ACh). Caffeine inhibited Ca2+ signals evoked by ACh, cholecystokinin, and ATP and also inhibited signals generated in the absence of external Ca2+. Caffeine application had the same effect as removal of agonist allowing recovery from apparent desensitization. Caffeine inhibited the agonist-evoked production of InsP3 in a dose-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate the acute and reversible dose-dependent inhibition of agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ signal generation due to rapid intracellular caffeine accumulation and washout. The inhibition can be explained by the reduction of agonist-evoked InsP3 production.
