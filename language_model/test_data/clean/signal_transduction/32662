Polycythemia vera is an acquired clonal myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased numbers of erythroid cells, often with a concomitant rise in neutrophils and/or megakaryocytes. Normally, erythropoietin is essential for the survival and proliferation of erythroid progenitors; however in polycythemia vera the erythroid progenitor cells can survive and develop in the absence of erythropoietin. Members of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators have been shown to mediate the erythropoietin-dependent survival of erythroid cells. In this article, recent advances in understanding the mechanisms used by erythroid progenitors from patients with polycythemia vera to control apoptosis, are discussed.
