In recent years, assessing the photogenotoxic potential of a compound became an issue for certain drugs and cosmetical products. Therefore, existing methods performed according to international guidelines (e.g. OECD guidelines) were adapted to the use of concurrent UV-visible (UV-Vis) light irradiation for the assessment of photomutagenicity/photogenotoxicity. In this review, photobiological bases of the processes occurring in the cell after irradiation with UV- and/or visible (vis)-light as well as a compilation of testing methods is presented. Methods comprise cell free investigations on naked DNA and in vitro methods, such as the photo-Ames test, the photo-HPRT/photo-mouse lymphoma assay (MLA), the photo-micronucleus test (MNT), the photo-chromosomal aberration test (CA) and the photo-Comet assay. A compilation of the currently available international literature of compounds tested on photogenotoxicity is given for each method. The state of the art of photogenotoxicity testing as well as the rational for testing are outlined in relation to the recommendations reached in expert working groups at different international meetings and to regulatory guidance papers. Finally, photogenotoxicity testing as predictor of photocarcinogenicity and in the light of risk assessment is discussed.
