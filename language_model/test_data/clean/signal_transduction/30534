Indicators such as clonogenic survival, transformation, and chromosomal aberrations are used to evaluate the effects of radiation on cells. Apoptosis, another such indicator, is a mode of cell death, and radiation-induced apoptosis contributes to eliminating damaged cells and preventing malformation and carcinogenesis. Understanding radiation-induced apoptosis will assist in radiotherapy for cancer and treatment of patients in accidental radiation exposure. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a serine/threonine kinase that is related to cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, and apoptosis, and has many roles in the radiation-induced cellular responses involving apoptosis. This review describes the functions of PKC, including its relationship with other signaling networks and oxidative stress in the regulation of radiation-induced apoptosis. Such information might provide clues for evaluating the effects of radiation and for identifying clinical applications.
