The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) controls numerous physiological traits: dormancy and germination of seeds, senescence and resistance to abiotic stresses. In order to get more insight into the role of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) in ABA signalling, we obtained eight homozygous T-DNA insertion lines in Arabidopsis thaliana PTP genes. One mutant, named phs1-3, exhibited a strong ABA-induced inhibition of germination as only 26% of its seeds germinated after 3 days instead of 92% for the Columbia (Col-0) line. Genetic and molecular analyses of phs1-3 showed that it bears a unique T-DNA insertion in the promoter of the gene and that the mutation is recessive. PHS1 expression in the mutant is about half that of the Col-0 line. The upregulation of two ABA-induced genes (At5g06760, RAB18) and the downregulation of two ABA-repressed genes (AtCLC-A, ACL) are enhanced in the phs1-3 mutant compared with the wild-type. The 'in planta' aperture of phs1-3 stomata is reduced and the inhibition of the light-induced opening of stomata by ABA is stronger in phs1-3 leaves than in Col-0 leaves. Finally, PHS1 expression is upregulated in the presence of ABA in both phs1-3 and Col-0 but more intensively in the mutant. Thus, phs1-3 is hypersensitive to ABA. Taken together, these results show that PHS1, which encodes a dual-specificity PTP, is a negative regulator of ABA signalling.
