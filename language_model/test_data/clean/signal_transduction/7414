Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most devastating fibrotic diffuse parenchymal lung disease which remains refractory to pharmacological therapies. Therefore, novel treatments are urgently required. Protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that mediates critical signalling pathways in pathology and physiology. Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis has been shown to be diminished in PAR-1-deficient mice. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether pharmacological PAR-1 inhibition is a potential therapeutic option to combat pulmonary fibrosis.

Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by intranasal instillation of bleomycin into wild-type mice with or without a specific PAR-1 antagonist (ie, P1pal-12, a pepducin that blocks the PAR-1/G-protein interaction). Fibrosis was assessed by hydroxyproline analysis, immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR and western blot for fibrotic markers expression.

We first show that P1pal-12 effectively inhibits PAR-1-induced profibrotic responses in fibroblasts. Next, we show that once daily treatment with 0.5, 2.5 or 10 mg/kg P1pal-12 reduced the severity and extent of fibrotic lesions in a dose-dependent manner. These findings correlated with significant decreases in fibronectin, collagen and Î± smooth muscle actin expression at the mRNA and protein level in treated mice. To further establish the potential clinical applicability of PAR-1 inhibition, we analysed fibrosis in mice treated with P1pal-12 1 or 7 days after bleomycin instillation. Interestingly, when administered 7 days after the induction of fibrosis, P1pal-12 was as effective in limiting the development of pulmonary fibrosis as when administration was started before bleomycin instillation.

Overall, targeting PAR-1 may be a promising treatment for pulmonary fibrosis.
