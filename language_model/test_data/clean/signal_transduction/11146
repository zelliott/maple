The incidence of erectile dysfunction (ED) significantly increases in aging men, which may be associated with the decrease of the serum growth hormone (GH) level. GH may play an important role in the maintenance of penile erectile function, perhaps by promotion of the NO-cGMP pathway, stimulation of the regeneration of NOS-containing nerve fibers and the augmentation of androgenic action.
