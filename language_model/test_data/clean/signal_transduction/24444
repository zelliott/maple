Receptor transactivation, i.e., interaction between unrelated receptor systems, is a growing theme in cytokine and growth factor signaling. In this study we reveal for the first time the ability of IFN-alpha to transactivate gp130 in myeloma cells. An epidermal growth factor receptor/gp130 chimeric receptor previously shown by us to transactivate endogenous gp130, provided a complementary tool to study the underlying mechanisms of receptor cross-talk. Further analysis revealed that transactivation of gp130 by IFN-alpha did not require the extracellular or trans-membrane domain of gp130. Moreover, transactivation of gp130 was critically dependent upon Janus kinase activation by the initiating receptor and correlated with rapid and sustained Janus kinase 1 and tyrosine kinase (Tyk) 2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, transactivation of gp130 may be a common theme in myeloma cells, perhaps providing a mechanism for enhanced or qualitatively distinct cellular responses to specific stimuli.
