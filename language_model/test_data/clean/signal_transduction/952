Engagement of cells with the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is crucial for various biological processes, including cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and gene induction, contributing to maintenance of tissue integrity, embryogenesis, wound healing, and the metastasis of tumor cells (Hynes, 2002b; Juliano, 2002). The engagement involves cell adhesion mediated by integrins, a large family of cell adhesion receptors that are transmembrane glycoproteins which bind to ECM or to counter-receptors on neighbor cells. In this review, the molecular basis of signaling mediated by integrins and their collaboration with growth factor receptors will be discussed, based on recent observations. Although other cell adhesion receptors including cadherins, selectins, syndecans, and the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs) can play important roles or be involved in these processes, we suggest readers refer to recent outstanding reviews on them (Barclay, 2003; Brummendorf and Lemmon 2001; Panicker et al. 2003).
