A growing body of evidence indicates that the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-antioxidant response element (Nrf2-ARE) pathway plays a protective role in many physiological stress processes such as inflammatory damage, oxidative stress, and the accumulation of toxic metabolites, which are all involved in the cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We hypothesized that the Nrf2-ARE pathway might have a protective role in cerebral vasospasm following SAH.

In our study, we investigate whether the oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) can induce the activation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and evaluate the modulatory effects of sulforaphane (SUL) on OxyHb-induced inflammation in VSMCs.

As a result, both the protein level and the mRNA level of the nuclear Nrf2 were significantly increased, while the mRNA levels of two Nrf2-regulated gene products, both heme oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1, were also up-regulated in VSMCs induced with OxyHb. A marked increase of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α release was observed at 48 h after cells were treated with OxyHb. SUL enhanced the activity of the Nrf2-ARE pathway and suppressed cytokine release.

Our results indicate that the Nrf2-ARE pathway was activated in OxyHb-induced VSMCs. SUL suppressed cytokine release via the activation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway in OxyHb-induced VSMCs.
