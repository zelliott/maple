Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an inducible antioxidant enzyme that degrades heme to three products, biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and iron ion. The present study was originally designed to characterize the HO-1 induction by Lumbricus extract as a potential cytoprotective mechanism. Through bioactivity-guided fractionation, with human HepG2 cells as the cellular detector, surprisingly, we found that arsenic was enriched in the active fractions isolated from Lumbricus extract. Arsenic speciation was further carried out by liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC/ICP-MS). Our results showed that Lumbricus extract contained two major arsenic species, arsenite (As(III) ; 53.7%) and arsenate (As(V) ; 34.2%), and six minor arsenic species. Commercial sodium arsenite (NaAsO(2) ) was used to verify the effects of Lumbricus extract on HO-1 expression and related intracellular signaling pathways. Both p38 MAP kinase and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways were found to modulate HO-1 induction by Lumbricus extract and NaAsO(2) . The cytotoxicity of arsenite was augmented by p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB202190 and HO-1 inhibitor tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP), whereas p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB202190 also inhibited HO-1 induction by NaAsO(2) . These results suggest that arsenic-containing compounds are responsible for HO-1 induction by Lumbricus extract. Although the exact role of toxic arsenic compounds in the treatment of oxidative injury remains unclear, concomitant HO-1 induction may be a key mechanism to antagonize the cytotoxicity of arsenic compounds in human cells.
