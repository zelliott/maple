Granulosa cell tumours represent approximately 5% of all malignant ovarian tumours. They exhibit many morphological, biochemical and hormonal features of proliferating normal preovulatory granulosa cells, including both estrogen and inhibin biosynthesis. The aetiology of these tumours remains unclear, although many recent studies and several animal models have focused on signalling pathways that are known to be important in the regulation of granulosa cell proliferation. Here, we discuss the information currently available about the possible molecular changes that might lead to neoplastic transformation in human granulosa cells. The identification of these changes might lead not only to improved diagnosis, management and treatment of granulosa cell tumours, but could also offer new insights into normal granulosa cell biology.
