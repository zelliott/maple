Recent investigation of the DNA-damage checkpoint in several organisms has highlighted the conservation of this pathway. The checkpoint's signal transduction pathway consists of four conserved classes of molecules: two large protein kinases having homology to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, three "sensor" proteins with homology to proliferating cell nuclear antigen, two serine/threonine (S/T) kinases, and two adaptors for the S/T kinases. This review compares the role of these four classes of checkpoint proteins in humans and model organisms.
