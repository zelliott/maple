The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase which has a central role in the regulation of cell growth and metabolism. In the study of the mTOR signaling pathway, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1/2 complex is identified as a critical regulator of mTOR activity. TSC1/2 plays important roles for immune cell homeostasis and differentiation by negative control of mTOR signaling pathway. TSC1/2-mTOR pathway is proving to be a central point in regulating immune function of diverse immune cells. In this review, we discuss the function of TSC1/2-mTOR to direct the innate and adaptive immune cell development and function. Furthermore, we focus on the role of TSC1/2-mTOR signaling pathway in immune cell mediated diseases, especially autoimmunity.
