The effect of propranolol on Ca(2+) signalling in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was investigated by using fura-2 as a Ca(2+) probe. Propranolol increased cytosolic free Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) in a concentration-dependent manner between 0.1 and 1 mM. The response was partly inhibited by external Ca(2+) removal. In Ca(2+)-free medium pretreatment with 0.2 mM propranolol partly inhibited the [Ca(2+)](i) rise induced by 1 microM thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump; but pretreatment with thapsigargin abolished propranolol-induced Ca(2+) release. Addition of 3 mM Ca(2+) induced a [Ca(2+)](i) rise after pretreatment with 0.2 mM propranolol in Ca(2+)-free medium. Propranolol (0.2 mM) inhibited 25% of thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca(2+) entry. Suppression of 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) formation by 2 microM U73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, did not alter 0.2 mM propranolol-induced internal Ca(2+) release. Propranolol (1 mM) also increased [Ca(2+)](i) in human neutrophils. Collectively, we have found that 0.2 mM propranolol increased [Ca(2+)](i) in MDCK cells by releasing Ca(2+) from thapsigargin-sensitive Ca(2+) stores in an IP(3)-independent manner, followed by Ca(2+) influx from external space. Independently, propranolol was able to inhibit thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca(2+) entry.
