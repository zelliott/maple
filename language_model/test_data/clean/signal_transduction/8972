Pharmacological modulation of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) signalling could provide new therapeutic and experimental tools. Although drugs interfering with this pathway have traditionally targeted membrane receptors, the effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase (AC), which functions as a signalling catalyst, also presents an interesting target. Thus, development of isoform-selective stimulator and/or inhibitor compounds for AC could lead to organ-specific pharmacotherapeutics for treating heart failure, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, the potential of AC as the object of drug therapy is discussed.
