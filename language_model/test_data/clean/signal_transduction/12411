Activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling is considered an important mechanism in the development of prostate cancers. A recent study revealed that IkappaB kinase epsilon (IKKepsilon), an activator of NF-kappaB, was overexpressed in breast cancers and acted as an oncogene. Expression of NF-kappaB members has been reported in prostate cancer tissues, but expression of IKKepsilon has not yet been studied in prostate cancers. In this study, we attempted to explore as to whether expressions of IKKepsilon and NF-kappaB members p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA are altered in prostate cancers. We analyzed the expression of IKKepsilon, p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA in 107 prostate adenocarcinoma tissues by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray (TMA) method. In the TMA, IKKepsilon is expressed in basal cells, but not in alveolar cells in normal prostate glands. IKKepsilon is expressed in 60.0% of prostate intraepithelial neoplasm (PIN) and 70.1% of the prostate cancers in the cytoplasm. Nuclear immunostainings of NF-kappaB members p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA, which are considered activation of NF-kappaB signaling, were observed respectively in 28.0%, 18.7% and 37.4% of the cancers. Nuclear staining was detected neither in normal alveolar cells nor in PIN. However, none of the expression of p50/105 nor p52/p100 nor RelA nor IKKepsilon was associated with pathologic characteristics, including size of the cancers, age, Gleason score and stage. The increased cytoplasmic expression of IKKepsilon as well as the increased nuclear expressions of p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA in the prostate cancers compared to normal alveolar cells suggested that overexpression of these proteins may be related to activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and might play a role in tumorigenesis of prostate cancers.
