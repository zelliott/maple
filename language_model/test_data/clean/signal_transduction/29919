The TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of molecules acts as adapter proteins for signaling pathways initiated by several members of the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily. TRAF5(-/-) animals are viable and have normal development of the immune system despite interacting with several TNFR family members. A clear role for TRAF5 has yet to emerge. OX40 (CD134) interacts with TRAF5, suggesting that this pathway could be involved in regulating T cell differentiation into Th1 or Th2 cells. In tissue culture, OX40 stimulation of TRAF5(-/-) T cells resulted in a pronounced Th2 phenotype with elevated levels of IL-4 and IL-5. Similarly, in vivo immunization with protein in adjuvant in the presence of an agonist anti-OX40 Ab resulted in enhanced Th2 development in TRAF5(-/-) mice. Additionally, lung inflammation induced by T cells, which is critically controlled by OX40, was more pronounced in TRAF5(-/-) mice, characterized by higher levels of Th2 cytokines. These results suggest that TRAF5 can limit the induction of Th2 responses, and that TRAF5 can play a role in modulating responses driven by OX40 costimulation.
