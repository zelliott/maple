The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is a critical event in the life cycle of plants. Previous physiological studies have deduced that hormone-like substances mediate this important transition but the biochemical nature of the putative signaling molecules has remained elusive. Recent molecular and genetic studies of key flowering-time genes offer new approaches to understanding the mechanisms underlying the initiation of flowering.
