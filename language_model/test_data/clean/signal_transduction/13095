Collagens are the most abundant proteins in the mammalian body and it is well recognized that collagens fulfill an important structural role in the extracellular matrix in a number of tissues. Inactivation of the collagen alpha 1(I) gene in mice results in embryonic lethality and collagen mutations in humans cause defects leading to disease. Integrins constitute a major group of receptors for extracellular matrix components, including collagens. Currently four collagen-binding I domain-containing integrins are known, namely alpha 1 beta 1, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 10 beta 1 and alpha 11 beta 1. Unlike the undisputed role of collagens as structural elements, the biological importance of integrin mediated cell-collagen interactions is far from clear. This is in part due to the limited information available on the most recent additions of the integrin family, alpha 10 beta 1 and alpha 11 beta 1. Future studies using gene inactivation of individual and multiple integrin genes will allow testing of the hypothesis that collagen-binding integrins have redundant functions but will also shed light on their importance in pathological conditions. In this review we will describe what is currently known about the collagen-binding integrins and discuss their biological functions.
