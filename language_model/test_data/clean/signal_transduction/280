To investigate the significance of sonic hedgehog (Shh), indian hedgehog (Ihh), smoothened (Smo) and patched (Ptch) expressions in uterine cervical lesions and their relationships with HPV type 16 infection.

Totally 183 cases of cervical lesions, including 32 non-neoplastic cervix, 71 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (28 CINI, 18 CINII, and 25 CINIII) and 80 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) were selected from the Department of Pathology, Yanbian University Hospital, Yanbian Women Hospital, and Yanbian Tumor Hospital. Shh, Ihh, Ptch and Smo proteins expression were investigated by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarry platform, and the presence of HPV type 16 was detected by PCR method.

Immunohistochemical staining showed that the frequencies of Shh, Ihh, Ptch and Smo expression were rare in normal cervical epithelium, but were strongly expressed in cervical cancer and its precursor lesions (CINII/III) (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.05, respectively). In cervical cancer, the expression rate of Shh (95%) was higher than that of CIN (CINI to CINIII) (46.4%, 61.1%, 80.0%, respectively, P < 0.05). HPV16 was positive in 77.5% of SCC. In cervical cancer, the expression of Shh was related with HPV16 infection (P < 0.05), and the expression of Smo was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05).

Shh, Ihh, Ptch, and Smo genes may play important roles in the development of cervical cancer. Detection of Hedgehog signaling pathway molecules seems helpful for the early diagnosis of cervical cancer and its precursor lesions, and are potentially therapeutic targets as well.
