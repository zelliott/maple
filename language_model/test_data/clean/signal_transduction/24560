Increasing attention has been focused on how the retinoblastoma (RB) protein regulates cell growth. Recent evidence indicates that it is a substrate for phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase-cyclin complexes and suggests that this phosphorylation modulates the ability of this protein to regulate transit through the cell cycle, perhaps in its G1 phase.
