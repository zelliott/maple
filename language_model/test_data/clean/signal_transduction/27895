Recent genetic studies in Drosophila have identified signals that direct cell movement, mechanisms that transduce such signals within migrating cells and some of the molecular machinery underlying cell motility. Activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway is required for migration of the cells of the developing respiratory system and mesoderm. A signal dependent on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutanyl Coenzyme A reductase attracts migrating primordial germ cells to the somatic gonad, whereas the phosphohydrolase, phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2, repels germ cells. In the female germline, the migratory path of border cells is directed by the homophilic adhesion molecule E cadherin.
