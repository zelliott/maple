Human peripheral blood CD8+ T cells comprise cells that are in different states of differentiation and under the control of complex homeostatic processes. In a number of situations ranging from chronic inflammatory conditions and infectious diseases to ageing, immunodeficiency, iron overload and heavy alcohol intake, major phenotypic changes, usually associated with an increase in CD8+ T cells lacking CD28 expression, take place. CD8+CD28- T cells are characterized by a low proliferative capacity to conventional stimulation in vitro and by morphological and functional features of activated/memory T cells. Although the nature of the signals that give origin to this T-cell subset is uncertain, growing evidence argues for the existence of an interplay between epithelial cells, molecules with the MHC-class I fold and CD8+ T cells. The possibility that the generation of CD8+CD28- T cells is the combination of TCR/CD3zeta- and regulatory factor-mediated signals as a result of the sensing of modifications of the internal environment is discussed.
