Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, showed a temperature-dependent change in lipid A composition, with a reduced degree of acylation when bacteria were grown at 37 degrees C (tetraacylated) versus ambient temperature (hexaacylated).

Human monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were exposed to Y. pestis grown at 26 degrees C or 37 degrees C, to their corresponding lipopolysaccharides (LPS-26 degrees C or LPS-37 degrees C), and to ligands of different Toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as LPS from Escherichia coli (TLR4), lipoprotein (TLR2), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly-IC) (TLR9), and their combinations. Production of cytokines was measured, along with expression of surface markers of DC maturation.

Y. pestis grown at 37 degrees C or LPS-37 degrees C induced much lower production of cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 1beta, 10, and 12) by DCs than did Y. pestis grown at 26 degrees C or LPS-26 degrees C. Expression of the surface markers HLA-DR, CD86, and CD40 by DCs was also reduced in response to treatment with LPS-37 degrees C compared with LPS-26 degrees C. Pretreatment of DCs with LPS-37 degrees C inhibited subsequent stimulation with LPS-26 degrees C, control LPS from E. coli, lipoprotein, or poly-IC.

LPS-37 degrees C can inhibit stimulation of DCs not only via TLR4 signaling but also via TLR2 and TLR3. [corrected]
