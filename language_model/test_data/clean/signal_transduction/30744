Peritoneal surface epithelial (PSE) cells participate in adhesion formation following inflammatory injury yet adjacent ovarian SE (OSE) cells regenerate without scarification after ovulation. OSE cells show inflammation-associated expression of 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11betaHSD1) enzyme, enabling intracrine generation of anti-inflammatory cortisol to minimise tissue damage. We asked if human PSE cells show an 11betaHSD1 response to pro-/anti-inflammatory stimulation and if so, how the 11-oxoreductase activity generated compares with OSE. PSE collected from premenopausal women undergoing surgery for benign gynaecological conditions were used to establish primary PSE cell cultures that were treated for 48 h with interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) with/without anti-inflammatory steroid (cortisol or progesterone). mRNA levels corresponding to the genes of interest (11betaHSD1, 11betaHSD2, cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2) were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. IL-1alpha (0.5 ng/ml) stimulated 11betaHSD1 and COX-2 mRNA levels in PSE cells but 11betaHSD2 was unaffected. Cortisol (1 microM), not progesterone (1 microM), increased 11betaHSD1 mRNA and synergistically enhanced IL-1alpha action. Cortisol suppressed IL-1alpha-stimulated COX-2 more effectively than progesterone. PSE cells had a significantly lower basal 11-oxoreductase enzyme activity than OSE cells; IL-1alpha did not significantly increase the 11-oxoreductase activity in PSE cells but did so in OSE cells. We conclude that PSE cells respond to IL-1alpha and anti-inflammatory steroids in qualitatively similar ways as OSE. However, the enzymatic activity of 11betaHSD1 is lower in PSE and less responsive to IL-1alpha. This could help explain why peritoneal healing often leads to adhesion formation, whereas postovulatory ovarian healing is scar-free.
