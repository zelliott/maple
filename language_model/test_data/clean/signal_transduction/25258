Functional chemokine receptors and chemokines are expressed by glial cells within the CNS, though relatively little is known about the patterns of neuronal chemokine receptor expression and function. We developed monoclonal antibodies to the CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR6, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4 chemokine receptors to study their expression in human fetal neurons cultured from brain tissue as well as the clonally derived NT2.N human neuronal cell line (NTera 2/cl.D1). Specific monoclonal antibody labeling demonstrated expression of CCR2, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4 on neurons from both sources. Co-labeling studies revealed strong expression of CXCR3 and CXCR4 on both dendritic and axonal processes, with a weaker expression of CXCR2 and CCR2. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of pure NT2.N neurons confirmed RNA expression for CCR2, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4. No changes in the neuronal labeling pattern of chemokine receptor expression were noted when NT2.N neurons were grown on a supporting layer of astrocytes, again consistent with similar patterns seen in primary human fetal brain cultures. Analysis of single-cell calcium transients revealed a robust response to stromal derived factor-1alpha (CXCR4) and melanocyte growth-stimulating activity (CXCR2), and variable response to monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCR2) or interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 (CXCR3). Finally, we detected the release of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 from pure cultures of NT2.N neurons, but not undifferentiated NT2 cells. These data indicate that individual neurons may not only co-express multiple functional chemokine receptors, but also that neurons themselves produce chemokines which may influence cellular function within the central nervous system.
