The differentiation of naive T cells to effector/memory T cells is regulated by a variety of factors. The recent advance of the contribution of Notch signaling in this differentiation step has provided a new path to better understand the acquisition or persistence of effector function of mature T cells. In this review, we summarize emerging and, in some points, conflicting evidence for Notch signaling on mature T cell activation and differentiation.
