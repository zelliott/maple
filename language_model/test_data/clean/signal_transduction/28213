Consequences of human herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection include the induction of apoptosis and the concomitant synthesis of proteins which act to block this process from killing the infected cell. Recent data has clarified our current understanding of the mechanisms of induction and prevention of apoptosis by HSV. These findings emphasize the fact that modulation of apoptosis by HSV during infection is a multicomponent phenomenon. We review recent evidence showing how this important human pathogen modulates the fundamental cell death process.
