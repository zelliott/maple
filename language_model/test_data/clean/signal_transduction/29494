Uchida et al. show in this issue that in rat and human nephrosis, tyrosine phosphorylation of nephrin is reduced, and this is accompanied by a decrease in F-actin in glomeruli. This, together with previous studies, suggests that the nephrin protein complex is a signaling nexus that regulates actin dynamics in podocytes.
