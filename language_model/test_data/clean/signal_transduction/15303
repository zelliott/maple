Hippocampal dentate gyrus possesses an exceptional capacity of adaptation to ischemic insults. Recently, using a transient global ischemic model in the adult rat, we identified a neuroprotective signalling cascade in the dentate gyrus involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a major regulator of survival. We have shown that intracerebroventricular injections of anti-BDNF and anti-CREB are sufficient to cause substantial tissular damages and apoptotic deaths in late periods (48-72 h) after ischemia. Herein, we provide immunohistochemical and biochemical evidence that antibody-induced impairment of the protective CaMKIV/CREB/BDNF pathway induces an apparent duality of response in the dentate gyrus. The experimental protocol is performed as follows: (a) rats are anesthetized and vertebral arteries are occluded by electrocauterization; (b) on the following day, transient global ischemia is produced by occlusion of carotid arteries for 25 min; (c) finally, rats are infused with the pharmacologic agents into the left cerebral ventricle and then perfusion-fixed at different time points after ischemia for immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses. After infusion with anti-CaMKIV, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) MKK3, MKK6 and p38 and phospho-acetylation of histone H3 occur at 6 h after ischemia without presence of any caspase-9 activation and cellular injuries. In contrast, infusion of anti-BDNF or anti-CREB surprisingly results in a remarkable stimulation of casein kinase 2 (CK2) and caspase-9 activities at 48-72 h post-insult. This is accompanied by the disappearance of phosphorylation of MKK(3/6) and p38 and phospho-acetylation of histone H3. These results suggest that: (1) activation of a MKK(3/6)/p38/H3 cascade at early periods post-ischemia may be capable of causing a short transient protective effect in the dentate gyrus; (2) CK2 might be implicated in inhibition of activity of molecules such as MKK(3/6), p38 and deacetylases at late periods post-insult, thereby promoting injuries and cell deaths in the dentate cell layer.
