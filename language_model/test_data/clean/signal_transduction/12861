The role of BMPs in the development of the major noradrenergic centre of the brain, the locus coeruleus (LC), was investigated. LC generation is reflected by initial expression of the transcription factors Phox2a and Phox2b in dorsal rhombomere1 (r1), followed by expression of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase. Bmp5 is expressed in the dorsal neuroepithelium in proximity to Phox2-expressing cells. BMP inhibition in stage 10 chick embryos resulted in the lack of LC neurones or in their generation at the dorsal midline, and loss of roof plate and rhombic lip, but it did not affect neural crest development. These results reveal late essential BMP functions in the specification of dorsal neuronal phenotypes in r1, including LC neurones, and in the development of dorsal midline structures.
