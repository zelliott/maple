To assess the role of the conserved DPWXY motif of the seventh transmembrane domain in prostanoid receptor-mediated G protein activation, we have mutated the negatively charged Asp-318 in this motif of the Gi-coupled mouse prostaglandin EP3 receptor to uncharged but polar Asn (EP3-D318N) and to the non-polar Leu (EP3-D318L). The EP3 agonist and antagonist showed similar binding affinities for the wild-type and two mutant receptors. The wild-type and EP3-D318N receptors but not EP3-D318L receptor associated with Gi in guanine nucleotide- and pertussis toxin-sensitive manners. On the other hand, the wild-type receptor but not two mutant receptors had the ability to stimulate GTPase activity and to inhibit the adenylate cyclase. These findings demonstrate that the chemical nature of the amino acid residue at position 318 of the seventh transmembrane domain of the EP3 receptor dissociates the step of Gi association from that of subsequent Gi activation in the process of the EP3 receptor-Gi coupling.
