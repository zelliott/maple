ADP-induced P2y12 signaling is crucial for formation and stabilization of an arterial thrombus. We demonstrated recently in platelets from healthy subjects that insulin interferes with Ca2+ increases induced by ADP-P2y1 contact through blockade of the G-protein Gi, and thereby with P2y12-mediated suppression of cAMP.

Here we show in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) that platelets have lost responsiveness to insulin leading to increased adhesion, aggregation, and procoagulant activity on contact with collagen. Using Ser473 phosphorylation of protein kinase B as output for insulin signaling, a 2-fold increase is found in insulin-stimulated normal platelets, but in DM platelets there is no significant response. In addition, DM2 platelets show increased P2y12-mediated suppression of cAMP and decreased P2y12 inhibition by the receptor antagonist AR-C69931MX.

The loss of responsiveness to insulin together with increased signaling through P2y12 might explain the hyperactivity of platelets in patients with DM2.
