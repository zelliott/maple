The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) fulfils manifold tasks in the immune system acting in auto- and/or paracrine fashion. This includes regulation of apoptosis, migration and proliferation. Upon its generation by sphingosine kinases from plasma membrane sphingolipids, S1P can either act as a second messenger within cells or can be released from cells to occupy a family of specific G-protein-coupled receptors (S1P1-5). This diversity is reflected by the impact of S1P on macrophage biology and function. Over the last years it became apparent that the sphingosine kinase/S1P/S1P-receptor signalling axis in macrophages might play a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of the function of S1P in macrophage biology and discuss potential implications for pathology.
