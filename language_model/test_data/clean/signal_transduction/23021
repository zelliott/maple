The coordination of cell shape change and locomotion requires that actin polymerization at the cell cortex be tightly controlled in response to both intracellular and extracellular cues. The Arp2/3 complex - an actin filament nucleating and organizing factor - appears to be a central player in the cellular control of actin assembly. Recently, a molecular pathway leading from key signalling molecules to actin filament nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex has been discovered. In this pathway, the GTPase Cdc42 acts in concert with WASP family proteins to activate the Arp2/3 complex. These findings have led to a more complete picture of the mechanism of actin filament generation and organization during cell motility.
