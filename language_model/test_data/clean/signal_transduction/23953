Elucidation of signal transduction pathways involved in proliferation, cell cycle progression and the regulation of apoptosis has shown great promise in the treatment of various diseases including neoplastic, inflammatory, autoimmune, immunodeficiency, arthritic and neurodegenerative disorders. By understanding how these signal transduction pathways function, chemotherapeutic targets may be identified which will suppress or eliminate the disease. This information may eventually be translated into therapy, which would either eliminate or safely contain the patient's disease. This chapter will focus on basic tissue culture techniques which are used to elucidate signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, this chapter will provide a general background for understanding how gene transfer techniques can be used to elucidate signal transduction pathways as well as various pitfalls commonly encountered with their usage.
