Intrathecal baclofen therapy is an established treatment for severe spasticity. However, long-term management occasionally results in the development of tolerance. One of the mechanisms of tolerance is desensitization of Î³-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR) because of the complex formation of the GABAB2 subunit (GB2R) and G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 4 or 5. The current study focused on S(+)-ketamine, which reduces the development of morphine tolerance. This study was designed to investigate whether S(+)-ketamine affects the GABABR desensitization processes by baclofen.

The G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K channel currents induced by baclofen were recorded using Xenopus oocytes coexpressing G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K channel 1/2, GABAB1a receptor subunit, GB2R, and GRK. Translocation of GRKs 4 and 5 and protein complex formation of GB2R with GRKs were analyzed by confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis in baby hamster kidney cells coexpressing GABAB1a receptor subunit, fluorescent protein-tagged GB2R, and GRKs. The formation of protein complexes of GB2R with GRKs was also determined by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis.

Desensitization of GABABR-mediated signaling was suppressed by S(+)-ketamine in a concentration-dependent manner in the electrophysiologic assay. Confocal microscopy revealed that S(+)-ketamine inhibited translocation of GRKs 4 and 5 to the plasma membranes and protein complex formation of GB2R with the GRKs. Western blot analysis also showed that S(+)-ketamine inhibited the protein complex formation of GB2R with the GRKs.

S(+)-Ketamine suppressed the desensitization of GABABR-mediated signaling at least in part through inhibition of formation of protein complexes of GB2R with GRK 4 or 5.
