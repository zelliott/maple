E2F factors are involved in proliferation and apoptosis. To understand the role of E2F-1 in the epidermis, we screened wild type and E2F-1(-/-) keratinocyte mRNA for genes differentially expressed in the two cell populations. We demonstrate the reduced expression of integrins alpha(5), alpha(6), beta(1), and beta(4) in E2F-1(-/-) keratinocytes associated with reduced activation of Jun terminal kinase and Erk upon integrin stimulation. As a consequence of altered integrin expression and function, E2F-1(-/-) keratinocytes also show impaired migration, adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, and a blunted chemotactic response to transforming growth factor-gamma1. E2F-1(-/-) keratinocytes, but not dermal fibroblasts, exhibit altered patterns of proliferation, including significant delays in transit through both G(1) and S phases of the cell cycle. Recognizing that proliferation and migration are key for proper wound healing in vivo, we postulated that E2F-1(-/-) mice may exhibit abnormal epidermal repair upon injury. Consistent with our hypothesis, E2F-1(-/-) mice exhibited impaired cutaneous wound healing. This defect is associated with substantially reduced local inflammatory responses and rates of re-epithelialization. Thus, we demonstrate that E2F-1 is indispensable for a hitherto unidentified cell type-specific and unique role in keratinocyte proliferation, adhesion, and migration as well as in proper wound repair and epidermal regeneration in vivo.
