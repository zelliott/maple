The cell surface has various functions: communicating with other cells, integrating into the tissue, and interacting with the extracellular matrix. Proteases play a key role in these processes. This review focuses on cell-surface peptidases (ectopeptidases, oligopeptidases) that are involved in the inactivation or activation of extracellular regulatory peptides, hormones, paracrine peptides, cytokines, and neuropeptides. The nomenclature of cell-surface peptidases is explained in relation to other proteases, and information is provided on membrane anchoring, catalytic sites, regulation, and, in particular, on their physiological and pharmacological importance. Furthermore, nonenzymatic (binding) functions and participation in intracellular signal transduction of cell surfaces peptidases are described. An overview on the different cell-surface peptidases is given, and their divergent functions are explained in detail. An example of actual pharmacological importance, dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26), is discussed.
