Th cell differentiation is precisely regulated by thousands of genes at different stages. In the present study, we demonstrate that Dec2, a transcription factor belonging to the bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) superfamily, is progressively induced during the course of Th2 differentiation, especially at the late stage. The up-regulated Dec2 can strongly promote Th2 development under Th2-inducing conditions, as evidenced by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer or transgenic manipulation. In addition, an enhancement of Th2 responses is also detectable in Dec2 transgenic mice in vivo. Conversely, RNA interference-mediated suppression of endogenous Dec2 could attenuate Th2 differentiation. Finally, we show that the enhanced Th2 development is at least in part due to substantial up-regulation of CD25 expression elicited by Dec2, thereby resulting in hyperresponsiveness to IL-2 stimulation.
