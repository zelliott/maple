IL-33, a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines, has been shown to activate NF-κB and MAP kinase family through the IL-1 receptor-related protein, ST2L. In this study, we found that IL-33 rapidly activated a tyrosine kinase, JAK2. Interestingly, we demonstrated the functional involvement of JAK2 in IL-33-induced IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation, since a JAK2 inhibitor, AG490, effectively inhibited this signaling pathway. Furthermore, IL-33 failed to induce IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation in JAK2-deficient MEFs expressing ST2L, compared with wild-type MEFs expressing ST2L. In addition, the introduction of wild-type JAK2 but not kinase dead JAK2 mutant (K882R) restored the IL-33-induced efficient activation of NF-κB in JAK2-deficient MEFs expressing ST2L, resulting in the induction of IL-6, CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL1/KC expression. On the other hand, the activation of ERK, JNK and p38 was unaffected by JAK2 inhibition and JAK2 deficiency. Thus, these data demonstrate that JAK2 plays an important role in regulating IL-33-induced NF-κB activation.
