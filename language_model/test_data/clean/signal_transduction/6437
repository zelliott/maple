In the present study, we examined the mechanisms through which erythropoietin (Epo) activates the calcium-permeable transient receptor potential protein channel (TRPC)2. Erythroblasts were isolated from the spleens of phenylhydrazine-treated mice, and Epo stimulation resulted in a significant and dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). This increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was inhibited by pretreatment with the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122 but not by the inactive analog U-73343, demonstrating the requirement for PLC activity in Epo-modulated Ca(2+) influx in primary erythroid cells. To determine whether PLC is involved in the activation of TRPC2 by Epo, cell models were used to examine this interaction. Single CHO-S cells that expressed transfected Epo receptor (Epo-R) and TRPC2 were identified, and [Ca(2+)](i) was quantitated. Epo-induced Ca(2+) influx through TRPC2 was inhibited by pretreatment with U-73122 or by downregulation of PLCgamma1 by RNA interference. PLC activation results in the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), and TRPC2 has IP(3) receptor (IP(3)R) binding sites. To determine whether IP(3)R is involved in Epo-R signaling, TRPC2 mutants were prepared with partial or complete deletions of the COOH-terminal IP(3)R binding domains. In cells expressing TRPC2 IP(3)R binding mutants and Epo-R, no significant increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was observed after Epo stimulation. TRPC2 coassociated with Epo-R, PLCgamma, and IP(3)R, and the association between TRPC2 and IP(3)R was disrupted in these mutants. Our data demonstrate that Epo-R modulates TRPC2 activation through PLCgamma; that interaction of IP(3)R with TRPC2 is required; and that Epo-R, TRPC2, PLCgamma, and IP(3)R interact to form a signaling complex.
