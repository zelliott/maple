Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family members direct the differentiation of T helper cells, with specific STAT proteins promoting distinct effector subsets. STAT6 is required for the development of T helper 2 (Th2) cells, whereas STAT3 promotes differentiation of Th17 and follicular helper T cell subsets. We demonstrated that STAT3 was also activated during Th2 cell development and was required for the expression of Th2 cell-associated cytokines and transcription factors. STAT3 bound directly to Th2 cell-associated gene loci and was required for the ability of STAT6 to bind target genes. In vivo, STAT3 deficiency in T cells eliminated the allergic inflammation in mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin or transgenic for constitutively active STAT6. Thus, STAT3 cooperates with STAT6 in promoting Th2 cell development. These results demonstrate that differentiating T helper cells integrate multiple STAT protein signals during Th2 cell development.
