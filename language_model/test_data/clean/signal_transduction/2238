To study the role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors during early embryogenesis in Xenopus, we examined the temporal-spatial localization of Xenopus IP3 receptor (XIP3R). XIP3R protein is enriched in the animal hemisphere of early cleavage stage embryos and becomes localized in the ectoderm and involuted mesoderm in gastrula stage embryos. Up to tailbud stages, expression of XIP3R is observed in the mesodermal tissues and in most subregions of the central nervous system. A quantitative analysis of endogenous IP3 mass during normal early embryogenesis revealed an increase in IP3 mass first observed at early gastrula stage of 10.5 with an enrichment in the ectoderm throughout the gastrula stages, implying a potential role during gastrulation.
