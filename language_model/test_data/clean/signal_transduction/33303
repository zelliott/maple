The tetraspan cell surface glycoprotein, CD9, has been implicated in cellular signaling during growth and differentiation in the hematopoietic and nervous systems. Because CD9 expression is induced early in development in sensory and sympathetic neuroblasts, we investigated the role of CD9 in neurite outgrowth. We plated dissociated cells from neonatal sympathetic ganglia on immobilized anti-CD9 antibodies or antibodies against other cell surface molecules. We show here that B2C11, an anti-CD9 antibody that has been shown previously to activate Schwann cells in vitro, promotes robust neurite outgrowth from sympathetic neurons that is greater than that on other antibody surfaces and is comparable to neurite outgrowth on a collagen substratum. In addition, B2C11 causes dramatic morphological changes in neurons and glia from dissociated ganglia, including a flattening of these cells. Because CD9 interacts with integrins in many cell types including Schwann cells, and specifically with the alpha3beta1 integrin in some cells, we tested whether the effect of B2C11 on neurite outgrowth is mediated by this integrin. An anti-alpha3beta1 antibody, Ralph 3-1, attenuates the extent of neurite outgrowth on B2C11 and collagen, but not on laminin. Because the alpha3beta1 integrin has been shown to mediate neurite outgrowth on different substrates, these results provide a functional significance for the CD9-alpha3beta1 interaction; downstream signaling may be activated by this cis interaction on the cell surface in response to external cues that promote neurite outgrowth.
