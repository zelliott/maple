Retinoic acid (RA) is a teratogen that induces a variety of craniofacial abnormalities, including branchial arch deformities and cleft palate. Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C) is a recently identified member of the PDGF family. PDGF-C contributes to normal development of the heart, central nervous system, kidney and palatogenesis. But the roles of PDGF-C in branchial arches development and the relationship between PDGF-C and RA-induced branchial arches abnormalities are poorly understood. We examined the effects of RA on PDGF-C and its receptor PDGFR-alpha expressions. We demonstrated that administration of RA to mouse embryos resulted in dramatic losses of PDGF-C and its receptor PDGFR-alpha. Furthermore, we confirmed that blocking PDGF-C signaling by anti-PDGF-C neutralization antibody led to branchial arch malformations similar to that of RA induced, both hypoplastic branchial arches and FBA. These findings suggest the down-regulation of PDGF-C may be one of mechanisms of branchial arch abnormalities induced by RA and PDGF-C signaling is required for branchial arch morphogenesis.
