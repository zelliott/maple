The Hippo signalling pathway can suppress the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway through the last downstream effectors YAP (Yes-associated protein)/TAZ (tafazzin). MST (mammalian sterile 20-like kinase) 1 functions as the upstream kinase of the Hippo pathway, and CK1ε (casein kinase 1ε) plays roles in the up-stream signal transduction of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In the present study, using tandem affinity purification and MS analysis, CK1ε was identified as a novel partner of MST1. Further analysis showed that the interaction between MST1 and CK1ε was mediated by their kinase domains and enhanced by the activation of MST1. To exclude the interference of the phosphorylated YAP/TAZ, the transduction from MST1 to YAP/TAZ was blocked using anti-WW45 shRNA. In the sh-WW45 cells, MST1 still inhibited the Wnt3A-induced phosphorylation of DVL2 (dishevelled 2) and Wnt/β-catenin signalling by disturbing the interaction of DVL2 and CK1ε. The growth-suppressive effect of MST1 in the presence of Wnt3A was effectively relieved by the downstream activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Moreover, MST2, the close homologue of MST1, also displayed the similar function in suppressing the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Therefore the results of the present study revealed that, in addition to the phosphorylated YAP/TAZ, the Hippo pathway can suppress the Wnt/β-catenin pathway directly through MST1/2.
