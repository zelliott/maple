Cellular signaling pathways play crucial roles in cellular functions and design of effective therapies. Unfortunately, study of cellular signaling pathways remains formidably challenging because sophisticated cascades are involved, and a few molecules are sufficient to trigger signaling responses of a single cell. Here we report the development of far-field photostable-optical-nanoscopy (PHOTON) with photostable single-molecule-nanoparticle-optical-biosensors (SMNOBS) for mapping dynamic cascades of apoptotic signaling pathways of single live cells in real-time at single-molecule (SM) and nanometer (nm) resolutions. We have quantitatively imaged single ligand molecules (tumor necrosis factor α, TNFα) and their binding kinetics with their receptors (TNFR1) on single live cells; tracked formation and internalization of their clusters and their initiation of intracellular signaling pathways in real-time; and studied apoptotic signaling dynamics and mechanisms of single live cells with sufficient temporal and spatial resolutions. This study provides new insights into complex real-time dynamic cascades and molecular mechanisms of apoptotic signaling pathways of single live cells. PHOTON provides superior imaging and sensing capabilities and SMNOBS offer unrivaled biocompatibility and photostability, which enable probing of signaling pathways of single live cells in real-time at SM and nm resolutions.
