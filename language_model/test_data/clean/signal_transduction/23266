The CBL-CIPK signaling pathway represents a central and critical signaling system involved in plant response to abiotic stress and hormone signaling. In this study, we focused on AtCIPK6 gene, which have been shown to be required for development and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis, but the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of AtCIPK6 gene and whether it plays a role in ABA signaling is still unknown. Here, we showed that in addition to its expression induced by salt and drought stress, the transcripts of AtCIPK6 gene were largely accumulated in abscisic acid treated seedling, compared to basal level expression. Moreover, promoter sequence analysis revealed that there are some elements involved in stress and hormone response detected in the promoter region of AtCIPK6. AtCIPK6p:GUS transgenic assays unraveled that AtCIPK6 promoter is salt/osmotic stress- and ABA-inducible. Overexpression of AtCIPK6 gene in Arabidopsis increased plant tolerance to salt stress, but sensitivity to ABA. Our results contribute to the understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanism of AtCIPK6 gene and may also provide a good stress-inducible promoter candidate for transgenic engineering.
