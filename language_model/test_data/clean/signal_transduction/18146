The paper reviews recently described signalling mechanisms by which cumulus cells exposed to peak levels of gonadotropins, activate oocyte maturation. Cumulus cells react to LH with a prompt Ca raise which diffuses through gap junctions in a few minutes also into the oocyte where a local amplification system spreads the signal all over the cell. Few h later, still as a consequence of LH stimulation, cumulus cells undergo aprogressive depolarisation of their plasma membrane potential. Due to the electric coupling with these cells the oocyte depolarises too and this open specific voltage gated Ca channels responsible for a second wider and more sustained intracellular Ca rise. As a result of changes throughout maturation with a consequent modification of the size and charge of the molecules that can diffuse from one cell compartment to the other. This cell to cell interaction is further modified with cumulus expansion that leads to a progressive uncoupling of outer cumulus cells while the inner cell layer, corona radiata, remains in oocyte maturation by addressing to the oocyte nutrients and instructions in a well-orchestrated sequence. The identification of these mechanisms are a fundamental prerequisite for the development of in vitro systems suitable to produce oocytes matured in vitro with normal developmental competence.
