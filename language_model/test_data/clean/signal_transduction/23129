Angiotensin II (AII) receptor 1 (ATR1) and angiotensin converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) blockers have been shown to reduce acute cardiovascular events in patients, improve plaque stability and modify matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. However, the role of the ACE1/AII/ATR1 axis in interstitial collagenase regulation has not been fully explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of ATR1 and ACE1 blockade on the expression and activity of MMP-1, -8 and -13 in human carotid atheroma.

Atheroma samples (n = 24) were obtained from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. The effects of ATR1 (irbesartan), ACE1 (quinapril), ACE2 (DX600) and MMP (GM6001) blockade on the expression of AII, the interstitial collagenases and soluble elastin fragments were investigated in explant culture supernatants. Paired atheroma samples were incubated with intervention or media control for 4 days. Protein levels (AII, MMP-1, -8, -13 and soluble elastin) were determined by ELISA.

ATR1, but not ACE1, blockade significantly reduced MMP-1 and -8 concentrations in atheroma supernatants. ACE2 blockade significantly increased MMP-1 and -8 concentrations in atheroma supernatants. AII concentration in atheroma supernatants significantly increased after ATR1, ACE1 and ACE2 blockade. Release of soluble elastin fragments increased after ATR1 and ACE1 blockade, but was not changed by an MMP inhibitor.

Our findings suggest that ATR1 blockade alters AII, MMP-1, MMP-8 expression and a marker of elastin degradation in human atheroma, but that the elastin degradation response is not MMP driven. This data contributes to the recognised ability of ATR1 blockade to modify plaque stability.
