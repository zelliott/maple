Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers innate immune responses through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. Regulation of TLR signaling is a key step for inflammation, septic shock and innate/adaptive immunity. TLR signaling is shown to be regulated by cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (positive) and interleukin-10 and IL-4 (negative). However, molecular mechanisms of the regulation of LPS signaling by cytokines have not been clarified. Cytokine signaling is regulated by CIS/SOCS family proteins. Both SOCS1 and SOCS3 can inhibit JAK tyrosine kinase activity. We demonstrate that SOCS1 and SOCS3 play an important regulatory role in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) by modulating TLR signaling. SOCS1 negatively regulates not only the JAK/STAT pathway, but also the TLR-NF-kappaB pathway. SOCS3 protein was strongly induced by both IL-6 and IL-10 in the presence of LPS, but selectively inhibited IL-6 signaling. Therefore lack of SOCS3 gene in macrophages resulted in suppression of TLR signaling by hyperactivation of STAT3.
