Lymphokines are a group of signalling molecules involved in communication between cells, mainly those of the immune system. The lymphokines are multi-functional and most of them have mitogenic or co-mitogenic activity. An understanding of lymphokine biology is essential to understand how the immune system develops and functions and to provide a rationale for their use in immunotherapy. The potential to understand the cell biology of the lymphokines has recently become more apparent as molecular biological techniques have first of all produced recombinant factors and secondly have provided clues to the signal transduction pathways by cloning receptors, applying site-directed mutational analysis and also probing for specific promoters and enhancers that are activated along the signal pathway. This review discusses the information that has come from the recent analyses which blends with the biochemical analysis of the second messenger systems in an effort to understand the signalling pathways of the lymphokines.
