Anion channels are thought to participate in signal transduction and turgor regulation in higher plant cells. The regulation of hypocotyl cell elongation is a situation in which these channels could play important roles because it involves ionic fluxes that are implicated in turgor control and orchestrated by various signals. We have used a pharmacological approach to reveal the contribution of anion channels in the regulation of the development of hypocotyls by auxins. Auxins induce an inhibition of elongation, a disintegration of the cortical cell layers, and the formation of adventitious roots on Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls grown in the dark. Anion-channel blockers such as anthracene-9-carboxylic acid, 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2-2'-disulfonic acid, 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanato-stilbene-2-2'-disulfonic acid, and R(+)-methylindazone; indanyloxyacteic acid-94, which produce little or no stimulation of hypocotyl elongation by themselves, are able to counteract the inhibition and the disintegration induced by auxins with various efficiencies. This interference appears to be specific for auxins and does not occur when hypocotyl elongation is inhibited by other growth regulators such as ethylene or cytokinins. The putative involvement of anion channels in auxin signal transduction is discussed.
