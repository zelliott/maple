The signaling transduction processes involved in avulsion-induced motoneuron (MN) death have not been elucidated. Using the brachial plexus root avulsion rat model, we showed that avulsion-activated phosphorylation of phospholipase-Cγ (PLCγ) and protein kinase C (PKC) occurred in injured spinal MNs within 72 h of injury. Moreover, some MNs positive for PLCγ and PKC are also positive for avulsion-induced neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Inhibition of PLCγ/PKC signal pathway, either with PLCγ inhibitor, 1-[6-((17β-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl) amino)hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione, or with PLCγ siRNA augmented avulsion-induced MN death. 1-[6-((17β-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl) amino)hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione also inhibited PKC phosphorylation and exacerbated avulsion-induced reductions in the nNOS protein level in injured spinal segments. Moreover, activation of PLCγ/PKC signal pathway with PKC activator, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, decreased avulsion-induced MN death. The temporal profile of PLCγ/PKC signaling appears to be crucial for the survival of spinal MNs after root avulsion. Our data suggest that PLCγ mediates, while PKC and nNOS are associated with, the avulsion-induced MN death in brachial plexus root avulsion.
