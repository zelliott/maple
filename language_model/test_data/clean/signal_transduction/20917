The cloning of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor genes and the availability of specific receptor ligands allows characterization of Ang II receptor-mediated actions. Most of the well-known Ang II effects such as vasoconstriction, drinking response and cell proliferation are mediated through the AT1 receptor. Little is known about the physiological effect of the AT2 receptor, though there are some reports describing the involvement of the AT2 receptor in blood pressure regulation. Recent data demonstrate that the AT2-mediated actions are inhibitory to AT1- and mitogen-induced growth effects, indicating a balancing mechanism for Ang II-controlled mechanisms. It has also been demonstrated that AT2 receptor inactivation induces endothelial cell proliferation in the presence of Ang II. Additionally, AT2 receptor activation enhances nerve growth factor-induced differentiation of PCI2W cells and a role in apoptotic changes has also been reported. Based on recent findings, this article focuses on the role of Ang II in growth and differentiation processes with respect to the AT2 receptor in these events.
