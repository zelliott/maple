Nitric oxide (NO) seems to play a pivotal role in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced endothelial cell proliferation. This study was designed to investigate the role and intracellular signal pathway of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation induced by VEGF. ECV 304 cells were treated with VEGF(165) and then cell proliferation, eNOS protein and mRNA expression levels were analyzed to elucidate the functional role of eNOS in cell proliferation induced by VEGF. After exposure of cells to VEGF(165), eNOS activity and cell growth were increased by approximately two-fold in the VEGF(165) -treated cells compared to the untreated cells. In addition, VEGF stimulated eNOS expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) inhibitors were used to assess PI-3K involvement in eNOS regulation. LY294002 was found to attenuate VEGF-stimulated eNOS expression. Wortmannin was not as effective as LY294002, but the reduction effect was detectable. Cells activated by VEGF showed increased ERK1/2 levels. Moreover, the VEGF-induced eNOS expression was reduced by the PD98059, MAPK pathway inhibitor. This suggests that eNOS expression might be regulated by PI-3K and the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, VEGF(165) induces ECV 304 cell proliferation via the NO produced by eNOS. In addition, eNOS may be regulated by the PI-3K or mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.
