The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Mi-1 gene encodes a protein with putative coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat motifs. Mi-1 confers resistance to root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.), potato aphids (Macrosiphum euphorbiae), and sweet potato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci). To identify genes required in the Mi-1-mediated resistance to nematodes and aphids, we used tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to repress candidate genes and assay for nematode and aphid resistance. We targeted Sgt1 (suppressor of G-two allele of Skp1), Rar1 (required for Mla12 resistance), and Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90), which are known to participate early in resistance gene signaling pathways. Two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Sgt1 genes exist and one has been implicated in disease resistance. Thus far the sequence of only one Sgt1 ortholog is known in tomato. To design gene-specific VIGS constructs, we cloned a second tomato Sgt1 gene, Sgt1-2. The gene-specific VIGS construct TRV-SlSgt1-1 resulted in lethality, while silencing Sgt1-2 using TRV-SlSgt1-2 did not result in lethal phenotype. Aphid and root-knot nematode assays of Sgt1-2-silenced plants indicated no role for Sgt1-2 in Mi-1-mediated resistance. A Nicotiana benthamiana Sgt1 VIGS construct silencing both Sgt1-1 and Sgt1-2 yielded live plants and identified a role for Sgt1 in Mi-1-mediated aphid resistance. Silencing of Rar1 did not affect Mi-1-mediated nematode and aphid resistance and demonstrated that Rar1 is not required for Mi-1 resistance. Silencing Hsp90-1 resulted in attenuation of Mi-1-mediated aphid and nematode resistance and indicated a role for Hsp90-1. The requirement for Sgt1 and Hsp90-1 in Mi-1-mediated resistance provides further evidence for common components in early resistance gene defense signaling against diverse pathogens and pests.
