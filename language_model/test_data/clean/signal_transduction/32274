There is a need for the development of new safe and efficacious drug therapies             for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)‑negative breast cancers. 1-Methyl-3,5-bis[(E)-4-pyridyl)methylidene]-4-piperidone             (RL66) is a second generation curcumin analog that exhibits potent cytotoxicity             towards a variety of ER-negative breast cancer cells. Therefore, we have further             examined the mechanism of this novel drug in in vitro and in vivo models of ER-negative             breast cancer. The mechanistic studies demonstrated that RL66 (2 µM) induced cell             cycle arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, RL66 (2 µM) caused             40% of SKBr3 cells to undergo apoptosis after 48 h and this effect was time-dependent.             This correlated with an increase in cleaved caspase-3 as shown by western blot             analysis. RL66 (2 µM) also decreased HER2/neu phosphorylation and increased p27             in SKBr3 cells, while in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells RL66 (2 µM) significantly             decreased Akt phosphorylation and transiently increased the stress kinases JNK1/2             and MAPK p38. In addition, RL66 exhibited anti-angiogenic potential in vitro as             it inhibited HUVEC cell migration 46% and the ability of these cells to form tube‑like             networks. RL66 (8.5 mg/kg) suppressed the growth of MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors             by 48% compared to vehicle control following 10 weeks of daily oral administration.             Microvessel density in the tumors from treated mice was also decreased 57% compared             to control. Thus our findings demonstrate that RL66 has potent proapoptotic and             anti-angiogenic properties in vivo and in vitro and has the potential to be further             developed as a drug for the treatment of ER‑negative breast cancer.
