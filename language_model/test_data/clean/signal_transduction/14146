Energy homeostasis is crucial for maintaining normally functioning cells; disturbances in this balance often cause various diseases. The limb region 1 (LMBR1) domain containing 1 gene (lmbrd1) encodes the LMBD1 protein that possesses 9 putative transmembrane domains. LMBD1 has been suggested to be involved in the lysosome in aiding the export of cobalamin. In this study, we determined that LMBD1 plays a regulatory role in the plasma membrane. A micro-positron emission tomography analysis showed that a single-allele knock-out of lmbrd1 increased the (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in murine hearts. In addition, the knockdown of lmbrd1 resulted in an up-regulated signaling of the insulin receptor (IR) and its downstream signaling molecule, Akt. Confocal and live total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed that LMBD1 co-localized and co-internalized with clathrin and the IR, but not with the transferrin receptor. The results of the mutation analysis and phenotypic rescue experiments indicate that LMBD1 interacts with adaptor protein-2 and is involved in the unique clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the IR. LMBD1 selectively interacts with the IR. The knockdown of lmbrd1 attenuated IR endocytosis, resulting in the perturbation of the IR recycling pathway and consequential enhancement of the IR signaling cascade. In summary, LMBD1 plays an imperative role in mediating and regulating the endocytosis of the IR.
