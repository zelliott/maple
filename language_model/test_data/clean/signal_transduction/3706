Locomotion of T lymphocytes within three-dimensional collagen matrices is regulated via different signaling states of the cells. Purified human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells developed a spontaneously locomoting subpopulation of about 25% of the whole population immediately after incorporation into a three-dimensional collagen matrix analyzed by time-lapse videomicroscopy. This spontaneous locomotion was accompanied by enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Inhibition of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity using genistein significantly reduced the spontaneous locomotory activity. This reduction was overcome by subsequent activation of protein kinase C (PKC) using PMA, which led to a persistent increase of locomotory activity to more than 60% of the cells. Thus, the PKC-driven type of locomotion was independent of PTK activity, whereas spontaneous locomotion was not altered by inhibition of PKC activity using calphostin C or inhibition of the serine/ threonine phosphatases pp1 and pp2A using okadaic acid. We presume that PTK activity, especially tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, is decisively involved in the regulation of spontaneous T lymphocyte locomotion, which is independent of PKC activity. In contrast, PKC-driven locomotion is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation events, indicating that T lymphocyte locomotion is regulated by more than one signal transduction pathway. Furthermore, confocal microscopy analysis of phosphotyrosine residues, FAK, and PKC revealed an exclusive cellular distribution of these components, suggesting a regulation of T lymphocyte locomotion different from migration models developed for other cell types, which refer to a colocalization of FAK and PKC in focal adhesions.
