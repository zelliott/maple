Autoantibodies to the muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) cause the symptoms of human and experimental myasthenia gravis (EMG). AChR-specific CD4+ T cells permit development of these diseases, but the role(s) of the Th1 and Th2 subsets is unclear. The STAT4 and STAT6 proteins, which mediate intracellular cytokine signaling, are important for differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. Wild-type (WT) BALB/c mice, which are prone to develop Th2 rather than Th1 responses to Ag, are resistant to EMG. We have examined the role of Th1 and Th2 cells in EMG using STAT4 (STAT4-/-)- or STAT6 (STAT6-/-)-deficient BALB/c mice. After AChR immunization, STAT6-/- mice were susceptible to EMG: they developed more serum anti-AChR Ab, and had more complement-fixing anti-AChR IgG2a and 2b and less IgG1 than WT or STAT4-/- mice. The susceptibility to EMG of STAT6-/- mice is most likely related to the Th1 cell-induced synthesis of anti-AChR Ab, which trigger complement-mediated destruction of the neuromuscular junction. CD4+ T cells of the STAT6-/- mice had proliferative responses to the AChR comparable to those of WT and STAT4-/- mice, and recognized similar AChR epitopes. STAT6-/- mice had abundant AChR-specific Th1 cells, which were nearly absent in WT and STAT4-/- mice. Spleen and lymph nodes from STAT6-/- mice contained cells that secreted IL-4 when cultured with AChR: these are most likely STAT6-independent cells, stimulated in a non-Ag-specific manner by the cytokines secreted by AChR-specific Th1 cells.
