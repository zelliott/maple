The function of the temporally regulated B lymphocyte-specific immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) 3' enhancer has been linked to the IgH class switch machinery, but the physiological mechanism(s) of activation has not been discerned. Following crosslinking of the IgM receptor, we demonstrate that the enhancer is transactivated in the B lymphoma cell line BAL-17. In both induced primary B lymphocytes and BAL-17 cells, the enhancer activation is concomitant with the recruitment of a novel DNA binding complex, nuclear factor of activated B cells (NFAB). NFAB contains the tissue-restricted Ets protein Elf-1 and the AP-1 factors Jun-B and c-Fos, which bind to a novel 3' enhancer ETS-AP-1 motif. IgM receptor-mediated activation or stimulation by phorbol-ester in BAL-17 cells demonstrates that the ETS-AP-1 motif, when linked to a heterologous gene, can confer a ligand/receptor-dependent response. In NIH 3T3 cells, Elf-1 expression is required for efficient ETS-AP-1 promoter activity in response to stimulation by 12-O-tetradecanylphorbol 13-acetate. Our results suggest a biological role for Elf-1 in the regulation of IgH gene expression, attribute a functional role for receptor-induced AP-1 proteins in B lymphocytes and provide evidence for a direct link between IgM receptor-mediated signalling and 3' enhancer activation.
