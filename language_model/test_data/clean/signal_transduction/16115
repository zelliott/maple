Treatment of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) results in the activation of multiple signaling pathways. Exposure of HGF to LTA has been shown to result in the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of LTA-induced PI3K activation in HGFs. We found that LTA treatment results in the phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3). Inactivation of GSK-3 promotes the nuclear accumulation of Î²-catenin and expression of connexin43. Treatment with PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, inhibited LTA-induced phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3, demonstrating that these events require PI3K activation. This report is the first demonstration that LTA treatment activates AKT in HGFs.
