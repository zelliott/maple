Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase linked to the integrin and growth factor receptor-signalling pathways that regulates a number of the biological processes involved in neoplastic transformation, invasion and metastases, such as cell adhesion, migration and apoptosis. Its up-regulation might play a role in the tumourigenesis of invasive tumours, but its involvement in human lung cancer tissues has not yet been determined. We immunohistochemically compared FAK expression and localisation in 60 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues with that in the surrounding non-neoplastic tissue and in a further five microscopically normal lungs. FAK mRNA levels were quantitatively determined by real-time RT-PCR in frozen tissue specimens of all of the tumours and 21 matched non-neoplastic lung parenchymas, and protein expression in 16 homogenates of the matched neoplastic/non-neoplastic specimens was evaluated by Western blotting. The three different techniques showed that FAK is weakly expressed in non-neoplastic lung parenchyma and up-regulated in NSCLCs. Moreover, Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR indicated a statistically significant correlation between FAK up-regulation and higher disease stages (I+II versus III+IV, p=0.019 and 0.028, respectively). Our results provide evidence that FAK is up-regulated in NSCLCs, and suggest its potential involvement in lung cancer progression.
