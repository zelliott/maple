Previously, we reported that the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) inhibitor tricyclodecan-9-yl xanthogenate (D609) potentiates thapsigargin-induced Ca(2+) influx in human lymphocytes. In the present study we examined the effect of D609 on the thapsigargin-induced Na(+) entry. We found that the early phase of the thapsigargin-induced increase in the intracellular Na(+) concentration (approx. 1-2 min after stimulation) was attenuated after preincubation of lymphocytes with D609. By contrast, thapsigargin-induced Na(+) influx was not affected in the presence butan-1-ol, which inhibits phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PC-PLD). The thapsigargin-induced Na(+) influx could be mimicked by PC-PLC exogenously added to the lymphocyte suspension, whereas addition of PC-PLD had no effect. In addition, thapsigargin stimulated formation of the physiological PC-PLC products, diacylglycerol. Cell-permeable diacylglycerol analogue, dioctanoyl-glycerol (DOG), produced time- and concentration-dependent increase in the intracellular Na(+) concentration. Both thapsigargin- and DOG-induced Na(+) increases were not affected in the presence of Na(+)/H(+) antiport inhibitor, HOE609, or Na(+)/Ca(2+) antiport inhibitor, dimethylthiourea, as well as in the presence of Co(2+) and Ni(2+), which block store-operated Ca(2+) entry. By contrast, markedly reduced thapsigargin- and DOG-induced Na(+) influx were noted in the presence of flufenamic acid, which blocks the non-selective cation current (I(CRANC)). In conclusion, our results suggest that diacylglycerol released due to the PC-PLC activation contributes to the thapsigargin-induced Na(+) entry.
