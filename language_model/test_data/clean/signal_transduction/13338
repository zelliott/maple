Coactivators are diverse and multifunctional proteins that act downstream of DNA-binding activators to stimulate transcription. Recent studies elucidate the temporal sequence in which coactivators are recruited to target promoters, and how their enzymatic properties and molecular interactions culminate in transcriptional initiation.
