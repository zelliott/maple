Pharmacological and challenge study data showed an involvement of the serotonergic system in the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We studied transmission disequilibrium of polymorphisms in three candidate genes of the serotonergic pathway in 64 trios comprising patients with early onset OCD and both of their parents. Polymorphisms of the following genes were studied: tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (rs1800532), serotonin transporter (polymorphism in the promoter region; 5-HTTLPR) and the serotonin 1 B receptor (rs6296). This is, to our knowledge, one of the first family based association studies pertaining to children and adolescents with OCD. We did not detect transmission disequilibrium of the investigated polymorphisms in OCD. Hence, these polymorphisms do not play a major role in the genetic predisposition to early onset OCD.
