Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S-1-P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulated glycogen phosphorylase, a rate-limiting enzyme responsible for glycogenolysis, in association with Ca2+ mobilization and phospholipase C (PLC) activation in rat hepatocytes. S-1-P, but not LPA, also inhibited adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate accumulation reflecting adenylyl cyclase inhibition. S-1-P-induced PLC activation, Ca2+ mobilization, and phosphorylase activation were markedly enhanced by primary culture of the cells for 24 h, whereas the inhibitory adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate response was unchanged by increasing culture time. Activation of the PLC-Ca2+ system during primary culture was specific to the lysosphingolipid; PLC and Ca2+ responses to LPA and NaF were unchanged or slightly attenuated by increasing culture time. Pertussis toxin treatment almost completely suppressed the S-1-P-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase but hardly influenced the lipid-induced activation of PLC and its cascade reactions. We conclude that S-1-P, through an LPA receptor-independent mechanism, stimulates two signaling pathways, i.e., activation of the PLC-Ca2+ system and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, through distinct S-1-P receptor-transducer systems, resulting in the modulation of glycogenolysis in rat hepatocytes.
