Mitochondria dysfunction has been reported in various kidney diseases but how it leads to kidney fibrosis and how this is regulated is unknown. Here we found that mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) was induced in kidney tubular epithelial cells after unilateral ureteral obstruction in mice and that mice with ablated UCP2 resisted obstruction-induced kidney fibrosis. We tested this association further in cultured NRK-52E cells and found that TGF-β1 remarkably induced UCP2 expression. Knockdown of UCP2 largely abolished the effect of TGF-β1, whereas overexpression of UCP2 promoted tubular cell phenotype changes. Analysis using a UCP2 mRNA-3'-untranslated region luciferase construct showed that UCP2 mRNA is a direct target of miR-30e. MiR-30e was downregulated in tubular cells from fibrotic kidneys and TGF-β1-treated NRK-52E cells. A miR-30e mimic significantly inhibited TGF-β1-induced tubular-cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition, whereas a miR-30e inhibitor imitated TGF-β1 effects. Finally, genipin, an aglycone UCP2 inhibitor, significantly ameliorated kidney fibrosis in mice. Thus, the miR-30e/UCP2 axis has an important role in mediating TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and kidney fibrosis. Targeting this pathway may shed new light for the future of fibrotic kidney disease therapy.
