Extracellular matrix controls capillary endothelial cell sensitivity to soluble mitogens by binding integrin receptors and thereby activating a chemical signaling response that rapidly integrates with growth factor-induced signaling mechanisms. Here we report that in addition to integrins, growth factor receptors and multiple molecules that transduce signals conveyed by both types of receptors are immobilized on the cytoskeleton (CSK) and spatially integrated within the focal adhesion complex (FAC) at the site of integrin binding. FACs were rapidly induced in round cells and physically isolated from the remainder of the CSK after detergent-extraction using magnetic microbeads coated with fibronectin or a synthetic RGD-containing peptide. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that multiple signaling molecules (e.g., pp60c-src, pp125FAK, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, phospholipase C-gamma, and Na+/H+ antiporter) involved in both integrin and growth factor receptor signaling pathways became associated with the CSK framework of the FAC within 15 min after binding to beads coated with integrin ligands. Recruitment of tyrosine kinases to the FAC was also accompanied by a local increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, as indicated by enhanced phosphotyrosine staining at the site of integrin binding. In contrast, neither recruitment of signaling molecules nor increased phosphotyrosine staining was observed when cells bound to beads coated with a control ligand (acetylated low density lipoprotein) that ligates transmembrane scavenger receptors, but does not induce FAC formation. Western blot analysis confirmed that FACs isolated using RGD-beads were enriched for pp60c-src, pp125FAK, phospholipase C-gamma, and the Na+/H+ antiporter when compared with intact CSK or basal cell surface preparations that retained lipid bilayer. Isolated FACs were also greatly enriched for the high affinity fibroblast growth factor receptor flg. Most importantly, isolated FACs continued to exhibit multiple chemical signaling activities in vitro, including protein tyrosine kinase activities (pp60c-src and pp125FAK) as well as the ability to undergo multiple sequential steps in the inositol lipid synthesis cascade. These data suggest that many of the chemical signaling events that are induced by integrins and growth factor receptors in capillary cells may effectively function in a "solid-state" on insoluble CSK scaffolds within the FAC and that the FAC may represent a major site for signal integration between these two regulatory pathways. Future investigations into the biochemical and biophysical basis of signal transduction may be facilitated by this method, which results in isolation of FACs that retain the CSK framework as well as multiple associated chemical signaling activities.
