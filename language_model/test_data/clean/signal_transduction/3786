The aim of this study was to quantitate the density of guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein subunits (inhibitory G alpha i, stimulatory G alpha s, G alpha q/11, and G beta) in platelets of unipolar depressed patients to assess the status of these signal transduction proteins in depression and the effects of antidepressant drug treatment. Blood platelets were collected from 22 drug-free depressed patients and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The levels of the various G protein subunits were assessed by immunoblotting techniques. The immunoreactivity of G alpha 12 was increased (41%) and that of G alpha i3 decreased (25%) in platelets of depressed patients. The levels of other G protein subunits (G alpha s, G alpha q/11, G beta) did not change significantly with respect to those of control subjects. Chronic administration of cyclic antidepressant drugs (citalopram, clomipramine, imipramine) decreased the immunoreactivity of the up-regulated G alpha i2 protein (31%). Since platelet G alpha i2 is in line with the existence of supersensitivity of these receptors in major depression.
