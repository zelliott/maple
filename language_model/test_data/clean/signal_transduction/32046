Long-distance signaling is essential for coordination of plant development and environmental responses. We originally isolated a tiny mutant named bypass1 (bps1), which has defects in shoot and root development. The bps1 roots overproduce a mobile signal (bps signal) that arrests both root and shoot development. Our recent study demonstrated that all three BPS gene family members prevent ectopic synthesis of the same bps signal.bps multiple mutants show progressively more severe developmental defects. An embryogenesis analysis revealed abnormal cell divisions in all meristem lineages of bps triple mutants. These defects appear to be auxin independent, and arise prior to changes in PLT1 and PLT2 expression.
