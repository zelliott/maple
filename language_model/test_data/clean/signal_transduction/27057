The vav proto-oncogene encodes a 95 kDa protein which is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence has revealed the presence of a src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, 2 SH3 domains, a cysteine-rich region with similarity to protein kinase C, and a region highly similar to proteins with guanine nucleotide exchange activity on ras-like GTPases. Recent work has shown that vav is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to stimulation of surface membrane receptors in a variety of hematopoietic cell lines. Vav may play a role in hematopoietic cell signaling by coupling tyrosine kinase pathways to ras-like GTPases through the regulation of guanine nucleotide exchange.
