The BCR-ABL oncogene is the result of a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosome 9 and 22 t(9; 22). There is good experimental evidence demonstrating that BCR-ABL is the single causative abnormality in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), making it a unique model for the development of molecular targets. In addition to CML, BCR-ABL transcripts can be found in a minority of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias and very rarely in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Elucidating the molecular mechanisms and downstream pathways of BCR-ABL has led to the design of several novel therapeutic approaches. In this review, molecular targeting of BCR-ABL will be discussed based on the inhibition of protein tyrosine kinase activity, antisense strategies and immunomodulation.
