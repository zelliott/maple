The SKN7 two-component response regulator gene of Candida albicans was deleted, and the phenotype of the mutant was established. This mutant exhibited impaired growth on Spider agar and 10% serum agar compared to wild-type and gene-reconstituted strains. The skn7 mutant was sensitive to H(2)O(2) in vitro, but its virulence was only mildly attenuated. A comparison of the Skn7p and Ssk1p response regulators of C. albicans is discussed.
