The survival of pancreatic beta cells depends on the balance between external cytotoxic and protective molecular systems. The neuropeptide neurotensin (NT) has been shown to regulate certain functions of the endocrine pancreas including insulin and glucagon release. However, the mechanism of action of NT as well as the identification of receptors involved in the pancreatic functions of the peptide remained to be studied. We demonstrate here that NT is an efficient protective agent of pancreatic beta cells against cytotoxic agents. Both beta-TC3 and INS-1E cell lines and the mouse pancreatic islet cells express the three known NT receptors. The incubation of beta cells with NT protects cells from apoptosis induced either by staurosporine or by IL-1beta. In beta-TC3 cells, NT activates both MAP and PI-3 kinases pathways and strongly reduces the staurosporine or the Il-1beta-induced caspase-3 activity by a mechanism involving Akt activation. The NTSR2 agonist levocabastine displays the same protective effect than NT whereas the NTSR1 antagonist is unable to block the effect of NT suggesting the predominant involvement of the NTSR2 in the action of NT on beta cells. These results clearly indicate for the first time that NT is able to protect endocrine beta cells from external cytotoxic agents, a role well correlated with its release in the circulation after a meal.
