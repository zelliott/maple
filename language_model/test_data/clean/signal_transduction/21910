Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are C(6) aldehydes, alcohols, and their esters formed through the hydroperoxide lyase pathway of oxylipin metabolism. Plants start to form GLVs after disruption of their tissues and after suffering biotic or abiotic stresses. GLV formation is thought to be regulated at the step of lipid-hydrolysis, which provides free fatty acids to the pathway. Recently, studies dissecting the physiological significance of GLVs in plants have emerged, and it has been postulated that GLVs are important molecules both for signaling within and between plants and for allowing plants and other organisms surrounding them to recognize or compete with each other.
