Budding yeast adjusts to increases in external osmolarity via a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase signal pathway, the high-osmolarity glycerol response (HOG) pathway. Studies with a functional Hog1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion reveal that even under nonstress conditions the mitogen-activated protein kinase Hog1 cycles between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. The basal distribution of the protein seems independent of its activator, Pbs2, and independent of its phosphorylation status. Upon osmotic challenge, the Hog1-GFP fusion becomes rapidly concentrated in the nucleus from which it is reexported after return to an iso-osmotic environment or after adaptation to high osmolarity. The preconditions and kinetics of increased nuclear localization correlate with those found for the dual phosphorylation of Hog1-GFP. The duration of Hog1 nuclear residence is modulated by the presence of the general stress activators Msn2 and Msn4. Reexport of Hog1 to the cytoplasm does not require de novo protein synthesis but depends on Hog1 kinase activity. Thus, at least three different mechanisms contribute to the intracellular distribution pattern of Hog1: phosphorylation-dependent nuclear accumulation, retention by nuclear targets, and a kinase-induced export.
