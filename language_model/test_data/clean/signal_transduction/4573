While the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) effect of raising intracellular Ca(2+) levels has been shown to rely on G(q/11) and PLC activation, the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of ERG K(+) channels by TRH are still partially unknown. We have analysed the effects of βγ scavengers, Akt/PKB inactivation, and TRH receptor (TRH-R) overexpression on such regulation in native and heterologous expression cell systems. In native rat pituitary GH(3) cells β-ARK/CT, Gα(t), and phosducin significantly reduced TRH inhibition of rERG currents, whereas in HEK-H36/T1 cells permanently expressing TRH-R and hERG, neither of the βγ scavengers affected the TRH-induced shift in V                         (1/2). Use of specific siRNAs to knock Akt/PKB expression down abolished the TRH effect on HEK-H36/T1 cell hERG, but not on rERG from GH(3) cells. Indeed, wortmannin or long insulin pretreatment also blocked TRH regulation of ERG currents in HEK-H36/T1 but not in GH(3) cells. To determine whether these differences could be related to the amount of TRH-Rs in the cell, we studied the TRH concentration dependence of the Ca(2+) and ERG responses in GH(3) cells overexpressing the receptors. The data indicated that independent of the receptor number additional cellular factor(s) contribute differently to couple the TRH-R to hERG channel modulation in HEK-H36/T1 cells. We conclude that regulation of ERG currents by TRH and its receptor is transduced in GH(3) and HEK-H36/T1 cell systems through common and different elements, and hence that the cell type influences the signalling pathways involved in the TRH-evoked responses.
