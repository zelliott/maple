Mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are involved in critical aspects of cellular growth and genomic stability. Each complex contains one of two highly homologous ATPases, BRG1 and BRM, yet little is known about their specialized functions. We show that BRG1and BRM associate with different promoters during cellular proliferation and differentiation, and in response to specific signaling pathways by preferential interaction with certain classes of transcription factors. BRG1 binds to zinc finger proteins through a unique N-terminal domain that is not present in BRM. BRM interacts with two ankyrin repeat proteins that are critical components of Notch signal transduction. Thus, BRG1 and BRM complexes may direct distinct cellular processes by recruitment to specific promoters through protein-protein interactions that are unique to each ATPase.
