Upon treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), primary B cells proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells with concomitant up-regulation of immunoglobulin (Ig) gene expression. Here we examine the role of the Igkappa 3' enhancer in this process using a kappa3'-enhancer-driven beta-globin reporter gene in transgenic mice. We find that LPS treatment up-regulates kappa3' enhancer activity as a function of differentiation rather than proliferation, since proliferation only (induced by cross-linking of CD40) is insufficient to activate the element, whilst differentiation with only limited proliferation (LPS + transforming growth factor-beta) does allow activation to occur. The Igkappa 3' enhancer is also induced by cross-linking of surface Ig and this signal can synergize with LPS activation, suggesting that distinct activation pathways are used. Nevertheless, both of these pathways can be inhibited by co-cross-linking of CD40. Thus Ig enhancers in the heavy and light chain loci are differentially regulated in response to CD40.
