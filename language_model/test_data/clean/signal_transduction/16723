Wnt signaling elicits changes in gene expression and cell physiology through beta-catenin and LEF1/TCF proteins. The signal transduction pathway regulates many cellular and developmental processes, including cell proliferation, cell fate decisions and differentiation. In cells that have been stimulated by a Wnt protein, cytoplasmic beta-catenin is stabilized and transferred to the nucleus, where it interacts with the nuclear mediators of Wnt signaling, the LEF1/TCF proteins, to elicit a transcriptional response. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments in the mouse have provided insight into the role of this signaling pathway in lymphopoiesis. The self-renewal and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells is regulated by Wnt signals. Differentiation of T cells and natural killer cells is blocked in the absence of LEF1/TCF proteins, and pro-B cell proliferation is regulated by Wnt signaling.
