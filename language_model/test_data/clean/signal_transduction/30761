We describe a method for rapid identification of protein kinase substrates. Cdk1 was engineered to accept an ATP analog that allows it to uniquely label its substrates with a bio-orthogonal phosphate analog tag. A highly specific, covalent capture-and-release methodology was developed for rapid purification of tagged peptides derived from labeled substrate proteins. Application of this approach to the discovery of Cdk1-cyclin B substrates yielded identification of >70 substrates and phosphorylation sites. Many of these sites are known to be phosphorylated in vivo, but most of the proteins have not been characterized as Cdk1-cyclin B substrates. This approach has the potential to expand our understanding of kinase-substrate connections in signaling networks.
