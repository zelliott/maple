Incidences of lung cancer and pleural plaque have been reported in relation to exposure to anthophyllite asbestos. To investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of anthophyllite, chemiluminescence (CL) detection of reactive oxygen metabolite (ROM) generation of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) stimulated by anthophyllite asbestos was determined and compared with that of other asbestos and mineral fiber samples. When anthophyllite fiber sample was mixed with the luminol-primed PMN, high levels of CL which exhibited a specific time course characterized by two separate peaks were induced. The CL induced by anthophyllite sample was greater than that induced by chrysotile, crocidolite, and amosite asbestos. We further investigated the two peaks of CL using specific inhibitors of signal transduction mechanisms. The two peaks of CL by anthophyllite sample were different in sensitivity to cytochalasin B and genistein; the former relates to the cytoskeleton-dependent mechanism and the latter has been shown to inhibit tyrosine kinase, which resides in the pathway to cause PMN activation. The strong ROM reaction of PMN by anthophyllite suggests that the surface characteristics of the fiber may participate in the pathogenic mechanisms of anthophyllite asbestos.
