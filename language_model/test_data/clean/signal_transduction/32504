IL-7 is a single-chain 25 kDa protein first identified in bone marrow cultures through its pre-B cell growth factor properties, then also described as a potent T-lymphocyte growth factor. This review relates to the molecular and functional aspects of interleukin-7 (IL-7) and its receptor (IL-7R). We focused on the role of IL-7 in T-cell activation, cytotoxicity generation, leukemic cell growth and immunotherapy.
