Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) selectively evokes an inward (excitatory) current in cultured lobster olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and directly activates two types of channels in cell-free patches of plasma membrane from the ORNs. The IP3-activated channels have kinetic properties of odor-activated channels in the ORNs and pharmacological properties of intracellular IP3-activated channels in other systems. An antibody directed against an intracellular, cerebellar IP3 receptor recognizes a protein with a molecular weight similar to the mammalian receptor in the ORNs. The antibody selectively increases odor-evoked inward currents and IP3-activated unitary currents in the ORNs. The data provide further evidence for IP3 as an olfactory second messenger and implicate at least one and possibly two novel plasma membrane IP3 receptors in olfactory transduction.
