Behavioral responses to osmotic upshift were characterized by temporal assays of free-swimming cells of Escherichia coli. Small osmotic upshifts (200 to 300 mosM) elicited tumble responses which were chemotaxis dependent, while large osmotic upshifts (400 to 500 mosM) elicited stopping followed by pseudotumbling which was chemotaxis independent.
