Selective inhibition of the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase by imatinib (STI571, Glivec/Gleevec) is the therapeutic strategy in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Despite significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses with imatinib, mainly due to the mutations in the Abl kinase domain, resistance occurs in patients with advanced disease. In the present study on imatinib-resistant K562 cells (IR-K562), however, no such mutations in the Abl kinase domain were observed. Further studies revealed the over-expression of COX-2 and MDR-1 in IR-K562 cells suggesting the possible involvement of COX-2 in the development of resistance to imatinib. So, we sought to examine the effect of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, on IR-K562 cells. The results clearly indicate that celecoxib is more effective in IR-K562 cells with a lower IC50 value of 10 microM compared to an IC50 value of 40 microM in K562 cells. This increase in the sensitivity of IR-K562 cells towards celecoxib suggests that the development of resistance in IR-K562 cells is COX-2 dependent. Further studies revealed down-regulation of MDR-1 by celecoxib and a decline in p-Akt levels. Celecoxib-induced apoptosis of IR-K562 cells led to release of cytochrome c, PARP cleavage and decreased Bcl2/Bax ratio. Also, celecoxib at 1 microM concentration induced apoptosis in IR-K562 cells synergistically with imatinib by reducing the IC50 value of imatinib from 10 to 6 microM. In conclusion, the present study indicates over-expression of COX-2 and MDR-1 in IR-K562 cells and celecoxib, a COX-2 specific inhibitor, induces apoptosis by inhibiting COX-2 and down-regulating MDR-1 expression through Akt/p-Akt signaling pathway.
