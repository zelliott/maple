5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the key enzyme in leukotriene biosynthesis. Leukotrienes are key mediators of inflammation, allergic and innate immune reactions. 5-LO expression is mainly restricted to a variety of immune competent cells including B-lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages. Here, we studied the effects of the growth or differentiation factors TGFbeta, 1,25(OH)2D3, GM-CSF and TNFalpha on 5-LO mRNA and protein expression and on 5-LO activity in human monocytes. We found that cultivation of monocytes under standard culture conditions downregulates 5-LO mRNA expression which could be prevented by addition of the four factors. Monocyte 5-LO activity was serum-dependent and cultivation of the cells in serum-free medium strongly downregulated cellular 5-LO activity which could be prevented by TGFbeta, 1,25(OH)2D3, GM-CSF and TNFalpha to different extents. The protein kinase A activator dibutyryl-cAMP blocked the effects of the four factors. The data suggest that 5-LO expression and activity in monocytes is strongly regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory growth or differentiation factors.
