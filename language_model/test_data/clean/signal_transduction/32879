The pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 inhibits insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-dependent proliferation in hormone-responsive breast cancer cells. However, the interactions of ICI 182,780 with IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) intracellular signaling have not been characterized. Here, we studied the effects of ICI 182,780 on IGF-IR signal transduction in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and in MCF-7-derived clones overexpressing either the IGF-IR or its 2 major substrates, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) or src/collagen homology proteins (SHC). ICI 182,780 blocked the basal and IGF-I-induced growth in all studied cells in a dose-dependent manner; however, the clones with the greatest IRS-1 overexpression were clearly least sensitive to the drug. Pursuing ICI 182,780 interaction with IRS-1, we found that the antiestrogen reduced IRS-1 expression and tyrosine phosphorylation in several cell lines in the presence or absence of IGF-I. Moreover, in IRS-1-overexpressing cells, ICI 182,780 decreased IRS-1/p85 and IRS-1/GRB2 binding. The effects of ICI 182,780 on IGF-IR protein expression were not significant; however, the drug suppressed IGF-I-induced (but not basal) IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation. The expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC as well as SHC/GRB binding were not influenced by ICI 182,780. In summary, downregulation of IRS-1 may represent one of the mechanisms by which ICI 182,780 inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells. Thus, overexpression of IRS-1 in breast tumors could contribute to the development of antiestrogen resistance.
