To investigate the regulation of epithelium growth factor receptor (EGFR), pan-Ras, and extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) with both a ras homologue member I (ARHI) suppression and epithelium growth factor (EGF) stimulation.

After identification and implication, the constructed plasmid pIRES2-EGFP-ARHI was transfected into Panc-1. The untransfected cell was also explored as controls. The growth curve was drawn to indicate the proliferation effect of ARHI. EGFR-ELISA was performed to investigate the expression of EGFR. Western blot analysis was used to investigate the expression of protein MAPK/ERK1/2, pan-Ras in Panc-1.

The proliferation rate of Panc-1 was inhibited by ARHI compared with both empty plasmid and untransfected cell. The amount of EGFR was parallel in both transfected and untransfected cell but affected by EGF stimulation. The amount of pan-Ras was decreased after ARHI transfection. The optimum concentration of EGF effect on P-ERK was 50 ng/ml.

Both ARHI and EGF play roles in the EGF-EGFR-Ras-Raf-MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway.
