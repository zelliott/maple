Soluble guanylate cyclase catalyzes the formation of cyclic GMP using GTP as substrate. It is now well established that soluble guanylate cyclase is highly activated by nitric oxide, and that many of the effects of nitric oxide on various cells and tissues are mediated through increased production of cyclic GMP. This review discusses the evidence for the presence of soluble guanylate cyclases in different classes of cells in vertebrate retina and the role of these enzymes in retinal physiology. It is concluded that the enzyme is present in nearly every class of cells in the retina and that it may be involved in signal transmission between some cells and in the modulation of signal transmission between others.
