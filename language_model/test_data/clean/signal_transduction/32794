CRF exerts a key neuroregulatory control on the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. These effects are thought to be mediated primarily through activation of Gs-coupled plasma membrane receptors. In the present study, we investigated the effects of activation of CRF receptors by sauvagine on signaling pathways that converge on phosphorylation of the transcription factor calcium/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Studies were undertaken using CHO cell lines transfected with either rat CRF-1 or CRF-2alpha receptors. Signaling pathways were investigated using immunocytochemical, Western blot, and imaging techniques. Treatment with sauvagine increased phosphorylation of p42/p44, but not of p38 or stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases correlating with increased p42/p44 MAP kinase activity. Mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores was observed in cells treated with high concentrations (100 nM, 1 microM) of sauvagine. A time- and dose-dependent increase in phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB was observed in cultures treated with sauvagine. Phosphorylation of CREB occurred at lower concentrations of sauvagine than those required to mobilize intracellular calcium stores, and phosphorylation was not blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 at a concentration (1 microM) that fully inhibited phosphorylation of MAP kinase. Cotreatment of cultures with the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 (10 microM) blocked fully the stimulatory actions of sauvagine (0.1 nM, 1 nM) on phosphorylation of CREB, but not those on phosphorylation of MAP kinase. Phosphorylation of MAP kinase was partially blocked by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (5 microM) and by the phosphoinositide-phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (10 microM). These data demonstrate that cAMP-, Ca2+-, and MAP kinase-dependent signaling pathways are activated by stimulation of CRF-1 and CRF-2alpha receptors. However, in these cells, only protein kinase A-dependent pathways contribute significantly to enhanced phosphorylation of CREB. These represent the first reported observations of CRF receptor-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB and activation of MAP kinase signal transduction pathways.
