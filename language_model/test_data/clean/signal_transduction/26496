OBJECTIVE To summary the functional roles and molecular mechanisms of microRNA (miRNA) in osteoblast differentiation so as to supply information for basic and clinical researches.

Recent literature concerning miRNA in osteoblast differentiation was reviewed. The information was classified and summarized.

miRNAs critically regulate bone morphogenetic protein, transforming growth factor beta, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways during osteoblast differentiation. In pathological conditions, especially in some disorders of abnormal osteoblast differentiation, down-regulated miRNA expression has been observed.

miRNA may represent a novel biomarker for diagnosis, and a candidate target therapies for the disorders with abnormal osteoblast differentiation.
