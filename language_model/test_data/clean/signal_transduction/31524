Our understanding of the regulation of vascular development has exploded over the past decade. Prior to this time, our knowledge of vascular development was primarily based on classic descriptive studies. The identification of stem cells, lineage markers, specific growth factors and their receptors, and signalling pathways has facilitated a rapid expansion in information regarding details of the mechanisms that govern development of the vascular system.
