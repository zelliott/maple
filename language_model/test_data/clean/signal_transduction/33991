This study investigated the possible interaction between the heme oxygenase (HO)/biliverdin reductase (BVR) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway in murine gastric fundus and jejunum, since previous studies have shown that both HO-2 and BVR are expressed in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and co-localized with neuronal NOS in a large proportion of myenteric neurons along the gastrointestinal tract. Neither HO inhibition by chromium mesoporphyrin (CrMP) nor co-incubation with CO or biliverdin/bilirubin affected nitrergic neurotransmission - i.e. relaxations induced by non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) nerve stimulation or exogenous NO - under normal physiological conditions. However, biliverdin/bilirubin reversed the inhibitory effect of the superoxide generator LY83583 on exogenous NO-induced relaxations in both tissues. When gastric fundus muscle strips were depleted of the endogenous antioxidant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) by the Cu-chelator DETCA, electrically induced NANC relaxations were also affected by LY82583; however, biliverdin/bilirubin could not substitute for the loss of Cu/Zn SOD when this specific antioxidant enzyme was depleted. In jejunal muscle strips, the combination DETCA plus LY83583 nearly abolished contractile phasic activity and, hence, did not allow studying nitrergic relaxation in these experimental conditions. In conclusion, this study does not establish a role for HO/CO in inhibitory NANC neurotransmission in murine gastric fundus and jejunum under normal physiological conditions. However, the antioxidants biliverdin/bilirubin might play an important role in the protection of the nitrergic neurotransmitter against oxidative stress.
