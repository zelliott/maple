Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important to initiate the innate immune response to a wide variety of pathogens. The protective role of TLRs during infection with protozoan parasites has been established. In this regard, malaria represents an exception where activation of TLRs seems to be deleterious to the host. In this article, we review the recent findings indicating the contrasting role of Myeloid Differentiation Primary-Response gene 88 (MyD88) and TLRs during malaria and infection with other protozoa. These findings suggest that MyD88 may represent an Achilles' heel during Plasmodium infection.
