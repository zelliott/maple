Inflammatory responses are thought to be mediated in part by the prostaglandins derived from arachidonic acid (AA) by the action of prostaglandin H synthase, also referred to as cyclooxygenase (COX). The mitogen-inducible isoform, COX-2, is over-expressed in numerous chronic inflammatory disease conditions and in neoplasms from both human and experimental animal models. COX-1 expression, on the other hand, has been referred to as constitutive or non-inducible. In this study, we present evidence demonstrating autoregulation of prostaglandin (PG) production by the PGs themselves and their precursor, AA. We observed that AA and PGs induced COX-2, as well as COX-1, expression in cultured murine keratinocytes approximately 3 h after treatment. In primary keratinocytes transiently transfected with a full-length COX-2 promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene, we observed enhanced transcription by AA, PGE(2), and the other prostaglandins. Forskolin, a known activator of adenylate cyclase, and dibutryl-cAMP, a cAMP analog, induced COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA, suggesting that cAMP is a second messenger for COX expression. SQ 22536, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, inhibited COX-2 mRNA induction by PGE(2) in a dose-dependent manner suggesting that PGE(2)-induced expression may be through one of the cAMP-linked PGE(2) receptors. The results of this study demonstrate that both COX-1 and COX-2 are inducible. Further, both COX isoforms can be up-regulated by their products, the PGs, and this autoregulation probably occurs via prostaglandin receptors linked to a cAMP signal transduction pathway.
