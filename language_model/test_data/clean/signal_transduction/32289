The neurotrophic effects of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) on rat sensory neuronal cell line ND7/23 cells were investigated. PACAP caused a concentration-dependent increase in the number of neurite-bearing cells and the expression of the substance P precursor (PPT) mRNA in 24Â h. The effects of PACAP were mimicked by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide with lower potency and dibutyryl-cyclic AMP, and inhibited by inhibitors of protein kinase A, ERK kinase or p38 kinase, KT5720, U0126, or SB203580, respectively. In a PPT promoter luciferase reporter assay, the increase of PPT mRNA was the result of an increase in PPT gene transcriptional activity by PACAP. The increasing effects of PACAP on PPT mRNA were similarly observed in primary cultured rat dorsal root ganglion cells. Thus, PACAP could induce differentiation-like phenomena in sensory neurons in a cAMP-, protein kinase A-, ERK kinase-, and p38 kinase-dependent manner. These results provide evidence of the neurotrophic action of PACAP, which may function to rescue damaged neurons or to switch the neuronal phenotype in injured or inflamed sensory neurons.
