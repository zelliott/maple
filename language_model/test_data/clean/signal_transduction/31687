The herb Liriope platyphylla (LP) has been considered to have curative properties             for diabetes, asthma and neurodegenerative disorders. To examine the effects of             steaming time and frequency of manufactured red LP (RLP) on the nerve growth factor             (NGF) secretion ability and NGF receptor signaling pathway, the NGF concentration,             cell differentiation, NGF signaling pathway and calcium concentration were analyzed             in neuronal cells treated with several types of LPs manufactured under different             conditions. The maximum NGF secretion was observed in B35 cells treated with 50             Âµg/ml LP extract steamed for 9 h (9-SLP) and with two repeated steps (3 h steaming             and 24 h air-dried) carried out 7 times (7-SALP). No significant changes in viability             were detected in any of the cells treated with the various LPs, with the exception             of 0-SLP and 0-SALP. In addition, PC12 cell differentiation was induced by treatment             with the NGF-containing conditional medium (CM) collected from the RLP-treated             cells. The levels of TrkA and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation             in the high affinity NGF receptor signaling pathway were significantly higher             in the cells treated with 3-SLP or 1-SALP/3-SALP CM compared with those treated             with the vehicle CM. In the low affinity NGF receptor pathway, the expression             levels of most components were higher in the 9-, 15- and 24-SALP CM-treated cells             compared with the vehicle CM-treated cells. However, this level was significantly             altered in cells treated with 3-SALP CM. Furthermore, an examination of the RLP             function on calcium regulation revealed that only the LP- or RLP-treated cells             exhibited changes in intracellular and extracellular calcium levels. RLP induced             a significant decrease in the intracellular calcium levels and an increase in             the extracellular calcium levels. These results suggest the possibility that steaming-processed             LP may aid in the relief of neurodegenerative diseases through the NGF secretion             ability and NGF signaling pathway.
