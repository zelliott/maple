Understanding how mineral particles trigger cellular responses is crucial in order to elucidate what characteristics determine their harmful effects. It is not clear whether cellular effects are triggered through the cell membrane or require particle uptake. However, studies with asbestos suggest that activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) may be important. We have previously reported that crystalline silica-induced interleukin (IL)-8 release from human lung epithelial cells (A549) was regulated through Src family kinases (SFKs) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1 and -2. The present study shows that SFK and p38 phosphorylation increased almost immediately upon crystalline silica exposure, whereas ERK1/2 phosphorylation increased after 10 min of exposure. The p38 inhibitor SB202190 increased the silica-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation suggesting that p38 activity may attenuate activation of ERK1/2. Scanning electron microscopy showed that some silica particles were phagocytosed between 1 and 4h of exposure, but that the majority remained bound by microvilli on the cell surface. The EGFR inhibitor AG1478 attenuated both silica-induced IL-8 release and phosphorylation of SFKs and ERK1/2. However, AG1478 also inhibited the respective background levels, and the EGFR was not phosphorylated at the onset of silica exposure. The results suggest that crystalline silica triggers p38 and SFK-ERK1/2 signaling through interactions with membrane components as both pathways were rapidly activated prior to particle internalization. However, the silica-induced up-regulation of IL-8 release through the SFK-ERK1/2 pathway does not appear to be initiated through activation of the EGFR, although basal EGFR activity may affect the magnitude of the responses.
