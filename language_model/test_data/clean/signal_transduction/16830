Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) has traditionally been thought of as a phytotoxin, having deleterious effects on the plant growth and survival. It is now recognized that plants have enzymes which generate H₂S, cysteine desulfhydrase, and remove it, O-acetylserine lyase. Therefore, it has been suggested that H₂S is considered as a signalling molecule, alongside small reactive compounds such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and nitric oxide (NO). Exposure of plants to low of H₂S, for example from H₂S donors, is revealing that many physiological effects are seen. H₂S seems to have effects on stomatal apertures. Intracellular effects include increases in glutathione levels, alterations of enzyme activities and influences on NO and H₂O₂ metabolism. Work in animals has shown that H₂S may have direct effects on thiol modifications of cysteine groups, work that will no doubt inform future studies in plants. It appears therefore, that instead of thinking of H₂S as a phytotoxin, it needs to be considered as a signalling molecule that interacts with reactive oxygen species and NO metabolism, as well as having direct effects on the activity of proteins. The future may see H₂S being used to modulate plant physiology in the field or to protect crops from postharvest spoilage.
