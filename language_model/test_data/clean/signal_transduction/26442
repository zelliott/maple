Signalling in malaria parasites is a field of growing interest as its components may prove to be valuable drug targets, especially when one considers the burden of a disease that is responsible for up to 500 million infections annually. The scope of this review is to discuss external stimuli in the parasite life cycle and the upstream machinery responsible for translating them into intracellular responses, focussing particularly on the calcium signalling pathway.
