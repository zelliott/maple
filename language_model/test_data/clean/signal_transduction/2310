Protein kinase CK2 is a ubiquitous protein kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser and Thr residues specified by acidic side chains in many proteins, including several key enzymes, growth factor receptors, transcription factors and cytoskeletal proteins. The holoenzyme is composed of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits, the latter having antagonistic roles. CK2 is constitutively active and its targeting seems to be modulated through association with a variety of cellular proteins (e.g. heat shock protein 90 and p53). CK2 is abnormally elevated in proliferating and neoplastic tissues and recent studies suggest that mice overexpressing CK2 develop leukemia. Specific inhibitors of CK2, currently being developed, may have therapeutic potential.
