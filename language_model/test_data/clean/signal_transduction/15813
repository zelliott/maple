Recent studies have demonstrated the significance of the leukemia oncogene Evi1 as the regulator of hematopoietic stem cells and marker of poor clinical outcomes in myeloid malignancies. Evi1-mediated leukemogenic activities include a wide array of functions such as the induction of epigenetic modifications, transcriptional control, and regulation of signaling pathways. We have recently succeeded in comprehensively elucidating the oncogenic function of Evi1 in a model of the polycomb-Evi1-PTEN/AKT/mTOR axis. These results may provide us with novel therapeutic approaches to conquer the poor prognosis associated with Evi1-activated leukemia or other solid tumors with high Evi1 expression. Here, we review the current understanding of the role of Evi1 in controlling the development of leukemia and highlight potential modalities for targeting factors involved in Evi1-regulated signaling.
