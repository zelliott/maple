p130Cas (Cas, Crk-associated substrate) is an adaptor molecule composed of a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a substrate domain (SD) and a Src binding domain (SBD). The SH3 domain of Cas associates with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), but its role in cellular function has not fully been understood. To address this issue, we established and analyzed primary fibroblasts derived from mice expressing a truncated Cas lacking exon 2, which encodes the SH3 domain (Cas Deltaexon 2). In comparison to wild-type cells, Cas exon 2(Delta/Delta) cells showed reduced motility, which could be due to impaired tyrosine-phosphorylation of FAK and Cas, reduced FAK/Cas/Src/CrkII binding, and also impaired localization of Cas Deltaexon 2 to focal adhesions on fibronectin. In addition, to analyze downstream signaling pathways regulated by Cas exon 2, we performed microarray analyses. Interestingly, we found that a deficiency of Cas exon 2 up-regulated expression of CXC Chemokine Receptor-4 and CC Chemokine Receptor-5, which may be regulated by IkappaBalpha phosphorylation. These results indicate that the SH3-encoding exon of Cas participates in cell motility, tyrosine-phosphorylation of FAK and Cas, FAK/Cas/Src/CrkII complex formation, recruitment of Cas to focal adhesions and regulation of cell motility-associated gene expression in primary fibroblasts.
