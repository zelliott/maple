Miniature eye movements jitter the retinal image unceasingly, raising the question of how perceptual continuity is achieved during visual fixation. Recent work discovered suppression of visual bursts in the superior colliculus around the time of microsaccades, tiny jerks of the eyes that support visual perception while gaze is fixed. This finding suggests that corollary discharge, supporting visual stability when rapid eye movements drastically shift the retinal image, may also exist for the smallest saccades.
