G-protein cascades provide amplification in a wide variety of biological signal transducers--from hormonal and synaptic systems to the receptor cells of vision and olfaction. Through recent understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved, it is possible to construct a quantitative description of the amplification and speed of response of the cascade. The gain and kinetics can now be described in terms of physical parameters, such as enzyme activities and the densities and lateral diffusion coefficients of the proteins involved.
