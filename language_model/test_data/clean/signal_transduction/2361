In Xenopus laevis development, beta-catenin plays an important role in the Wnt-signaling pathway by establishing the Nieuwkoop center, which in turn leads to specification of the dorsoventral axis. Cadherins are essential for embryonic morphogenesis since they mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion and can modulate beta-catenin signaling. alpha-catenin links beta-catenin to the actin-based cytoskeleton. To study the role of endogenous alpha-catenin in early development, we have made deletion mutants of alphaN-catenin. The binding domain of beta-catenin has been mapped to the NH2-terminal 210 amino acids of alphaN-catenin. Overexpression of mutants lacking the COOH-terminal 230 amino acids causes severe developmental defects that reflect impaired calcium-dependent blastomere adhesion. Lack of normal adhesive interactions results in a loss of the blastocoel in early embryos and ripping of the ectodermal layer during gastrulation. The phenotypes of the dominant-negative mutants can be rescued by coexpressing full-length alphaN-catenin or a mutant of beta-catenin that lacks the internal armadillo repeats. We next show that coexpression of alphaN-catenin antagonizes the dorsalizing effects of beta-catenin and Xwnt-8. This can be seen phenotypically, or by studying the effects of expression on the downstream homeobox gene Siamois. Thus, alpha-catenin is essential for proper morphogenesis of the embryo and may act as a regulator of the intracellular beta-catenin signaling pathway in vivo.
