Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare tumour arising from neural crest-derived parafollicular C-cells. Metastatic MTC patients are incurable because the cancer does not respond to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene plays a key role in the development of MTC. However, one-half of the sporadic MTC do not carry RET mutations. Mice models and early evidence obtained in human samples suggest that other genes, including those encoding components of the RB1 (retinoblastoma) and TP53 tumour-suppressor pathways, may be involved in MTC formation. Here, we review the data on the involvement of genes acting in the RET and RB1/TP53 pathways in MTC. Understanding genetic lesions that occur in MTC is a prerequisite to identifying molecular therapeutic targets in MTC and in improving the efficacy of RET-targeted therapies.
