Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates both bone formation and resorption by activating diverse osteoblast signalling pathways. Upstream signalling for PTH stimulation of protein kinase C-alpha (PKCalpha) membrane translocation and subsequent expression of the pro-resorptive cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) was investigated in UMR-106 osteoblastic cells. PTH 1-34, PTH 3-34, PTHrP and PTH 1-31 stimulated PKCalpha translocation and IL-6 promoter activity. Pharmacologic intervention at the adenylyl cyclase (AC) pathway (forskolin, IBMX, PKI) failed to alter PTH 1-34- or PTH 3-34-stimulated PKCalpha translocation. The phosphoinositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) antagonist U73122 slightly decreased PTH 1-34-stimulated PKCalpha translocation; however, the control analogue U73343 acted similarly. Propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphohydrolase, decreased diacylglycerol (DAG) formation and attenuated PTH 1-34- and PTH 3-34-stimulated PKCalpha translocation and IL-6 promoter activity, suggesting a phospholipase D (PLD)-dependent mechanism. This is the first demonstration that PLD-mediated signalling leads to both PKC-alpha translocation and IL-6 promoter activation in osteoblastic cells.
