The cells of monocyte-macrophage (Mphi) lineage play important roles both in innate and adaptive immune responses. They are the first line of defence in body and their job is to phagocytose a foreign invader, the pathogen, digest it and remove it. Mphi help body in mounting the antigenspecific immune response by presenting the digested pathogen antigen in conjunction with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules to recruit B and T lymphocytes response. Usually Mphi succeed in their job of eliminating most pathogens from the body but sometimes the pathogen strikes a "friendship" with them and starts using them for its benefit. A number of pathogens, including dengue virus (DV), subvert Mphi and use them for their replication, increasing the severity of damage to the body. This duality may be related to the fact that Mphi serve as efficient host cell for DV replication, in addition to being responsible for innate immunity and for initiating adaptive immune responses. This review gives a brief overview of the various roles of Mphi (enmity and friendship) during dengue virus infection.
