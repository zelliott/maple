MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules involved in the expressional regulation of genes by inhibiting gene translation. MicroRNAs are recruited and incorporated into the miRISC, ribonucleoprotein complex, targeting specific mRNAs through mechanisms specific for a miRNA sequence. Here we review the biogenesis, regulation, and monitoring of miRNAs, as well as the current evidence for potential roles of miRNAs in human diseases associated with activation of the endothelin system. These diseases include cancer, kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, and blood diseases, that may all be aggravated by aberrant miRNA expression. In this review we will also discuss regulatory mechanisms determining production of miRNA as well as measuring or targeting miRNAs as potential novel approaches for diagnosis and treatment. Targeting miRNAs possibly will allow one to detect diseases or to interfere with the progression of diseases associated with activation of the endothelin system.
