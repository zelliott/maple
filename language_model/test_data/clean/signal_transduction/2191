The amount and type of eicosanoids made can be affected by the type of fat consumed in the diet. It is now apparent that both eicosanoids and n-3 PUFAs are potent modulators of lymphocyte and M phi functions in vitro. Inclusion in the diet of high levels of certain lipids containing n-3 PUFAs markedly affects the functions of cells of the immune system subsequently tested in vitro. Cellular components of both natural and acquired immunity are affected. In vivo tests are perhaps the most appropriate approach for determining the effect of different dietary n-3 PUFAs upon immune function. Several studies indicate that diets rich in n-3 PUFAs are anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive in vivo, although there have been relatively few studies in man. Although some of the effects of n-3 PUFAs may be brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, it is clear that these fatty acids can also elicit their effects by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms (Fig. 12). Such n-3 PUFA-induced effects may be of use as a therapy for acute and chronic inflammation, for disorders which involve an inappropriately-activated immune response and for the enhancement of graft survival.
