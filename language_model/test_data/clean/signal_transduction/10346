The incorporation of growth factors into new methylidene malonate 2.1.2-based biocompatible polymeric blends of oligomers and polymers to improve their stability and controlled release was investigated. Five growth factors were used in this study: FGF2, PDGF, TGF-beta, NGF and GM-CSF. Formulation in poly(methylidene malonate 2.1.2) blends was achieved by a four-step optimized process, using different oligomers/polymers ratios. Once dried, formulations could be subsequently stored at 4 or 20 degrees C or immediately subjected to degradation in conditioned cell culture medium. Toxicity of blends and their degradation products were evaluated in several cell lines with MTT. Bioactivity and biospecificity of the formulated growth factors were investigated using MTT and immunohistochemical staining. Combined ELISA and crystal violet colorimetric assays were performed to analyze growth factors release. Limited toxicities were observed for unloaded poly(methylidene malonate 2.1.2) blends. Once optimized, growth factors formulations did not reveal lower bioactivities or loss of biospecificity. Moreover, a sustained release over a 21-day period with more than 90% of preserved bioactivity was reached. To conclude, dual growth factor delivery was made possible by the mean of poly(methylidene malonate 2.1.2) blends. These studies demonstrate the ability of methylidene malonate 2.1.2-based polymeric blends for the delivery of growth factors.
