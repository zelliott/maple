Cell therapy is a promising option for the treatment of acute or chronic myocardial ischemia. The intracoronary infusion of cells imposes the potential risk of cell clotting, which may be prevented by the addition of anticoagulants. However, a comprehensive analysis of the effects of anticoagulants on the function of the cells is missing.

Here, we investigated the effects of heparin and the thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin on bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell (BMC) functional activity and homing capacity.

Heparin, but not bivalirudin profoundly and dose-dependently inhibited basal and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)-induced BMC migration. Incubation of BMCs with 20 U/mL heparin for 30 minutes abrogated SDF-1-induced BMC invasion (16±8% of control; P<0.01), whereas no effects on apoptosis or colony formation were observed (80±33% and 100±44% of control, respectively). Pretreatment of BMCs with heparin significantly reduced the homing of the injected cells in a mouse ear-wound model (69±10% of control; P<0.05). In contrast, bivalirudin did not inhibit in vivo homing of BMCs. Mechanistically, heparin binds to both, the chemoattractant SDF-1 and its receptor, chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), blocking CXCR4 internalization as well as SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling after SDF-1 stimulation.

Heparin blocks SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling by binding to the ligand as well as the receptor, thereby interfering with migration and homing of BMCs. In contrast, the thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin did not interfere with BMC homing or SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling. These findings suggest that bivalirudin but not heparin might be recommended as an anticoagulant for intracoronary infusion of BMCs for cell therapy after cardiac ischemia.
