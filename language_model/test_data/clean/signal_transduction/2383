IgA was obtained from HIV-infected haemophilic patients and the intracellular signals triggered by its reaction with isolated rat intestinal strips were studied. HIV+ IgA stained intestinal microvilli with a granular immunofluorescence pattern and bound to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), displacing the specific muscarinic cholinergic antagonist QNB in a non-competitive manner. It triggered the signals that are the consequence of mAChR stimulation in the intestine. Thus, it decreased cAMP synthesis and increased guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) formation and phosphoinositide (PI) turnover of the intestine. In addition, it stimulated prostaglandin E2(PGE2) synthesis by intestinal strips. Through its effect on PGE2 synthesis, HIV+ IgA could have a dual action. On the one hand, it could enhance immunosuppression at a local level, favouring pathogen growth and subsequent intestinal dysfunction. On the other hand, PGE2 could directly increase intestinal motility and electrolyte/fluid loss. Both effects could be involved in intestinal damage in AIDS.
