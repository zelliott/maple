In the bone marrow, multipotent and committed hematopoietic progenitors have to closely regulate their balance between sustained proliferation without differentiation (self renewal) and entering a terminal differentiation pathway. A useful model to analyze this regulation at the molecular level is committed avian erythroid progenitors. These are induced to undergo long-term self renewal by the ligand-activated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-ErbB, in cooperation with steroid hormone receptors. This self-renewal induction by c-ErbB even occurs in the presence of differentiation factors (erythropoietin and insulin). Under the same conditions, the RTK c-Kit is unable to sustain erythroid progenitor self renewal, stimulating cell proliferation without arresting terminal differentiation. Two mechanisms are involved in these differential activities of c-Kit and c-ErbB. The first one, differential regulation of receptor expression, proved to be of minor importance, because c-Kit was unable to induce self renewal, even if exogenously expressed from a retrovirus at high levels. Rather our results support the second mechanism, i.e., that receptor-specific signal transduction is responsible for the differential biological activity of c-Kit and c-ErbB: (a) specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tryphostins) were found which selectively inhibited the biological function of either c-Kit or c-ErbB in erythroblasts but did not affect ligand-induced autophosphorylation of either RTK; and (b) c-ErbB selectively induced SHC phosphorylation and STAT5 activation. The Ras pathway was similarly activated by c-Kit and c-ErbB. The c-ErbB-specific tyrphostin AG30 specifically blocked STAT5 activation, implicating this signal transducer in c-ErbB-induced self renewal.
