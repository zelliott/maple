Many integral membrane proteins use the same translocation machinery for membrane insertion as secretory proteins use to get across the membrane. This requires that transmembrane segments can be discriminated from other parts of the protein during membrane translocation, and further requires that the transmembrane segments can be moved laterally out of the translocation channel into the surrounding lipid. The molecular basis for this remarkable intramembraneous sorting event is a major focus of current studies of membrane protein biogenesis.
