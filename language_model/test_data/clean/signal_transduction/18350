The effects of cannabinoids on motor behaviors and cognitive functions are well documented. The discovery of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor and the mapping of its distribution in the central nervous system have provided a rationale to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cannabinoid actions. The identification of naturally occurring ligands for these receptors, anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol, has prompted a large research effort aimed at investigating the physiological role of the endogenous cannabinoid system, as well as its potential use as a target for novel therapeutic interventions. This mini-review discusses the participation of the endogenous cannabinoid system in the regulation of motor behaviors, pointing out its possible involvement in the pathophysiology of psychomotor disorders.
