By contrast to chloroplasts, our knowledge of amyloplasts--organelles that synthesize and store starch in heterotrophic plant tissues--is in a formative stage. While our understanding of what is considered their primary function, i.e. the biosynthesis and degradation of starch, has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little is known about other biochemical processes taking place in these organelles. To help fill this gap, a proteomic analysis of amyloplasts isolated from the starchy endosperm of wheat seeds (10 d post-anthesis) has been conducted. The study has led to the identification of 289 proteins that function in a range of processes, including carbohydrate metabolism, cytoskeleton/plastid division, energetics, nitrogen and sulphur metabolism, nucleic acid-related reactions, synthesis of various building blocks, protein-related reactions, transport, signalling, stress, and a variety of other activities grouped under 'miscellaneous'. The function of 12% of the proteins was unknown. The results highlight the role of the amyloplast as a starch-storing organelle that fulfills a spectrum of biosynthetic needs of the parent tissue. When compared with a recent proteomic analysis of whole endosperm, the current study demonstrates the advantage of using isolated organelles in proteomic studies.
