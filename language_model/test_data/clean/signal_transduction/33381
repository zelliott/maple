The complex range of pituitary regulatory mechanisms reviewed here underlies the critical function of the pituitary in sustaining all higher life forms. Thus, the ultimate net secretion of pituitary hormones is determined by signal integration from all three tiers of pituitary control. It is clear from our current knowledge that the trophic hormone cells of the anterior pituitary are uniquely specialized to respond to these signals. Unravelling their diversity and complexity will shed light upon the normal function of the master gland. Understanding these control mechanisms will lead to novel diagnosis and therapy of disordered pituitary function (357).
