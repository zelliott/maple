We have analyzed the effect of CD3/T-cell receptor stimulation on GTP hydrolysis and GTP binding. We show that stimulation of Jurkat, T-cell, membranes with OKT3 results in a 50% increase in GTP hydrolysis which is specifically inhibited by GDP. Pretreatment of the membranes with neither pertussis toxin nor cholera toxin inhibited the GTP hydrolysis. We also show that stimulation with OKT3 increases the binding of GTP gamma S to Jurkat membranes. These data strongly implicate the involvement of a G-protein in CD3/T-cell receptor signalling.
