Ag-induced mature T cell apoptosis is the result of death-inducing cytokines, including the ligand for CD95 (Apo-1/Fas). This raises the possibility that expression of this death molecule could affect bystander T cells that were not directly antigenically stimulated but that express the CD95 receptor. We show here that bystander T cells, even if they express the CD95 receptor, are not killed when exposed to T cells undergoing Ag-induced apoptosis. Rather, cell death is restricted to T cells that bear the receptor clonotype that is specifically engaged by TCR ligands. At least one mechanism of clonotype restriction is a significant enhancement of CD95-induced apoptosis by TCR ligation. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to the well-known ability of TCR to stimulate apoptosis by inducing CD95 ligand expression, TCR signals at the time of CD95 engagement can effectively increase apoptosis. Therefore, we put forward the hypothesis that strict clonotype specificity is preserved when death cytokines such as CD95 ligand induce autoregulatory mature T cell apoptosis, at least in part through a sensitization signal provided by the TCR stimulation.
