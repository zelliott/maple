The coupling of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in a variety of biological processes; however, little is known regarding the involvement of the autophagy/ER stress pathway in early embryogenesis or the underlying mechanism(s). Here, we showed that the developmental competence of in vitro-produced (IVP) bovine embryos was highly dependent on the autophagy/ER stress balance. Although relative abundances of autophagy-associated gene transcripts, including LC3, Atg5, and Atg7 transcripts, were high in oocytes and throughout the early stages of preattachment development, extensive autophagosome formation was only detected in fertilized embryos. Using an inducer and inhibitor of autophagy, we showed that transient elevation of autophagic activity during early preattachment development greatly increased the blastocyst development rate, trophectoderm cell numbers, and blastomere survival; these same parameters were reduced by both inhibition and prolonged induction of autophagy. Interestingly, the induction of autophagy reduced ER stress and associated damage, while the developmental defects in autophagy-inhibited embryos were significantly alleviated by ER stress inhibitor treatment, indicating that autophagy is a negative regulator of ER stress in early embryos. Collectively, these results suggest that early embryogenesis of IVP bovine embryos depends on an appropriate balance between autophagy and ER stress. These findings may increase our understanding of important early developmental events by providing compelling evidence concerning the tight association between autophagy and ER stress, and may contribute to the development of strategies for the production of IVP bovine blastocysts with high developmental competence.
