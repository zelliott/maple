Plant response to abiotic stresses depends upon the fast activation of molecular cascades involving stress perception, signal transduction, changes in gene and protein expression and post-translational modification of stress-induced proteins. Legumes are extremely sensitive to flooding, drought, salinity and heavy metal stresses, and soybean is not an exception of that. Invention of immobilized pH gradient strips followed by advancement in mass spectrometry has made proteomics a fast, sensitive and reliable technique for separation, identification and characterization of stress-induced proteins. As the functional translated portion of the genome plays an essential role in plant stress response, proteomic studies provide us a finer picture of protein networks and metabolic pathways primarily involved in stress tolerance mechanism. Identifying master regulator proteins that play key roles in the abiotic stress response pathway is fundamental in providing opportunities for developing genetically engineered stress-tolerant crop plants. This review highlights recent contributions in the field of soybean biology to comprehend the complex mechanism of abiotic stress acclimation. Furthermore, strengths and weaknesses of different proteomic methodologies of extracting complete proteome and challenges and future prospects of soybean proteome study both at organ and whole plant levels are discussed in detail to get new insights into the plant abiotic stress response mechanism.
