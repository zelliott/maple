We investigated the signal-transduction pathway of canine distemper virus-Onderstepoort (CDV-Ond) vaccine strain-mediated apoptosis in Vero cells. Canine distemper virus-Onderstepoort at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 induced DNA fragmentation 48 h after infection. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that 57% +/- 4% of the CDV-N-protein-positive cells were terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive, and all TUNEL-positive cells were CDV-N-protein-positive, indicating that CDV-Ond induced apoptosis only in the infected cells. We also found that CDV-Ond infection induced activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8. In the semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for apoptosis-related genes, the expression of mRNA of the death receptor, Fas, was also increased in CDV-Ond-infected cells. In contrast, the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax, regulators for intrinsic apoptotic signaling through the mitochondria, did not change. These results suggest that CDV-Ond induced apoptosis by activating caspase-3, possibly through caspase-8 signaling rather than through p53/Bax-mediated, mitochondrial signaling in the infected cells.
