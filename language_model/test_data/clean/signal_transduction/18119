Many developmental processes are regulated by intercellular signaling mechanisms that employ the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases. One model system that has been particular useful in determining the role of receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling processes in cell fate determination is the developing Drosophila eye. The specification of the R7 photoreceptor cell in each ommatidium of the developing Drosophila eye is dependent on activation of the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase. This review will focus on the genetic and biochemical approaches that have identified signaling molecules acting downstream of the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase which ultimately trigger differentiation of the R7 photoreceptor cell.
