Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease with a 5-year survival rate of 4%. The only opportunity for improved survival continues to be complete surgical resection for those with localized disease. Although chemotherapeutic options are limited for the few patients with resectable disease, this problem is even more magnified in the majority (85%) of patients with unresectable or metastastic disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improved therapeutic options. The recent success of inhibitors of signal transduction for the treatment of other cancers supports the need to identify and validate aberrant signaling pathways important for pancreatic tumor growth. This review focuses on the validation of specific signaling networks and the present status of inhibitors of these pathways as therapeutic approaches for pancreatic cancer treatment.
