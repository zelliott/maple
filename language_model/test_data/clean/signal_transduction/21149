The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sodium butyrate on calcium mobilization. Histamine was found to stimulate a dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) through H1 receptors, but this effect was attenuated in C6 cells pretreated with 1-5 mM sodium butyrate. Evidence is provided that release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Experiments with BAPTA that show lower levels of [Ca2+]i in cells pretreated with higher concentrations of sodium butyrate suggest that sodium butyrate also decreases Ca2+ influx. These results suggest that changes in Ca2+ mobilization are at least partially responsible for sodium butylate-induced C6 cell differentiation.
