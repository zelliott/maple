Lung cancer (LC) is the major cause of death by cancer and the number of LC patients is increasing worldwide. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of gene delivery using suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1), an endogenous inhibitor of intracellular signaling pathways, for the treatment of LC. To examine the antitumor effect of SOCS-1 overexpression on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, NSCLC cells (A549, LU65, and PC9) were infected with adenovirus-expressing SOCS-1 vector. The cell proliferation assay showed that A549 and LU65, but not PC9, were sensitive to SOCS-1 gene-mediated suppression of cell growth. Although JAK inhibitor I could also inhibit proliferation of A549 and LU65 cells, SOCS-1 gene delivery appeared to be more potent as SOCS-1 could suppress focal adhesion kinase and epidermal growth factor receptor, as well as the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. Enhanced phosphorylation of the p53 protein was detected by means of phospho-kinase array in SOCS-1 overexpressed A549 cells compared with control cells, whereas no phosphorylation of p53 was observed when JAK inhibitor I was used. Furthermore, treatment with adenoviral vector AdSOCS-1 in vivo significantly suppressed NSCLC proliferation in a xenograft model. These results suggest that the overexpression of SOCS-1 gene is effective for antitumor therapy by suppressing the JAK/STAT, focal adhesion kinase, and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathways and enhancing p53-mediated antitumor activity in NSCLC.
