Chronic treatment of rat parotid gland acinar cells with either epidermal growth factor (EGF) or the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol leads to cell proliferation through activation of the tyrosine kinase second messenger signalling pathway. Activation of p21ras activity in acinar cells was evaluated by measuring the levels of protein bound GTP and GDP. Both EGF and isoproterenol increased the amount of p21ras-GTP complex during active proliferation. The increase in bound GTP appears to be the result of an increased activity for the Ras-guanine nucleotide exchange factor.
