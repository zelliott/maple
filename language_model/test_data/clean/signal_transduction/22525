Studies describing the tumor as a hierarchically organized cell population have changed the classical oncogenesis view and propose new therapeutic strategies. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to sustain tumor initiation/maintenance, therapy resistance, and systemic metastases. Targeting this tumor cell population is crucial to achieve a true cancer cure. A large research effort is now aiming to develop drugs targeting CSCs, based either on a priori understanding of key pathways regulating CSC biology or on high-throughput screening to identify novel targets and compounds.
