In the present study, we investigated the antidepressive activity of opiorphin with central administration in the forced swim test in mice. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of opiorphin (1-6 μg/mouse) dose-dependently decreased the immobility time, which was reversed by nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, δ-selective naltrindole and μ-selective β-FNA. The data suggested that central administration of opiorphin produced an antidepressant-like effect by activating both μ and δ opioid receptors indirectly. In order to eliminate the possibility of a false-positive result in the forced swim test, locomotor activity was checked in both non-habituated and habituated mice. Opiorphin had no influence on non-habituated mice, though had weak effect on habituated mice. In addition, mice treated with opiorphin did not display any convulsive behaviors.
