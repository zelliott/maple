Notch signaling allows cells in contact to adopt different fates. Regulation of the Notch pathway allows for the same signaling mechanism to be used in a wide variety of contexts during development. Intracellular activities of the E3 ubiquitin ligases Sel-10 and Neuralized involve proteasome-dependent degradation in the regulation of Notch pathway activity. Extracellular manipulations of Notch by Fringe and Scabrous regulate the pathway by changing Notch interactions outside the cell. These regulatory mechanisms, along with many others, affect how Notch signaling activity influences cell fate determination.
