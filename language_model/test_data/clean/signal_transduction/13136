Sympathetic ganglia are composed of noradrenergic and cholinergic neurons. Cholinergic sympathetic neurons are characterized by the expression of choline acetyl transferase (ChAT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). To investigate the role of cytokine growth factor family members in the development of cholinergic sympathetic neurons, we interfered in vivo with the function of the subclass of cytokine receptors that contains LIFRbeta as essential receptor subunit. Expression of LIFRbeta antisense RNA interfered with LIFRbeta expression and strongly reduced the developmental induction of VIP expression. By contrast, ganglion size and the number of ChAT-positive cells were not reduced. These results demonstrate a physiological role of cytokines acting through LIFRbeta-containing receptors in the control of VIP expression in sympathetic neurons.
