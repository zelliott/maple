Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and growth differentiation factors (GDFs) control the development and homeostasis of multiple tissue types in many organisms, from humans to invertebrates. These morphogens are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and they signal by binding to serine-threonine kinase receptors, resulting in coordinated changes in gene expression that regulate the differentiation and development of multiple tissue types. In addition, these proteins are regulated post-transcriptionally through binding to several soluble proteins. In this review we focus on a subset of BMPs and GDFs that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
