Light regulation of seeding morphogenesis is mediated by photoreceptors that perceive red, far-red, blue and UV light. Photomorphogenetic mutants of Arabidopsis have identified several of the primary photoreceptors, as well as a set of negative regulators of seedling photomorphogenesis, including DET1, that appear to act downstream of the photoreceptors. To study the regulatory context in which DET1 acts to repress photomorphogenesis, we used a simple morphological screen to isolate extragenic mutations in six loci, designated ted (for reversal of the det phenotype), that partially or fully suppress the seeding morphological phenotype of det1-1. Genetic analyses indicate that mutations in the ted4 and ted5 loci identify new alleles of the previously described photomorphogenetic loci hy1 and hy5, respectively. Molecular analyses indicate that the ted mutations partially suppress the dark-grown gene expression phenotype of det1-1, and that the mechanism of suppression does not involve direct remediation of the splicing defect caused by the det1-1 mutation. The ted mutations also partially suppress the light-grown morphological phenotype of mature det1-1 plants, and ted1 and ted2 suppress a daylength insensitivity phenotype of det1. TED1, TED2 and TED3 are newly described genes, whose function appears closely associated with that of DET1. In addition, alleles of ted1 are associated with a moderate late-flowering phenotype, suggesting that TED1 plays a role in the pathways that regulate both seedling morphogenesis and the initiation of flowering.
