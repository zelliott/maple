Quorum sensing is a form of cell-cell signaling in bacteria that provides information regarding population density, species composition, and environmental and metabolic signals. It enables community-wide coordination of gene expression, and presumably benefits group behaviors. Multiple regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) act centrally in quorum sensing, integrating signals with other environmental stimuli, to produce an appropriate output.
