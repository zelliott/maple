We are interested in the mechanism and regulation of the extracellular regulated protein kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, due to their key roles in cellular signal transduction and disease. Both enzymes phosphorylate a large number of structurally disparate proteins upon activation by phorbol esters, serum and growth factors, and are activated through a protein kinase cascade, termed the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. ERK2 catalyses the transfer of the gamma-phosphate of adenosine triphosphate to serine or threonine residues found in Ser-Pro or Thr-Pro motifs on proteins. Its catalytic mechanism is intriguing, because it appears to predominantly rely on interactions outside of the active site cleft to specify a substrate. To study ERK2, we developed a recombinant protein called EtsDelta138, which comprises residues 1-138 of the transcription factor Ets-1, an excellent substrate of ERK2. Here we review several steady-state kinetic experiments that reveal details of the ERK2 mechanism and a hitherto unknown process of ERK2 activation by free magnesium. The physiological relevance of this mechanism is discussed.
