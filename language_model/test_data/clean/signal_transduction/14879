Superoxide anion is the most important reactive oxygen species (ROS) primarily generated in cells. The main cellular constituents with capabilities to generate superoxide anion are NADPH oxidases and mitochondrial respiratory chain. The emphasis of our article is centered in critically examining hypotheses proposing that ROS generated by NADPH oxidase and mitochondria are key elements in O(2)-sensing and hypoxic responses generation in carotid body chemoreceptor cells. Available data indicate that chemoreceptor cells express a specific isoform of NADPH oxidase that is activated by hypoxia; generated ROS acting as negative modulators of the carotid body (CB) hypoxic responses. Literature is also consistent in supporting that poisoned respiratory chain can produce high amounts of ROS, making mitochondrial ROS potential triggers-modulators of the CB activation elicited by mitochondrial venoms. However, most data favour the notion that levels of hypoxia, capable of strongly activating chemoreceptor cells, would not increase the rate of ROS production in mitochondria, making mitochondrial ROS unlikely triggers of hypoxic responses in the CB. Finally, we review recent literature on heme oxygenases from two perspectives, as potential O(2)-sensors in chemoreceptor cells and as generators of bilirubin which is considered to be a ROS scavenger of major quantitative importance in mammalian cells.
