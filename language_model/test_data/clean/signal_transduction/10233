The plasma membrane, long considered a simple barrier between the extracellular and intracellular compartments, is now thought to play a pivotal role in many physiological processes that regulate the communication of cells with their environment. On one hand, the plasma membrane directly participates in intracellular signaling; on the other hand, changes in membrane structure contribute to the transcellular transfer of biological information. Among the membrane constituents, phosphatidylserine is a major actor implicated in these effects. Evidence now exists for a role for phosphatidylserine redistribution in modulating the activities of several membrane proteins during signaling in nonapoptotic T lymphocytes.
