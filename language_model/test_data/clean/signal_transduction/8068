Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is characterized by a hyperstimulated immune response, including elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and oligoclonal expansion of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. Studies have shown that the HTLV-1 transactivator protein Tax is available for immune recognition by antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are relevant to the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP because the presentation of Tax peptides by activated DCs to naÃ¯ve CD8(+) T cells may play an important role in the induction of the Tax-specific immune response that is observed in HAM/TSP. In this study, a human cytokine protein array was used to study the secretion of cytokines by monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) exposed to Tax. Of the 16 cytokines analyzed, 6 cytokines were secreted in significantly high amounts (> or =2-fold), including Th1 cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-12, and TNF-alpha) and C-C chemokines (Eotaxin, MCP-1, and MCP-3). Selected cytokines were further examined at two concentrations of Tax and at two time periods. Furthermore, a transient exposure to Tax did not result in any cytokine production when examined at three different time points after exposure, indicating that a prolonged presence of Tax is required for its activity. Finally, inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway by specific inhibitors, abrogated Tax-mediated cytokine secretion. Collectively, these findings suggest a role for Tax-induced cytokine secretion from MDDCs, which may be critical for the cellular activation and tissue damage that has been observed in HAM/TSP.
