The study of the mammalian GnRH system has been greatly advanced by the development of immortalized cell lines. Of particular relevance are the so-called GT1 cells. Not only do they exhibit many of the known physiologic characteristics of GnRH neurons in situ, but in approximately one decade have yielded new insights regarding the intrinsic physiology of individual cells and networks of GnRH neurons, as well as the nature of central and peripheral signals that directly modulate their function. For instance, valuable information has been generated concerning intrinsic properties of the system such as the inherent pulsatile pattern of secretion displayed by networks of GT1 cells. Concepts regarding feedback regulation and autocrine feedback of GnRH neurons have been dramatically expanded. Likewise, the nature of the receptors and of the proximal and distal signal transduction mechanisms involved in the actions of multiple afferent signals has been identified. Understanding this neuronal system allows a better comprehension of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and of the regulatory influences that ultimately control reproductive competence.
