We examined the role of TrkB ligands in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) using function-blocking TrkB antiserum (Ab) and Trk-IgG fusion proteins. Incubation of hippocampal slices with TrkB Ab had no effect on basal synaptic transmission, short-term plasticity, or LTP induced by several trains of tetanic stimulation. The TrkB Ab-treated slices, however, showed significant deficits in LTP induced by either theta-burst stimulation (TBS) or "pairing." Slices exposed to the same number of inducing stimuli, delivered either as TBS or as a single 100 Hz epoch, only exhibited TrkB-sensitive LTP when TBS was used, indicating that the temporal pattern of stimulation determines the neurotrophin dependence. The late phase of LTP (2-3 hr) was also significantly impaired in slices pretreated with TrkB Ab or a TrkB-IgG. The application of a TrkB-IgG 30 min after LTP induction caused previously potentiated synaptic transmission to return to baseline levels, indicating that TrkB ligands are required to maintain LTP for up to 1 hr after induction. Taken together, these results indicate that both the temporal patterns of synaptic activity and the different temporal phases of synaptic enhancement are important in determining the neurotrophin dependence of plasticity in the hippocampus.
