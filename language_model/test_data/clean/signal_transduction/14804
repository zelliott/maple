Natural killer (NK) cells are important effector cells in the control of infections. The cellular and molecular signals required for NK cell activation in vivo remain poorly defined. By using a mouse model for the inducible ablation of dendritic cells (DCs), we showed that the in vivo priming of NK cell responses to viral and bacterial pathogens required the presence of CD11c(high) DCs. After peripheral Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation, NK cells were recruited to local lymph nodes, and their interaction with DCs resulted in the emergence of effector NK cells in the periphery. NK cell priming was dependent on the recognition of type I IFN signals by DCs and the subsequent production and trans-presentation of IL-15 by DCs to resting NK cells. CD11c(high) DC-derived IL-15 was necessary and sufficient for the priming of NK cells. Our data define a unique in vivo role of DCs for the priming of NK cells, revealing a striking and previously unappreciated homology to T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system.
