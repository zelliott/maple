Hyaluronan (HA) triggers a wide variety of cellular functions, yet its signaling pathway remains largely unclear. We found that HA-treatment of 3Y1 cells activated tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and, subsequently, stimulated cell growth. This HA-activity was resistant to boiling at 100 degrees C but completely abolished by treatment with hyaluronidase, suggesting that HA itself, but not any HA-associated proteins, has the activity. In addition, we found that HA-dependent activation of MAP kinase was strongly suppressed by the expression of dominant negative ras (S17N ras). These results suggest that Ras-MAP kinase pathway is activated by HA and may play an important role in HA-dependent signaling.
