To investigate the role of hypercorticism in the development of compromised beta-adrenergic signalling in adipocytes of mature C57BL/6J-ob/ob mice. DESIGN AND EXPERIMENTAL UNITS: Mature male ob/ob mice and their lean littermates were treated with vehicle or the specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, RU-486 (30 mg/kg bw/d) for 21 d.

Blood glucose, serum insulin, adipocyte Glut-4 expression, adipocyte Gs alpha expression, adenylylcyclase activation by beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) agonists in adipocyte membranes and mRNA levels for beta 1-, beta 2- and beta 3-adrenergic receptor subtypes in adipocytes.

RU-486 reduced blood glucose levels in ob/ob mice to levels that were not different from lean mice. RU-486 also reduced serum insulin by approximately 50% in ob/ob mice, but failed to restore depressed Gs alpha or GLUT-4 expression in adipocytes of ob/ob mice. RU-486 produced a two-fold increase in beta 3-AR mRNA in ob/ob mice and a small but significant improvement in isoprenaline-mediated adenylylcyclase activation.

The present results indicate that glucocorticoid antagonism ameliorates diabetic symptoms of the mature ob/ob mouse, but does not lessen their obesity or fully reverse deficient expression and function of components of the adipocyte beta-adrenergic signalling cascade.
