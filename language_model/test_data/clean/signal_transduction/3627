It is well established that nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a central regulator of the immune response and that dysregulation of NF-κB contributes to the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The food supplement Aquamin is a natural multi-mineral derived from the red algae Lithothamnion corallioides, rich in calcium, magnesium and 72 other trace minerals. This study describes an anti-inflammatory role for Aquamin in inhibiting NF-κB activation through reducing the phosphorylation and degradation of its upstream inhibitor IκBα. Aquamin inhibition of NF-κB activation results in significantly reduced cyclo-oxygenase-2 gene expression following treatment of macrophage cells with lipopolysaccharide. These data suggest that nutritional supplements such as Aquamin may play an important role in regulating the inflammatory response by modulating the nuclear factor kappa B signalling pathway.
