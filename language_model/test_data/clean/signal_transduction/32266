Pancreatic cancer stem cells play a crucial role in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance.             The Hedgehog signaling pathway is a key regulator in pancreatic tumorigenesis             and drug resistance. To identify pancreatic cancer stem cells, tumorspheres derived             from the PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell line were cultured under a floating-culture             system. PANC-1 tumorspheres possessed properties of self-renewal, differentiation,             higher tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. It was observed that Hedgehog pathway             is active in PANC-1 tumorspheres as shown by expression of hedgehog components             Smo, Gil 1 and Gli 2, detected by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. After             cyclopamine-mediated blockade of hedgehog, a decrease in proliferation of PANC-1             tumorspheres and G0/G1 transition were observed, as well as a decreased expression             of Bmi-1 in PANC-1 tumorspheres. Cyclopamine reversed chemoresistance to gemcitabine,             resulting in decreased expression of ABCG2 in PANC-1 tumorspheres. Taken together,             our data indicate that PANC-1 tumorspheres have 'stemness' potential, and hedgehog             signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of self-renewal and             reversal of chemoresistance in cancer stem cells in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
