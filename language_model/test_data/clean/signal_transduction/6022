Synthesis and biological evaluation of a new class of 1-aryl-4-amino-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives are reported. A preliminary cellular assay system using the tumor cell line A431 responding to epidermal growth factor (EGF) for its growth, shows that the new compounds are potent inhibitors of cell growth. The inhibition of tumor cell proliferation is not associated with blockage of EGF receptor (EGFR), but substantially due to the interference with the signalling pathway at the level of Src tyrosine kinase and at the level of the downstream effector signal mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), ERK1-2.
