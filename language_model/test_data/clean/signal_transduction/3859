Using a newly developed, parallel-plate flow-chamber for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we studied the distribution and temporal changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in individual HUVECs stimulated by shear-stress. In the presence of ATP, shear-stress (1-10 dyne/cm2) caused a rise in [Ca2+]i, whereas no such response was observed in the absence of ATP or in the presence of Ni2+, a nonspecific, plasma membrane Ca2+ channel blocker. These results suggest that both ATP and Ca2+ influx are essential for the increase in [Ca2+]i in response to shear stress at less than 10 dyne/cm2. Analysis of [Ca2+]i distribution revealed a repetitive intracellular 'Ca2+ wave' originating from the upstream edge of the cell in some populations of HUVECS, which was transmitted to the downstream of the cell. The polarized [Ca2+]i response induced by shear-stress might be integral to polarized cellular reactions such as remodeling of endothelial lining.
