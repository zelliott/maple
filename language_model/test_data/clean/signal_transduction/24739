The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb), a nuclear phosphoprotein, functions as a tumor suppressor that is inactivated in retinoblastoma and other malignancies. The hypophosphorylated forms of Rb are observed in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas the hyperphosphorylated forms predominate in S and G2/M phases, suggesting that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Rb may regulate progression through the growth cycle. However, little is known about the intracellular signals that regulate phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Rb. We show that D-erythro-sphingosine potently induces early dephosphorylation of Rb. Initial dephosphorylation was observed as early as 1 h after treatment of hematopoietic cells with sphingosine, whereas complete shift to the dephosphorylated form was seen 4 h after treatment. These effects occurred at concentrations of sphingosine as low as 100-500 nM, with maximal effects observed at 1-2.5 microM. These effects were specific to sphingosine, inasmuch as other lipids, amphiphiles, and long chain amino bases, as well as structural analogs of sphingosine, failed to induce dephosphorylation of Rb. Also, activation of second messenger systems including protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent kinases, and calcium ionophores, as well as inhibition of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, failed to induce dephosphorylation of Rb. Induction of Rb dephosphorylation by sphingosine preceded inhibition of growth and a specific arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. These studies, for the first time, identify an intracellular activator of Rb.
