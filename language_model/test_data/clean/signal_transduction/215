The present study reported that the ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b was up-regulated during anthracycline-induced apoptosis in two cell lines, RBL-2H3 leukemia cells and MGC803 gastric cancer cells. Overexpression of Cbl-b strongly promoted the cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects of anthracyclines, while a dominant negative (DN) Cbl-b mutation abolished these effects in both cell lines. Further investigation revealed that mitochondrial depolarization was enhanced by Cbl-b and decreased by Cbl-b (DN) in RBL-2H3 cells. Moreover, overexpression of Cbl-b significantly suppressed ERK activation, and Cbl-b (DN) strongly enhanced both ERK and Akt activation. Altogether, these results indicate that Cbl-b sensitized both leukemia and gastric cancer cells to anthracyclines by activating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and modulating the ERK and Akt survival pathways.
