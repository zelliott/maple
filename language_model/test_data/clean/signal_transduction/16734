Large assemblies of different molecules and macromolecules,termed hyper structures, have been proposed to be the units of an intermediate level of organisation in bacteria. Here we propose a model for chemotaxis in Escherichia coli in which (1) the size and functioning of the chemo-signalling hyper-structure depends not only on the protein constituents but also on cardiolipin and calcium,(2) the coupled transcription, translation and insertion of nascent proteins (transertion) is a potentially powerful influence in determining the size of the chemo-signalling hyper-structure and therefore in affecting its function, and (3) a single transertional hyper-structure is jointly responsible for the synthesis of chemo-signalling and flagellar proteins so as to divorce the size of the chemo-signalling hyper-structure from the transertion of its constituents.
