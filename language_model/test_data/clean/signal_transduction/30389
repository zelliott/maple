In a previous report (Higai K et al., Biol Pharm Bull, 2007), glycated human serum albumin (Glc-HSA) was found to induce interleukin-8 (IL-8) mRNA expression in human monocyte-derived U937 cells through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent pathway; however, Glc-HSA signaling has not been elucidated in macrophages.

U937 cells were differentiated by treatment with 50 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 2 days and the macrophage-like differentiated U937 (differentiated U937) cells were stimulated with Glc-HSA and glycolaldehyde dimer-modified HSA (GA-HSA) in the presence of various signaling inhibitors. Macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta) mRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR. Intracellular ROS generation was estimated by confocal laser microscopy.

Glc-HSA and GA-HSA markedly enhanced MIP-1beta mRNA expression in differentiated U937 cells. Enhanced MIP-1beta mRNA expression was completely suppressed by the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine, the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, and the protein kinase C (PKC)-delta inhibitor rottlerin. Furthermore, ROS generation was suppressed completely by rottlerin but not by the PKC-gamma inhibitor Ro318425 or the PKC-alpha, -beta1 and -micro inhibitor Go6976.

Glc-HSA and GA-HSA enhance MIP-1beta mRNA expression in differentiated U937 cells through PKC-delta-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase.
