Phototropins are blue-light receptors controlling a range of responses that serve to optimize the photosynthetic efficiency of plants. These include phototropism, light-induced stomatal opening, and chloroplast movements in response to changes in light intensity. Since the isolation of the Arabidopsis PHOT1 gene in 1997, phototropins have been identified in ferns and mosses where their physiological functions appear to be conserved. Arabidopsis contains two phototropins, phot1 and phot2, that exhibit overlapping functions in addition to having unique physiological roles. Phototropins are light-activated serine/threonine protein kinases. Light sensing by the phototropins is mediated by a repeated motif at the N-terminal region of the protein known as the LOV domain. Photoexcitation of the LOV domain results in receptor autophosphorylation and an initiation of phototropin signaling. Here we summarize the photochemical and biochemical events underlying phototropin activation in addition to the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms associated with photoreceptor signaling.
