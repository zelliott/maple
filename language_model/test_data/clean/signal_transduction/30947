Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that arise from the reaction of sugars with protein side chains and the terminal amino group are supposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases and therefore the effects of AGEs on cells are the objective of numerous investigations. The effects of AGEs on cells are commonly assumed to be transduced via the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) but there are also other receptors known to interact with AGEs and they are likely to be involved in signal transduction. The primary cellular effect of AGEs on cultured cells was found to be the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). For the present study one murine and three human cell lines were used. The effects of a set of different highly modified AGEs and AGE-like compounds derived from the incubation of different modifiers with BSA were tested for their effects on these cells. Almost all AGEs tested induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the different cell lines although the intensity of the detected signals varied considerably between the cell lines and are strongly dependent on the AGE used for cell activation. The most highly modified BSA-species were shown to inhibit cell growth in all cell lines, whereas a moderately modified glucose derived BSA-AGE and BSA-GA(red) did not show any inhibitory effect on cell growth even when a high ROS formation was detected.
