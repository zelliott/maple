Nitric oxide (NO) is a messenger molecule that is highly diffusible and short-lived. Despite these two characteristics, seemingly unsuitable for intracellular reactions, NO modulates a variety of cellular processes via the mechanism of S-nitrosylation. An important factor that determines the specificity of S-nitrosylation as a signaling mechanism is the compartmentalization of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) with its target proteins. Endothelial NOS (eNOS) is unique among the NOS family members by being localized mainly near specific intracellular membrane domains including the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane caveolae. Nitric oxide produced by eNOS localized on the Golgi apparatus can react with thiol groups on nearby Golgi proteins via a redox mechanism resulting in S-nitrosylation of these proteins. This modification influences their function as regulators of cellular processes such as protein trafficking (e.g., exocytosis and endocytosis), redox state, and cell cycle. Thus, eNOS-derived NO regulates a wide range of endothelial cell functions, such as inflammation, apoptosis, permeability, migration, and cell growth.
