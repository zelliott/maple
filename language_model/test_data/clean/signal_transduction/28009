The lung collectin surfactant protein A (SP-A) has both anti-inflammatory and prophagocytic activities. We and others previously showed that SP-A inhibits the macrophage production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha stimulated by the gram-negative bacterial component LPS. We propose that SP-A decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines by alveolar macrophages via a CD14-independent mechanism. SP-A inhibited LPS-simulated TNF-alpha production in rat and mouse macrophages in the presence and absence of serum (72% and 42% inhibition, respectively). In addition, SP-A inhibited LPS-induced mRNA levels for TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta as well as NF-kappa B DNA binding activity. SP-A also diminished ultrapure LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha produced by wild-type and CD14-null mouse alveolar macrophages by 58% and 88%, respectively. Additionally, SP-A inhibited TNF-alpha stimulated by PMA in both wild-type and TLR4-mutant macrophages. These data suggest that SP-A inhibits inflammatory cytokine production in a CD14-independent manner and also by mechanisms independent of the LPS signaling pathway.
