Regulation of agonist-activated Ca2+ influx by the NOS pathway through generation of cGMP is being found in an increasing number of cell types. In the present work, we examined the role of the NOS pathway in agonist-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations and attempted to identify the NOS isoform most likely to regulate Ca2+ influx. For this, we first show that two Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists acting on pancreatic acinar cells, bombesin (BS) and the cholecystokinin analog CCK-JMV-180 (CCKJ), evokes different type of [Ca2+]i oscillations. The BS-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations rapidly became acutely dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+, whereas the CCKJ-evoked oscillations continue for long periods of time in the absence of Ca2+ influx. This differential behavior allowed us to isolate Ca2+ influx and study its regulation while controlling for non specific effects on all other Ca2+ transporting events involved in generating [Ca2+]i oscillations. Inhibitors of selective steps in the NOS pathway inhibited agonist-induced cGMP production. The inhibitors were then used to show that scavenging NO with reduced hemoglobin, inhibition of guanylyl cyclase with 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo[4,3-a] quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ) and inhibition of protein kinase G with Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS inhibited [Ca2+]i oscillations evoked by BS but not those evoked by CCKJ. These findings were extended to duct and acinar cells of the SMG. In these cells, Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists stimulate large Ca2+ influx, which was inhibited by all inhibitors of the NOS pathway. Western blot analysis and immunolocalization revealed that the cells did not express iNOS, eNOS was expressed only in blood vessels and capillaries whereas nNOS was expressed at high levels next to the plasma membrane of all cells. Accordingly, the nNOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) inhibited BS- but not CCKJ-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations and Ca2+ influx into SMG acinar and duct cells. Thus, together, our findings favor nNOS as the isoform activated by the Ca2+ released from internal stores to generate cGMP and regulate Ca2+ influx.
