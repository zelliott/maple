Activation of Akt by insulin is transmitted via phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI-3K) and enhances glucose uptake. The PI-3K/Akt signaling is diminished in insulin resistance. Thus, approaches that activate PI-3K/Akt signaling leading to improved glucose uptake may ameliorate hyperglycemia. Here we showed that low-intensity electrical current or mild electrical stimulation (MES) activated the PI-3K/Akt signaling and increased the glucose uptake in rat skeletal muscle (L6) cells. The glucose uptake enhanced by MES in muscle cells, the major cells involved in glucose disposal, suggests MES may have a possible beneficial effect on hyperglycemia.
