Schistosome parasites exhibit separate sexes and with the evolution of sex they have developed an intricate relationship between the male and female worms such that signals between the male and female that are initiated at the time of mating, regulate female reproductive development and subsequent egg production. As the egg stage is responsible for pathogenesis and transmission, understanding the molecular mechanisms of female reproductive development may identify novel targets for the control of transmission and morbidity of this major world public health problem. Recent data have demonstrated that the pairing process, proliferation, and differentiation of vitelline cells, expression of female-specific genes and egg embryogenesis are regulated by the TGFbeta pathway and protein tyrosine kinases.
