The Ly49H activating receptor on C57BL/6 (B6) NK cells plays a key role in early resistance to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection through specific recognition of the MCMV-encoded MHC class I-like molecule m157 expressed on infected cells. The m157 molecule is also recognized by the Ly49I inhibitory receptor from the 129/J mouse strain. The m157 gene is highly sequence variable among MCMV isolates, with many m157 variants unable to bind Ly49H(B6). In this study, we have sought to define if m157 variability leads to a wider spectrum of interactions with other Ly49 molecules and if this modifies host susceptibility to MCMV. We have identified novel m157-Ly49 receptor interactions, involving Ly49C inhibitory receptors from B6, BALB/c, and NZB mice, as well as the Ly49H(NZB) activation receptor. Using an MCMV recombinant virus in which m157(K181) was replaced with m157(G1F), which interacts with both Ly49H(B6) and Ly49C(B6), we show that the m157(G1F)-Ly49C interactions cause no apparent attenuating effect on viral clearance in B6 mice. Hence, when m157 can bind both inhibitory and activation NK cell receptors, the outcome is still activation. Thus, these data indicate that whereas m157 variants predominately interact with inhibitory Ly49 receptors, these interactions do not profoundly interfere with early NK cell responses.
