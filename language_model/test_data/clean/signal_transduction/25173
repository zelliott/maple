The SH2 domain protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 has been shown earlier to bind to the epidermal growth factor receptor and to have the capacity for receptor dephosphorylation. New bi- and tricistronic expression vectors (pNRTIS-21 and pNRTIS-33, respectively) based on the tetracycline system were constructed and employed to generate stable cell lines with inducible expression of SHP-1. Inducible overexpression of SHP-1 in A431 cells led to attenuation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor autophosphorylation and of EGF-induced DNA binding of 'signal transducers and activators of transcription' (STAT) 1 and 3. SHP-1 was localized in the cytoplasm with an enrichment in the perinuclear compartment. Association of SHP-1 with perinuclear structures may form the basis for a partial cofractionation with nuclei observed in different types of transfected cells and also with endogenous SHP-1 in U-937 cells. Treatment of SHP-1-overexpressing A431 cells or of HaCaT human keratinocytes expressing SHP-1 endogenously with the Ca2+-ionophore A23187 resulted in partial nuclear accumulation of SHP-1. Thus, SHP-1 may interact with substrates or regulatory proteins in perinuclear or nuclear structures.
