Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced contraction of esophageal circular smooth muscle cells was inhibited by the M2 muscarinic antagonist methoctramine. In lower esophageal sphincter (LES) cells contraction was inhibited by the M3 antagonist p-fluoro-hexa-hydro-sila-difenidol (pF-HSD). Pertussis toxin (PTX) reduced ACh-induced contraction of esophageal but not of LES cells, which suggested that different receptor-linked G proteins are involved. Antibodies against G13 antagonized contraction of esophageal cells and G9-G11 antibodies antagonized contraction of LES cells. The phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitors, U-73122 and neomycin, reduced ACh-induced contraction of LES but not of esophageal cells. Conversely, propranolol and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (pCMB), which inhibit a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PLD)-dependent pathway, reduced contraction of esophageal but not of LES muscle cells. At 1 and 5 sec after the administration of ACh (10(-5) M), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) increased only in LES muscle, which suggested that contraction results from PLC-induced IP3 production in the LES but not in the esophagus. The IP3 receptor antagonist heparin, and depletion of intracellular Ca++ stores by thapsigargin or A23187, inhibited ACh-induced contraction of LES but not of esophageal muscle. It was concluded that ACh-induced esophageal contraction depends preferentially on M2 receptors, a PTX-sensitive G13 protein, phosphatidylcholine-specific PLD and production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and is independent of IP3 formation and the release of intracellular Ca++. Conversely, LES contraction is mediated through M3 receptors, a PTX-insensitive G9-G11 protein, activation of PLC, IP3 formation and the release of intracellular Ca++.
