IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of a unique p19 subunit and of a p40 subunit that is also common to IL-12. We defined the distinct signaling mechanisms that regulate the LPS-mediated induction of IL-23 p19 and p40 in human macrophages and dendritic cells. We found that the overexpression of dominant-negative Rac1 (N17Rac1) enhanced LPS-induced IL-23 p19 expression but did not alter p40 expression or IL-12 p70 production in PMA-treated THP-1 macrophages and in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Although the inhibition of either p38 MAPK or JNK enhanced LPS-induced p19 expression, N17Rac1 did not influence either p38 MAPK or JNK activation. By contrast, N17Rac1 augmented both NF-kappaB gene expression and p65 trans activation stimulated by LPS without affecting the degradation of IkappaB-alpha or DNA binding to NF-kappaB. Furthermore, small interference RNA of NF-kappaB p65 attenuated cellular amounts of p65 and suppressed LPS-induced p19 expression but did not affect p40 expression. Our findings indicate that Rac1 negatively controls LPS-induced IL-23 p19 expression through an NF-kappaB p65 trans activation-dependent, IkappaB-independent pathway and that NF-kappaB p65 regulates LPS-induced IL-23 p19, but not p40, expression, which causes differences in the control of IL-23 p19 and p40 expression by Rac1.
