Osteoclasts (OCs) are the only bone-resorbing cells and are critically involved in various bone-associated diseases, including osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Differentiation of OCs from bone marrow macrophage cells (BMMs) is regulated by RANK and the adaptor protein (DAP12/FcRγ)-mediated costimulatory signals. However, it is unknown how RANKL/RANK signal stimulates phosphorylation of DAP12/FcRγ to initiate the costimulatory signals. As reported here, we found that OC differentiation and acquisition of bone resorption capacity were suppressed in RANKL-stimulated Fyn(-/-) or Fyn-siRNA-transfected BMMs, but could be restored by overexpression of Fyn kinase in Fyn(-/-) BMMs. However, the RANKL-stimulated proliferation of BMMs was unaffected by the absence of Fyn. In addition, RANKL-stimulated Fyn(-/-) BMMs no longer exhibited the optimal induction of typical OC markers such as NFATc1, c-Fos, c-Src, TRAF6, and cathepsin K or costimulatory signals such as the activating phosphorylations of Syk, PLCγ2, and Gab2. These were restored by overexpression of Fyn in Fyn(-/-) BMMs. Immunoprecipitation studies also indicated that the adaptor proteins DAP12/FcRγ and Syk interacted with RANK during RANKL stimulation in BMMs in a Fyn-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of the DAP12/FcRγ and the recruitment of Syk by DAP12/FcRγ were suppressed in Fyn(-/-) BMMs. This is the first demonstration that Fyn relays the initial RANK/RANKL signal to the ITAM-containing adaptors DAP12/FcRγ for OC differentiation.
