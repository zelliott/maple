Streptococcus agalactiae (also known as group B Streptococcus [GBS]) and Streptococcus suis are encapsulated streptococci causing severe septicemia and meningitis. Bacterial capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are poorly immunogenic, but anti-CPS antibodies are essential to the host defense against encapsulated bacteria. The mechanisms underlying anti-CPS antibody responses are not fully elucidated, but the biochemistry of CPSs, particularly the presence of sialic acid, may have an immunosuppressive effect. We investigated the ability of highly purified S. suis and GBS native (sialylated) CPSs to activate dendritic cells (DCs), which are crucial actors in the initiation of humoral immunity. The influence of CPS biochemistry was studied using CPSs extracted from different serotypes within these two streptococcal species, as well as desialylated CPSs. No interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-12p70, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), or IL-10 production was observed in S. suis or GBS CPS-stimulated DCs. Moreover, these CPSs exerted immunosuppressive effects on DC activation, as a diminution of gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-induced B cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF) expression was observed in CPS-pretreated cells. However, S. suis and GBS CPSs induced significant production of CCL3, via partially Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)- and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathways, and CCL2, via TLR-independent mechanisms. No major influence of CPS biochemistry was observed on the capacity to induce chemokine production by DCs, indicating that DCs respond to these CPSs in a patterned way rather than a structure-dedicated manner.
