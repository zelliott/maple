Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is a multifunctional cytokine involved in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival of many different cell types. The role of TGF-beta in atherosclerosis has been intensively studied, but the precise function of the downstream signals in this disease entity remains unclear. We recently discovered that mice lacking Smad3, a major downstream mediator of TGF-beta, show enhanced neointimal hyperplasia with decreased matrix deposition in response to vascular injury. This review summarizes the current view on involvement of TGF-beta in atherosclerotic vascular disease and discusses the role of Smad3-dependent TGF-beta signal in vascular response to injury.
