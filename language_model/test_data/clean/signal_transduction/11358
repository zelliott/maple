In this issue of Molecular Cell, Stefanovsky et al. demonstrate that the activation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinases by growth factors leads to induction of ribosomal gene transcription, through a mechanism dependent on phosphorylation of the upstream binding factor (UBF). This provides a connection between growth factor signaling and increased translation.
