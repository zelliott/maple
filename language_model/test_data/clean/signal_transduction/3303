JMJD3, a Jumonji C family histone demethylase, is induced by transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), in response to various stimuli. JMJD3 is crucial for erasing histone-3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a modification associated with transcriptional repression and is responsible for the activation of a diverse set of genes. Here, we identify the genes in human leukaemia monocyte (THP-1) human monocytic cells that are significantly affected by the stable knockdown (kd) of JMJD3. Global gene expression levels were detected in stable JMJD3 knockdown THP-1 cells and in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-stimulated JMJD3-kd THP-1 cells by using a 12-plex NimbleGen human whole genome array. In addition, datasets were analysed by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Stable knockdown of JMJD3 in THP-1 cells affected particularly in expression levels and in downstream effects on inflammatory signalling pathways. JMJD3 attenuation down-regulates various key genes in NF-κB, chemokine and CD40 signalling, and mostly affects inflammatory disease response molecules. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that JMJD3-kd could inhibit several NF-κB-regulated inflammatory genes by recruiting repressive histone-3 lysine-27 trimethylation to their promoters. Moreover, this study significantly highlights the connexion of NF-κB with JMJD3, which suggests an epigenetic regulation in different signalling pathways. Finally, this study establishes novel JMJD3 targets through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
