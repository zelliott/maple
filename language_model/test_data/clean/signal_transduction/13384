B-cell development to antibody-producing plasma cells requires the concerted function of a large number of genes and proteins. Genome-level expression profiling during human B-cell maturation was studied in anti-immunoglobulin M-stimulated Ramos cells. cDNA microarrays were used to follow changes in the transcriptome over several days. Close to 1500 genes had significantly altered expression at least at one time point. The genes were organized into clusters based on expression profiles and were further characterized based on the functions of the coded proteins. Several groups of genes important for B cells were analyzed. Here we concentrate on genes involved in signal transduction and cytokines and their receptors. The results provide knowledge on the development of humoral immunity. Several new genes were found to be essential for B-cell development. They can be used as targets for research and possibly for drug development.
