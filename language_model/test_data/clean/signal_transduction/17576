This paper summarizes the results found in our laboratory investigating the ultrafast light-induced charge separation in bacteriorhodopsin. A special technique was elaborated for dried oriented samples of long term stability. An upper limit of 21 ps was found by a direct electric method for the early charge separation processes. A permanent electric field on the surface of illuminated samples was demonstrated. The potential application of such samples as ultrafast optoelectric signal transducers is discussed.
