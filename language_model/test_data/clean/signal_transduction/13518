Stimulation of antigen receptors on WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells with anti-receptor antibodies (anti-immunoglobulin M [IgM]) causes irreversible growth arrest. This may be a model for antigen-induced tolerance to self components in the immune system. Antigen receptor stimulation also causes inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, producing diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which causes release of calcium from intracellular stores. To better understand the nature of the antigen receptor-induced growth arrest of WEHI-231 cells, we have examined the basis for it. WEHI-231 cells in various phases of the cell cycle were isolated by centrifugal elutriation, and their response was evaluated following treatment with either anti-IgM or pharmacologic agents that raise intracellular free calcium levels and activate protein kinase C. Treatment with anti-IgM or the pharmacologic agents did not lengthen the cell cycle. Instead, growth inhibition was solely the result of arrest in the G1 phase. The efficiency of G1 arrest increased with the length of time during which the cells received signaling before reaching the G1 phase arrest point. Maximum efficiency of arrest was achieved after approximately one cell cycle of receptor signaling. These results imply that anti-IgM causes G1 arrest of WEHI-231 cells by slowly affecting components required for S phase progression, rather than by rapidly inhibiting such components or by rapidly activating a suicide mechanism. Antigen receptor stimulation was twice as effective as stimulation via the mimicking reagents phorbol dibutyrate and ionomycin. Thus, although the phosphoinositide second messengers diacylglycerol and calcium probably play roles in mediating the effects of anti-IgM on WEHI-231 cells, other second messengers may also be involved.
