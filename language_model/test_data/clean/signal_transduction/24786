Lnk was originally cloned from a rat lymph node cDNA library and shown to participate in T cell signaling. Human Lnk (hLnk) was cloned by screening a Jurkat cell cDNA library. hLnk has a calculated molecular mass of 63 kDa, and its deduced amino acid sequence indicates the presence of an N-terminal proline-rich region, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a Src homology 2 domain. When expressed in COS cells, hLnk migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa. Confocal fluorescence microscope analysis indicates that in COS cells transfected with an expression vector encoding a chimeric Lnk-green fluorescent protein, hLnk is found at the juxtanuclear compartment and also appears to be localized at the plasma membrane. Lnk is tyrosine-phosphorylated by p56lck. Following phosphorylation, p56lck binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated hLnk through its Src homology 2 domain. In COS cells cotransfected with hLnk, p56lck, and CD8-zeta, hLnk associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated TCR zeta-chain through its Src homology 2 domain. The overexpression of Lnk in Jurkat cells led to an inhibition of anti-CD3 mediated NF-AT-Luc activation. Our study reveals a potentially new mechanism of T cell-negative regulation.
