Somatostatin (SRIF) inhibits GH release from rat somatotropes by reducing adenylate cyclase (AC) activity and the free cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). In contrast, we have reported that SRIF can stimulate GH release in vitro from pig somatotropes. Specifically, 10(-7) and 10(-15) M SRIF stimulate GH release from a subpopulation of high density (HD) somatotropes isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation, whereas in low density (LD) somatotropes only 10(-15) M SRIF induces such an effect. To ascertain the signaling pathways underlying this phenomenon, we assessed SRIF effects on second messengers in cultured LD and HD cells by measuring cAMP, IP turnover, and [Ca(2+)](i). Likewise, contribution of the corresponding signaling pathways to SRIF-induced GH release was evaluated by blocking AC, PLC, extracellular Ca(2+) influx, or intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization. Both 10(-7) and 10(-15) M SRIF increased cAMP, IP turnover, and [Ca(2+)](i) in HD cells. Conversely, in LD cells 10(-7) M SRIF reduced [Ca(2+)](i), but did not alter cAMP or IP, and 10(-15) M SRIF was without effect. Interestingly, SRIF-stimulated GH release was abolished in both subpopulations by AC blockade, but not by PLC inhibition. Furthermore, SRIF-induced GH release was not reduced by blockade of extracellular Ca(2+) influx through voltage-sensitive channels or by depletion of thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca(2+) stores. Therefore, SRIF stimulates GH secretion from cultured porcine somatotrope subpopulations through an AC/cAMP pathway-dependent mechanism that is seemingly independent of net increases in IP turnover or [Ca(2+)](i). These novel actions challenge classic views of SRIF as a mere inhibitor for somatotropes and suggest that it may exert a more complex, dual function in the control of porcine GH release, wherein molecular heterogeneity of somatotropes would play a critical role.
