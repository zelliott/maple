Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancy and primary cause of death in Chinese cancer patients. Recurrence is a major factor leading to treatment failure and low level of 5-year survival rate in GC patients following surgical resection. Therefore, identification of biomarkers with potential in predicting recurrence risk is the key problem of the prognosis in GC patients.

A total of 74 GC patients were selected for systematic analysis, consisting of 31 patients with recurrence and 43 patients without recurrence. Firstly, miRNAs microarray and bioinformatics methods were used to characterize differential expressed miRNAs from primary tumor samples. Following, we used a ROC method to select signature with best sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we validated the signature in GC samples (frozen fresh and blood samples) using quantitative PCR.

We have identified 12 differential miRNAs including 7 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated miRNAs in recurrence group. Using ROC method, we further ascertained hsa-miR-335 as a signature to recognize recurrence and non-recurrence cases in the training samples. Moreover, we validated this signature using quantitative PCR method in 64 test samples with consistent result with training set. A high frequency recurrence and poor survival were observed in GC cases with high level of hsa-miR-335 (P<0.001). In addition, we evaluated that hsa-miR-335 were involved in regulating target genes in several oncogenic signal-pathways, such as p53, MAPK, TGF-Î², Wnt, ERbB, mTOR, Toll-like receptor and focal adhesion.

Our results indicate that the hsa-miR-335 has the potential to recognize the recurrence risk and relate to the prognosis of GC patients.
