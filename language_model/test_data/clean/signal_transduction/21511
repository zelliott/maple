The late-phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in hippocampal area CA1 requires gene expression and de novo protein synthesis but it is expressed in an input-specific manner. The 'synaptic tag' theory proposes that gene products can only be captured and utilized at synapses that have been 'tagged' by previous activity. The mechanisms underlying synaptic tagging, and its activity dependence, are largely undefined. Previously, we reported that low-frequency stimulation (LFS) decreases the stability of L-LTP in a cell-wide manner by impairing synaptic tagging. We show here that a phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, blocked homosynaptic and heterosynaptic inhibition of L-LTP by prior LFS. In addition, prior LFS homosynaptically and heterosynaptically impaired chemically induced synaptic facilitation elicited by forskolin/3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, suggesting that there is a cell-wide dampening of cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling concurrent with phosphatase activation. We propose that prior LFS impairs expression of L-LTP by inhibiting synaptic tagging through its actions on the cAMP/PKA pathway. In support of this notion, we show that hippocampal slices from transgenic mice that have genetically reduced hippocampal PKA activity display impaired synaptic capture of L-LTP. An inhibitor of PKA, KT-5720, also blocked synaptic capture of L-LTP. Moreover, pharmacological activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway can produce a synaptic tag to capture L-LTP expression, resulting in persistent synaptic facilitation. Collectively, our results show that PKA is critical for synaptic tagging and for input-specific L-LTP. PKA-mediated signaling can be constrained by prior episodes of synaptic activity to regulate subsequent L-LTP expression and perhaps control the integration of multiple synaptic events over time.
