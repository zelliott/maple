We created two artificial modulating proteins for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-signalling, tmw57 and tmw61, starting from partial sequences of human BMP-2 (hBMP-2). The proteins were able to boost the hBMP-4 activities, BMP responsive element-driven transcription and an osteoblastic differentiation marker induction.
