In Entamoeba histolytica little is known about the microfilament rearrangements formed by actin and ABPs. Fibronectin regulates many aspects of cell behavior involving the actin cytoskeleton and members of the Rho family of small GTPases. Using trophozoites interacted with fibronectin and glass, we present evidence related with the formation and regulation of different microfilament rearrangements and their cellular distribution, the effect of actin affecting drugs on these arrangements, and on trophozoites adhesion; we also demonstrate that actin isoforms are induced after adhesion, and also the selective participation of specific actin binding proteins such as ABP-120 and phospho-paxillin, regarding their location in the different actin structures. In addition, we show results that confirm the participation of EhRho, ROCK-2, and GAP activities. We propose that fibronectin induced signaling in E. histolytica trophozoites have important consequences in the actin cytoskeleton that may affect its behavior during the invasive process in the host.
