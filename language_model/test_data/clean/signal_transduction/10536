Chronic infections with hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) are etiologically linked to hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Both viruses may induce activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) in hepatocytes that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. Functional proteomics analysis of proteins associated with NF-kappaB signaling complexes in both viruses-related HCC tumor and non-tumor tissues may disclose possible common mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis. By functional proteomics, we analyzed proteins associated with NF-kappaB-signaling complexes in four-paired human HCC tumor and non-tumor tissues from HBV- and HCV-infected patients, respectively, and in one-paired tissue with dual viral infection. The quantity of NF-kappaB-associated proteins was semi-quantitatively measured by protein spot intensity on the gels of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results showed that overexpression of NF-kappaB-associated Wnt-1 protein in tumor part was detected in the majority of HBV- and HCV-infected HCC samples. These data suggest that enhanced expression of NF-kappaB-associated Wnt-1 protein might be a mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis common to HBV- and HCV-infected patients. NF-kappaB signaling pathway and Wnt-1 protein could be potential targets for designing highly effective therapeutic agents in treating HCC and for chemoprevention of hepatocarcinogenesis.
