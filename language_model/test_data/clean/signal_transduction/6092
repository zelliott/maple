Biosimulation software is being used in pharmaceutical drug development to mimic diseases. Virtual clinical trials of new developing pharmaceutical drugs can be conducted on computers running disease simulations. Using virtual patients instead of clinical research patients can save both time and money for pharmaceutical companies in their search to discover new drugs and bring them to market. In the future, this type of research will be commonplace.
