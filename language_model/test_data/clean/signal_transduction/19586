The NF-kappaÎ’ pathway gene expression profiles were compared between 10, 20 and 39 days after Trichinella spiralis experimental infection in BALB/c mice. Out of 128 genes, 19 (14.8%) genes were present in non-infected and post-infected mice. The expression of 7 (36.8%) genes was downregulated 10 and 20 days post-infection while 3 (15.8%) genes were upregulated 39 days post-infection. The present study lists the candidate genes of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway that were commonly and differentially expressed between the specific points of T. spiralis infection, thus suggesting that these genes need to be further investigated to reveal the mechanism of the T. spiralis modulation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathways.
