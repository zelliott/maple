Cytoskeleton is a stereo wire frame system of filament, which is in a dynamic state. It can assemble or disassemble continuously with the change of physiological condition, and be regulated by many factors interior and exterior of the cell. Insulin is an important hormone involving in lots of physiological functions such as transport of glucose, gene expression and DNA synthesis. Normal secretion of insulin is the significant premise for which to educe its functions. Many studies indicate that cytoskeleton plays an important role in the process of insulin action and secretion, with a mechanism referring to insulin related signal transduction pathways tightly. The change of cytoskeleton influencing insulin related signal transduction pathways will lead to incidence of insulin resistance.
