The Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors and regulators has so far only been described in vertebrates and arthropods, where they mediate responses to many extracellular signals. No counterparts of genes coding for such proteins have been identified in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome and no NF-kappaB activity was found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We describe here the presence of an NF-kappaB transduction pathway in the lower eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum. Using antibodies raised against components of the mammalian NF-kappaB pathway, we demonstrate in Dictyostelium cells extracts the presence of proteins homologous to Rel/NF-kappaB, IkappaB and IKK components. Using gel-shift experiments in nuclear extracts of developing Dictyostelium cells, we demonstrate the presence of proteins binding to kappaB consensus oligonucleotides and to a GC-rich kappaB-like sequence, lying in the promoter of cbpA, a developmentally regulated Dictyostelium gene encoding the Ca(2+)-binding protein CBP1. Using immunofluorescence, we show specific nuclear translocation of the p65 and p50 homologues of the NF-kappaB transcription factors as vegetatively growing cells develop to the slug stage. Taken together, our results strongly indicate the presence of a complete NF-kappaB signal transduction system in Dictyostelium discoideum that could be involved in the developmental process.
