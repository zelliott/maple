Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is an efficacious chemoattractant for lymphocytes, monocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells. In the present study, we examined whether SDF-1 has growth promoting activity on human peripheral T cells and analyzed the possible underlying signal transduction pathways. SDF-1 augmented the proliferation of anti-CD3- or PHA-stimulated normal human PBMC in a dose-dependent manner but not that of resting PBMC. It was noted that SDF-1 alone could induce a significant proliferation of PHA-preactivated T cells. Anti-SDF-1 sera could inhibit the augmentation of T-cell proliferation in each experiment. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was activated by SDF-1. Considering that costimulatory signals have been reported to involve ERK2 activation, these results indicate that SDF-1 has costimulatory effects on T cells that are possibly mediated by ERK2 activation and may play a role in not only migration but also the potentiation or maintenance of T cells.
