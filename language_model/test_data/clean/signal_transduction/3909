Migrating neutrophils utilize beta2 integrins for substrate attachment and urokinase receptors (uPAR) to focus pericellular proteolysis. Our studies show that CR3 associates with uPAR on resting cells, whereas uPAR associates with CR4 at lamellipodia of migrating cells. Using resonance energy transfer (RET) microscopy, we show that the molecular proximity between CR4 and uPAR oscillates on migrating cells, thus suggesting that CR4 molecules periodically bind/release uPAR. Cell contact with fibrinogen, endothelial cells, chemotactic factors and indomethacin, and treatment with sub-optimal doses of signal transduction inhibitors, affect the oscillations' period, amplitude, and/or waveform. The oscillations were indistinguishable in period and 180 degrees out-of-phase with cytosolic NAD(P)H autofluorescence oscillations. Thus, CR4 and CR3 identify a neutrophil's axis of migration and CR4 may restrain uPAR at lamellipodia. Oscillations in signal transduction and energy metabolism may coordinate cell adherence, local proteolysis, oxidant release, actin assembly, and cell extension.
