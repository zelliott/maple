To observe the effects of Jianpi Huoxue Decoction, a compound Chinese herbal medicine, on Kupffer cell signal pathway activation in rats with liver injury induced by Lieber-Decarli liquid diet and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

SD rats were divided into normal, control liquid diet, ethanol liquid diet and ethanol liquid diet plus Jianpi Huoxue Decoction group. Rats were administrated with Jianpi Huoxue Decoction or distilled water via gastrogavage for 4 weeks after administration with ethanol or control liquid diet for 2 weeks respectively. After that, rats in each group were stimulated with LPS via gastrogavage for 3.5 h and harvested. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in serum and triglyceride (TG) in liver were analyzed. Pathological changes in liver tissues were observed in HE staining section. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) in portal vein plasma was assayed by ELISA. The protein expressions of CD68, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), phosphorylation-I kappa B (P-I kappa B) and TNF-alpha in liver were evaluated with Western-blotting.

After the treatment with Jianpi Huoxue Decoction, the pathologic changes in liver tissue were lightened, levels of ALT in serum, TG in liver and TNF-alpha in portal vein plasma were decreased, and the protein expressions of CD68, TLR4, P-IkappaB and TNF-alpha in liver were reduced.

Jianpi Huoxue Decoction can inhibit Kupffer cell signal pathway activation in rats with liver injury induced by Lieber-Decarli liquid diet and LPS.
