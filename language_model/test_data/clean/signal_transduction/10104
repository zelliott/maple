Signal transduction pathways often modulate both positively and negatively acting components to optimize the efficiency of a signal. Recent results have shown that plants make extensive use of regulated proteolysis to modulate signal transduction pathways. An emerging theme from hormone (e.g. auxin and gibberellin) and light signaling pathways is signal or stimulus-induced degradation of negative regulators to optimize plant growth and development.
