The significant contributions this past year to our understanding of IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) signaling in mast cells include studies with truncated Syk in a vaccinia expression system and Syk-negative variants of rat basophilic (RBL-2H3) cells. These studies demonstrate an essential role for Syk in initiating signals for secretion and release of arachidonic acid via phospholipase A2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase. A newly recognized addition to the repertoire of Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling systems is the activation of sphingosine kinase, which contributes to calcium mobilization in mast cells. Advances have been made in our understanding of other receptors that regulate proliferation and differentiation of mast cells, and in our understanding of the ability of mast cells to mount acquired and acute responses to antigenic and bacterial challenge.
