Many cellular Ca(2+)-dependent signaling cascades utilize calmodulin (CaM) as the intracellular Ca(2+) receptor. Ca(2+)/CaM binds and activates a plethora of enzymes, including CaM kinases (CaMKs). CaMKK2 is one of the most versatile of the CaMKs and will phosphorylate and activate CaMKI, CaMKIV, and AMP-activated protein kinase. Cell expression of CaMKK2 is limited, yet CaMKK2 is involved in regulating many important physiological and pathophysiological processes, including energy balance, adiposity, glucose homeostasis, hematopoiesis, inflammation, and cancer. Here, we explore known functions of CaMKK2 and discuss its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
