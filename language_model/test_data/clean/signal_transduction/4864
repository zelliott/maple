Nesfatin-1, an 82 amino acid peptide derived from the prohormone nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2), is a novel satiety hormone acting through a leptin-independent mechanism in the hypothalamus. The mechanisms by which production of nesfatin-1/NUCB2 is regulated remain unknown.

Nesfatin-1/NUCB2 mRNA and immunoreactivity were examined in gastric tissue and Min-6 cells by RT-PCR and immunofluorescent staining or Western blotting.

Nesfatin-1/NUCB2 is co-localized with pS6K1, the downstream target of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), in gastric X/A like cells. A parallel relationship between gastric mTOR signaling and nesfatin-1/NUCB2 was observed during changes in energy status. Both mTOR activity and gastric nesfatin-1/NUCB2 were down-regulated by fasting, and returned to basal levels with re-feeding. In high fat diet induced obese mice, gastric mTOR signaling and nesfatin-1/NUCB2 were increased. Inhibition of the gastric mTOR signaling by rapamycin attenuated the expression of gastric nesfatin-1/NUCB2 mRNA and protein in both lean and obese mice. Attenuation of mTOR activity by rapamycin or over-expression of TSC1 or TSC2 reduced the expression of nesfatin-1/NUCB2 in Min-6 cells, suggesting a direct effect of mTOR signaling.

Gastric mTOR is a gastric energy sensor whose activity is linked to the regulation of gastric nesfatin-1/NUCB2.
