Early work on T-cell hybridomas lacking the T-cell-receptor (TCR) sub-unit CD3 eta had suggested a correlation between the presence of CD3 zeta-eta heterodimers and signalling leading to phosphatidyl-inositol (PI) turnover as well as activation-induced cell death. The cloning of CD3 eta has now allowed thorough and direct analysis of the signal transduction properties of CD3 zeta-zeta-, CD3 zeta-eta- and CD3 eta-eta-containing TCRs. We have found that all forms of the TCR are capable of transducing signals leading to PI turnover, Ca2+ mobilization, IL-2 production and cell-cycle arrest. CD3 zeta and CD3 eta utilize the same promoter which yields coordinate expression of both products, so that restricted CD3 eta expression in a sub-population of thymocytes is unlikely. Immunohistochemical methods employing an anti-CD3 eta-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) show no detectable staining of thymic sections from adult mice, implying at best a low level of constitutive CD3 eta expression. In contrast, CD3 eta expression is readily detected in the majority of cortical thymocytes of CD3 eta transgenic mice using a Thy-1 promoter construct. However, over-expression of CD3 eta in mice transgenic for this polypeptide does not result in increased negative selection in vivo, consistent with the in vitro findings that induction of cell death is not strictly dependent on CD3 eta. Despite earlier reports of the detection of human CD3 eta protein, we find no CD3 eta message in human thymus or T cells. Cloning of the human CD zeta-eta genomic locus has demonstrated approximately 70% homology between the mouse and human genomic sequence, corresponding to the mouse CD3 eta-specific exon. However, translation of the DNA sequence does not result in a homologous amino acid sequence. Thus, there does not appear to be a CD3 eta protein in humans.
