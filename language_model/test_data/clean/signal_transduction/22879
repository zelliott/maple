Glomerular epithelial cell proliferation occurs in renal diseases such as membranous nephropathy and crescentic glomerulonephritis. To understand the growth factors responsible for the proliferative response and inflammation of these cells, we have examined the effects of extracellular matrix on the regulation of glomerular epithelial cell proliferation and phospholipid turnover, as well as the pathophysiological consequences of this intricate process.
