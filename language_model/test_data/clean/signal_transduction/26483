Upon wounding, syndecan-4 detects the appearance of fibronectin in the wound bed and mediates regulation of the small GTPases, Rac1, RhoA and RhoG. Cohesive regulation of these molecules results in cycles of membrane protrusion and cytoskeletal contraction, and triggers the endocytosis of α 5β 1-integrin, which collectively lead to immigration of fibroblasts into the wound bed. In this manuscript we identify the regulation of a fourth GTPase, Arf6 that is responsible for α 5β 1-integrin recycling and thereby completes the cycle of syndecan-4-regulated integrin trafficking. We demonstrate that each of the GTPase signals can be regulated by syndecan-4, but that they are independent of one another. By doing so we identify syndecan-4 as the coordinating center of pro-migratory signals.
