Resistin is a peptide secreted by adipocytes and recognized as a hormone that could link obesity to insulin resistance. This study was designed to examine the effect and mechanism(s) of insulin on resistin expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with insulin and resistin mRNA expression was examined by Northern blot analysis. In some experiments, the insulin signal was blocked by several chemical inhibitors or overexpression of a dominant negative form (Deltap85) of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase).

Insulin treatment caused a reduction of resistin mRNA in time-dependent and dose-dependent manners in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Pre-treatment with PD98059, an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway, or SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein-kinase (p38 MAP-kinase) pathway, did not influence insulin-induced reduction of resistin mRNA. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase by LY294002 or Deltap85 also failed to block insulin-induced reduction of resistin mRNA. Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, completely blocked insulin-induced reduction of resistin mRNA. Actinomycin D, a RNA synthesis inhibitor, also blocked insulin-induced reduction of resistin mRNA, and the decreasing rate of resistin mRNA in cells treated with insulin alone was faster than that with actinomycin D.

Insulin downregulates resistin mRNA via PI 3-kinase, ERK or p38 MAP-kinase independent pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The downregulation mechanism of resistin mRNA by insulin would be an indirect event through the synthesis of novel protein(s) that could accelerate the degradation of resistin mRNA.
