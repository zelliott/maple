Accumulating evidence indicates that interleukin-8 (IL-8) plays a major role in the mucosal inflammation caused by Helicobacter pylori infection. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether Lactobacillus gasseri OLL2716 (LG21) can inhibit the H. pylori-induced production of IL-8.

A coculture system including MKN45 cells, H. pylori, and LG21 was established for an in vitro analysis. Biopsy specimens were obtained from H. pylori-infected human subjects consisting of 19 men and six women.

When LG21 was 1/100 less than H. pylori in a coculture system, LG21 significantly suppressed both the IL-8 mRNA and protein generation in the coculture. Live, but not heat- or UV-treated LG21, could exert the suppressive effect. However, this amount of LG21 could not suppress either the adhesion of H. pylori to the cell surface or the IL-8 production by tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which induces IL-8 generation through the activation of the transcription. These results thus suggest that LG21 suppresses an event leading to IL-8 production, which is specific for H. pylori-induced IL-8 generation, and this event is located upstream from the IL-8 transcription but downstream from the adhesion. The measurement of the IL-8 level using gastric biopsy specimens from H. pylori-infected subjects demonstrated that LG21 also suppresses the production of IL-8 in the gastric mucosa.

Live LG21 were found to suppress H. pylori-induced IL-8 production in both a gastric cell line and within gastric mucosa.
