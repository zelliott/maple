The zeta isotype of protein kinase C (PKCzeta) is a member of the atypical PKC subfamily and has been widely implicated in the regulation of cellular functions. PKCzeta, as an important message molecular, is involved in many intracellular signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-avtivated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, transcriptional factor NF-kappaB activation, ribosomal S6-protein kinase signaling and so on. Increasing evidence from studies support the concept that the activation mechanisms of PKCzeta are tissue/cell specific. The understanding of the mechanisms underlying PKCzeta-mediated control of intracellular signaling is beginning to provide important insightsinto the roles of PKCzeta in various cells.
