Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease of the large arteries that is responsible for the majority of cardiovascular events. In its pathogenesis, the immune system plays a pivotal role. The effectuation of the immune response through interactions between immune cells that is mediated by co-stimulatory molecules, determine atherosclerosis severity. This review will highlight the role of one of the most powerful co-stimulatory dyads, the CD154 (also known as CD40 ligand, CD40L)-CD40 dyad, in atherosclerosis. Its cell-type specific actions, signal transduction cascades and its therapeutic potentials will be discussed.
