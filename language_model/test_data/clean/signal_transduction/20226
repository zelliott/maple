How does a cell respond to numerous external stresses with a limited number of internal molecular components? It has been observed that there are some common responses of yeast to various stresses, but most observations were based on gene-expression profiles and only some part of the common responses were intensively investigated. So far there has been no system-level analysis to identify commonly responsive or regulated genes against various stresses. In this study, we identified a core regulation module (CRM), a commonly involved regulation structure in the regulatory networks of yeast, which cells reuse in response to an array of environmental stresses. We found that regulators in the CRM constitute a hierarchical backbone of the yeast regulatory network and that the CRM is evolutionarily well conserved, stable against genetic variations and crucial for cell growth. All these findings were consistently held up to considerable noise levels that we introduced to address experimental noise and the resulting false positives of regulatory interactions. We conclude that the CRM of yeast might be an evolutionarily conserved information processing unit that endows a cell with enhanced robustness and efficiency in dealing with numerous environmental stresses with a limited number of internal elements.
