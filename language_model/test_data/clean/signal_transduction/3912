The major physiological function of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the maintenance of Ca2+/Pi homeostasis via the parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor (PTHR) in kidney and bone. An important consequence of PTHR activation in bone is enhanced local acidification of the extracellular space. Agonist activation of some seven transmembrane-domain receptors increases the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). We utilized microphysiometry to investigate PTH-stimulated, receptor-mediated increases in ECAR in human osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cells. PTH-(1-34) elicited a large, acute, dose-dependent increase in ECAR with an EC50 of about 2 nM. The PTH-induced increase in ECAR was specific to cells expressing the PTHR and was inhibited by PTHR antagonists. Rapid, partial, homologous desensitization of the PTH-induced increase in ECAR was observed. Incubation of SaOS-2 cells with 8-bromo-cyclic AMP neither mimicked nor abrogated the PTH effect, and PTH stimulated an acute increase in ECAR in cAMP-resistant SaOS-2 Ca#4A cells. Stimulation of ECAR by PTH was independent of transient increases in cytosolic free calcium. Both inhibition and down-regulation of PKC reduced the PTH-induced increase in ECAR. Inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange did not affect the PTH-induced ECAR response. We conclude that PTH caused a receptor-mediated, concentration-dependent, increase in ECAR, which was not dependent on the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway or the Na+/H+ exchanger but involved the action of PKC. Thus, acid production in bone, a physiologically important action of PTH, is not confined to osteoclasts as previously considered but is also mediated by osteoblasts.
