Interferon signaling pathways are critical to both innate and adaptive immunity. We have demonstrated here that the inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) functions by small interfering RNAs or chemical inhibitors blocking interferon-induced gene expression. Hsp90 was required for signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 phosphorylation, and in its absence, Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 were degraded by the proteosome. JAK1 interacts with Hsp90 and the CDC37 co-chaperone, and both interactions are destabilized by Hsp90 inhibitors. The biological consequences were suggested by experiments showing that T cell activation by interferon-gamma-primed macrophages and the antiviral response of interferons required Hsp90. We conclude that JAK1/2 are client proteins of Hsp90 and that Hsp90 and CDC37 play a critical role in types I and II interferon pathways.
