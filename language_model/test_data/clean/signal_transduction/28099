Functional inducible NOS (iNOS) may be involved in the prolonged lifespan of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (B-CLL), although the exact mechanisms implicated remain elusive as yet. In this work, we have examined iNOS expression in normal B lymphocytes and B-CLL cells in pro- and antiapoptotic conditions. Our results demonstrate: (1) The existence of a new splice variant characterized by a complete deletion of exon 14 (iNOS 13-16(14del)), which was preferentially detected in normal B lymphocytes and may represent an isoform that could play a role in the regulation of enzyme activity. (2) The existence of another alternatively spliced iNOS mRNA transcript involving a partial deletion of the flavodoxin region (iNOS 13-16(neg)) was correlated to a decreased B-CLL cell viability. The 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoradenine or fludarabine (F-ara) treatment induced iNOS 13-16(neg) transcript variants, whereas IL-4 enhanced both the transcription of variants, including these exons (iNOS 13-16(pos)), and the expression of a 122 kDa iNOS protein. These results suggest that in B-CLL, a regulation process involving nitric oxide (.- NO) levels could occur by a post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by soluble factors. Our results also provide an insight into a new complementary proapoptotic action of F-ara in B-CLL by the induction of particular iNOS splice variants, leading to the activation of a caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway.
