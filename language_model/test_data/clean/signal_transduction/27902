Single-unit neurophysiology and human psychophysics have begun to reveal distinct neural mechanisms for processing visual stimuli defined by differences in contrast or texture (second-order motion) rather than by luminance (first-order motion). This processing begins in early visual cortical areas, with subsequent extrastriate specialization, and may provide a basis for form-cue invariant analyses of image structure, such as figure-ground segregation and detection of illusory contours.
