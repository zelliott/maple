The regulation of appetite relies on the integration of numerous episodic (meal) and tonic (energy storage) generated signals in energy regulatory centres within the central nervous system (CNS). These centers provide the pharmacological potential to modify human appetite (hunger and satiety) to increase or decrease caloric intake, or to normalize aberrant eating behavior. With regard to obesity, the satiety enhancing anti-obesity drug sibutramine has proved effective at reducing body weight. Additionally, the endocannabinoid CB(1) antagonist rimonabant has recently been approved for use in Europe (but not in the US). A 5-HT(2C) agonist lorcaserin is also currently undergoing large-scale clinical trials, but the effect of the drug on human appetite is unknown as yet. Appetite enhancing drugs such as magestrol acetate and dronabiol are currently used to promote weight gain. Finally, sibutramine, selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine and some anti-epileptic drugs have all been used to normalise aberrant eating behaviour. All these drugs act by modifying the expression of human appetite. An assessment of a drug's effects on caloric intake and feelings of hunger and satiety is necessary before they can be considered for clinical use.
