To investigate the protective effects of hydrogen peroxide preconditioning (HPP) on the pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) and to explore the potential mechanisms.

The viability and apoptosis of PC12 cells were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, respectively. The expressions of 14-3-3 protein and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were determined by Western blot. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the activity of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2).

The cell viability decreased and the number of apoptotic cells increased dramatically in MPP(+) group compared with that in Control group. HPP induced a significant increase in cell viability and a marked decrease in population of apoptotic cells of the MPP(+)-treated PC12 cells, accompanied with up-regulation of 14-3-3 protein and increase of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activities. The 14-3-3 protein expression was positively correlated with the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Furthermore, inhibition of the ERK1/2 with PD98059 abolished the 14-3-3 protein up-regulation in PC12 cells induced by HPP.

HPP protects PC12 cells against MPP(+) toxicity by up-regulating 14-3-3 protein expression through the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways.
