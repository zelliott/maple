Sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramide, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and complex sphingolipids (gangliosides), are recognized as molecules capable of regulating a variety of cellular processes. The role of sphingolipid metabolites has been studied mainly in non-neuronal tissues. These studies have underscored their importance as signals transducers, involved in control of proliferation, survival, differentiation and apoptosis. In this review, we will focus on studies performed over the last years in the nervous system, discussing the recent developments and the current perspectives in sphingolipid metabolism and functions.
