Depolarization of neurons can lead to changes in gene expression that are important for such processes as synaptic plasticity, neuronal differentiation, and apoptosis. Impey and Goodman discuss some of the opposing models for how gene transcription in response to neuronal activity and elevations in intracellular calcium concentration is regulated. The pathways appear to converge on cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB) protein, with the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways playing an important role. The continuing debate about the involvement of calmodulin kinase IV is also described.
