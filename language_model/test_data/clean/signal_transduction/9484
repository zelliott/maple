In this study, we examined the cytotoxic effects of sanguinarine, a phytoalexin with antimicrobial, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects, on the blastocyst stage of mouse embryos, subsequent embryonic attachment and outgrowth in vitro and in vivo implantation via embryo transfer. Blastocysts treated with 0.5-2 μM sanguinarine exhibited significantly increased apoptosis and a corresponding decrease in total cell number. Notably, the implantation success rates of blastocysts pretreated with sanguinarine were lower than that of their control counterparts. Moreover, in vitro treatment with 0.5-2 μM sanguinarine was associated with increased resorption of post-implantation embryos and decreased fetal weight. Our results collectively indicate that sanguinarine induces apoptosis and retards early post-implantation development in vitro and in vivo. In addition, sanguinarine induces apoptotic injury effects on mouse blastocysts through intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling processes to impair sequent embryonic development. However, the extent to which sanguinarine exerts teratogenic effects on early human development is not known at present, and further studies are required to establish effective protection strategies against its cytotoxic effects.
