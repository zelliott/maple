The FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein is a likely component of the 'florigen' signal that plays a crucial role in regulating the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. Here, we report the isolation of full-length cDNAs and the corresponding genomic clones encoding orthologous FT proteins (PaFT) of London plane (Platanus acerifolia Willd). Two genes with high sequence identity were isolated (PaFT1-2), but 34 different transcript products were identified, comprising 21 splice forms produced by alternative splicing of the PaFT pre-mRNAs. Expression of the alternative splicing forms of PaFT varied according to tissue type and developmental stage. PaFT transcripts were detected throughout adult trees, whereas in juvenile trees they were only detected in dormant sub-petiolar buds. In adult trees, levels of the various alternative splicing PaFT forms were related to flower development stage and tree dormancy. Ectopic expression of the archetypal splice form of PaFT-A in tobacco and Arabidopsis developed multiple altered phenotypes, notably early flowering and attenuation of apical dominance. The evidence in this study indicates that complex alternative processing of PaFT transcripts in P.Â acerifolia may be associated with multiple regulatory roles, including initiation of flowering, flower development, apical dominance, tree dormancy and dormancy release.
