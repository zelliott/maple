The small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans (SLRPs) constitute a group of structurally and functionally related molecules that participate in the organization of the extracellular matrix ECM and have important effects on cell behavior. Osteosarcomas are heterogeneous bone tumors whose common characteristic is the production of an abundant nonmineralized (ECM)-osteoid. The scope of this minireview is to briefly present the current state of knowledge on the role of the SLRPs in osteosarcoma pathogenesis, with special emphasis on the recently described in osteosarcoma, proteoglycan lumican.
