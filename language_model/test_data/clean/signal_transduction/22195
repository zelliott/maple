Recently, it has been demonstrated that fibroin and fibroin-derived peptides enhances insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in adipocytes. Here, we show that a synthetic hexapeptide Gly-Ala-Gly-Val-Gly-Tyr (GAGVGY) derived from repetitive amino acid sequence of fibroin improves glucose transport and exerts beneficial lipid metabolic effects in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. GAGVGY increases both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake through enhancement of GLUT1 expression and PI 3-K-dependent GLUT4 translocation, respectively. GAGVGY treatment also led to a significant reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which was corroborated with decreased lipid accumulation by GAGVGY treatment. Additionally, in cells undergoing differentiation, mRNA levels of adipogenic genes including PPARγ and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), and FAS were suppressed by GAGVGY. Furthermore, GAGVGY increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and adiponectin secretion in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The latter effect was supported with evidence showing increased AMPK activation in C2C12 myocytes treated with 3T3-L1-adipocyte-conditioned medium. Together, our data suggest that GAGVGY has multiple beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, and would control hyperglycemia without the adverse effect of weight gain.
