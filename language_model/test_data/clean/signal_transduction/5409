The p53 tumor suppressor gene plays a crucial role in mediating apoptotic cell death in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). To further elucidate the p53-dependent pathway, we investigated the role of the p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22 (PERP), an apoptosis-associated p53 transcriptional target. PERP mRNA and protein are highly induced in the outer medullary proximal tubular cells (PTC) of ischemic kidneys postreperfusion at 3, 12, and 24 h in a p53-dependent manner. In PTC, overexpression of PERP augmented the rate of apoptosis following hypoxia by inducing mitochondrial permeability and subsequent release of cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and caspase 9 activation. In addition, silencing of the PERP gene with short hairpin RNA prevented apoptosis in hypoxia-mediated injury by precluding mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent cytochrome c and AIF translocation. These data suggest that PERP is a key effector of p53-mediated apoptotic pathways and is a potential therapeutic target for renal IRI.
