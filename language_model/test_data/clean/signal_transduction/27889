The dorso-ventral axis is specified in vertebrates through the formation of a dorsal signaling center known as the Spemann organizer. This process depends on signal transduction by beta-catenin that can be regulated by secreted Wnt proteins. Recent discoveries of new players in this signaling pathway have narrowed down the search for the initial cues for axis specification in vertebrate embryos.
