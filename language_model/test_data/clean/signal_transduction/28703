The basic building blocks of a cell are its cytoskeletal proteins, the orderly but dynamic organization of which is essential. How signalling molecules regulate the cytoskeleton in the developing nervous system is still largely unknown. A recent breakthrough sheds light on a pathway involving Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) and FAK (focal adhesion kinase), demonstrating their role in regulating microtubule structure and thus nuclear positioning in radially migrating cortical neurones.
