Glycoprotein130 (gp130) and Notch signaling are thought to participate in neural stem cell (NSC) self-renewal. We asked whether gp130 regulates Notch activity in forebrain epidermal growth factor (EGF)-responsive NSCs. Disruption of Notch1 using antisense or a gamma-secretase inhibitor demonstrated a requirement for Notch1 in the maintenance and proliferation of NSCs. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) activation of gp130 in NSCs rapidly increased Notch1 expression. NOTCH1 activation, indicated by tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme (TACE)- and presenilin-mediated processing, also increased. Infusion of EGF+CNTF into adult forebrain lateral ventricles increased periventricular NOTCH1 compared with EGF alone. Neither Hes1 (hairy and enhancer of split) nor Hes5 appeared to mediate gp130-enhanced NOTCH1 signaling that regulates NSC maintenance. This is the first example of a link between gp130 signaling and NOTCH1 in regulating NSC self-renewal.
