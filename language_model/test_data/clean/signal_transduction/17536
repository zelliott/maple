The role of pertussis-toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G proteins) in the signal transduction processes involved in post-junctional vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction has been investigated in the pithed rat using two chemical classes of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, the phenethylamines and imidazolines, in order to determine if they utilize different signal transduction mechanisms. Pertussis toxin pretreatment (50 micrograms/kg, i.v., 3 days prior to experimentation) slightly inhibited the pressor response to the full alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist of the phenethylamine class (-)-norepinephrine (in the presence of rauwolscine, 1 mg/kg, i.v.), whereas it markedly inhibited the pressor response to the partial alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist of the imidazoline class oxymetazoline (in the presence of rauwolscine, 1 mg/kg, i.v.). However, after elimination of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor reserve for (-)-norepinephrine with phenoxybenzamine (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.), the pressor response to this agonist became sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin treatment. The pattern of inhibition of alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses produced by pertussis toxin was similar to that produced by the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine (1 mg/kg, i.a.). The results support the hypothesis that vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptors may be coupled to a G protein which is sensitive to pertussis toxin and which couples the alpha 1-adrenoceptor to the influx of extracellular calcium, which possibly another G protein that is insensitive to pertussis toxin that couples the alpha 1-adrenoceptor to the release of intracellular calcium. The intrinsic efficacy of the agonist, and not its chemical class, determines which signal transduction mechanisms will be utilized.
