In mammals, plasma concentrations of amino acids (AA) are affected by nutritional or pathologic conditions. Alterations in AA profiles have been reported as a result of a deficiency of any one of the essential AA, a dietary imbalance of AA or an insufficient intake of protein. In recent years, evidence has accumulated that AA availability regulates the expression of several genes involved in the regulation of a number of cellular functions or AA metabolism. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in the AA regulation of mammalian gene expression are limited, particularly the signaling pathways mediating the AA response. This work provides a better understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the AA control of gene expression. We studied the expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and asparagine synthetase (AS) in response to deprivation of a single AA and investigated the possible link between protein synthesis inhibition due to amino acid limitation and gene expression. We have shown the following: 1) several mechanisms are involved in the AA control of gene expression. When omitted from the culture medium, each AA can activate one (or several) specific signaling pathways leading to the regulation of one specific pattern of genes. 2) AA limitation by itself can induce gene expression independently of a cellular stress due to protein synthesis inhibition. Together, these results suggest that AA control of gene expression involves several specific mechanisms by which one AA (or one group of AA) can activate one signaling pathway and thus alter one specific pattern of gene expression.
