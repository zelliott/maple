Alterations in brain density and signaling associated with monoamine receptors are believed to play a role in depressive disorders. This study evaluates the functional status of α₂(A)-adrenoceptors in postmortem frontal cortex of depressed subjects.

G-protein activation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity induced by the α₂-adrenoceptor agonist UK14304 were measured in triplicate in samples from 15 suicide victims with an antemortem diagnosis of major depression and 15 matched control subjects.

Basal [³⁵S] guanosine γ thio-phosphate (GTPγS) binding and cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation did not differ between groups. In depressed victims, an increase in [³⁵S] GTPγS binding potency (EC₅₀ = .58 μmol/L vs. EC₅₀ = 3.31 μmol/L; p < .01; depressed vs. control) and a significant reduction in the maximal inhibition of AC activity (I(max) = 27 ± 4% vs. I(max) = 47 ± 5%; p < .01) were observed after incubation with the α(2)-adrenoceptor agonist UK14304. No differences were found between antidepressant-free and antidepressant-treated subjects. A significant relationship between EC₅₀ values for [³⁵S] GTPγS and I(max) values for AC assay was found (n = 30; r = -.43; p < .05).

The dual regulation of α(2A)-adrenoceptor signaling pathways raises the possibility that factors affecting the G-protein cycle and/or selective access of Gα(i/o)-protein to AC might be relevant to receptor abnormalities in depression, providing further support for the involvement of α₂(A)-adrenoceptors in the pathogenesis of depression.
