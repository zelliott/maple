Chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions mediate constitutive leukocyte trafficking and leukocyte recruitment to sites of infection and inflammation. We suggest that a multiplicity of leukocyte chemoattractants exists to increase the selectivity of leukocyte recruitment in a range of physiological and pathological settings.
