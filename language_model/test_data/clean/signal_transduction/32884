Neurotoxicity is one of the side-effects of the therapeutically useful antitumour agent, Ara-C (or 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine, cytarabine). This agent is also reported to induce cell death of cultured neurons. In this study, we show that Ara-C-induced death of differentiating rat cerebellar granule neurons is prevented by cycloheximide at concentrations corresponding to its action in preventing protein synthesis. The death is accompanied by cleavage of the caspase substrate poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) and c-Abl-dependent activation of the stress-activated protein kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38. However, c-Jun levels do not rise and the activation of the stress-activated protein kinases is not required for this form of neuronal death. Cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) activity and inappropriate cell-cycle re-entry have been implicated in some forms of death in differentiated neurons. Here we show that Ara-C-induced death of cerebellar granule neurons is prevented by an inhibitor of cdk4, whereas inhibition of cdk1, -2 and -5 mimics the death, and non-cdk4/6 cdks are inhibited by Ara-C treatment. Cdk1 and -2 are dramatically down-regulated during neuronal differentiation, and neither Ara-C nor inhibition of these cdks induces death in mature neurons. This mechanism could also play a significant role in the neurotoxicity associated with the therapeutic use of Ara-C, as cdk levels can be upregulated in stressed neurons of adult brain. We propose that the balance between cdk4/6 and cdk1/2/5 activity may determine the survival of early differentiating neurons, and that DNA-damaging agents may induce neuronal death by inhibiting cdk1/2/5 under conditions which require these activities for survival.
