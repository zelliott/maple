Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a fundamental role in the recognition of bacteria and viruses. TLR3 is activated by viral dsRNA and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic mimetic of viral RNA. We show that NK cells, known for their capacity to eliminate virally infected cells, express TLR3 and up-regulate TLR3 mRNA upon poly(I:C) stimulation. Treatment of highly purified NK cells with poly(I:C) significantly augments NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Poly(I:C) stimulation also leads to up-regulation of activation marker CD69 on NK cells. Furthermore, NK cells respond to poly(I:C) by producing proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-8, as well as the antiviral cytokine IFN-gamma. The induction of cytokine production by NK cells was preceded by activation of NF-kappaB. We conclude that the ability of NK cells to directly recognize and respond to viral products is important in mounting effective antiviral responses.
