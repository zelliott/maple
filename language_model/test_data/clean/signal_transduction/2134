The purpose of this study was to characterize the prostanoid receptors coupled to intracellular calcium in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, a cell line with platelet/megakaryocytic characteristics. Both prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and iloprost increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) in HEL cells, but modulated [Ca2+]i by different mechanisms. Iloprost (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) had no effect on basal [Ca2+]i, but greatly potentiated the increase in [Ca2+]i produced by thrombin. This effect was mimicked by cholera toxin and other Gs-coupled receptors, and involved calcium influx since iloprost had no effect on [Ca2+]i in cells incubated in Ca2+-free buffer. Furthermore, iloprost did not increase the generation of baseline or thrombin-induced inositol phosphates at these concentrations. In contrast, PGE1 (10(-7) to 10(-5) M), but not iloprost, increased basal [Ca2+]i through a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism that involved stimulation of inositol phosphate generation and mobilization of intracellular calcium. The order of potencies of other prostaglandins that increased [Ca2+]i was not consistent with known IP, EP, DP, FP, or TP receptors. 11-Deoxy-16,16-dimethyl PGE2 was the most potent of the analogs tested (EC50 = 28 nM). In summary, at least two prostaglandin receptors are functionally coupled to intracellular calcium in HEL cells: a putative IP receptor coupled to Gs proteins that increases cAMP and enhances calcium influx, and a novel prostanoid receptor that evokes calcium mobilization through stimulation of phospholipase C by a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway.
