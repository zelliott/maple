NOV/CCN3 is one of the founding members of the CCN (Cyr61 CTGF NOV) family. In the avian retina, CCN3 expression is mostly located within the central region of the inner nuclear layer. As retinal development progresses and this retinal layer differentiates and matures, CCN3 expression forms a dorsal-ventral and a central-peripheral gradient. CCN3 is produced by two glial cell types, peripapillary cells and M端ller cells, as well as by horizontal, amacrine, and bipolar interneurons. In retinal neurons and M端ller cell cultures, CCN3 expression is induced by activated BMP signaling, whereas Notch signaling decreases CCN3 mRNA and protein levels in M端ller cells and has no effect in retinal neurons. In M端ller cells, the CCN3 expression detected may thus result from a balance between the Notch and BMP signaling pathways.
