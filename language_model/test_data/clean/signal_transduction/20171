Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a multifactorial disease of the upper airways with a high prevalence (approximately 11%) in the general population. Different immune and inflammatory mechanisms are involved in its pathogenesis. Alterations in the arachidonic acid pathway (leading to an imbalanced production of eicosanoids) have been linked to the pathophysiology of different diseases especially nasal polyposis, asthma, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Furthermore, viral and bacterial infections have been identified as important factors amplifying the pro-inflammatory reactions in these pathologies. This review summarizes the impact of an imbalance in the eicosanoid pathway and the effect of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins on the regulation of the pro-inflammatory network in CRS and their translation into disease severity.
