Reactive oxygen species (ROS), the most prominent free radicals produced in cells, can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on them. Many genes are known to be involved in ROS regulation. P53 inducible gene 3 (PIG3 or TP53I3) was identified in an analysis of genes induced by p53 before the onset of apoptosis. It is a widely conserved gene between many species. Until now it has been shown to exert two disparate cellular roles. The first is that of ROS producer linked to p53 induced apoptosis. In this context, it exhibits a NADPH dependent reductase activity with orthoquinones. The second is that of a component of the DNA damage response pathway. While it is considered as a p53 dependent pro-apoptotic gene, it is rarely affected in cancer. This data does not support an anti-tumor activity. In the present review we present and discuss aspects on the regulation and function of this factor and how it is implicated in cancer. We conclude by proposing that PIG3 may possibly have a role in cancer cell survival.
