Enzymatic phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate breakdown is not Ca(2+)-dependent in NG108-15 cells and the bradykinin-induced response consisted of at least two distinct components in the hybrid cells. The initial signal transduction from bradykinin receptors to acetylcholine secretion is composed of the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Ca2+ pathway despite multiple pathways in the late phase.
