To determine which intracellular pathways mediate the survival effects of ciliary neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-1 cytokines on motoneurons, we studied the activation of the Jak/STAT, the PI 3-kinase/Akt, and the ERK pathways. At shorter time points, cytokines induced the activation of STAT3 and ERK, but not PI 3-kinase. Jak3 inhibitor suppressed cytokine- and muscle extract-induced survival. In contrast, PD 98059, a MEK inhibitor, was not able to prevent cytokine-induced survival, demonstrating that ERK is not involved. Surprisingly, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002 prevented the survival-promoting effects of cytokines. When assays of PI 3-kinase activity were performed at later stages following cytokine treatment a significant increase was observed compared to control cultures. This delayed increase of activity could be completely prevented by treatment with protein synthesis or Jak3 inhibitors. Collectively, these results demonstrate that cytokines induce motoneuron survival through a PI 3-kinase activation requiring de novo protein synthesis dependent on Jak pathway.
