Retinoic acid, steroid and thyroid hormones regulate complex programs of gene expression by binding to intracellular receptors that are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. Recent studies have led to the identification and cloning of genes encoding coactivator molecules that appear to play important roles in mediating ligand-dependent transcription by members of this family. The identification of these coactivator molecules suggests a point of entry into the general transcriptional machinery that is common to several other classes of regulated transcription factors.
