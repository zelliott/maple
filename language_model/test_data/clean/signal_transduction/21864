The authors' objective was to assess the role of protein kinase C (PKC) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in mediating the effects of propofol on diabetic cardiomyocyte contractility, intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity.

Freshly isolated ventricular myocytes were obtained from normal and diabetic rat hearts. [Ca2+]i and cell shortening were simultaneously measured in electrically stimulated, ventricular myocytes using fura-2 and video-edge detection, respectively. Actomyosin adenosine triphosphatase activity and troponin I (TnI) phosphorylation were assessed in [32P]orthophosphate-labeled myofibrils. Western blot analysis was used to assess expression of PKC and NOS.

Propofol (10 microM) decreased peak shortening by 47 +/- 6% with little effect on peak [Ca2+]i (92 +/- 5% of control) in diabetic myocytes. Maximal actomyosin adenosine triphosphatase activity was reduced by 43 +/- 7% and TnI phosphorylation was greater (32 +/- 6%) in diabetic myofibrils compared with normal. Propofol reduced actomyosin adenosine triphosphatase activity by 17 +/- 7% and increased TnI phosphorylation in diabetic myofibrils. PKC inhibition prevented the propofol-induced increase in TnI phosphorylation and decrease in shortening. Expression of PKC-alpha, PKC-delta, PKC-epsilon, and constitutive NOS were up-regulated and inducible NOS was expressed in diabetic cardiomyocytes. NOS inhibition attenuated the propofol-induced decrease in shortening.

Myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and, to a lesser extent, peak [Ca2+]i are decreased in diabetic cardiomyocytes. Increases in PKC and NOS expression in combination with TnI phosphorylation seem to contribute to the decrease in [Ca2+]i and myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. Propofol decreases [Ca2+]i and shortening via a PKC-, NOS-dependent pathway.
