Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step during embryogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role in cancer progression, through which tissue epithelial cancers invade and metastasise. Cell characteristics are highly affected during EMT, resulting in altered cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, cell motility and invasiveness. Nevertheless, the demonstration of this process in human cancer has been proven difficult and controversial. Besides the fact that the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics is not a prerequisite for cell migration/invasion, it is a transient event that concerns only few cells in a tumour mass. The induction of EMT depends on the tumour type and its genetic alterations as well as on its interaction with the extracellular matrix. In parallel, trials for EMT identification in clinical samples lack of a widely accepted methodology, nomenclature and reliable markers. This review summarizes the main EMT characteristics and proposes methodologies for better analysis in vitro. It also highlights recent studies identifying cells with EMT characteristics in human cancer and proposes certain markers to identify them in tumour samples. Finally, it cites the recent literature concerning the mechanisms of drug resistance related to EMT in the context of anti-tumour therapies and proposes related new targets for therapy.
