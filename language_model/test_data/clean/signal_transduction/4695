Dysexpression of microRNAs has been found in many tumors, including lung cancer. The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays an important role during normal development, and the abnormal regulation of its members has also been related to many tumors. However, little is known about the relationship between microRNA and the Hh pathway. In this paper, we report microRNA-212 (miR-212) playing a role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and targeting PTCH1, a receptor of the Hh pathway. We found that miR-212 was up-regulated when cells were treated with 4ÃŸ-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We ectopically expressed miR-212 in NSCLC cell lines to examine the influence of miR-212 overexpression. The results showed that overexpression of miR-212 in NSCLC cells promoted cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The promoting effects of miR-212 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were partially reversed by the miR-212 inhibitor anti-miR-212. These results suggested that miR-212 might have tumor-promoting properties. Potential targets of miR-212 were predicted, and we showed tumor suppressor PTCH1 was a functional target of miR-212. PTCH1 may be responsible for the effect of miR-212 on cell proliferation. Altogether, our results indicated that miR-212 was involved in tumorigenesis, and the oncogenic activity of miR-212 in NSCLC cells was due, in part, to suppression of PTCH1.
