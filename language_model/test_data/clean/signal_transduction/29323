Extracellular ATP exerts both short-term and long-term effects in the CNS by stimulating cell-surface purinergic receptors. Here we have examined the effect of purinergic receptor activation on N-cadherin expression, a calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule involved in many processes, including glia-glia and axon-glia interactions. When primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes were treated with ATP, N-cadherin protein expression increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In addition, ATP treatment caused an increase in N-cadherin immunoreactivity in both the cytoplasm and on the cell surface membrane. Interestingly, experiments with cycloheximide revealed that relocalization of N-cadherin to the cell surface membrane were independent of protein synthesis. The ATP-induced increase in N-cadherin protein expression was blocked by reactive blue 2 and 8-(p-sulfophenyl)-theophylline, suggesting involvement of both P2 and P1 purinergic receptors, respectively. In addition, N-cadherin expression was partially blocked when signaling from purinergic receptors to extracellular signal regulated protein kinase or Akt was inhibited by 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene or wortmannin, respectively. By using an in vitro model of traumatic CNS injury, we found that N-cadherin expression was increased when astrocytes were subjected to rapid and reversible mechanical strain. The findings presented here demonstrate a role for extracellular ATP, purinergic receptors and protein kinase signaling in regulating N-cadherin expression and suggest a role for this mechanism in cell-cell interactions.
