PHLPP1 (PH domain leucine-rich-repeats protein phosphatase) is a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase that acts as a tumour suppressor by negatively regulating Akt. Here, we show that PHLPP1 is recruited to the cell membrane by binding to a scaffolding protein: Scribble. Knockdown of Scribble (Scrib) results in redistribution of PHLPP1 from the membrane to the cytoplasm and an increase in Akt phosphorylation, whereas overexpression of Scrib has the opposite effect. Furthermore, PHLPP1-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation is facilitated by the formation of a Scrib, PHLPP1 and Akt trimeric complex. Thus, our findings identify a functional interaction between PHLPP1 and Scrib in negatively regulating Akt signalling.
