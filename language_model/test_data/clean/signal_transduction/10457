Erythropoietin (Epo) stimulation of its receptor's downstream signaling pathways and optimum function of GATA-1 transcription factor are both essential for normal erythroid cell development. Epo-receptor (EpoR) signaling and GATA-1 regulate proliferation, survival, differentiation, and maturation of erythroid cells. Whether any signal that is generated by EpoR targets GATA-1 or affects GATA-1 transcriptional activity is not known. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of EpoR results in phosphorylation of GATA-1 at serine 310 (S310) in primary fetal liver erythroid progenitors and in cultured erythroid cells. We show that phosphorylation of GATA-1 is important for Epo-induced maturation of fetal liver erythroid progenitor cells. The PI3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway is identified as a mediator of Epo-induced phosphorylation of GATA-1. AKT serine threonine kinase phosphorylates GATA-1S310 in vitro and in erythroid cells and enhances GATA-1 transcriptional activity. These data demonstrate that EpoR signaling phosphorylates GATA-1 and modulates its activity via the PI3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway.
