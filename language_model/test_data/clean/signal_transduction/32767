The secretion of cerebrospinal fluid by the epithelial cells of choroid plexus is regulated by membrane receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclases or to phospholipase C. These intracellular signalling pathways as their interactions were investigated in a sheep choroid plexus cell line. Endothelin-1, bradykinin and serotonin induced a transient dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium. EC 50 were 10(-8) M for endothelin-1, 10(-8) M for bradykinin and 10(-6) M for serotonin. Maximal increase in intracellular calcium was comparable for bradykinin and serotonin, but was 3 to 5 fold larger for endothelin-1. Successive stimulations with endothelin-1, serotonin or bradykinin elicited calcium increases similar to single stimulations reflecting absence of heterologous desensitization between these receptors. Forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation was potentiated by bradykinin, but not by serotonin and endothelin-1. This potentiation resulted from an increase in cAMP production rather than to an inhibition of cAMP hydrolysis. These data suggest that serotonin, endothelin-1 and bradykinin each use specific signalling pathways in the sheep choroid plexus cells.
