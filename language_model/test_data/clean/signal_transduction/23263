Oncology is undergoing a revolutionary change. Image-guided biopsy is expected to play an increasingly important role in this radical transformation. Current concepts of disease and treatment are based on an established set of physical signs and symptoms and laboratory tests broken down by organ system. However, soon diseases will be categorized and treated based on much more specific and detailed molecular and genetic information. This transformation in how disease is categorized and treated will depend on the ability to harvest tissue from tumors and analyze it appropriately.
