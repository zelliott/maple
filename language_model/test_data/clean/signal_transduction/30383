This report reviews the joint British Society for Proteome Research (BSPR) and European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) 2007 meeting, 'Integrative Proteomics: From Molecules to Systems' which took place at the Wellcome Trust Conference Centre, Hinxton, UK, from 25th to 27th July. The aim of this year's meeting was to explore how the integration of 'omic' technologies can lead to a comprehensive understanding of cellular organization, differentiation and signalling. Studies investigating protein-protein interactions and trafficking illustrated how the combination of proteomics and bioinformatics is allowing systems biology to develop as a discipline in its own right.
