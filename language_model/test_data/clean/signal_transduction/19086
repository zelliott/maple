PTEN is a dual phosphatase that negatively regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway important for cell survival. We determined effects of the inflammation and oxidative stresses of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), respectively, on PTEN, Akt, and GSK3beta signalling in rat primary cortical neurons. The inhibitors bisperoxovanadium [bpV(Pic)] and LY294002 were also used to determine PTEN and PI3K involvement in TNFalpha and HNE modulation of neuronal cell death. PTEN inhibition with bpV(Pic) alone did not affect Ser(473)Akt or Ser(9)GSK3beta phosphorylation. Instead, effects of this inhibitor were manifest when it was used together with TNFalpha and to a lesser extent with HNE. TNFalpha together with PTEN inhibition increased phosphorylation of Ser(473)Akt and Ser(9)GSK3beta. TNFalpha and HNE both gave decreased numbers of viable and increased numbers of early apoptotic neurons. PTEN inhibition partially reversed the toxic effect of TNFalpha as shown by an increased number of viable and a decreased number of early apoptotic neurons. All effects were reversed by PI3K inhibition. HNE together with inhibition of PTEN gave increased Ser(473)Akt but not Ser(9)GSK3beta phosphorylation and no effects on the number of viable or early apoptotic cells. In conclusion, PTEN inhibition gives a mild reversal of TNFalpha- but not HNE-induced cell death via the PI3K pathway.
