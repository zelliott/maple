In peripheral nerve regeneration or remyelination, immature Schwann cells expressing p75(NTR) play cardinal roles in the support and regeneration of axons (Griffin JW, Hoffman PN. Peripheral Neuropathy 361-376, 1993). Only one of four to six Schwann cells participate in remyelination of damaged or regenerating axons. The rest of the cells, or supernumerary Schwann cells, show severe atrophy and gradually decrease in number, reestablishing a 1:1 axon-Schwann cell relationship (Said G, Duckett S. Acta Neuropathol (Berl) 53:173-179, 1981). Recent reports demonstrated that severely atrophied supernumerary Schwann cells are eliminated by apoptosis during axonal regeneration or remyelination (Hirata H, Hibasami H. Apoptosis 3:353-360, 1998; Berciano MT, Calle E. Acta Neuropathol (Berl) 95:269-279, 1998). The mechanism to induce selective death of supernumerary Schwann cells without causing any damage to axon-associated Schwann cells or axons remains to be determined. In this article, we report that p75(NTR), the low-affinity receptor for all members of neurotrophins, signals both cell differentiation and apoptosis through intracellular ceramide elevation. The final response is dependent on the intracellular ceramide level and Schwann cells modulate their response by changing expression level of p75(NTR). This effect was selective for nerve growth factor (NGF). Taken together, the present study suggests that NGF contributes both to phenotypic regulation and to elimination of the dedifferentiated Schwann cells, while supporting survival or regeneration of certain types of axons during peripheral nerve repair or regeneration.
