Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a critical regulator of osteogenic differentiation and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a chemoattractant or mitogen of osteogenic mesenchymal cells. However, the combined effects of these regulators on the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of TGF-β and/or PDGF on the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The TGF-β-induced osteogenic differentiation of UE7T-13 cells, a bone marrow-derived hMSC line, was markedly enhanced by PDGF, although PDGF alone did not induce differentiation. TGF-β induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and PDGF induced Akt phosphorylation. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, U0126, suppressed the osteogenic differentiation induced by TGF-β alone. Moreover, U0126 completely suppressed the osteogenic differentiation synergistically induced by TGF-β and PDGF, whereas the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, only partially suppressed this effect. These results suggest that the enhancement of TGF-β-induced osteogenic differentiation by PDGF-induced PI3K/Akt-mediated signaling depends on TGF-β-induced MEK activity. Thus, PDGF positively modulates the TGF-β-induced osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs through synergistic crosstalk between MEK- and PI3K/Akt-mediated signaling.
