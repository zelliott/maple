Interactions between the Wiskott-Aldrich (WAS) protein (WASp), small GTPases, and the cytoskeletal organizing complex Arp2/3 appear to be critical for the transduction of signals from the cell membrane to the actin cytoskeleton in hematopoietic cells. This study shows that Fcgamma-receptor (FcgammaR)-mediated phagocytosis is impaired in WASp-deficient peripheral blood monocytes, and that in macrophages, formation of the actin cup and local recruitment of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins is markedly attenuated. Results also show that, in normal macrophages, WASp itself is actively recruited to the cup, suggesting that assembly of this specialized cytoskeletal structure is dependent on its expression.
