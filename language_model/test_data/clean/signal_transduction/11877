A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 gene (C9orf72) was recently identified as the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here we describe the clinical, pathologic, and genetic features of a Finnish C9orf72 expansion carrier, who developed a dysplastic gangliocytoma (Lhermitte-Duclos disease), a rare hamartoma/overgrowth syndrome of cerebellar granule cells associated with mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog gene. In addition to the dysplastic gangliocytoma, the patient showed typical transactive response DNA-binding protein with Mr 43 kD (TDP-43) pathology mainly in the cortex and the substantia nigra and numerous p62-positive/TDP-43-negative inclusions in the cerebellar granule cells. His sister carried the same gene defect and showed a similar type of TDP-43/p62 pathology in her brain. Our findings confirm that the clinical and pathologic picture of C9orf72 mutation carriers is more heterogeneous than originally thought and warrants further studies on the possible involvement of phosphatase and tensin homolog gene pathway in the specific cerebellar granule cell pathology associated with C9orf72 expansion.
