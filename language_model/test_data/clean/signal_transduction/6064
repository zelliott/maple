The thrombin peptide, TP508, accelerates tissue repair and initiates a cascade of cellular events. We have previously shown that alpha-thrombin induces cytokine expression in human mononuclear cells. We, therefore, investigated the possibility that TP508 might activate cytokine production and intracellular signaling pathways associated with cytokine activation. Our results show that TP508 induces cytokine expression in human mononuclear cells. TP508 treatment enhances extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk1/2) activities in U937 cells, as well as Erk1/2 and p38 activation in Jurkat T cells. These data support the hypothesis that TP508 may accelerate tissue repair through the activation of the inflammatory response.
