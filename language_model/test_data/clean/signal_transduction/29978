Molecular biological research on the development and reproduction of parasites is of major significance for many fundamental and applied areas of medical and veterinary parasitology. Together with knowledge of parasite biology and epidemiology, the application of molecular tools and technologies provides unique opportunities for elucidating developmental and reproductive processes in helminths. This article focuses specifically on recent progress in studying the molecular mechanisms of development, sexual differentiation and reproduction in parasitic nematodes of socio-economic importance and comparative analyses, where appropriate, with the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It also describes the implications of such work for understanding reproduction, tissue migration, hypobiosis, signal transduction and host-parasite interactions at the molecular level, and for seeking new means of parasite intervention.
