Insulin signal transduction, initiated by binding of insulin to its receptor at the plasma membrane, activates the intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase and leads to internalization of the activated ligand-receptor complex into endosomes. This study addresses the role played by the activated insulin receptor within hepatic endosomes and provides evidence for its central role in insulin-stimulated events in vivo. Rats were treated with chloroquine, an acidotrophic agent that has been shown previously to inhibit endosomal insulin degradation, and then with insulin. Livers were removed and fractionated by density gradient centrifugation to obtain endosomal and plasma membrane preparations. Chloroquine treatment increased the amount of receptor-bound insulin in endosomes at 2 min after insulin injection by 93% as determined by exclusion from G-50 columns and by 90% as determined by polyethylene glycol precipitation (p < 0.02). Chloroquine treatment also increased the insulin receptor content of endosomes after insulin injection (integrated over 0-45 min) by 31% when compared with controls (p < 0.05). Similarly, chloroquine increased both insulin receptor phosphotyrosine content and its exogenous tyrosine kinase activity after insulin injection (64%; p < 0.01 and 96% and p < 0. 001, respectively). In vivo chloroquine treatment was without any observable effect on insulin binding to plasma membrane insulin receptors, nor did it augment insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation or kinase activity in the plasma membrane. Concomitant with its effects on endosomal insulin receptors, chloroquine treatment augmented insulin-stimulated incorporation of glucose into glycogen in diaphragm (p < 0.001). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that chloroquine-dependent inhibition of endosomal insulin receptor dissociation and subsequent degradation prolongs the half-life of the active endosomal receptor and potentiates insulin signaling from this compartment.
