Mechanical perturbation has been shown to modulate a wide variety of changes in second message signals and patterns of gene expression in osteoblasts. Embryonic chick osteoblasts were subjected to a dynamic spatially uniform biaxial strain (1.3% applied strain) at 0.25 Hz for a single 2-h period, and osteopontin (OPN), an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing protein, was shown to be a mechanoresponsive gene. Expression of opn mRNA reached a maximal 4-fold increase 9 h after the end of the mechanical perturbation that was not inhibited by cycloheximide, thus demonstrating that mechanoinduction of opn expression is a primary response through the activation of pre-existing transcriptional factors. The signal transduction pathways, which mediated the increased expression of opn in response to mechanical stimuli, were shown to be dependent on the activation of a tyrosine kinase(s) and protein kinase A (PKA) or a PKA-like kinase. Selective inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) had no effect on the mechanoinduction of osteopontin even though opn has been demonstrated to be an early response gene to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation. Mechanotransduction was dependent on microfilament integrity since cytochalasin-D blocked the up-regulation of the opn expression; however, microfilament disruption had no effect on the PMA induction of the gene. The microtubule component of the cytoskeleton was not related to the mechanism of signal transduction involved in controlling opn expression in response to mechanical stimulation since colchicine did not block opn expression. Mechanical stimulus was shown to activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which specifically became associated with the cytoskeleton after mechanical perturbation, and its association with the cytoskeleton was dependent on tyrosine kinase activity. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the signal transduction pathway for mechanical activation of opn is uniquely dependent on the structural integrity of the microfilament component of the cytoskeleton. In contrast, the PKC pathway, which also activates this gene in osteoblasts, acts independently of the cytoskeleton in the transduction of its activity.
