We performed a gene-smoking interaction analysis using families from an early-onset coronary artery disease cohort (GENECARD). This analysis was focused on validating and expanding results from previous studies implicating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 3 in smoking-mediated coronary artery disease. We analyzed 430 SNPs on chromosome 3 and identified 16 SNPs that showed a gene-smoking interaction at P < 0.05 using association in the presence of linkage--ordered subset analysis, a method that uses permutations of the data to empirically estimate the strength of the association signal. Seven of the 16 SNPs were in the Rho-GTPase pathway indicating a 1.87-fold enrichment for this pathway. A meta-analysis of gene-smoking interactions in three independent studies revealed that rs9289231 in KALRN had a Fisher's combined P value of 0.0017 for the interaction with smoking. In a gene-based meta-analysis KALRN had a P value of 0.026. Finally, a pathway-based analysis of the association results using WebGestalt revealed several enriched pathways including the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton pathway as defined by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
