RAGE is a multiligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in regeneration of injured peripheral nerve and cell motility. RAGE is implicated in the development of various chronic diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory responses, and diabetic complications. The correlation between RAGE endocytic trafficking and RAGE function is still uninvestigated. S100B is one of the ligands of RAGE. The molecular mechanisms responsible of S100B translocation in exocytic vesicles are still poorly investigated. In the present study we elucidate the role of RAGE endocytic trafficking in promoting S100B secretion in Schwann cells. Here we show that RAGE-induced secretion of S100B requires phosphorylated caveolin1-dependent endocytosis of RAGE. Endocytosis of RAGE in response to ligand binding promotes the fusion of endosomes with S100B-positive secretory vesicles. Src promotes the fusion of endosomes with S100B-secretory vesicles. Inhibition of src induces RAGE degradation. RAGE-mediated src activation induces cav1 phosphorylation and relocalization in the perinuclear compartment. RAGE signaling and recycling are required for S100-induced Schwann cells morphological changes and are inhibited by high-glucose, suggesting a possible link between diabetes and peripheral nerve injury. Indeed, high glucose inhibits RAGE-mediated src activation. Src inhibition blocks RAGE recycling, S100B secretion, and morphological changes. In summary, we identified a novel pathway of vesicular trafficking required for the amplification of RAGE signaling and cytoskeleton dynamics that is potentially involved in the regeneration of injured peripheral nerve.
