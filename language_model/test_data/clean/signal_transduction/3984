Release of inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) generated by phospholipase C (PLC) upon receptor stimulation plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. A second, completely different, signal transduction system involves retinoic acid (RA) and related derivatives. Binding to intracellular receptor sites can modulate keratinocyte growth and inhibits differentiation. The present study was aimed at characterizing possible interactions between the two signalling pathways in HaCaT keratinocytes. As determined by anion exchange chromatography and HPLC analysis, HaCaT keratinocytes treated with 1 microM RA for up to 72 h showed a marked decrease in Ins(1,4,5)P3 release upon stimulation with 10 microM bradykinin or 10 microM ionomycin. Thin-layer chromatography of phosphatidylinositol phosphates, the substrates of PLC, revealed no differences between RA-treated and untreated cells. Western blot analysis of the PLC isozymes present in HaCaT cells, PLC beta 3 and PLC gamma 1, showed no alterations in the expression of these proteins in RA-treated cells as compared to vehicle-treated controls. In addition, expression of the PLC-activating G protein G alpha q was not affected by RA treatment. Our results show that RA downregulates the PLC-mediated signaling system. The point of interference of this signal transduction crosstalk has yet to be elucidated. Our results suggest, furthermore, that RA-induced attenuation of keratinocyte differentiation might be mediated at least in part by the downregulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 release.
