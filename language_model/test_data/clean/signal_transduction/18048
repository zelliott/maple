Immunocytes from the mollusc Mytilus galloprovincialis express corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor subtype (CRH-R1 and CRH-R2)-like mRNAs. Using computer-assisted microscopic image analysis, we have found that exogenous CRH provokes changes in the cellular shape of immunocytes, and that this response is extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent. The various inhibitors of transduction signaling pathways, i.e. suramin sodium, 2', 5'-dideoxyadenosine, neomycin sulfate, calphostin C, H-89, and wortmannin, completely or partially inhibit these changes. The present findings demonstrate that PKA, PKC, and PKB/Akt are involved in CRH-induced cell shape changes in immunocytes, and that the cellular effect of CRH needs the synergistic action of the two second messengers, cAMP and IP(3).
