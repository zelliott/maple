The transcription factor NF-kappaB is a tightly regulated positive mediator of T- and B-cell development, proliferation, and survival. The controlled activity of NF-kappaB is required for the coordination of physiologic immune responses. However, constitutive NF-kappaB activation can promote continuous lymphocyte proliferation and survival and has recently been recognized as a critical pathogenetic factor in lymphoma. Various molecular events lead to deregulation of NF-kappaB signaling in Hodgkin disease and a variety of T- and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas either up-stream or downstream of the central IkappaB kinase. These alterations are prerequisites for lymphoma cell cycling and blockage of apoptosis. This review provides an overview of the NF-kappaB pathway and discusses the mechanisms of NF-kappaB deregulation in distinct lymphoma entities with defined aberrant pathways: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATL). In addition, we summarize recent data that validates the NF-kappaB signaling pathway as an attractive therapeutic target in T- and B-cell malignancies.
