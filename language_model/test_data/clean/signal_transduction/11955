Spatial organization of metabolic enzymes may represent a general cellular mechanism to regulate metabolic flux. One recent example of this type of cellular phenomenon is the purinosome, a newly discovered multi-enzyme metabolic assembly that includes all of the enzymes within the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. Our understanding of the components and regulation of purinosomes has significantly grown in recent years. This paper reviews the purine de novo biosynthesis pathway and its regulation, and presents the evidence supporting the purinosome assembly and disassembly processes under the control of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. This paper also discusses the implications of purinosome and GPCR regulation in drug discovery.
