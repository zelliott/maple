It is becoming clear that, as is the case with many human diseases, targeting protein phosphorylation in strategies aimed at developing the next generation of anti-malarials is likely to bear considerable fruit. A major barrier to this development, however, is the paucity of information regarding the role of protein phosphorylation in malaria. A major step has recently been taken in this area with the publication of the first analyses of the phospho-proteome of the most virulent species of human malaria Plasmodium falciparum. Here, we discuss these studies.
