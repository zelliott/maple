Endocrine regulation of corpus allatum (CA) cell proliferation in response to chilling was studied in mated females of the Hawaiian cockroach, Diploptera punctata. Chilling alone, when applied 24 h post-mating, suppressed CA cell division, and elevated ecdysteroid levels in Diploptera's haemolymph. Application of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) at 24 h post-mating similarly suppressed CA cell division, but had no effects at 48 h or 72 h post-mating. Severance of the ventral nerve cord prior to chilling or to the application of 20E prevented suppression of CA cell division, indicating that the effects of either chilling or 20E application are mediated by the ventral nerve cord.
