To study the effects of different concentrations of Allium Mongolicum Regel polysaccharides on the generation of signal molecules of sheep peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro.

Allium Mongolicum Regel polysaccharides of different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 μg/mL) were prepared and used to stimulate sheep peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in vitro. Content of Ca(2+) in the media was tested by Fluo-3/AM fluorescence probe method and concentration of nitric oxide (NO) was measured by nitrate reductase. Contents of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were detected by (125)I isotope labeled competitive protein combined with radioimmunoassay at 3, 6, and 9 h after stimulation.

High concentration of Allium Mongolicum Regel polysaccharides significantly increased the concentration of Ca(2+) in sheep peripheral blood lymphocytes (P<0.05), and promoted the production of NO. Contents of cAMP and cGMP tended to decrease with the increasing concentration of Allium Mongolicum Regel polysaccharides added into the media at 3h. At 6 and 9 h, concentrations of cAMP and cGMP in the media were significantly higher in 250 μg/mL stimulation group than in the control group (P<0.05), however they did not alter in a regular tendency.

Allium Mongolicum Regel polysaccharides could increase the concentrations of Ca(2+) and NO in peripheral blood lymphocytes, change the concentrations of cAMP and cGMP, thus affecting the signal transduction of immune system.
