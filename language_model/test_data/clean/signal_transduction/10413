Tom1 (target of Myb 1) and its related proteins (Tom1L1/Srcasm and Tom1L2) constitute a protein family and share an N-terminal VHS (Vps27p/Hrs/Stam) domain and a following GAT (GGA and Tom1) domain, both of which are also conserved in the GGA family proteins. However, the C-terminal half is not significantly conserved between the Tom1 and GGA families or even between Tom1 and Tom1L1. We have previously shown that the GAT domain of Tom1 interacts with Tollip (Toll-interacting protein), which is associated with endosomes, to which it recruits Tom1. We here extend the previous data and show that the GAT domains of Tom1L1 and Tom1L2 also interact with Tollip, and the C-terminal regions of all the Tom1 family proteins interact with clathrin. Furthermore, when coexpressed with Tollip, all the Tom1 family proteins recruite clathrin onto endosomes. These results indicate that, in conjunction with Tollip, Tom1 family proteins play an important role in recruiting clathrin onto endosomes and suggest that they modulate endosomal functions.
