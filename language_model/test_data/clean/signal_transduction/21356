The yeast myosins I Myo3p and Myo5p have well established functions in the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton and in the endocytic uptake of the G protein-coupled receptor Ste2p. A number of results suggest that phosphorylation of the conserved TEDS serine of the myosin I motor head by the Cdc42p activated p21-activated kinases Ste20p and Cla4p is required for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, the role of this signaling cascade in the endocytic uptake has not been investigated. Interestingly, we find that Myo5p TEDS site phosphorylation is not required for slow, constitutive endocytosis of Ste2p, but it is essential for rapid, ligand-induced internalization of the receptor. Our results strongly suggest that a kinase activates the myosins I to sustain fast endocytic uptake. Surprisingly, however, despite the fact that only p21-activated kinases are known to phosphorylate the conserved TEDS site, we find that these kinases are not essential for ligand-induced internalization of Ste2p. Our observations indicate that a different signaling cascade, involving the yeast homologues of the mammalian PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent-protein kinase-1), Phk1p and Pkh2p, and serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase, Ypk1p and Ypk2p, activate Myo3p and Myo5p for their endocytic function.
