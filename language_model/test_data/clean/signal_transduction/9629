Preventing breast cancer is possible with selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators and aromatase inhibitors, which reduce the risk of invasive disease by up to 65% (up to 73% for ER-positive and no effect for ER-negative cancer) and the risk of preinvasive disease [ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] by up to 50%. Clearly, approaches for preventing ER-negative, and increased prevention of ER-positive breast cancers would benefit public health. A growing body of work (including recent preclinical and clinical data) support targeting the HER family [epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 1 or ErbB1) and HER2, HER3, and HER4] for preventing ER-negative and possibly ER-positive breast cancer. Preclinical studies of HER family-targeting drugs in mammary neoplasia show suppression of (i) ER-negative tumors in HER2-overexpressing mouse strains, (ii) ER-negative tumors in mutant Brca1/p53(+/-) mice, and (iii) ER-positive tumors in the methylnitrosourea (MNU) rat model; tumors arising in both the MNU and mutant Brca1/p53(+/-) models lack HER2 overexpression. Clinical trials include a recent placebo-controlled phase IIb presurgical trial of the dual EGFR HER2 inhibitor lapatinib that suppressed growth of breast premalignancy [including atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and DCIS] and invasive cancer in patients with early-stage, HER2-overexpressing or -amplified breast cancer. These results suggest that lapatinib can clinically suppress the progression of ADH and DCIS to invasive breast cancer, an effect previously observed in a mouse model of HER2-overexpressing, ER-negative mammary cancer. The preclinical and clinical signals provide a compelling rationale for testing HER-targeting drugs for breast cancer prevention in women at moderate-to-high risk, leading perhaps to combinations that prevent ER-negative and ER-positive breast cancer.
