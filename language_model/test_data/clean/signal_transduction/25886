Internalization of H-Ras from the cell surface onto endomembranes through vesicular endocytic pathways may play a significant role(s) in regulating the outcome of Ras signaling. However, the identity of Ras-associated subcellular vesicles and the means by which Ras localize to these internal sites remain elusive. In this study, we show that H-Ras is absent from endosomes initially derived from a clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway. Instead, both oncogenic H-Ras-61L and wild type H-Ras (basal or EGF-stimulated) bind Arf6-associated clathrin-independent endosomes and vesicles of the endosomal-recycling center (ERC). K-Ras4B-12V can also be internalized via Arf6 endosomes, and the C-terminal tails of both H-Ras and K-Ras4B are sufficient to mediate localization of GFP chimeras to Arf6-associated vesicles. Interestingly, little Raf-1 was found on these Arf6-associated endosomes even when active H-Ras was present. Instead, endogenous Raf-1 distributed primarily on EEA1-containing vesicles, suggesting that this H-Ras effector, although accessible for H-Ras interaction on the plasma membrane, appears to separate from its regulator during early stages of endocytosis. The discrete and dynamic distribution of Ras pathway components with spatio-temporal complexity may contribute to the specificity of Ras:effector interaction.
