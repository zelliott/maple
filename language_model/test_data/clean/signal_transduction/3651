The RFC5 gene encodes a small subunit of replication factor C (RFC) complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have previously shown that a temperature-sensitive (ts) rfc5-1 mutation is impaired in the S-phase checkpoint. In this report, we show that the rfc5-1 mutation is sensitive to DNA-damaging agents. RFC5 is necessary for slowing the S-phase progression in response to DNA damage. The phosphorylation of the essential central transducer, Rad53 protein kinase, is reduced in response to DNA damage in rfc5-1 mutants during the S phase. Furthermore, the inducibility of RNR3 transcription in response to DNA damage is dependent on RFC5. It has been shown that phosphorylation of Rad53 is controlled by Mec1 and Tel1, members of the subfamily of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinases. We also demonstrate that overexpression of TEL1 suppresses the ts growth defect and DNA damage sensitivity of rfc5-1 mutants and restores phosphorylation of Rad53 and RNR3 induction in response to DNA damage in rfc5-1. Our results, together with the observation that overexpression of RAD53 suppresses the defects of the rfc5-1 mutation, suggest that Rfc5 is part of a mechanism transducing the DNA damage signal to the activation of the central transducer Rad53.
