P-15 is an analog of the cell-binding domain of collagen. P-15 has been shown to facilitate physiological processes in a way similar to collagen; to serve as an anchorage for cells; and to promote the binding, migration, and differentiation of cells.

Expression profiling by DNA microarray is a molecular technology that allows the analysis of gene expression in a cell system. By using DNA microarrays containing 19,200 genes, we identified in osteoblast-like cell line (MG-63) cultured with P-15 several genes whose expression was significantly up- or downregulated.

The differentially expressed genes cover a broad range of functional activities: 1) signaling transduction, 2) differentiation, 3) apoptosis, and 4) cell-cycle regulation. It was also possible to detect some genes whose function is unknown.

The data reported are, to our knowledge, the first genetic portrait of P-15 effects. They can help us to better understand the molecular mechanism of osteogenesis and can serve as a model for comparing different cell cultures and/or other materials with similar effect.
