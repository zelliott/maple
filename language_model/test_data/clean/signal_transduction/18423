VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor-A) is an endothelial-specific growth factor that stimulates endothelial function and angiogenesis. VEGF-A plays an important role during development of the vascular system, wound healing, vascularization of tumors, and for angiogenesis in ischemic tissues including the heart. VEGF-A stimulates many actions of endothelial cells including proliferation, migration, and nitric oxide release via binding to and activation of the two primarily endothelial-specific receptor-tyrosine kinases KDR and Flt-1. KDR and Flt-1 stimulate multiple signal transduction pathways in endothelial cells. This review provides an overview of the role of VEGF-A in the regulation of endothelial function, angiogenesis, and arteriogenesis with regard to activation of signal transduction pathways and their functional consequences in the endothelium. Moreover, this article discusses recent developments exploring the therapeutic potential of VEGF-A for treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
