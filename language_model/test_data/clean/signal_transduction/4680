Endothelial progenitor cells were initially considered to radically alter the concepts of adult tissue angiogenesis for their contribution of incorporation into new blood vessels. Nevertheless, controversy arises over their mechanism of action due to rare cell population and decreased number and impaired activity under pathological changes. Recent studies show that endothelial progenitor cells also function in a paracrine manner by secreting multiple cytokines and growth factors, but the beneficial paracrine signals remain partially unidentified. In this review, we provide an overview of varieties and signal pathways of factors secreted by endothelial progenitor cells and further present the prospect of new ways to encourage cardiovascular protection such as neovascularization, reendothelialization of larger vessels, and myocardial remodeling based on the paracrine factors.
