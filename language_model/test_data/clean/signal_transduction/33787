The review summarizes current concepts concerning the molecular genetic mechanisms of the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells, which is controlled by a complex of signaling proteins and transcription factors. The interaction of regulatory factors involved in the most important signaling pathways at different stages of this differentiation is discussed.
