One of the most abundant F2 isoprostanes formed under pathological conditions is 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha (8-epi-PGF2 alpha), a potent vasoconstrictor. The purpose of this study was to determine the signal transduction events initiated by 8-epi-PGF2 alpha-induced vasoconstriction. Isolated arterial rings from male Sprague-Dawley rats were suspended in tissue baths containing Krebs-Henseleit salt solution, stretched to optimal resting tension and stimulated. 8-epi-PGF2 alpha induced concentration-dependent contractions in pulmonary arteries (EC50: 7.7 +/- 2.1 microM; n = 3) and aortas (EC50: 0.9 +/- 0.1 microM; n = 4) which were blocked by the TXA2 receptor antagonists SQ29548, L657925 and L657926. The contractile response to 8-epi-PGF2 alpha was significantly (*p < 0.05; n = 4) diminished by: 1) indomethacin and ibuprofen; 2) Ca++ free media; 3) verapamil, a voltage gated Ca++ channel blocker; 4) flunarizine, a T-type Ca++ channel blocker; and 5) calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor. These data suggest that the contractile response to 8-epi-PGF2 alpha is: 1) mediated via activation of TXA2 receptors; 2) partially dependent on the synthesis and release of other cyclooxygenase derived products; 3) dependent on an influx of extracellular Ca++ possibly via Ca++ channels; and 4) may be PKC dependent.
