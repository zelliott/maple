β-Catenin is a central player of the Wnt signaling pathway that regulates cell-cell adhesion and may promote leukemia cell proliferation. We examined whether JS-K, an NO-donating prodrug, modulates the Wnt/β-catenin/TCF-4 signaling pathway in Jurkat T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cells. JS-K inhibited Jurkat T cell growth in a concentration and time-dependent manner. The IC(50)s for cell growth inhibition were 14±0.7 and 9±1.2μM at 24 and 48h, respectively. Treatment of the cells with JS-K for 24h, caused a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis from 16±3.3% at 10μM to 74.8±2% at 100μM and a decrease in proliferation. This growth inhibition was also due, in part, to alterations in the different phases of the cell cycle. JS-K exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxicity as measured by LDH release at 24h. However, between 2 and 8h, LDH release was less than 20% for any indicated JS-K concentration. The β-catenin/TCF-4 transcriptional inhibitory activity was reduced by 32±8, 63±5, and 93±2% at 2, 10, and 25μM JS-K, respectively, based on luciferase reporter assays. JS-K reduced nuclear β-catenin and cyclin D1 protein levels, but cytosolic β-catenin expression did not change. Based on a time-course assay of S-nitrosylation of proteins by a biotin switch assay, S-nitrsolyation of nuclear β-catenin was determined to precede its degradation. A comparison of the S-nitrosylated nuclear β-catenin to the total nuclear β-catenin showed that β-catenin protein levels were degraded at 24h, while S-nitrosylation of β-catenin occurred earlier at 0-6h. The NO scavenger PTIO abrogated the JS-K mediated degradation of β-catenin demonstrating the need for NO.
