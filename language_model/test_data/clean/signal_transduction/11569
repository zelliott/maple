Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is an etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia. HTLV-1 is exclusively detected in CD45RO+ T-cells in infected individuals, but CD45RO is weakly expressed in HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CD45RO in the persistent HTLV-1 infection in vivo. Flow cytometry showed that only two out of eight interleukin(IL)-2-independent HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines expressed CD45RO, whereas all five IL-2-dependent ones expressed CD45RO, and the level of expression was higher in IL-2-dependent than in IL-2-independent cells. The high CD45RO expression in IL-2-dependent cell lines was not due to IL-2, since IL-2 had little effect on the expression of CD45RO in T-cell lines. Using western blotting, we showed that IL-2-dependent HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines expressed a lower level of expression of the viral transcriptional regulatory protein Tax than IL-2-independent ones, and that the level of expression correlated inversely with that of CD45RO. However, the expression of Tax in one HTLV-1-negative T-cell line little affected the expression of CD45RO, suggesting that Tax at least alone does not suppress the expression of CD45RO in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, and that other viral or cellular factor(s) are probably involved in such suppression. Our results suggest that CD45RO+ Tax-low IL-2-dependent T-cell lines in vitro correspond to the persistent HTLV-1-infected cells in vivo, and HTLV-1-infected cells in vivo are immortalized in IL-2-dependent manner.
