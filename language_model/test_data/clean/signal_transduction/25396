Agmatinase, an ureohydrolase belonging to the arginase family, is widely expressed in mammalian tissues including the brain. Here, it may serve two different functions, the inactivation of the arginine derivative agmatine, a putative neurotransmitter, and the formation of the diamine putrescine. In order to identify the cellular sources of agmatinase expression in the brain, we generated a polyclonal monospecific antibody against recombinant rat agmatinase. With immunocytochemistry, selected areas of rat and human brain were screened. Clearly, in both species agmatinase-like immunoreactivity was predominantly detected in distinct populations of neurons, especially cortical interneurons. Also, principal neurons in limbic regions like the habenula and in the cerebellum robustly expressed agmatinase protein. When comparing the overall agmatinase expression with immunocytochemical data available for agmatine and polyamine biosynthetic enzymes, the observed pattern may argue in favor of an agmatine inactivating function rather than fueling the alternative pathway of polyamine synthesis. The putative neurotransmitter agmatine is seemingly involved with mental disorders. Therefore, agmatinase may be similarly important for pathogenesis. The normal expression profile of the protein as described here may therefore be altered under pathological conditions.
