Activation of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) family of receptors promotes the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of cells of the myeloid compartment. Several signaling pathways are activated downstream of the receptor, however it is not clear how these induce specific biologic outcomes. We have previously identified 2 classes of constitutively active mutants of the shared signaling subunit, human (h) betac, of the human GM-CSF/interleukin-3 (IL-3)/IL-5 receptors that exhibit different modes of signaling. In a factor-dependent bipotential myeloid cell line, FDB1, an activated mutant containing a substitution in the transmembrane domain (V449E) induces factor-independent proliferation and survival, while mutants in the extracellular domain induce factor-independent granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. Here we have used further mutational analysis to demonstrate that there are nonredundant functions for several regions of the cytoplasmic domain with regard to mediating proliferation, viability, and differentiation, which have not been revealed by previous studies with the wild-type GM-CSF receptor. This unique lack of redundancy has revealed an association of a conserved membrane-proximal region with viability signaling and a critical but distinct role for tyrosine 577 in the activities of each class of mutant.
