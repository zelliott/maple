The secretin receptor is a prototypic class B G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by binding of its natural peptide ligand. The signaling effects of this receptor are mediated by coupling with Gs, which activates cAMP production, and Gq, which activates intracellular calcium mobilization. We have explored the molecular basis for the coupling of each of these G proteins to this receptor using systematic site-directed mutagenesis of key residues within each of the intracellular loop regions, and studying ligand binding and secretin-stimulated cAMP and calcium responses. Mutation of a conserved histidine in the first intracellular loop (H157A and H157R) markedly reduced cell surface expression, resulting in marked reduction in cAMP and elimination of measurable calcium responses. Mutation of an arginine (R153A) in the first intracellular loop reduced calcium, but not cAMP responses. Mutation of a dibasic motif in the second intracellular loop (R231A/K232A) had no significant effects on any measured responses. Mutations in the third intracellular loop involving adjacent lysine and leucine residues (K302A/L303A) or two arginine residues separated by a leucine and an alanine (R318A/R321A) significantly reduced cAMP responses, while the latter also reduced calcium responses. Additive effects were elicited by combining the effective mutations, while combining all the effective mutations resulted in a construct that continued to bind secretin normally, but that elicited no significant cAMP or calcium responses. These data suggest that, while some receptor determinants are clearly shared, there are also distinct determinants for coupling with each of these G proteins.
