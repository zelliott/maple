We have listed and described recent promising developments in the field of aptamer research. The properties and the application potential of aptamers propose an exciting future for aptamers either in the clinic or as research tools for various purposes. We have reviewed exciting examples in which the SELEX technology was applied to obtain promising tools that may help to facilitate our understanding of biological processes and to interfere at distinct points in signal transduction cascades. High affinities and specificities of aptamer/target-interactions can now routinely be achieved. Furthermore, a wide spectrum of chemical modifications of nucleotides is known which greatly increase the stability of RNA molecules in biological materials, considerably enhancing their application potential. The aptamer technology shows that the combination of organic synthesis and molecular biology can contribute to interesting and promising new drug leads, which may very soon find their way into daily clinical practice or onto the laboratory benches of many researchers in the life sciences.
