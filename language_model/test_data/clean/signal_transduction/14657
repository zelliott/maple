Significant progress has been made in the identification of intrinsic and extrinsic factors involved in the development of nervous system. It is remarkable that the establishment and maintenance of the asymmetrical architecture of a neuron is coordinated by a limited repertoire of signalling machineries. However, the details of signalling mechanisms responsible for creating specificity and diversity required for proper development of the nervous system remain largely to be investigated. An emerging body of evidence suggests that specificity and diversity can be achieved by differential regulation of signalling components at distinct subcellular localizations. Many aspects of neuronal polarization and morphogenesis are attributed to localized signalling. Further diversity and specificity of receptor signalling can be achieved by the regulation of molecules outside the cell. Recent evidence suggests that extracellular matrix molecules are essential extrinsic cues that function to foster the growth of neurons. Therefore, it is important to understand where the signalling machineries are activated and how they are combined with other factors in order to understand the molecular mechanism underlying neuronal development.
