Peripheral CD4+ T cells can be divided into two different functional populations based on the expression of distinct isoforms of the surface molecule CD45. We have investigated the differences in the proximal signaling induced by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody in purified populations of "naive" CD45RA+ and "memory" CD45RO+ human CD4+ T cells. Expression of cell surface CD3, CD4 and CD28 was comparable between RA+ and RO+ cells. However, TCR-directed stimulation in the form of anti-CD3 produced markedly different patterns of intracellular signaling. Greater inositol triphosphate generation occurred in naive cells and the rise in intracellular free calcium was also substantially greater in naive than in memory cells. Cells with the naive phenotype were considerably more active in TCR-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, both at an overall level and specifically in terms of TCR-zeta and ZAP-70 phosphorylation. Despite these differences in phosphorylation, the amounts of TCR-zeta, ZAP-70 and Ick were equivalent between the two subsets. These findings suggest that the TCR-dependent signaling is differentially regulated in naive and memory CD4+ T cells. This may be due to differences in the way that the two isoforms of the CD45 phosphatase regulate the activity of proximal kinases in the TCR signaling pathway, and could be an important means by which the unique functions of differentiated T cell populations are maintained.
