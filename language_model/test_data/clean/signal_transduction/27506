An individual's set of polymorphic HLA class II and I molecules is known to select the T cell repertoire in the thymus and to present processed antigenic peptides (pAg) to mature peripheral CD4+ T helper (Th) and CD8+ T cytotoxic (Th) cells in the periphery. This review highlights new studies which address how antigen presenting cells (APC) integrate the responses of cognate Th and T suppressor (Ts) cells to determine the outcome of immune responses. Together with other findings, these studies emphasize that understanding the mechanism of immune processes requires consideration of HLA molecules in the context of the peptides they bind, the antigen presenting cells (APC) that express them and the T lymphocytes that recognize them. The activities of lymphocyte and APC surface structures are becoming integrated into a physiological understanding of the cellular interactions between regulatory and effector T cells with APC.
