The potential role of nitric oxide in the diabetes-induced hypersensitive activation of glycogen phosphorylase by epinephrine was investigated in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Pretreatment of normal and diabetic-derived cells with 1 mM sodium nitroprusside significantly diminished the phosphorylase activation response by nearly 20% in both normal and diabetic myocytes but failed to alter the hypersensitivity of the diabetic cells. Nitroprusside increased cGMP levels in both normal and diabetic myocytes although the effect was more pronounced in the diabetic cells. Epinephrine did not alter cellular cGMP content and cGMP levels were consistently lower in diabetic myocytes when compared with normal myocytes. Preincubation of ventricular myocytes with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-iminoethyl ornithine did not affect phosphorylase activation. These data indicate that nitric oxide plays a minor role in phosphorylase activation by epinephrine in rat cardiomyocytes and suggest that signal transduction via nitric oxide is not affected by the onset of diabetes.
