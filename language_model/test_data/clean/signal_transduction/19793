Adiponectin whose systemic levels are reduced in obesity-related diseases ameliorates insulin sensitivity and regulates biological processes like apoptosis, proliferation, migration and inflammation. Adiponectin binds to adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, which are ubiquitously expressed. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis of AdipoR1 and adiponectin has been demonstrated to modulate adiponectin bioactivity. Recently, APPL1 has been identified as an AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 binding protein. Furthermore, activated protein kinase C1, endoplasmic reticulum protein 46 and protein kinase CK2Î² subunit form a complex with AdipoR1. This review summarizes recent studies exploiting heterologous expression of adiponectin receptors in yeast, and the type and function of the recently described adiponectin receptor associated proteins.
