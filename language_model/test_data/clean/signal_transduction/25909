At the latest stage of terminal differentiation in the epidermis, granular keratinocytes (GKs) undergo cornification, a programmed cell death required for the establishment of a functional skin barrier. A complex genetic regulatory network orchestrates the underlying biochemical modifications, but very few transcription factors specific to this programme have been identified to date. Here, we describe a large-scale, multi-technique approach performed on cells purified from normal human epidermis, primarily focusing on the identification of regulators. We combined data from microarray analysis of cell fractions enriched in GKs or basal keratinocytes, from an expressed sequence tag (EST) library built from GKs and from an in silico promoter analysis of 52 differentiation-associated genes. Among 3576 genes potentially expressed in GK, 298 candidates were selected, and half were directly profiled for the first time in the different layers of the epidermis by quantitative real-time PCR. Forty-nine genes upregulated during terminal differentiation, associated with numerous function of GK including lipid synthesis and secretion, were identified. Of 94 transcription factors detected, 37 were found to be either positively or negatively regulated, suggesting their involvement as regulators of gene expression in the GKs. These results largely extend the number of genes known as involved in the latest step of the terminal differentiation of human epidermis as well as the number of transcription factors known to control the expression of these genes.
