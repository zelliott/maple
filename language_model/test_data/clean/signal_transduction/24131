Signaling pathways in response to DNA double strand breaks involve molecular cascades consisting of sensors, transducers, and effector proteins that activate cell cycle checkpoints and recruit repair machinery proteins. NFBD1 (a nuclear factor with BRCT domains protein 1) contains FHA (forkhead-associated), BRCT (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 carboxyl terminus) domains, and internal repeats and is an early participant in nuclear foci in response to IR. To elucidate its role in the response pathways, small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against NFDB1 in human cells demonstrated that its absence is associated with increased radio-sensitivity and delayed G(2)/M transition, but not G(1) to S. NFBD1 associates with nuclear foci within minutes following IR, a property similar to histone H2AX, 53BP1, and Chk2, which are all early participants in the DNA damage signaling cascade. Temporal studies show that H2AX is required for the foci positive for NFBD1, but NFBD1 is not needed for 53BP1- and H2AX-positive foci. NFBD1, together with 53BP1, plays a partially redundant role in regulating phosphorylation of the downstream effector protein, Chk2, since abrogation of both diminishes phosphorylated Chk2 in IR-induced foci. These results place NFBD1 parallel to 53BP1 in regulating Chk2 and downstream of H2AX in the recruitment of repair and signaling proteins to sites of DNA damage.
