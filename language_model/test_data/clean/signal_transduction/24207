RGS proteins finely tune heterotrimeric G-protein signaling. Implying the need for such fine-tuning in the developing vascular system, in situ hybridization revealed a striking and extensive expression pattern of Rgs5 in the arterial walls of E12.5-E17.5 mouse embryos. The distribution and location of the Rgs5-positive cells typified that of pericytes and strikingly overlapped the known expression pattern of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-beta. Both E14.5 PDGFR-beta- and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B-deficient mice exhibited markedly reduced levels of Rgs5 in their vascular plexa and small arteries. This likely reflects the loss of pericytes in the mutant mice. RGS5 acts as a potent GTPase activating protein for Gi(alpha) and Gq(alpha) and it attenuated angiotensin II-, endothelin-1-, sphingosine-1-phosphate-, and PDGF-induced ERK-2 phosphorylation. Together these results indicate that RGS5 exerts control over PDGFR-beta and GPCR-mediated signaling pathways active during fetal vascular maturation.
