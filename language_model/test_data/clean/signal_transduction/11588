Along with the great strides that have been made towards understanding cancer, has come a realization of the complexity of molecular events that lead to malignancy. Proteomics-based approaches, which enable the quantitative investigation of both cellular protein expression levels and protein-protein interactions involved in signaling networks, promise to define the molecules controlling the processes involved in cancer.
