1. The effect of ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase (ecto-NPPase; EC 3.6.1. 9) on the ATP- and ADP-mediated receptor activation was studied in rat C6 glioma cells. The P2-purinoceptor antagonists pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) and reactive blue (RB2) are potent inhibitors (IC(50)=12+/-3 microM) of the latter enzyme. 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2' disulfonic acid (DIDS), 5'-phosphoadenosine 3'-phosphate (PAP) and suramin were less potent inhibitors with an IC(50) of 22+/-4, 36+/-7 and 72+/-11 microM respectively. 2. P1-purinoceptor antagonists CGS 15943, cyclo-pentyl theophylline (CTP) and theophylline did not affect the activity of the ecto-NPPase. 3. ATP- and ADP-mediated P2Y(1)-like receptor activation inhibited the (-)-isoproterenol-induced increase of intracellular cyclic AMP concentration. PPADS, an ineffective P2Y-antagonist in C6, potentiated the ATP and ADP effect approximately 3 fold due to inhibition of nucleotide hydrolysis by the ecto-NPPase. 4. We conclude that ecto-NPPase has a modulator effect on purinoceptor-mediated signalling in C6 glioma cell cultures.
