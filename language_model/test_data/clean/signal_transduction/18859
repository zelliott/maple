Hydrolytically-stable phosphotyrosyl (pTyr) mimetics can be useful tools for the study of cellular signal transduction processes. Among pTyr mimetics reported to date, phosphono(diflouromethyl)phenylalanine (F(2)Pmp) has shown particular utility when dealing with protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). The current overview presents the development of F(2)Pmp and a summary of approaches toward its synthesis and use.
