Molecular markers like IgV(H) mutational status, chromosomal abnormalities, and CD38 and ZAP-70 expression have prognostic value in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). These may be pathogenetic because of the coincidental expression of ZAP-70 and increased B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and the signaling function of CD38 in CLL. This study shows that ZAP-70(+) CLL B cells respond in vitro more readily than ZAP-70(-) CLL and normal B cells to chemokine migratory signals through enhanced surface CCR7 expression (P = .009; P < .001) and increased responsiveness to its ligands CCL19 and CCL21, demonstrated by F-actin polymerization (P < .05) and cellular migration (P < .01). In addition, ZAP-70(+) CLL cells exhibit sustained ERK phosphorylation/activation following stimulation with CXCL12 (SDF1-alpha, a survival factor produced by stromal cells) compared with ZAP-70(-) cells (P = .004). Following coculture with nurse-like cells, the survival of ZAP-70(+) but not ZAP-70(-) CLL cells is significantly enhanced by the addition of CXCL12 (P < .05), an effect that is partially blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. These advantageous migratory and survival responses may promote easier access to and greater proliferation in pseudo-germinal centers and explain in part the more progressive nature of ZAP-70(+) disease.
