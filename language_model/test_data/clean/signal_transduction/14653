The two lectin receptors, CLEC-2 and Dectin-1, have been shown to signal through a Syk-dependent pathway, despite the presence of only a single YXXL in their cytosolic tails. In this study, we show that stimulation of CLEC-2 in platelets and in two mutant cell lines is dependent on the YXXL motif and on proteins that participate in signaling by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif receptors, including Src, Syk, and Tec family kinases, and on phospholipase Cgamma. Strikingly, mutation of either Src homology (SH) 2 domain of Syk blocks signaling by CLEC-2 despite the fact that it has only a single YXXL motif. Furthermore, signaling by CLEC-2 is only partially dependent on the BLNK/SLP-76 family of adapter proteins in contrast to that of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif receptors. The C-type lectin receptor, Dectin-1, which contains a YXXL motif preceded by the same four amino acids as for CLEC-2 (DEDG), signals like CLEC-2 and also requires the two SH2 domains of Syk and is only partially dependent on the BLNK/SLP-76 family of adapters. In marked contrast, the C-type lectin receptor, DC-SIGN, which has a distinct series of amino acids preceding a single YXXL, signals independent of this motif. A mutational analysis of the DEDG sequence of CLEC-2 revealed that the glycine residue directly upstream of the YXXL tyrosine is important for CLEC-2 signaling. These results demonstrate that CLEC-2 and Dectin-1 signal through a single YXXL motif that requires the tandem SH2 domains of Syk but is only partially dependent on the SLP-76/BLNK family of adapters.
