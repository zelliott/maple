The signaling mechanisms regulating pluripotency in porcine embryonic stem cells and embryos are unknown. In this study, we characterize cell signaling in the in-vivo porcine inner cell mass and later-stage epiblast. We evaluate expression of OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, genes within the JAK/STAT pathway (LIF, LIFR, GP130), FGF pathway (bFGF, FGFR1, FGFR2), BMP pathway (BMP4), and downstream-activated genes (STAT3, c-Myc, c-Fos, and SMAD4). We discovered two different expression profiles exist in the developing porcine embryo. The D6 porcine blastocyst (inner cell mass stage) is devoid in the expression of most genes analyzed, with the exception of OCT4. In contrast, the D11 epiblast expressed 10 of the 12 genes investigated. Immunocytochemistry confirmed LIFR and bFGF was not expressed in the epiblast, but within the trophectoderm. These findings reveal cell signaling associated with maintaining pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells is detectable in the porcine epiblast, but not in the inner cell mass.
