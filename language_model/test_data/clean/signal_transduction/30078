Prostate cancer growth inhibition by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) is best characterized in the androgen dependent LNCaP cell line, where treatment with this hormone causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. 1,25(OH)2D3 also inhibits the growth of PC-3 prostate cancer cells, but not through the induction of G1 arrest or apoptosis. In this study, we have sought to elucidate the mechanism/s involved in PC-3 cell growth inhibition by 1,25(OH)2D3.

We determined the effect of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) blocking antibodies on 1,25(OH)2D3 mediated growth inhibition of PC-3 cells. In addition, we also studied the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on TGFbeta signaling and receptor expression. Finally, we assessed the role of TGFbeta signaling in the induction of the growth inhibitory protein, insulin like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), by 1,25(OH)2D3.

We find that 1,25(OH)2D3 action in PC-3 cells is mediated through at least two distinct pathways, the TGFbeta pathway and the IGFBP-3 pathway. We show that 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment elevates TGFbeta production and signaling, as well as receptor levels, in PC-3 cells. Further, using a blocking antibody against TGFbeta substantially reduces 1,25(OH)2D3 mediated growth inhibition without affecting IGFBP-3 induction, suggesting that IGFBP-3, alone, is insufficient to inhibit the growth of PC-3 cells.
