The NF-kappaB activation pathway induced by T cell costimulation uses various molecules including Vav1 and protein kinase C (PKC)theta. Because Vav1 inducibly associates with further proteins including phospholipase C (PLC)gamma1 and Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte phosphoprotein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), we investigated their role for NF-kappaB activation in Jurkat leukemia T cell lines deficient for expression of these two proteins. Cells lacking SLP-76 or PLCgamma1 failed to activate NF-kappaB in response to T cell costimulation. In contrast, replenishment of SLP-76 or PLCgamma1 expression restored CD3/CD28-induced IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity as well as NF-kappaB DNA binding and transactivation. PKCtheta activated NF-kappaB in SLP-76- and PLCgamma1-deficient cells, showing that PKCtheta is acting further downstream. In contrast, Vav1-induced NF-kappaB activation was normal in SLP-76(-) cells, but absent in PLCgamma1(-) cells. CD3/CD28-stimulated recruitment of PKCtheta and IKKgamma to lipid rafts was lost in SLP-76- or PLCgamma1-negative cells, while translocation of Vav1 remained unaffected. Accordingly, recruitment of PKCtheta to the immunological synapse strictly relied on the presence of SLP-76 and PLCgamma1, but synapse translocation of Vav1 identified in this study was independent from both proteins. These results show the importance of SLP-76 and PLCgamma1 for NF-kappaB activation and raft translocation of PKCtheta and IKKgamma.
