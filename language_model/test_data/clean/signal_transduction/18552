Oxygen homeostasis under conditions of limited O2 supply requires hypoxia-dependent gene regulation. The transcription factor complex hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) has been recognized as the master regulator that mediates the adaptational genetic response to ensure restoration of energy supply. This review will focus on the recent advances in understanding the hypoxia-induced cellular response with particular respect to cellular O2 sensing for adequate control of HIF-1 activation.
