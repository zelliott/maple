In this article, we review the evidence that dietary protein has a positive influence on bone health, reduces hip fracture risk, and promotes postfracture recovery, and we consider the molecular, cellular, and endocrine bases of the interactions that link protein and calcium metabolism, including effects via IGF-1 and PTH. In addition, we consider the roles of amino acid-sensing mechanisms in coupling dietary protein intake to metabolic change as well as the central role of calcium-sensing receptors (CaRs) in the control of calcium metabolism. Finally, we consider how recently identified broad-spectrum amino acid-sensing receptors from class 3 of the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily including, remarkably, the CaR itself may contribute to the impact of dietary protein on bone.
