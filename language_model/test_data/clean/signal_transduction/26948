The natriuretic peptide family of proteins acts through two distinct classes of receptors that signal through entirely different mechanisms. The elucidation of the structure of the guanylate cyclase-containing receptor proteins has provided a better understanding of the mechanisms by which the natriuretic peptides regulate diverse functions of salt and water balance, in conjunction with other vasoactive peptides. A second receptor class was named for the originally described function of this protein to clear the natriuretic peptides from plasma. The mechanism of signaling for the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor is not firmly established. All known members of the natriuretic peptide family bind to, and can theoretically act through, the clearance receptor. This review summarizes the known features of the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor, a protein that contains extracellular and transmembrane domains and a short cytoplasmic segment. Recent studies have pointed to new and potentially important functions for this protein in mediating the actions of the natriuretic peptides.
