To investigate the effect of l-stepholidine (SPD) on the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) in the pyramidal cells between layers V and VI in the prelimbic cortex (PL).

A whole-cell patch clamp in rat brain slices was used.

SPD significantly increased the frequency of sEPSC in a concentration-dependent manner. A selective D1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH23390 blocked SPD-mediated effects, whereas the D1 agonist SKF38393, but not the D2/3 antagonist sulpiride, mimicked SPD-mediated increase in the frequency of sEPSC. Moreover, both protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor N-(2- [p-bromocinnamylamino]-ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide hydrochloride and protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine attenuated the effect of SPD on sEPSC.

SPD elicits its effect on the frequency of sEPSC on the PL pyramidal cells via presynaptic D1 receptors, and is dependent on PKA and PKC signaling pathways.
