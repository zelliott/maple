Engagement of antigen and immunoglobulin receptors on hematopoietic cells is directly coupled to activation of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that then phosphorylate critical intracellular substrates. In mast cells stimulated through the FcvarepsilonRI receptor, activation of several PTKs including Syk leads to degranulation and release of such mediators of the allergic response as histamine and serotonin. Regulation of Syk function occurred through interaction with the Cbl protein, itself a PTK substrate in this system. Overexpression of Cbl led to inhibition of Syk and suppression of serotonin release from mast cells, demonstrating its ability to inhibit a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. Complex adaptor proteins such as Cbl can directly regulate the functions of the proteins they bind.
