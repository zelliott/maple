The Runx1 transcription factor is post-translationally modified by seryl/threonyl phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation that control its interactions with transcription factor partners and epigenetic coregulators. In this issue of Genes & Development, Huang and colleagues (pp. 1587-1601) describe how the regulation of Runx1 tyrosyl phosphorylation by Src family kinases and the Shp2 phosphatase toggle Runx1's interactions between different coregulatory molecules.
