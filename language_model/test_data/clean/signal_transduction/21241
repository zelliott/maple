Long-term ethanol intake suppresses liver regeneration in vivo and ethanol interferes with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis in vitro. Therefore, the effects of long-term ethanol treatment on EGF-activated signaling reactions in rat hepatocytes were investigated.

Hepatocytes from long-term ethanol-fed rats and pair-fed controls were stimulated with EGF (0.5-20 nmol/L) for 15-120 seconds. Tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor (EGFR), Shc, and phospholipase-C gamma1 (PLC gamma), and growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2) coprecipitation with EGFR and Shc were analyzed by Western blotting.

EGFR autophosphorylation was suppressed at all EGF concentrations in ethanol-fed cells compared with pair-fed cells, without significant differences in total EGFR protein or EGFR tyrosine kinase activity detected in cell lysates, suggesting that intracellular factors suppressed EGFR function. EGF-induced PLC gamma tyrosine phosphorylation and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) formation were suppressed, but cytosolic [Ca2+]c elevation was little affected, indicating enhanced InsP3-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release in ethanol-fed cells. Grb2 binding to EGFR was suppressed, but EGF-induced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Grb2 association with Shc were not significantly decreased.

Long-term ethanol feeding suppressed EGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation in rat hepatocytes with differential inhibition of downstream signaling processes mediated by PLC gamma, Shc, and Grb2. Altered patterns of downstream signals emanating from EGFR may contribute to deficient liver regeneration in chronic alcoholism.
