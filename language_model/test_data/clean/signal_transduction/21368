Although protein phosphorylation is integral to the regulation of protein function in diverse biological responses, relatively little is currently known about the rules that govern phosphorylation in plants. This review will discuss how the data acquired by evolving phosphoproteomic methods are beginning to fill the gaps in our knowledge. In addition, ways are suggested in which new quantitative methods in conjunction with extrapolating from genomic data may provide a strategy to predict components of signalling networks that may be co-ordinately regulated.
