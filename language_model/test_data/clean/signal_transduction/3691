Ca2+ plays a central role in cell signaling, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a major mediator of Ca2+ actions. The spatial distribution of intracellular Ca2+ signaling is not homogenous, rather it is dynamically organized, and it has been speculated that spatial patterns of Ca2+ signals may function as a form of cellular information transmitted to downstream molecules. To address this issue, we studied the intracellular distributions of the signalings by CaMKII and Ca2+ in the same astrocytes. The former was visualized by monitoring site-specific phosphorylation of a cytoskeletal protein vimentin, using site- and phosphorylation-specific antibodies, while the latter was examined by fura-2-based Ca2+ microscopy. Local Ca2+ signals induced vimentin phosphorylation by CaMKII localized in the same area. On the other hand, Ca2+ waves in astrocytes induced global phosphorylation of vimentin by CaMKII. A small population of vimentin filaments highly phosphorylated by CaMKII underwent structural alteration into short filaments at electron microscopic level. These results indicate that CaMKII transmits spatial patterns of Ca2+ signals to vimentin as cellular information. The possibility is discussed that spatial patterns of vimentin phosphorylation may be important for intracellular organization of vimentin filament networks.
