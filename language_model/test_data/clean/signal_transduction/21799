In rat mesencephalic trigeminal (Mes V) neurons, persistent sodium currents in conjunction with low-threshold potassium currents are critical for generation of subthreshold membrane oscillations and onset of burst behavior. Here we demonstrate that the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway modulates persistent sodium currents. In particular, we show that elevation of cAMP suppresses a low-threshold I(NaP) via a PKA intracellular pathway. Bath application of forskolin (20 microM), a stimulant for the production of cAMP, reduced the peak I(NaP). 1,9-Dideoxy-forskolin (20 microM), an inactive form of forskolin, produced minimal effects on I(NaP), and the membrane-permeable cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cAMP (500 microM) mimicked the effect of forskolin. Additionally, preapplication of H89 (2 microM), a specific PKA inhibitor, suppressed the effect of forskolin, suggesting the involvement of the cAMP/PKA intracellular signaling pathway in this modulation. 5-HT receptor stimulation (20 microM) also mimicked the modulation of I(NaP) by forskolin via the cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling pathway. Current clamp analysis demonstrated that voltage-dependent membrane resonance in response to a ZAP input current at depolarized holding potentials (approximately -50 mV) was specifically suppressed by forskolin or 5-HT. Moreover, drug application enhanced frequency adaptation in response to a 1-sec current pulse. These results indicate that modulation of persistent sodium currents by a cAMP/PKA pathway can significantly alter the membrane excitability and discharge characteristics of Mes V neurons.
