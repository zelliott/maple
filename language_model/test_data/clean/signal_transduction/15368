The purpose of this review is to document the development of fish radiobiology techniques which have led to the discovery of an in vivo communication of radiation-induced signals from irradiated fish to unirradiated fish.

This review discusses the development of fish radiobiology techniques and knowledge with particular emphasis on mechanisms relevant to modern systems biology and discusses the implications for ecology and evolution of the new research findings.

Communication of information using chemical signals is one of the most widespread and primitive methods of information transfer. Since it is found in plant, animal and microbial kingdoms, it should have been no surprise that fish receiving a dose of ionising radiation, communicate a chemical message to other fish, causing the partner or 'bystander' fish to induce what may be protective strategies, should they be exposed. However, it was a surprise in the radiobiology bystander field and has led to an interesting cross fertilisation between the fields of radiobiology and chemical ecology.
