The juvenoid, methyl farnesoate (MF), is synthesized in the mandibular organs (MOs) of crustaceans, under the control of mandibular organ-inhibiting hormone (MO-IH). Using an in vitro assay to measure synthesis of MF by MOs, the effect of a variety of agents that affect signal transduction pathways was investigated. Of the compounds tested, only agents which affect cAMP (forskolin and 8-bromoadenosine cyclic-3',5'-monophosphate) levels were found to mimic the inhibitory action of MO-IH on MF synthesis. To further support these findings, the effect of MO-IH-1 on production of cAMP was investigated. The results demonstrated that MO-IH stimulated a dose-dependent increase in cAMP levels. Furthermore, a maximal 2-fold increase in cAMP was detected after a 5-min exposure of MO membranes to 100 nM MO-IH-1, falling to basal levels thereafter. The results presented strongly support a role for cAMP in the signal transduction mechanism of MO-IH that leads to inhibition of MF synthesis in MOs.
