Optimal regimens for ovulation induction depend on a sound, fundamental understanding of the physiology of ovulation. This chapter will review the endocrinology of folliculogenesis, with particular emphasis on the signaling pathways activated by FSH and LH. Important new information regarding the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction and the biologic responses that are produced will also be presented. Ultimately, a clearer understanding of mechanisms regulating the selection and promotion of the dominant follicle, as described here, will lead to advances in the field of ovulation induction and pregnancy in women.
