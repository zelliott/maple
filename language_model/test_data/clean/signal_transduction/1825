The 2002 Keystone Symposium on "Regulation of Cellular Responses by Lipid Mediators" provided a lively and active forum to discuss research in lipid signaling. This meeting review can provide only a glimpse into the diversity of research presented. Here we have chosen to highlight a group of exciting presentations describing novel features of the temporal and spatial regulation of phosphoinositides and their downstream targets.
