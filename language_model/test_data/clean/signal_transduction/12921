We have determined the kinetics of up-regulation of the homologous recombination gene RAD51, one of the genes induced following DNA damage in isogenic haploid DNA repair-deficient mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using treatment with the DNA crosslinking agent 8-methoxypsoralen. We show that RAD51 is up-regulated concomitantly, although independently, with a shift from the G1 cell cycle phase to G2/M arrest. This up-regulation is absent in homologous recombination repair-deficient mutants and increased in mutants deficient in nucleotide excision repair and pol(zeta)-dependent translesion synthesis. We demonstrate that the Rad53-dependent DNA damage signal transduction cascade is active in RAD51 non-inducing mutants. However, when independently eliminated, it too abolishes RAD51 up-regulation. We present a model in which RAD51 up-regulation requires two signals: one depending on the Rad53-dependent DNA damage signal transduction cascade and the other on homologous recombination repair.
