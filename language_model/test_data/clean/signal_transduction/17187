Interferon (IFN)-γ is a potent stimulator of the IL-12 family Th1 cytokines, including IL-12/23p40 and IL-23, responsible for coordinating the innate and adaptive immune responses. Our results show that IFN-γ induced the production of IL-12/23p40 and IL-23p19 mRNA as well as IL-12p40 and IL-23 proteins in primary human monocytes isolated by positive selection through anti-CD14 microbeads. These results were confirmed by IFN-γ stimulation of CD14-activated monocytes resulting in IL-12/23p40 and IL-23 production. We investigated the signaling pathways governing the regulation of IL-23 and its subunits IL-23p40 and IL-23p19 following IFN-γ stimulation. We observed a differential regulation of IL-23p19, IL-12/23p40, and IL-23 following IFN-γ stimulation. IFN-γ-induced IL-23 and IL-12/23p40 expression was positively regulated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), independent of the Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling. In contrast, IL-12 and IL-23 were negatively regulated by the Jak/STAT, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPKs in IFN-γ-stimulated monocytes. Overall, our results suggest for the first time a differential positive regulation of IL-12p40 and IL-23 by p38 MAPKs independent of the Jak/STAT pathways and negative regulation by the Jak/STAT, JNK, and PI3K pathways in CD14-activated primary human monocytes stimulated with IFN-γ.
