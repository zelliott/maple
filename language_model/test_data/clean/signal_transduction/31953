Tissues of animals and plants are maintained through balanced cell growth, movement, and elimination. Although cells are exchanged perpetually, the whole structure of the tissue is maintained. This form of maintenance is called cell turnover. Here I propose a bio-inspired model of patterns that regenerate through turnover. This model is derived from the Dachsous-Fat system, which has recently attracted much attention because it is considered to facilitate regeneration in insect legs. In this model, I parameterized the manner of the redistribution of Dachsous and Fat during cell division, and then derived equations in the parameters that enable the patterns to regenerate and maintain themselves through turnover. I extended the equations derived in the one-dimensional model into a two-dimensional model. Finally, I discuss a possible relationship between regeneration and turnover.
