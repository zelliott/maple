Integrins comprise a large family of alphabeta heterodimeric cell-surface receptors that are found in many animal species. They are expressed on a wide variety of cells. There are two members in the beta3 integrin family: alphaIIb beta3 and alpha(v)beta3. This class of adhesion receptors mediates cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Dysregulation of the beta3 integrins is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases (including cancer) and in transplant rejection. Integrins also play a key role in many virus infectious cycles. In this paper the biological functions of the beta3 family are reviewed, with particular interest in its role in cancer progression and metastasis.
