We have shown that dopamine (DA), an inhibitor of prolactin secretion from anterior pituitary lactotrophs, stabilizes the cortical actin cytoskeleton. DA-induced cortical actin stabilization is accompanied by cytoplasmic actin cable disassembly and cell rounding up. Our aim was to identify the mechanisms involved in DA-induced stabilization of the lactotroph's actin cytoskeleton. Here we show that DA increased the association of myosin II with the cell cortex, suggesting that DA facilitates actin-myosin interaction to stabilize cortical actin filaments. This notion was supported by the finding that inhibitors of actin-myosin interaction blocked DA-evoked morphological responses. In addition, our results showed that DA-induced myosin association with the cell periphery may be mediated by inhibition of Rac1/Cdc42-dependent pathways, whereas, DA-induced cytoplasmic actin filament disassembly may be mediated by the inhibition of MLCK- and RhoA-dependent pathways. In conclusion, the present results provide evidence that myosin II is involved in the DA-induced remodeling of actin filaments in lactotrophs, and that DA-induced cortical actin filament assembly and stabilization involve the translocation of myosin II to the cell cortex. This effect requires, among other things, inhibition of the Rac1/Cdc42-dependent signaling pathway.
