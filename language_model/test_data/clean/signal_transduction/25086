In previous studies we demonstrated that histone preparations possess multiple effects in vivo on pituitary hormone secretion. We have now studied the specificity and signal transduction pathways involved in the prolactin (PRL)-releasing activity of histones H2A and H2B on perifused and incubated rat pituitary cells. In the perifusion experiments, freshly dispersed pituitary cells were packed into short columns and were continuously perifused with serum-free medium. The substances to be tested (stimuli) were pumped through the perifusion circuit, at the end of which perifusate fractions were collected and PRL measured by specific RIA. In the incubation studies, freshly dispersed pituitary cells were incubated in a metabolic incubator with different stimuli at different doses and for varying times. Perifusion of cells with median eminence extract (1/30), histone H2A (30 microM) or histone H2B (30 microM), generated clear PRL release responses. Cells incubated with histone H2A and H2B showed a dose- and time-dependent stimulatory effect on PRL release which, for H2A, was blocked by peptide MB-35, an 86-120 amino acid synthetic fragment of histone H2A. The polycation, poly-lys was unable to mimic the action of histones. To detect the possible signal transduction pathways involved in the response of lactotrophs to histones, cells were incubated with the calcium ionophore A23187, the calcium chelator EGTA, the intracellular phosphoinositide enhancer LiCl, the intracellular cAMP enhancers caffeine, NaF and forskolin, and the protein kinase C inhibitor, trifluoperazine (TFP). Both EGTA (or EGTA plus A23187 ionophore) and TFP were able to reduce significantly the response of lactotrophs to histones. Our results confirm previous evidence that histones may act as hypophysotropic signals. The data also suggest that calcium- and diacylglycerol-associated pathways participate in these effects.
