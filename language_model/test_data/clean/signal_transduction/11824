Inactivated Sendai virus (HVJ-E) directly kills cancer cells by inducing apoptosis through a mechanism mediated by Janus kinases/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathways. However, whether other signaling pathways are involved remain largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying HVJ-E-induced apoptosis in murine B16F10 melanoma cells. We found that HVJ-E induced B16F10 cell apoptosis via the caspase pathway, particularly caspase-9, which mediates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation also contributed to HVJ-E-induced apoptosis. Whereas caspase pathway involvement depended on both IFN-Î² promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1) and type I interferon (IFN), MAPK pathway activation was independent of type I IFN but involved IPS-1. In addition, intratumoral HVJ-E treatment displayed a direct oncolytic effect in an in vivo BALB/c nude mouse melanoma model. Collectively, our data provides new insights into the mechanism underlying HVJ-E-induced apoptosis in tumor cells.
