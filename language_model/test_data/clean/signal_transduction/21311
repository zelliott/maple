Modeling, the heart of systems biology, of complex processes (example: signal transduction) is a wide scientific discipline where many approaches from different areas are confronted with the aim of better understanding, identifying and modeling of complex data coming from various sources. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the basic steps of systems biology view towards signaling pathways, which mainly deals with the computational tools. The paper emphasizes the modeling and simulation approach in the signal transduction pathways using the topologies of the biochemical reactions with an overview of the different types of software platforms. Finally, we demonstrated the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway model as an example to study the growth factor mediated signaling system with biological experiments. This paper will enables new comers to underline the strengths of the computational approaches towards signal transduction, as well as to highlight the systems biology research directions.
