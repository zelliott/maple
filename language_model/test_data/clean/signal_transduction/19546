Disrupted or aberrant endocrine signaling has profound effects on the health of both children and adults. This issue focuses attention on endocrine signaling mediated by G protein-coupled receptor and receptor tyrosine kinase pathways involved in endocrine signaling, especially those critical in child development and health. Research in this issue highlights gender-specific differences in glucocorticoid signaling, which have implications for gender-specific treatment of inflammatory diseases.
