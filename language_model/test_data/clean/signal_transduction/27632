Deregulated expression of c-Myc has been shown to induce or enhance apoptosis in various different cell types. c-Myc requires p53 for apoptosis in some but not all the cell types, indicating heterogeneous mechanisms for c-Myc-induced apoptosis. In B lymphoma line WEHI-231, stable expression of c-Myc has been demonstrated to protect cells from BCR-mediated apoptosis. However, stable expression of c-Myc carrying pro-apoptotic functions may generate variant cells resistant to apoptosis. By utilizing an inducible system for c-Myc, we demonstrated here that deregulated expression of c-Myc induced apoptosis of WEHI-231 by itself, indicating that c-Myc induces apoptosis in WEHI-231 as is the case for other cell types. When transactivation of p53 was inactivated, WEHI-231 cells overexpressing c-Myc no longer underwent apoptosis in the absence of other stimuli, but showed markedly enhanced apoptosis in the presence of BCR ligation. These results indicate that deregulated c-Myc expression enhances apoptosis by a p53-independent pathway in the presence of BCR signaling but requires p53 for apoptosis in the absence of BCR crosslinking in WEHI-231. BCR ligation may thus activate a p53-independent pathway of c-Myc-induced apoptosis.
