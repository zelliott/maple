Glatiramer acetate (GA), an immunomodulator used in multiple sclerosis (MS) therapy, induces the production of secreted IL-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1Ra), a natural inhibitor of IL-1β, in human monocytes, and in turn enhances sIL-1Ra circulating levels in MS patients. GA is a mixture of peptides with random Glu, Lys, Ala, and Tyr sequences of high polarity and hydrophilic nature that is unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier. In contrast, sIL-1Ra crosses the blood-brain barrier and, in turn, may mediate GA anti-inflammatory activities within the CNS by counteracting IL-1β activities. Here we identify intracellular signaling pathways induced by GA that control sIL-1Ra expression in human monocytes. By using kinase knockdown and specific inhibitors, we demonstrate that GA induces sIL-1Ra production via the activation of PI3Kδ, Akt, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, demonstrating that both PI3Kδ/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways rule sIL-1Ra expression in human monocytes. The pathways act in parallel upstream glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β (GSK3α/β), the knockdown of which enhances sIL-1Ra production. Together, our findings demonstrate the existence of signal transduction triggered by GA, further highlighting the mechanisms of action of this drug in MS.
