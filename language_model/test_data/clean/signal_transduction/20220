10-Acetylirciformonin B, a furanoterpenoid derived from irciformonin B found in a marine sponge, has been reported to possess potent cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines. However, the mechanism of its apoptotic activity against human leukemia cells has never been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of 10-acetylirciformonin B and its possible mechanism of action against leukemia HL 60 cells. We found that 10-acetylirciformonin B decreased cell viability through the inhibition of cell growth as well as the induction of DNA damage and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of DNA damage was mediated by the increase of p-CHK2 and Î³-H2A.X, which was suggested from the increase of tail movement in the neutral Comet assay. Induction of apoptosis was mediated with the increase in caspases 8, 9 and 3 activation as well as PARP cleavage. In summary, our resultsindicate that 10-acetylirciformonin B treatment causes apoptosis in leukaemia cells; probably through a caspase-dependent regulatory pathway.
