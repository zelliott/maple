Previous work with growing chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) indicates that transient dietary protein restriction induces long-term enhancement of adrenal steroidogenic function in response to adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). The present study investigated two possible cellular functions mediating this enhanced response: (a) ACTH signal transduction and dissemination and (b) short-loop feedback inhibition of ACTH-induced corticosterone production by exogenous corticosterone. Cockerels (2 weeks old) were fed isocaloric synthetic diets containing either 20% (control) or 8% (restriction) soy protein for 4 weeks. Adrenal glands were processed for the isolation of adrenal steroidogenic cells nearly devoid of chromaffin cells ( approximately 90% adrenal steroidogenic cells). Results of experiments to assess signal transduction and dissemination indicated that protein restriction selectively enhanced ACTH-induced corticosterone production mediated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent pathway. In addition, protein restriction substantially counteracted exogenous corticosterone-dependent inhibition of acute ACTH-induced corticosterone production (by 40.7% vs control). The proximal portion of the cAMP pathway seemed most affected by this stressor. Protein-restricted cells exhibited enhanced homologous sensitization to ACTH (136% greater than that of control cells) which appeared to be localized at a step(s) prior to or at the formation to cAMP. Also, maximal ACTH-induced cAMP production and sensitivity to ACTH in terms of cAMP production by protein-restricted cells were, respectively, 2.2 and 15.8 times those of control cells. However, variable results were obtained from other experiments designed to pinpoint the altered early steps in ACTH-transmembranous signaling. For example, with intact cells, cAMP responses to cholera toxin (CT) and forskolin (FSK) did not corroborate the results suggesting an augmentation of ACTH-signal transduction induced by protein restriction. Furthermore, basal and stimulatable (by ACTH, CT, FSK, and NaF) adenylyl cyclase activities from membranes from protein-restricted cells were, respectively, 47.2 and 40.2% less than those from control cells (normalized to 10(7) cell equivalents of crude membranes). Collectively, these findings suggest that protein restriction stress potentiates ACTH-induced corticosterone secretion by chicken adrenal steroidogenic cells in at least two ways: (1) on the proximal end, by modulating unknown factors which enhance cellular sensitivity to ACTH, ACTH receptor-adenylyl cyclase coupling, and adenylyl cyclase activity, and (2) on the distal end, by suppressing end-product corticosterone negative feedback, thus facilitating an increase in net corticosterone secretion.
