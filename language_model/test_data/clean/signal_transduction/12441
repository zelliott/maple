Members of both the Wnt and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) families of signaling molecules have been implicated in the regulation of cartilage development. We explored the underlying mechanism of BMP-2-induced chondrocyte commitment of C3H10T1/2 cells. Treating cells with exogenous BMP-2 was tied to chondrocyte commitment by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity (MMP-9: 92 kDa type IV collagenase/gelatinase B). Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta inhibition by its specific inhibitor blocked BMP-2-induced chondrocyte commitment by stimulating MMP-9 activity. These findings indicate that the downregulation of MMP-9 by BMP-2 is associated with chondrocyte commitment, and that the GSK-3beta signaling pathway is involved in this process.
