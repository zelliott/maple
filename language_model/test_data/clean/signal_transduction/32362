Angiotensin II induces protein tyrosine kinase activation and apparent decreased electrophoretic mobility of the c-raf-1 serine/threonine protein kinase in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of at least 9 cellular proteins with molecular weights of 151, 131, 116, 110, 90, 65, 62, 60, 52 kd was induced in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and included a serine/threonine protein kinase. The phosphotyrosine containing proteins differed from those induced by PDGF BB or AB. Angiotensin II by itself was shown not to act as a mitogen in cultured smooth muscle cells.
