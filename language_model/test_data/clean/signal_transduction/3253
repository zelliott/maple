The current paradigm of G protein coupled receptor signaling involves a classical pathway being the activation of phospholipase C and the generation of 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate, signaling through β-arrestin scaffold molecules and the transactivation of tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors. Transactivation greatly expands the range of signaling pathways and responses attributable to the receptor. Recently it has been revealed that G protein coupled receptor agonists can also transactivate the serine/threonine kinase cell surface receptor for transforming growth factor-β (Alk5). This leads to the generation of carboxyl terminal phosphorylated Smad2 which is the immediate downstream product of the activated Alk5. Thus, the current paradigm of G protein coupled signaling can be expanded to include the transactivation of the serine kinase receptor Alk5. These insights expand the possibilities for outcomes of therapeutically targeting GPCRs where more substantive and prolonged actions such as the synthesis of extracellular matrix may be affected.
