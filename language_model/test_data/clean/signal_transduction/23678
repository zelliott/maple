We previously reported that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) appearance in the portal vein facilitates hepatic vagal afferent activity, and this further augments reflexively the pancreatic vagal efferents in anesthetized rats, suggesting a neuroincretin effect of GLP-1. To determine whether the GLP-1-induced vagal pathways lead to a neuronal-mediated component (NMC) of insulin secretion, we infused GLP-1 at a physiological or pharmacological dose (1 or 3 pmol·kg(-1)·min(-1), respectively) into the portal vein in conscious rats with selective hepatic vagotomy (Vagox) or sham operation (Sham). The experiments consisted of two sequential 10-min intraportal infusions (P1 and P2): glucose at a physiological rate (56 μmol·kg(-1)·min(-1)) in P1 and the glucose plus GLP-1 or vehicle in P2. Under arterial isoglycemia across the groups, the physiological GLP-1 infusion in Sham augmented promptly and markedly arterial insulin levels, approximately twofold the levels in glucose alone infusion (P < 0.005), and insulin levels in Vagox diminished apparently (P < 0.05). Almost 60% of the GLP-1-induced insulin secretion (AUC) in Sham met the NMC, i.e., difference between insulin secretion in Sham and Vagox, (AUC 976 ± 65 vs. 393 ± 94 pmol·min/l, respectively, P < 0.005). Intraportal pharmacological GLP-1 infusion further augmented insulin secretion in both groups, but the NMC remained in 46% (NS; Sham vs. Vagox). In contrast, "isoglycemic" intravenous GLP-1 infusion (3 pmol·kg(-1)·min(-1)) evoked an equal insulin secretion in both groups. Thus, the present results indicate that GLP-1 appearing in the portal vein evokes a powerful neuronal-mediated insulinotropic effect, suggesting the neuroincretin effect.
