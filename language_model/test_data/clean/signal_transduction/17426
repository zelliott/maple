Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF) convened its 19th Annual Scientific Retreat October 25-27, 2012, in Carlsbad, CA. Each year, this event brings together diverse researchers in a collaborative forum to present and discuss new and largely unpublished findings for prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment and defines the challenges to ending this disease as a threat to life and well-being. Several themes resonated at the multidisciplinary meeting, notably (i) the roles of field cancerization, tumor microenvironment, epithelial plasticity, signal transduction pathways in cancer progression, and disease resistance; (ii) intratumoral heterogeneity and consequences for precision medicine; (iii) resistance mechanisms to androgen axis inhibitors; and (iv) advances in molecular imaging and therapeutics for better detection and treatment.
