Fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) and their receptors (Fgfrs) are important intercellular signaling molecules that are essential to mammalian embryonic development. The signaling pathways between endoderm-derived gastric epithelium and the surrounding mesenchyme are largely unknown; however, the developmental expression profile of the IIIb isoform of Fgfr2 (Fgfr2b) and its main ligand, Fgf10, suggest that they may be strong candidates. Mice lacking either component (Fgfr2b-/- or Fgf10-/-) were examined to determine the role of Fgfr2b-mediated signaling during gastric organogenesis.

Stomachs from embryonic day 13.5-18.5 Fgfr2b-/-, Fgf10-/-, and wild-type littermates were collected and analyzed by conventional histology, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopy.

Fgfr2b-/- and Fgf10-/- fetuses had stomachs smaller than wild-type, consisting of relatively proportionate forestomach but disproportionately reduced glandular stomach, the mucosa of which has low cytoarchitectural complexity with a spiral arrangement of large mucosal folds. During mid to late fetal stages (embryonic day 15.5-18.5), epithelial differentiation to mucous and chief cell lineages was rudimentary, with no expression of several early cytodifferentiation markers including GATA4, GATA6, and H+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase and abnormal expression of members of the hedgehog family of signaling molecules.

Fgfr2b and Fgf10 are part of a signaling network with Sonic hedgehog and Indian hedgehog that are essential to anterior-posterior and radial patterning in gastric development.
