Studies on electropermeabilized human platelets indicated that any two of three distinct factors must be present for marked secretion of dense or alpha-granule constituents to occur. These factors are Ca2+, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and activation of an unidentified GTP-binding protein ('GE'). Thus, in the absence of Ca2+, phorbol ester and GTP[S] acted synergistically to promote secretion, whereas in the presence of Ca2+, either activation of PKC or addition of GTP[S] was sufficient. In all cases, secretion correlated with the activation of phospholipase D (PLD), as detected by the formation of [3H]phosphatidic acid (PA) in the absence of ethanol or of [3H]phosphatidylethanol (PEt) in the presence of ethanol. Secretion did not correlate with phospholipase C (PLC) activity or with the accumulation of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), both of which required Ca2+ and were inhibited by phorbol ester. Ethanol partially inhibited secretion in the absence of Ca2+. BAPTA, a known inhibitor of Ca(2+)-independent secretion in permeabilized cells, caused parallel inhibitions of secretion and PLD activity. GTP[S] enhanced PKC activity, as indicated by pleckstrin phosphorylation, apparently by stimulating the formation of PA in the absence of Ca2+, as well as of DAG in the presence of Ca2+. PA and stable analogues, including PEt, stimulated the Ca(2+)-independent phosphorylation of pleckstrin and other proteins in platelet supernatant fraction. The results suggest that PA formed by activation of PLD may mediate secretion from permeabilized platelets by PKC-dependent and independent mechanisms. However, in intact platelets stimulated by thrombin, PLD accounted for only 10-20% of the total PA formed and can only play a major role in secretion if this PA fraction is distinct from that formed by the combined actions of PLC and DAG kinase.
