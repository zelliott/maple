The Drosophila midgut has emerged as an attractive model system to study stem cell biology. Extensive studies have been carried out to investigate the mechanisms of how the signaling pathways integrate to regulate intestinal stem cells (ISCs), yet, whether the microRNAs are involved in ISC self-renewal and maintenance is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the bantam microRNA is expressed specifically at high levels in Drosophila midgut precursor cells (including ISCs and enteroblasts) and secretory enteroendocrine cells while at extremely low levels in enterocytes. Furthermore, overexpression of bantam microRNA results in increase of the division of the midgut precursor cells, whereas loss of bantam microRNA decreases their proliferation. The mechanical studies show that bantam microRNA is essential for the Hpo pathway induced cell-autonomous ISC self-renewal, while it is disposable for EGFR and Notch pathways mediated ISC proliferation. More interestingly, we find that bantam microRNA is not required for the Hpo pathway mediated non-cell-autonomous ISC proliferation, revealing a novel mechanism by which the Hpo signaling pathway specifies its transcriptional targets in specific tissue to exhibit its biological functions.
