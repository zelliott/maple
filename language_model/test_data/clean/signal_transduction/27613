Rhizobial lipochitooligosaccharidic Nod factors mediate the specific recognition between leguminous plants and their prokaryotic symbionts. This review summarizes recent findings on the way plants could perceive and transduce these bacterial signals. It starts by summarizing knowledge about Nod factor binding sites, before moving to the potential implications in Nod factor signal transduction of G proteins, root-hair plasma membrane depolarisation, cytoplasmic and extracellular alkalinisation and finally variations in cytoplasmic calcium concentration.
