Extracellular matrix (ECM)-integrin stimulation can promote beta cell differentiation, proliferation and function. However, beta cells lose their insulin secretion function in response to glucose stimulation, and senesce when cultured with ECM proteins for a long time. Fibrin is a provisional ECM protein that is capable of maintaining beta cell function, yet the mechanisms by which this occurs is unknown. The present study examined how fibrin interacts with integrin receptors to promote beta cell cluster formation, proliferation and function. The rat insulinoma cell line, INS-1, was cultured on tissue-culture polystyrene, or with 2-D or 3-D fibrin gels for up to 4 weeks. Cells cultured with fibrin formed islet-like clusters and showed direct contacts with fibrin determined by scanning electron microscopy. Fibrin-cultured INS-1 cells also had significantly increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. A significant increase in integrin αvβ3 protein and phosphorylated FAK, Erk1/2 and Akt levels was observed in fibrin-cultured INS-1 cells, which was associated with significantly increased cell proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis. Integrin αvβ3 blockade affected INS-1 cell spreading on fibrin gels, and resulted in significantly decreased FAK phosphorylation and increased cleaved caspase-3 levels. These results show that fibrin promotes beta cell function, proliferation and survival via integrin αvβ3 interactions.
