Filamin, known primarily for its actin cross-linking function, is a stretch-sensitive structural and signaling scaffold that binds transmembrane receptors and a wide variety of intracellular signaling proteins. The Caenorhabditis elegans filamin ortholog, FLN-1, has a well conserved overall structure, including an N-terminal actin-binding domain, and a series of 20 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like repeats. FLN-1 partially colocalizes with actin filaments in spermathecal and uterine cells. Analysis of phenotypes resulting from a deletion allele and RNAi depletion indicates FLN-1 is required to maintain the actin cytoskeleton in the spermatheca and uterus, and to allow the exit of embryos from the spermatheca. FLN-1 deficient animals accumulate embryos in the spermatheca, lay damaged and unfertilized eggs, and consequently exhibit dramatically reduced brood sizes. The phospholipase PLC-1 is also required for the exit of embryos from the spermatheca, and analysis of doubly mutant animals suggests that PLC-1 and FLN-1 act in the same pathway to promote proper transit of embryos from the spermatheca to the uterus. Given the modular protein structure, subcellular localization, genetic interaction with PLC-1, and known mechanosensory functions of filamin, we postulate that FLN-1 may be required to convert mechanical information about the presence of the oocyte into a biochemical signal, thereby allowing timely exit of the embryo from the spermatheca.
