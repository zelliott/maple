Our goal was to test whether formin homology protein 1 (FHOD1) plays a significant role in the regulation of smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation and, if so, whether Rho kinase (ROCK)-dependent phosphorylation in the diaphanous autoinhibitory domain is an important signaling mechanism that controls FHOD1 activity in SMC.

FHOD1 is highly expressed in aortic SMCs and in tissues with a significant SMC component. Exogenous expression of constitutively active FHOD1, but not wild-type, strongly activated SMC-specific gene expression in 10T1/2 cells. Treatment of SMC with the RhoA activator sphingosine-1-phosphate increased FHOD1 phosphorylation at Thr1141, and this effect was completely prevented by inhibition of ROCK with Y-27632. Phosphomimetic mutations to ROCK target residues enhanced FHOD1 activity, suggesting that phosphorylation interferes with FHOD1 autoinhibition. Importantly, knockdown of FHOD1 in SMC strongly inhibited sphingosine-1-phosphate-dependent increases in SMC differentiation marker gene expression and actin polymerization, suggesting that FHOD1 plays a major role in RhoA-dependent signaling in SMC.

Our results indicate that FHOD1 is a critical regulator of SMC phenotype and is regulated by ROCK-dependent phosphorylation. Thus, additional studies on the role of FHOD1 during development and the progression of cardiovascular disease will be important.
