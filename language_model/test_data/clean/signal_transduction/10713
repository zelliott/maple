Completion of the cell cycle requires the temporal and spatial coordination of chromosome segregation with mitotic spindle disassembly and cytokinesis. In budding yeast, the protein phosphatase Cdc14 is a key regulator of these late mitotic events. Here, we review the functions of Cdc14 and how this phosphatase is regulated to accomplish the coupling of mitotic processes. We also discuss the function and regulation of Cdc14 in other eukaryotes, emphasizing conserved features.
