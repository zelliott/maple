To identify specific mutants for components of phytochrome A (phyA) signaling in Arabidopsis, we established a light program consisting of multiple treatments with alternating red and far-red light. In wild-type seedlings, irradiation with multiple red light pulses can reduce the amount of phyA, which in turn decreases the high-irradiance responses (HIRs) mediated by the subsequent treatments with far-red light. Our mutants were able to avoid this red light-dependent reduction of the HIR. Here, we describe eid1, a new recessive mutant with increased sensitivity to far-red light. The eid1 mutation maps to the top of chromosome 4. The mutants showed no change in phenotype in darkness or under continuous white light, but they exhibited an increased sensitivity to red light and an increased persistence of HIR during prolonged dark phases after multiple short pulses of far-red light. The eid1 seedlings accumulated normal amounts of phytochrome and showed no alterations in the degradation or de novo synthesis of phyA. The expression of the Eid1 phenotype requires the presence of phyA. Our data provide evidence that EID1 is a negatively acting component in the phyA-dependent HIR-signaling pathway.
