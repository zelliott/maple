To analyze the function of Sj34.9 gene, so as to provide the reference for future studies.

The Sj34.9 gene was knocked down in Schistosoma japonicum by RNA interference (RNAi), and the microarray was used to analyze the genes'expression of S. japonicum after Sj34.9 knocked down.

A total of 378 genes expressed differently including 202 up-regulated genes and 176 down-regulated genes. The pathway analysis indicated that the genes expressed differently were mainly related to organelles, metabolism and signal transduction. The gene ontology category analysis showed that most of these genes might be involved in binding, membrane fomulation and cellular process.

The gene Sj34.9 might play important roles in the process of growth, development, reproduction and metabolism of S. japonicum.
