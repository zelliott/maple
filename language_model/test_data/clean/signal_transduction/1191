The nerve growth factor (NGF) is known as a factor involved in neuronal growth and survival. From recent studies it may also be considered as a mediator of inflammation, in particular in the airways.

Several animal studies have shown that NGF may increase the sensory innervation, and participate in the bronchial hyperresponsiveness and inflammation observed in the airways of asthmatic patients. Different cell types are capable of secreting NGF: inflammatory cells that infiltrate the bronchial mucosa, and structural cells such as epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells and pulmonary fibroblasts. Furthermore, increased NGF levels have been detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from asthmatic patients.

Altogether, these results suggest that NGF may play a role in inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway remodelling in asthma, and may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms occurring in chronic inflammatory diseases, in particular asthma.
