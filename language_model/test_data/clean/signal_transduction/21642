Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-alpha (PTPalpha) activates Src family kinases (SFKs) to promote the integrin-stimulated early autophosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We report here that integrin stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPalpha. PTPalpha was dephosphorylated upon fibroblast detachment from the substratum and rephosphorylated when cells were plated on the integrin ligand fibronectin. alpha PTP phosphorylation occurred at Tyr789 and required SFKs (Src or Fyn/Yes), FAK, and an intact cytoskeleton. It also required active PTPalpha or constitutively active Src. These observations indicate that PTPalpha activates SFKs and that the subsequently activated SFK.FAK tyrosine kinase complex in turn phosphorylates PTPalpha. Reintroduction of wild-type PTPalpha or unphosphorylatable PTPalpha(Y789F) (but not inactive PTPalpha) into PTPalpha-null fibroblasts restored defective integrin-induced SFK activation, FAK phosphorylation, and paxillin phosphorylation. PTPalpha(Y789F) and inactive PTPalpha could not rescue delayed actin stress fiber assembly and focal adhesion formation or defective cell migration. This study distinguishes two roles of PTPalpha in integrin signaling: an early role as an activator of SFKs and FAK with no requirement for PTPalpha phosphorylation and a later downstream role in cytoskeleton-associated events for which PTPalpha phosphorylation at Tyr789 is essential.
