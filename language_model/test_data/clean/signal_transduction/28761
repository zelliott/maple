Plants have the capacity to recognise and reject pathogens at various stages of their attempted colonisation of the plant. Non-specific rejection often arises as a consequence of the potential pathogen's attempt to breach the first lines of plant defence. Pathogens able to penetrate beyond this barrier of non-host resistance may seek a subtle and persuasive relationship with the plant. For some, this may be limited to molecular signals released outside the plant cell wall, but for others it includes penetration of the cell wall and the delivery of signal molecules to the plant cytosol. Direct or indirect recognition of these signals triggers host-specific resistance. Our understanding of host-specific resistance and its possible links to non-host-specific resistance has advanced significantly as more is discovered about the nature and function of the molecules underpinning both kinds of resistance.
