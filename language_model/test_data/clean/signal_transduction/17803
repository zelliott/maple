MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20- to 22-nucleotide fragments that regulate expression of mRNAs that have complementary sequences. They are numerous and widespread among eukaryotes, being conserved throughout evolution. The few miRNAs that have been fully characterized were found in Caenorhabditis elegans and are required for development. Recently, a study of miRNAs isolated from Arabidopsis showed that here also developmental genes are putative regulatory targets. A role for miRNAs have in plant development is supported by the developmental phenotypes of mutations in the genes required for miRNA processing.
