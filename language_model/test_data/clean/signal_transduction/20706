The cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i and dense tubular system (DTS) of washed human platelets were affected by low density lipoproteins (LDL) of 25 micrograms/ml at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes. After the incubation with LDL, the [Ca2+]i increased from 115 +/- 29 nM to 141 +/- 24 nM. LDL promoted the increase of [Ca2+]i (471 +/- 31 nM) induced by thrombin (0.03 U/ml) as compared to that which thrombin did alone (240 +/- 11 nM) (p < 0.05). The increased Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space is thought to be the reason of the increase in [Ca2+]i, since the effect of LDL was abolished by removal of external Ca2+ by EGTA. The DTS changed primarily from thin elongated forms to rounded vesicles. No evidence was noticed that LDL caused a mobilization of Ca2+ from the DTS.
