A growing family of cellular proteins encoding the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) has a crucial role in immunity by sensing virus infection and signaling antiviral immune defenses. Four independent studies have identified a novel CARD-containing protein, variously called IPS-1, MAVS, VISA and Cardif, which is an essential signaling adaptor of the host defense mediating CARD-CARD interactions with retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDAS), sensors of virus infection. Disruption of this novel signaling pathway by hepatitis C virus (HCV) might provide a foundation for viral persistence.
