Previous studies indicate that in brain tissue the endocannabinoid 2-AG is inactivated by monoglyceride lipase (MGL)-catalyzed hydrolysis, and a recent report has indicated that MGL activity could be specifically inhibited by URB754 . In the present study, URB754 failed to inhibit 2-AG hydrolysis in rat brain preparations. In addition, brain cryosections were employed to assess whether URB754 could facilitate the detection of 2-AG-stimulated G protein activity. Nevertheless, whereas pretreatment with PMSF readily allowed detection of 2-AG-stimulated G protein activity, URB754 was ineffective. In contrast to previous claims, brain FAAH activity was also resistant to URB754. Thus, in our hands URB754 was not able to block the endocannabinoid-hydrolyzing enzymes and cannot serve as a lead structure for future development of MGL-specific inhibitors.
