FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) are intracellular receptors for FK506 and rapamycin, immunosuppressants that have recently been utilized as anticancer drugs. In the cytoplasm, FKBPs and these drugs modulate signal transduction pathways. However, recent reports reveal novel functions of FKBPs in the nucleus, which include regulation of transcription factors, histone chaperone activity, and modifications of chromatin structure. These activities are known to affect gene expression, DNA repair, and DNA replication. Therefore, elucidation of the nuclear functions of FKBPs will help researchers and clinicians better understand how immunosuppressants work as anticancer drugs, which might in turn lead to novel designs of cancer therapy.
