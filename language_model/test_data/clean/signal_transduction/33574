The important antiviral and antitumor properties of interferons (IFNs) in vitro and in vivo have triggered extensive investigations over the years to understand the signals that control such responses in normal and malignant cells. The discovery of IFN-regulated Jak-Stat pathways and various ancillary cascades has led to the definition and establishment of models by which early signals at the IFN receptor level ultimately induce transcription of IFN-controlled genes to generate antiviral and antitumor responses. An important outstanding issue in the field has been the identification of the mechanisms responsible for regulation of mRNA translation of IFN-sensitive genes. There is emerging evidence suggesting that mTOR and its effectors play key and essential roles in the generation of such responses. Moreover, recent studies point towards Akt as a common and central integrator for such responses in Type I and II IFN signaling, via its regulatory effects on mTOR. Here, we review the accumulating evidence on the importance of Akt in IFN-signaling, with particular emphasis on its role in mRNA translation of IFN-sensitive genes. The implications of such studies on the overall perception of the Akt pathway are also discussed.
