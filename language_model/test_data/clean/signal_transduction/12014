Disuse atrophy of skeletal muscle is a common clinical problem and its exact mechanisms have not been fully understood. Previous studies suggested that disuse muscle atrophy is realized through the activation of one or more cell signaling pathways, but studies have shown that disuse atrophy is the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome caused extensive decomposition of the protein. The present researches for disuse atrophy mainly focus on regulatory role in the upstream signaling molecules MuRF1 and Atroginl/MAFbx by NF-kappaB, IGF-1/PI3K/Akt, TGF-beta/Smad and MAPK signal pathway and a plurality of signal pathway activation or inhibition and interaction,and then through the ubiquitin--proteasome to influence the metabolism of protein. But regulation of expression of MuRF1 and Atroginl/MAFbxs still to be studied. Participate in disuse atrophy also needs to be further studied with atrophy confirmation and functional gene verification. The paper summarized recent original articles about the researches of skeletal muscle disuse atrophy and reviewed the various signal pathways and related u-biquitin-proteasome protein metabolism of disuse muscle atrophy.
