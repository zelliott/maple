The hydrodynamic properties of the Gi2 alpha-subunit in human neutrophil cytosol were analyzed. The S20,w value was 3.3 S at 30 degrees C and 4.1 S at 4 degrees C. Reconstitution of the cytosolic alpha-subunit with beta gamma-complex purified from porcine brain resulted in an S20,w value of 4.0 S at 30 degrees C and 4.2 S at 4 degrees C. Treatment of cytosol with G-protein-activating agents, GTP gamma S and MgCl2, decreased the S20,w value to 2.4 S at 30 degrees C and 2.9 S at 4 degrees C. Our results indicate that the cytosolic alpha-subunit of neutrophils is an inactive monomeric species at 30 degrees C capable of interacting with G-protein beta gamma-complex and responsive to treatment with activating agents leading to the two activated forms, alpha at 4 degrees C and alpha at 30 degrees C.
