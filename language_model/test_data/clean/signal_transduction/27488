Upon contact with bacteria, eukaryotic cells activates a slurry of defence mechanisms via distinct signalling transduction pathways. However, some bacteria have evolved strategies to escape or inhibit these host defence systems. We have recently shown that the bacteria Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, which encodes the Yersinia outer protein (YopJ) appears to inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB by preventing the phosphorylation of IkappaB. In a subsequent series of experiments it has also been shown that YopJ blocks the phosphorylation of the p38 MAP kinase. Here the regulatory function of YopJ on eukaryotic signal transduction is discussed.
