The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the biological responses of androgens. However, non-androgenic pathways have also been shown to activate the AR. The mechanism of cross-talk between the interleukin-6 (IL-6) and AR signal transduction pathways was investigated in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. IL-6 induced several androgen-response element-driven reporters that are dependent upon the AR, increased the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and activated the AR N-terminal domain (NTD). Inhibitors to MAPK and JAK decreased the IL-6-induced phosphorylation of MAPK and activation of the AR NTD. Immunoprecipitation and transactivation studies showed a direct interaction between amino acids 234-558 of the AR NTD and STAT3 following IL-6 treatment of LNCaP cells. These results demonstrate that activation of the human AR NTD by IL-6 was mediated through MAPK and STAT3 signal transduction pathways in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.
