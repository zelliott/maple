The health of skeletal muscle is promoted by optimal nutrition and activity/exercise through the activation of molecular signaling pathways. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) have been shown to modulate numerous biochemical processes including glucose uptake, gene expression, calcium signaling, and contractility. In pathological conditions, ROS/RNS signaling excess or dysfunction contributes to contractile dysfunction and myopathy in skeletal muscle. Here we provide a brief review of ROS/RNS chemistry and discuss concepts of ROS/RNS signaling and its role in physiological and pathophysiological processes within striated muscle.
