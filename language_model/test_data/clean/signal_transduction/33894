Oestrogens have neuroprotective properties, resulting in memory and learning preservation. Red wine (RW) has been linked to neuroprotection, but mechanisms are largely unknown. The aim of this work was to test the effect of RW or 13% ethanol solution consumption on the expression of aromatase and estrogen receptors (ER) in the rat hippocampus. Beverages were supplied to male Wistar rats and after 8 weeks of treatment animals were euthanised, hippocampus was removed, aromatase expression assessed by western blotting and aromatase and ER transcription determined by RT-PCR. The effects of treatments on hippocampal aromatase activity were also determined, as well as the effect of several red wine polyphenols in hippocampal homogenates from untreated animals. Aromatase transcription was increased by ethanol (to 158+/-7%) but only significantly by RW (to 180+/-9%). No difference was found in ERalpha expression among groups, whereas RW significantly decreased ERbeta expression (to 63+/-10%). Resveratrol, quercetin, myricetin and kaempferol had no effect on aromatase activity and catechin (300 microM), epicatechin (200 microM), procyanidin extract (200 mg/L) and fractioned procyanidins (FI and FII; 200 mg/L) significantly decreased aromatase activity. The contribution of procyanidins in wine to the effect observed in aromatase was investigated in animals treated for the same period with these compounds (200 mg/L), although no effect was seen in aromatase activity, mRNA or protein levels, meaning that this group of compounds had little contribution, if any, to the effects observed. Nevertheless, the increase in aromatase expression induced by RW may corroborate the neuroprotective ability attributed to this beverage. Alterations in the relative abundance of ER expression may also play an important role in the protection.
