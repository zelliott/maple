The Hsp90 inhibition has been shown to induce apoptosis in various cancer cells. The licorice compounds may enhance the anti-cancer drug effect. However, effect of the licorice compounds on the Hsp90 inhibition-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells has not been studied. To assess the ability of 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid to promote apoptosis, we examined whether 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid potentiated the Hsp90 inhibitor-induced apoptosis in the human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3. Radicicol and geldanamycin induced a decrease in Bid, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin protein levels, an increase in Bax levels, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss, cytochrome c release, activation of caspases (-8, -9, and -3), cleavage of PARP-1, and an increase in the tumor suppressor p53 levels. 18β-Glycyrrhetinic acid enhanced Hsp90 inhibitor-induced apoptosis-related protein activation, nuclear damage, and cell death. The results suggest that 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid may potentiate the Hsp90 inhibition-induced apoptosis in ovarian carcinoma cell lines via the activation of the caspase-8- and Bid-dependent pathways and the mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway, leading to activation of caspases. Combination of Hsp90 inhibitors and 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid may confer a benefit in the treatment of epithelial ovarian adenocarcinoma.
