During aging, chondrocytes become unresponsive to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). This study examined the role of Cdc42 (cell-division-cycle 42) in IGF-I signaling during aging. Experiments were performed using cartilage and chondrocytes isolated from horses ages 1 day-25 years. Northern analysis was used to examine expression of the small GTPases Cdc42, Rac, and RhoA. Western analysis was utilized to assess total Cdc42 (GTP + GDP-bound); active, GTP-Cdc42 was assessed using a pulldown assay with Western analysis. GTP-Cdc42 was also measured following IGF-I treatment. Gene expression for Cdc42 and Rac were decreased in mature samples, but there was no difference in total Cdc42 (GTP + GDP-bound) protein expression due to age. GTP-Cdc42 was significantly greater in prepubescent samples compared to other age groups. IGF-I diminished the GTP-bound state of Cdc42 in prepubescent chondrocytes; however, this effect was lost during aging. No differences in results were observed due to sample type; that is, cartilage tissues versus isolated chondrocytes. These studies suggest that loss of IGF-I-mediated regulation of Cdc42 activation may be a mechanism for the chondrocyte unresponsive state during aging. Further, the activation state of Cdc42, measured in native and IGF-I-treated cartilage tissue for the first time, is similar to that of isolated chondrocytes, indicating that the activation state of small G-proteins is not affected by isolation of chondrocytes from the extracellular matrix. Continued studies will identify the upstream regulators of Cdc42, which will further elucidate the molecular mechanism of IGF-I resistance during aging thereby providing insight into targeted strategies for age-related osteoarthritis.
