The effects of activating the Gq protein-coupled cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor on different proteins/signaling molecules in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in pancreatic acinar cells were analyzed and compared with the effects of activating the tyrosine kinase-coupled epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Both EGF and CCK octapeptide rapidly increased the activity of the MAPKs [extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2], reaching a maximum within 2.5 min when 3.9- and 8.5-fold increases, respectively, were observed. The EGF-induced increase of MAPK activity was transient, with only a slight elevation after 30 min, whereas CCK-stimulated MAPK remained at a high level of activation to 60 min. The protein kinase C inhibitor GF-109203X abolished the activation by phorbol ester and inhibited the effect of CCK by 78% but had no effect on EGF-activated MAPK activity. EGF and CCK activated both forms of MAPK kinase (MEK), with CCK having a much larger effect, activating MEK1 by 6-fold and MEK2 by 10-fold, whereas EGF activated both MEKs by only 2-fold. Immunoblotting revealed three different forms of Raf in pancreatic acinar cells. Of the total basal Raf kinase activity, 3.7% was Raf-A, 89.0% was Raf-B, and 7.3% was c-Raf-1. All three forms of Raf were stimulated to a greater extent by CCK than by EGF, which was especially evident for Raf-A and c-Raf-1. The effect of CCK in activating Rafs was at least partially mimicked by stimulation with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. EGF significantly increased GTP-bound Ras by 183 and 164% at 2.5 and 10 min, respectively; CCK and TPA had no measurable effect. Our study suggests that CCK and EGF activate the MAPK cascade by distinct mechanisms in pancreatic acinar cells.
