In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding how Src family kinases regulate the formation and function of invadosomes. Invadosomes are organized actin-rich structures that contain an F-actin core surrounded by an adhesive ring and mediate invasive migration. Src kinases orchestrate, either directly or indirectly, each phase of the invadosome life cycle including invadosome assembly, maturation and matrix degradation and disassembly. Complex arrays of Src effector proteins are involved at different stages of invadosome maturation and their spatiotemporal activity must be tightly regulated to achieve effective invasive migration. In this review, we highlight some recent progress and the challenges of understanding how Src is regulated temporally and spatially to orchestrate the dynamics of invadosomes and mediate cell invasion.
