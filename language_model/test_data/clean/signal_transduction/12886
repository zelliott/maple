Angiogenesis is an essential step for many physiological and pathological processes. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily cytokines are increasingly recognized as key modulators of angiogenesis. In this study, we tested whether TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE), a new member of the TNF superfamily, possesses angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. TRANCE stimulated DNA synthesis, chemotactic motility, and capillary-like tube formation in primary cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Both Matrigel plug assay in mice and chick chorioallantoic membrane assay revealed that TRANCE potently induced neovascularization in vivo. TRANCE had no effect on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in HUVECs and TRANCE-induced angiogenic activity was not suppressed by VEGF-neutralizing antibody, implying that TRANCE-induced angiogenesis may be the result of its direct action on endothelial cells. TRANCE evoked a time- and dose-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 and focal adhesion kinase p125(FAK) in HUVECs, which are closely linked to angiogenesis. These signaling events were blocked by the Src inhibitor PP1 or the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor. Furthermore, these inhibitors and the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM suppressed TRANCE-induced HUVEC migration. These results indicate that the angiogenic activity of TRANCE is mediated through the Src-PLC-Ca(2+) signaling cascade upon receptor engagement in endothelial cells, suggesting the role of TRANCE in neovessel formation under physiological and pathological conditions.
