Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations, which have been implicated in endothelial transcytosis, endocytosis, potocytosis, and signal transduction. In addition to their well-defined morphology, caveolae are characterized by the presence of an integral membrane protein termed VIP21-caveolin. We have recently observed that lymphocytes have no detectable VIP21-caveolin and lack plasma membrane invaginations resembling caveolae. Here we transiently express VIP21-caveolin in a lymphocyte cell line using the Semliki Forest virus expression system and show de novo formation of plasma membrane invaginations containing VIP21-caveolin. These invaginations appear homogeneous in size and morphologically indistinguishable from caveolae of nonlymphoid cells. Moreover, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. Thy1, patched by antibodies, redistributes to the newly formed caveolae. Our results show that VIP21-caveolin is a key structural component required for caveolar biogenesis.
