Immunodeficiencies with nonfunctional T cells comprise a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by altered function of T lymphocytes in spite of largely preserved T cell development. Some of these forms are due to hypomorphic mutations in genes causing severe combined immunodeficiency. More recently, advances in human genome sequencing have facilitated the identification of novel genetic defects that do not affect T cell development, but alter T cell function and homeostasis. Along with increased susceptibility to infections, these conditions are characterized by autoimmunity and higher risk of malignancies. The study of these diseases, and of corresponding animal models, has provided fundamental insights on the mechanisms that govern immune homeostasis.
