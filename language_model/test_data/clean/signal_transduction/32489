The gamma chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor is an indispensable subunit for IL-2 binding and intracellular signal transduction. A monoclonal antibody to the gamma chain, TUGm2, inhibited IL-2 binding to the functional IL-2 receptors and also inhibited IL-4-induced cell growth and the high-affinity binding of IL-4 to the CTLL-2 mouse T cell line. Another monoclonal antibody, TUGm3, which reacted with the gamma chain cross-linked with IL-2, also immunoprecipitated the gamma chain when cross-linked with IL-4. These results suggest that the IL-2 receptor gamma chain is functionally involved in the IL-4 receptor complex.
