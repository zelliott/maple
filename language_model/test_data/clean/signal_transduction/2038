Erythrocytes are typically present as impurities in the majority of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) preparations. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of contaminating red blood cells (RBC) on the ability of OKT3 to activate CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Surprisingly, the levels of gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) produced by PBMC upon stimulation by OKT3 were increased (P < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner when increasing amounts of autologous RBC (RBC-to-PBMC ratios of 2:1, 10:1, and 50:1) were spiked into PBMC preparations. The OKT3-driven induction of the IL-2 receptor (CD25) and the proliferation of T lymphocytes in response to phorbol myristate acetate were not affected by the addition of RBC.
