The activity state of G proteins is involved in the ligands' maximal responses that can be produced by activating the 5-HT1A receptor (Pauwels et al., 1997). The present study investigated the ligand responses at the recombinant h 5-HT1A receptor (RC: 2.1.5HT.01A) as mediated by the Galpha(o) protein. Therefore, a fusion protein was constructed between the 5-HT1A receptor and a pertussis toxin resistant rat Galpha(o)Cys351Gly mutant protein to define its pharmacological properties at a receptor: Galpha(o) protein density ratio of 1. Pertussis toxin treatment (100 ng/ml) affected neither the expression of the 5-HT1A receptor fusion protein as measured by [3H] MPPF (3.0+/-0.7 pmol/mg protein) nor the 5-HT-mediated [35S]GTPgammaS binding response (146+/-34 fmol/mg protein) in Cos-7 cells. 8-OH-DPAT (Emax: 55+/-7%) and buspirone (Emax: 22+/-4%) yielded partial agonist activity as compared to 5-HT, whereas WAY 100635 acted as a competitive antagonist (pK(B): 9.75+/-0.17). The magnitude of the 8-OH-DPAT response (Emax, %) was highly dependent on the nature of the amino acid 351 in the C-terminus of the Galpha(o) protein: Ile351 (93+/-4) > Cys351 (79+/-3) > Gly351 (55+/-7). The Emax values (%) of buspirone displayed the following gradient: 69+/-5 approximately/= 62+/-8 > 22+/-4. For comparison, maximal responses of 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone were enhanced versus 5-HT upon co-expression of the 5-HT1A receptor with the respective Galpha(o) proteins, probably due to an altered receptor: Galpha(o) protein density ratio. In conclusion, residue 351 of the rat Galpha(o) protein is involved in determining the magnitude of 5-HT1A receptor activation that ligands can produce at these receptors. Moreover, the fusion protein approach allows quantitative comparisons of the intrinsic activities of ligands between one single receptor subtype with different Galpha protein subtypes.
