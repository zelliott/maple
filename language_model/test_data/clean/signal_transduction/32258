High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) has been implicated in a variety of biologically important processes, including transcription, DNA repair, differentiation, development, and extracellular signaling. However, the potential role of HMGB1 in tumor biology still remains intractable. Our previous study showed that TLR9 response to CpG oligonucleotide (ODN) in 95D human lung cancer cells could enhance their growth and invasive potential in vitro and in vivo. Here we found that CpG ODN stimulation to 95D cells induced the secretion of HMGB1 in a dose dependent manner. We further showed that blockade of extracellular HMGB1 using A box peptide and ethyl pyruvate significantly abrogated the CpG ODN enhanced progression of 95D cells. Interestingly, we found that HMGB1 alone or acted synergistic with CpG ODN could enhance the progression of 95D cells. Notably, we revealed that RAGE and TLR4 were critical for HMGB1 to exert the synergistic function. We observed a MyD88-dependent upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, MMP9 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 in 95D cells in response to HMGB1. These findings might further our understanding of TLR9 signaling in tumor biology and be helpful for developing HMGB1-based strategy against lung cancer.
