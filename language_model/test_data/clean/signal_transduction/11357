Intrathyroidal dendritic cells (DC) isolated at the same time and then cultured with thyrocytes in the presence of thyrotropin (TSH) keep a phenotype of immature DC (Croizet et al, 2000). As DC from other sources are known to undergo a rapid maturation in vitro, we hypothesized that the maintenance of thyroid-derived DC in an immature state might be caused by thyrocytes-DC interactions. In this study, we investigated whether thyroid-derived DC could change their phenotype in response to TSH stimulation of thyrocytes. Over an 8-day period of culture, the population of DC increased 2- to 3-fold in the presence of TSH and decreased by more than 75% in the absence of TSH. The increase in the DC population was related to DC proliferation, whereas the reduction of the number of DC was secondary to a loss of cell-substrate adhesion and subsequent cell death. In the presence of TSH, DC acquired and maintained a high capacity for internalizing labeled ligands, expressed the mannose receptor, and exposed MHC class II molecules at the cell surface. On the contrary, DC cultured without TSH were devoid of endocytic activity and mannose receptor and, after 2 days, no longer exposed MHC class II molecules at the cell surface. Using conditioned media and enriched DC populations, we show that thyrocytes, in response to TSH, produce soluble factors capable of activating proliferation and endocytic activity of DC. Exogenous granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor and transforming growth factor-beta, known to be produced by thyrocytes, reproduced the effects of conditioned media. These data, giving evidence of a hormone-regulated signaling process between epithelial and dendritic cells in vitro, suggest that thyrocytes could promote the maintenance of a population of immature DC within the thyroid gland.
