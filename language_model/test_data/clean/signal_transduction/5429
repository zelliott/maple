Neuregulin-1s are widely expressed signaling molecules that are involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, growth, survival, and apoptosis. They transmit their signals by interacting with cell membrane receptors of the ErbB family, resulting in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades, which participate in various physiological and etiological processes. Besides their essential function in the development of the heart and the physiology of cardiac pumping, there is emerging evidence for the involvement of neuregulin-1/ErbB signals in human disease, including heart failure. These reasons prompt the development of new therapeutic agents based on neuregulin-1.
