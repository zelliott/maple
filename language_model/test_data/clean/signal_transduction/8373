Thrombin upregulates expression of several proteins in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) which may contribute to atherosclerosis. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying thrombin-induced EGF receptor (EGFR) expression and its effect on VSMCs.

Normal rat VSMCs were used. First, Western blotting and RT-PCR analyses showed that thrombin induces the expression of EGFR at transcription and translation levels in VSMCs. Second, pharmacological inhibitors, dominant negative mutants, and short hairpin RNA interference (shRNA) technology enabled us to demonstrate that thrombin-induced EGFR expression is mediated through PKC(delta)/c-Src-dependent transactivation of EGFR linking to PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2. We further investigated whether the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB are involved in this response by a promoter assay. Finally, data obtained by using EGFR shRNA technology and XTT assay demonstrated that thrombin-enhanced VSMC proliferation was mediated through upregulation of EGFR.

Our results demonstrate that thrombin-enhanced VSMC proliferation was mediated through upregulation of EGFR via a PKC(delta)/c-Src-dependent transactivation of EGFR, PI3K-Akt, and ERK, and AP-1/NF-kappaB pathway.
