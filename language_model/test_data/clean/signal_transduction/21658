Myelin of the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) has been attributed to suppress structural plasticity and to impede regenerating nerve fibers. Nogo-A is possibly the best characterized of a variety of neurite growth inhibitors present in CNS myelin. Neutralizing its activity results in improved axon regrowth and functional recovery in experimental CNS lesion models of adult rodents and primates. While Nogo-A has become a major target for therapeutic intervention to promote axon regeneration in the CNS, it is realized that such an approach will likely have to be combined with other therapeutic strategies to maximize functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI).
