The analysis of polygenic diseases such as asthma poses a challenging problem. In an effort to provide unbiased insight into disease pathogenesis, we took an empirical approach involving transcript expression profiling of lung tissue from mice with experimental asthma. Asthmatic responses were found to involve sequential induction of 4.7% of the tested genome; notably, there was ectopic expression of a series of genes not previously implicated in allergic or pulmonary responses. Genes were widely distributed throughout all chromosomes, but preferentially included genes involved in immunity, development, and homeostasis. When asthma was induced by two independent experimental regimens, unique gene transcript profiles were found depending upon the mode of disease induction. However, the majority of genes were common to both models representing an asthma signature genome. Analysis of STAT6-deficient mice revealed that an unexpectedly large segment of the asthma genes were STAT6 independent; this correlated with sustained inflammatory events in these mice. Notably, induction of asthma in STAT6-deficient mice resulted in gene induction not seen in wild-type mice. These results raise concern that therapeutic blockade of STAT6 in the asthmatic setting may reprogram the genetic signature, resulting in alternative lung pathology, which we indeed observed in STAT6-deficient mice. These results provide unprecedented insight into the complex steps involved in the pathogenesis of allergic airway responses; as such, these results have significant therapeutic and clinical implications.
