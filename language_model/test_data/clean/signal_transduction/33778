Persephin (PSPN), a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family, and its implication in the retina is not well understood but might be an interesting therapeutic target for degenerative diseases. Although, PSPN is lost in the chicken during evolution, its target, the GDNF family receptor alpha 4 (GFRalpha4), is still expressed in a temporal and spatial pattern in the developing retina. We used this "knockout-precondition" to study the bioactivity and the effect of exogenous PSPN application and subsequent GFRalpha activation during retinal development in vitro without impairments of endogenous PSPN. Retinospheres, derived from dissociated chicken retina of embryonic day 6, were treated with PSPN and intracellular signalling was monitored. Additionally, PSPN was added during cultivation of the retinospheres and immunhistochemical stainings and Western blotting were performed to evaluate changes in proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Exogenous applied PSPN enhanced phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K) signalling and decreased signalling of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Most importantly early retinal proliferation was enhanced and glutamine synthetase expression was decreased whereas differentiation of major retinal cell types was not changed. In contrast to GDNF, PSPN is exclusively influencing early progenitors whereas differentiation is not effected and seems to be regulated through PSPN-independent mechanisms. Since the binding site of PSPN and therefore the target of potential therapeuticals, is well conserved among species and is with high probability not able to bind other members of the GDNF-family, these results might be assigned to other species including mammals and humans.
