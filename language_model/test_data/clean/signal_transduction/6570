Neurotransmitters convey specific messages by binding to receptors on the cell membrane surface. Receptors are linked to membrane-bound, signal-transducing proteins which act as intermediaries in the generation of second messengers that elicit biological responses. Cell surface receptors could be grouped into families that utilize common systems for their signal transmission. These classes include the growth factor receptors, the transporter receptors which internalize their ligands, ion channels, and G-protein-coupled receptors. In the past few years, the cDNAs and/or genes of a number of G-protein-coupled receptors have been cloned. Structural analysis of the G-protein-coupled receptors, as well as the other classes of receptor, shows that those receptors which use a common signaling pathway have similar topographies and share significant sequence homology. Adrenergic and dopamine receptors are examples of receptors coupled to G proteins. This review outlines some strategies in the study of adrenergic and dopamine receptors using molecular biology techniques and how they relate to investigations in developmental nephrology.
