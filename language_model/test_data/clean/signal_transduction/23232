The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) /RPS6KB1 activation has recently been implicated in tumour development, but its role in lung cancer remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the role of mTOR/RPS6KB1 signaling pathway in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the expression of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) and its downstream ribosomal phosphorylated RPS6KB1 (p-RPS6KB1) in NSCLC patients. We also analyzed p-mTOR/ p-RPS6KB1 protein expression in 45 fresh NSCLC tissues using Western blotting.

The expression level of p-mTOR and p-RPS6KB1 was significantly higher in NSCLC tumor specimens than that in adjacent noncancerous normal lung tissues (P<0.01). p-mTOR expression correlated with p-RPS6KB1. Furthermore, high expression level of p-mTOR or p-RPS6KB1 in NSCLC was associated with a shorter overall survival (both P<0.01). Multivariate analysis indicated high level of p-mTOR expression was an independent prognostic factor (HR=2.642, 95%CI 1.157-4.904, p=0.002).

p-mTOR and p-RPS6KB1 could be useful prognostic markers for NSCLC.
