Recent years have seen an increasing interest in research focused on the role that growth hormone (GH) may have in the central nervous system. The psychological improvements seen in adults following GH therapy combined with the observation that the hormone may affect the cerebrospinal fluid levels of several brain transmitters have received a great deal of attention. Studies have also revealed the presence of specific GH receptors in distinct areas of the brain of many mammals. This article will review our recent studies on the aging effects on GH binding in these regions. It also includes some data on the age-related effects on the expression of the GH-receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in certain brain areas.
