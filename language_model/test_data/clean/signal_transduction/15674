The morphological features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in man include emphysema and chronic bronchitis associated with mucus hypersecretion. These alterations can be induced in mice by a single intratracheal instillation of N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP), a chemoattractant and degranulating agent for neutrophils. The mechanisms underlying excessive mucus production and, in particular, goblet cell hyperplasia/metaplasia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remain poorly understood. The proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) are widely recognized for their modulatory properties during inflammation. In this study, we examined whether PAR-1 contributes to inflammation and lung damage induced by fMLP by comparing the response of PAR-1-deficient (PAR-1(-/-)) mice with that of wild-type (WT) mice. Mice were killed at various time points after fMLP instillation (200 microg/50 microl). WT mice developed emphysema and goblet cell metaplasia. The onset of pulmonary lesions was preceded by an increase in thrombin immunoreactivity in bronchial airways and alveolar tissue. This was followed by a decrease in PAR-1 immunoreactivity, and by an increase in IL-13 immunostaining on the luminal surface of airway epithelial cells. In PAR-1(-/-) mice, fMLP administration induced similar responses in terms of inflammation and emphysema, but these mice were protected from the development of goblet cell metaplasia. The involvement of PAR-1 in airway epithelial cell transdifferentiation was confirmed by demonstrating that intratracheal instillation of the selective PAR-1 agonist (TFLLR) induced goblet cell metaplasia in the airways of WT mice only. These data suggest that emphysema and goblet cell metaplasia occur independently, and that PAR-1 signaling through IL-13 stimulation may play an important role in inducing goblet cell metaplasia.
