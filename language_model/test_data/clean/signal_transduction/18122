The effect of nontoxic, low concentrations (10(-8) M) of retinoic acid (RA) for a relatively long time (28 days) on a Kirsten ras-virus transformed cell line (Ki-SVC1), derived from the rat seminal vesicle epithelium, was investigated. In these experimental conditions, the cell treatment with RA induced a decrease of the proliferation rate, apoptosis and a marked reduction of both anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity. These biological responses were either preceded or associated with important changes in adenylate cyclase/protein kinase C signaling pathways, the activation of important apoptosis-linked genes and a marked decrease of the v-Ki-ras p21 protein. The significance of these findings is discussed.
