Once thought of as toxic by-products of cellular metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in a large variety of cell-signaling processes. Several enzymatic systems contribute to ROS production in vascular endothelial cells, including NA(D)PH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The respiratory chain is the major source of ROS in most mammalian cells, but the role of mitochondria-derived ROS in vascular cell signaling has received little attention. A new paradigm has evolved in recent years postulating that, in addition to producing ATP, mitochondria also play a key role in cell signaling and regulate a variety of cellular functions. This review focuses on the emerging role of mitochondrial ROS as signaling molecules in vascular endothelial cells. Specifically, we discuss some recent findings that indicate that mitochondrial ROS regulate vascular endothelial function, focusing on major sites of ROS production in endothelial mitochondria, factors modulating mitochondrial ROS production, the physiological and clinical implications of endothelial mitochondrial ROS, and methodological considerations in the study of mitochondrial contribution to vascular ROS generation.
