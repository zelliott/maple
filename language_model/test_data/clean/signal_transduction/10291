Recent successes using Gleevec for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors have provided proof that strategies to target signal transduction pathways mutated in human cancers can work. However, the application of this strategy to other cancers has been slow. Central to alleviating this impedance is the molecular characterization of the tumors. There is an urgent need to translate basic scientific findings into relevant, clinically applicable molecular diagnostic assays.
