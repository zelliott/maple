In the present study, we isolated falcarindiol from Notopterygium incisum and investigated the effect of falcarindiol on the expression of antioxidant enzymes (AOEs), such as catalase, and phase 2 drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), such as glutathione S-transferase and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, in a cultured cell line from normal rat liver, Clone 9 cells. Exposure of Clone 9 cells to falcarindiol resulted in the significant induction of AOEs and phase 2 DMEs. Western blot analysis and transfection studies using a luciferase reporter construct demonstrated that the induction of AOEs and phase 2 DMEs by falcarindiol was caused through the Nrf2/ARE (nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element) pathway. Pretreatment of cells with falcarindiol accelerated the detoxification of a potentially toxic quinone (menadione) and mitigated menadione-induced cytotoxicity. We found that falcarindiol was a novel inducer of AOEs and phase 2 DMEs and falcarindiol might exhibit chemopreventive activity.
