Treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with cytochalasin D (10 microM, 1 h at 37 degrees C) disrupted the actin cytoskeleton and changed the cells from a planar, extended morphology, to a rounded shape. Calcium mobilization by ATP or by platelet-derived growth factor was abolished, while the ability of thapsigargin (2 microM) to empty calcium stores and activate calcium influx was unaffected. Similar experiments with nocodazole to depolymerize the tubulin network yielded identical results. Platelet-derived growth factor induced an increase in inositol phosphates, and this increase was undiminished in the presence of cytochalasin D. Therefore, the blockade of agonist responses by this drug does not result from decreased phospholipase C. Injection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) released calcium to the same extent in control and cytochalasin D-treated cells. Confocal microscopic studies revealed a significant rearrangement of the endoplasmic reticulum after cytochalasin D treatment. Thus, disruption of the cytoskeleton blocks agonist-elicited [Ca2+]i mobilization, but this effect does not result from a lower calcium storage capacity, impaired function of the IP3 receptor, or diminished phospholipase C activity. We suggest that cytoskeletal disruption alters the spatial relationship between phospholipase C and IP3 receptors, impairing phospholipase C-dependent calcium signaling. Capacitative calcium entry was not altered under these conditions, indicating that the coupling between depletion of intracellular calcium stores and calcium entry does not depend on a precise structural relationship between intracellular stores and plasma membrane calcium channels.
