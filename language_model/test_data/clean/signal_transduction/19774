Caveolin proteins physically interact with and compartmentalize membrane-localized signaling proteins to facilitate high-fidelity intracellular signaling. Though primarily studied outside the nervous system, recent investigations have revealed that caveolin proteins are key modulators of a variety of neuronal intracellular signaling pathways. Through both protein aggregation and segregation, caveolin proteins can exert positive and negative influences on intracellular signaling. This review will detail recent findings regarding caveolin function in the brain.
