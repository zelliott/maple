The objective of the present study was to identify the effect of osmolality, ions (K+, H+, Ca2+, Mg2+) and cAMP on the initiation of sperm motility in striped bass (Morone saxatilis). Striped bass spermatozoa remained motile in solutions isotonic to seminal plasma (350 mOsm/kg) until osmolality reached 600 mOsm/kg. K+ (0-100 mM) had no effect ( p>0.05 ) on sperm motility, and sperm displayed a high percentage of motility over a wide range of pH (6.0-8.5). Sperm motility could be initiated in Ca2+-free solutions. In contrast, sperm motility was inhibited (P<0.01) by solutions containing > or =10 mM Ca2+, and sperm could not be reactivated by a Ca2+-free solution. This Ca2+ inhibition was not affected by verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker. However, if sperm motility was first initiated in a Ca2+-free solution, the addition of Ca2+ solutions, up to 80 mM, failed to inhibit sperm motility, suggesting that Ca2+ inhibited the initiation of motility, but had no control of motile spermatozoa. Mg2+ solutions had similar inhibitory effects on sperm motility as Ca2+ solutions. Therefore, initiation of motility in striped bass sperm may be related to voltage-gated channels across the cell's plasma membrane. Membrane permeable cAMP did not initiate motility of quiescent, intact striped bass spermatozoa, and motility of demembranated sperm could be activated in the absence of cAMP.
