We report on two patients affected with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) with an unusual immunological phenotype and a substantial number of autologous, poorly functioning T cells. Distinct mutations identified at the IL2RG locus in the two patients impaired IL-2-mediated signaling but affected T-cell lymphopoiesis differently, resulting in generation of a polyclonal or oligoclonal T-cell repertoire. These observations add to the growing complexity of the immunological spectrum of SCID in humans and indicate the need for detailed immunological and molecular investigations in atypical cases.
