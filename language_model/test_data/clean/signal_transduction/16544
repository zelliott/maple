Signal transduction by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) underpins a multitude of physiological processes. Ligand recognition by the receptor leads to activation of a generic molecular switch involving heterotrimeric G-proteins and guanine nucleotides. Signal transduction has been studied extensively with both cell-based systems and assays comprising isolated signaling components. Interest and commercial investment in GPCRs in areas such as drug targets, orphan receptors, high throughput screening, biosensors, and so on will focus greater attention on assay development to allow for miniaturization, ultra-high throughput and, eventually, microarray/biochip assay formats. Although cell-based assays are adequate for many GPCRs, it is likely that these formats will limit the development of higher density GPCR assay platforms mandatory for other applications. Stable, robust, cell-free signaling assemblies comprising receptor and appropriate molecular switching components will form the basis of future GPCR assay platforms adaptable for such applications as microarrays. The authors review current cell-free GPCR assay technologies and molecular biological approaches for construction of novel, functional GPCR assays.
