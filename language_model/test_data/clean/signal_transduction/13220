The renin-angiotensin system is one of the major cardiovascular systems that controls blood volume, peripheral vascular tone, and blood pressure. Recent studies indicate important roles for angiotensin II in inflammation, atherosclerosis, and congestive heart failure as well. It is gradually becoming clear that angiotensin II exerts effects on the cardiovascular system through several unique mechanisms, including the availability of two different angiotensin II receptors, recruitment of protein tyrosine kinase activity, and receptor tyrosine kinase transactivation. This review discusses the diverse mechanisms of angiotensin II-mediated signal transduction pathways and the various effects of angiotensin II on the cardiovascular system.
