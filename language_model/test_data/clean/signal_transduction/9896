Essentially all organisms from bacteria to humans are mechanosensitive. Physical forces regulate a large array of physiological processes, and dysregulation of mechanical responses contributes to major human diseases. A survey of both specialized and widely expressed mechanosensitive systems suggests that physical forces provide a general means of altering protein conformation to generate signals. Specialized systems differ mainly in having acquired efficient mechanisms for transferring forces to the mechanotransducers.
