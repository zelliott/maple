In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the Wis1-Sty1 MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase signaling cascade is known to play a major role in cellular adaptation to adverse external stimuli, including osmotic stress, oxidative stress, nutrient deprivation, DNA-damaging agents, and heat stress. Nonetheless, it is not known whether or not this particular MAPK cascade is also involved in response to the most common stress, salinity. In this study, we provide evidence that the Wis1-Sty1 MAP cascade is implicated in salt stress response through regulating expression of a salinity-inducible gene. The downstream target gene thus identified is the cta3+ gene, which encodes a cation-transporting P-type ATPase. The salt stress-responsive nature of cta3+ expression was characterized extensively. It was found that not only the Sty1 MAP kinase but also the Atf1 transcription factor is crucial for the inducible expression of cta3+. As far as we know, this is the first instance that the stress-activated Wis1-Sty1 MAPK cascade plays a role in salt stress response in S. pombe.
