Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) is a 32 kDa matrix-associated Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitor consisting of a short amino-terminal region,three tandem Kunitz-type domains and a positively charged carboxy-terminal tail. Human TFPI-2, previously designated as placental protein 5, inhibits a broad spectrum of serine proteinases almost exclusively through its first Kunitz-type domain, and is thought to play an important role in the regulation of extracellular matrix digestion and remodeling. In this context, reduced synthesis of TFPI-2 has been related to numerous pathophysiological processes such as inflammation, angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, retinal degeneration and tumor growth/metastasis. In this review, we document current information regarding the expression of TFPI-2 by various tissues, its inhibitory activity and proteinase specificity in-vitro, and discuss possible physiological roles for this inhibitor based on in-vivo studies.
