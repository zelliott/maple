Multiple lines of evidence implicate steroid hormone and growth factor cross-talk as a modulator of endocrine response in breast cancer and that aberrations in growth factor signaling pathways are a common element in the endocrine resistant phenotype. Delineation of these relationships is thus an important diagnostic goal in cancer research, while the targeting of aberrant growth factor signaling holds the promise of improving therapeutic response rates.
