Plants, like other eukaryotes, rely on proteolysis to control the abundance of key regulatory proteins and enzymes. Strikingly, genome-wide studies have revealed that the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system (UPS) in particular is an exceedingly large and complex route for protein removal, occupying nearly 6% of the Arabidopsis thaliana proteome. But why is the UPS so pervasive in plants? Data accumulated over the past few years now show that it targets numerous intracellular regulators that have central roles in hormone signalling, the regulation of chromatin structure and transcription, tailoring morphogenesis, responses to environmental challenges, self recognition and battling pathogens.
