The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), like the insulin receptor (IR), plays a significant role in determining bioavailability of the critical signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO) and hence, modulates endothelial cell function, particularly in response to stimulation with insulin. In particular, the ability of the IGF-1R to form hybrid receptors with the IR appears to be highly significant in determining the sensitivity of the endothelial cell to insulin. This review will examine the structure of the IGF-1R and how this, with particular reference to the ability of the IGF-1R and the IR to form hybrid receptors, may have an effect both on endothelial cell function and the development of cardiovascular disease.
