Wnts are important for various developmental and oncogenic processes. Here we show that Wnt signaling functions at synapses in hippocampal neurons. Tetanic stimulations induce N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent synaptic Wnt3a release, nuclear beta-catenin accumulations, and the activation of Wnt target genes. Suppression of Wnt signaling impairs long term potentiation. Conversely, activation of Wnt signaling facilitates long term potentiation. These findings suggest that Wnt signaling plays a critical role in regulating synaptic plasticity.
