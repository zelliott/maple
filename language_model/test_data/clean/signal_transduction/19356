Pemphigus is a family of human autoimmune blistering diseases in which pathogenic autoantibodies induce blistering in skin and mucosa. The mechanisms by which pemphigus autoantibodies induce disease in the skin is under active investigation. A large number of cellular events induced in the target keratinocytes by pemphigus IgG have been described and suggest that pemphigus IgG binding to desmogleins trigger a complicated cascade of intracellular signaling and regulatory events. Targeting these intracellular events may prove useful therapeutically.
