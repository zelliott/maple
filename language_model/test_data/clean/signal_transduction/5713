G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are successfully exploited as drug targets. As our understanding of how distinct GPCR subtypes can be generated expands, so do possibilities for therapeutic intervention via these receptors. Receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) are excellent examples of proteins that enhance diversity in GPCR function. They facilitate the creation of binding pockets, controlling the pharmacology of some GPCRs. Moreover, they have the ability to regulate cell-surface trafficking, internalisation and signalling of GPCRs, creating novel opportunities for drug discovery. RAMPs could be directly targeted by drugs, or advantage could be taken of unique RAMP/GPCR interfaces for generating highly selective ligands.
