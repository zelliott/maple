Recent advances are revealing quantitative aspects of cytokinesis. Further, genetic analyses and cell imaging are providing insights into the molecular dynamics of cleavage furrow ingression as well as further refining our knowledge of the zones of the mitotic spindle that regulate the contractile properties of the overlying cortex. Ultimately, however, cortical mechanics are the result of signals that emanate from the mitotic spindle. A genuine quantitative understanding of cytokinesis must include a thorough analysis of the mechanical properties of the cortex and how signals modify these properties to dictate a well-controlled, error-free cytokinesis.
