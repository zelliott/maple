The cytokine receptor superfamily is characterized by structural motifs in the exoplasmic domain and by the absence of catalytic activity in the cytosolic segment. Activated by ligand-triggered multimerization, these receptors in turn activate a number of cytosolic signal transduction proteins, including protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, and affect an array of cellular functions that include proliferation and differentiation. Molecular study of these receptors is revealing the roles they play in the control of normal hematopoiesis and in the development of disease.
