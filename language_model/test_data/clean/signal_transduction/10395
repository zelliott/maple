Estrogen receptors (ERs) stimulate genomic effects by acting as nuclear transcription factors as well as non-genomic effects by activating distinct cytoplasmic protein kinase cascades. Non-genomic effects have been implicated in numerous cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and vasorelaxation. To exploit non-genomic effects mediated by ERalpha for novel hormone replacement regimens, we screened a focused library of steroid receptor ligands to identify compounds exhibiting properties different from estradiol, i.e. substances that selectively stimulate non-genomic signal transduction pathways while exhibiting low genomic activities. Treatment of breast cancer cells and osteosarcoma cells with estradiol, estren, substance A and substance B led to non-genomic activation of Akt (protein kinase B) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling cascades mediated by Src (Rous Sarcoma Virus, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) stimulation. Such compounds leading to prominent Akt/ERK activation but exhibiting only weak genomic properties were applied in vasorelaxation assays, modeling physiological non-genomic ER responses. As expected from PI3K and Src activation data, substances were as effective as estradiol in mediating vasorelaxation. We assume that these pathway-selective estrogen receptor ligands may serve as potent lead structures for novel hormone replacement strategies exhibiting lesser side effects than the existing treatment paradigms.
