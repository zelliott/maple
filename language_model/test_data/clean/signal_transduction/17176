Vascular injury that results in proliferation and dedifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is an important contributor to restenosis following percutaneous coronary interventions or plaque rupture. Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) has been shown to play a role in vascular repair processes; however, little is known regarding its function or the relative roles of the upstream proteases thrombin and matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) in triggering PAR1-mediated arterial restenosis. The goal of this study was to determine whether noncanonical MMP-1 signaling through PAR1 would contribute to aberrant vascular repair processes in models of arterial injury. A mouse carotid arterial wire injury model was used for studies of neointima hyperplasia and arterial stenosis. The mice were treated post-injury for 21 days with a small molecule inhibitor of MMP-1 or a direct thrombin inhibitor and compared with vehicle control. Intimal and medial hyperplasia was significantly inhibited by 2.8-fold after daily treatment with the small molecule MMP-1 inhibitor, an effect that was lost in PAR1-deficient mice. Conversely, chronic inhibition of thrombin showed no benefit in suppressing the development of arterial stenosis. Thrombin-PAR1 signaling resulted in a supercontractile, differentiated phenotype in SMCs. Noncanonical MMP-1-PAR1 signaling resulted in the opposite effect and led to a dedifferentiated phenotype via a different G protein pathway. MMP-1-PAR1 significantly stimulated hyperplasia and migration of SMCs, and resulted in down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. These studies provide a new mechanism for the development of vascular intimal hyperplasia and suggest a novel therapeutic strategy to suppress restenosis by targeting noncanonical MMP-1-PAR1 signaling in vascular SMCs.
