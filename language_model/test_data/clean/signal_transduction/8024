Physiologic roles of highly phosphorylated inositol phosphates, including those containing pyrophosphate groups, have been the focus of much recent interest. In the April 6, 2007 issue of Science, two papers (Lee et al., 2007; Mulugu et al., 2007) demonstrate the occurrence of a novel inositol pyrophosphate molecule in yeast and elucidate its role in phosphate homeostasis.
