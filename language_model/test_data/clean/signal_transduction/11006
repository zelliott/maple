Like viruses, intracellular bacteria stimulate their host cells to produce type I IFNs (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta). In our study, we investigated the signals and molecules relevant for the synthesis of and response to IFN by mouse macrophages infected with Listeria monocytogenes. We report that IFN-beta is the critical immediate-early IFN made during infection, because the synthesis of all other type I IFN, expression of a subset of infection-induced genes, and the biological response to type I IFN was lost upon IFN-beta deficiency. The induction of IFN-beta mRNA and the IFN-beta-dependent sensitization of macrophages to bacteria-induced death, in turn, was absolutely dependent upon the presence of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). IFN-beta synthesis and signal transduction occurred in macrophages deficient for TLR or their adaptors MyD88, TRIF, or TRAM. Expression of Nod2, a candidate receptor for intracellular bacteria, increased during infection, but the protein was not required for Listeria-induced signal transduction to the Ifn-beta gene. Based on our data, we propose that IRF3 is a convergence point for signals derived from structurally unrelated intracellular pathogens, and that L. monocytogenes stimulates a novel TLR- and Nod2-independent pathway to target IRF3 and the type I IFN genes.
