Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades are multifunctional signaling networks that influence cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and cellular responses to stress. Since the activation/propagation of MAPK signaling requires the sequential phosphorylation of many downstream proteins, the phosphatases that dephosphorylate MAPKs represent critical elements in the control of MAPK-signaling networks. Here we show that hypoxia induces a transient increase in the activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1), a MAPKKK that responds to oxidative stress by triggering cascades leading to the phosphorylation/activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38-MAPK. Hypoxia-induced ASK-1/MKK-4/JNK signaling is suppressed by serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 5 (PP5), which acts to turn off ASK-1/MKK-4/JNK signaling via two mechanisms. First, in a rapid response hypoxia facilitates the association of endogenous PP5 with ASK-1. PP5 binds to the C-terminal domain of ASK-1, and studies with siRNA targeting PP5 indicate that PP5 acts to suppress the phosphorylation of MKK4 (Thr-261), JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), and c-Jun (Ser-63) without affecting the activating phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182), p44/p42-MAPK/ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), or c-Jun protein levels. If hypoxia is prolonged, the expression of PP5 is increased due to the activation of a transcriptional activator, which was identified as hypoxia-inducible factor-1. Together, these studies indicate that PP5 plays an important role in the survival of cells in a low oxygen environment by suppressing a hypoxia-induced ASK-1/MKK4/JNK signaling cascade that promotes an apoptotic response.
