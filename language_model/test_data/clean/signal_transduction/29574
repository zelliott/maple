Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is an inherited disorder of humans, mice, horses, and dogs, in which affected individuals are incapable of generating antigen-specific immune responses. It occurs when lymphocyte precursors fail to differentiate into mature lymphocytes because of mutations within recombinase-activating genes 1 and 2 or within the genes encoding deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). It also occurs when differentiated lymphocytes are incapable of completing signal transduction pathways because of defects in cell surface receptors for interleukins (IL). A spontaneous mutation in DNA-PKcs of BALB/c mice results in SCID, as do experimentally induced mutations in RAG1 and RAG2. SCID in horses results from a spontaneous mutation in DNA-PKcs. Two molecular mechanisms account for SCID in dogs. Jack Russell Terriers have a mutation within the DNA-PKcs gene, whereas Cardigan Welsh Corgi and Basset Hound have different defects in the gene encoding the gamma chain that is common to the receptors for IL-2, -4, -7, -9, -15, and -21. The location of the mutation within target genes influences the spectrum of diseases observed in affected animals.
