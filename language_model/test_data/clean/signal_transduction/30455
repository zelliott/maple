Severe sepsis dominates the mortality of non-cardiac intensive care units. The ingenious Toll-like receptor (TLR) system can recognise many infectious organisms through relatively few receptors to trigger pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine release. Further complexity arises from positive and negative signalling feedback loops. Severe sepsis may be a consequence of an inappropriately excessive response or inadequate endogenous negative feedback. Therapies targeting these pathways are currently being evaluated. Alternatively, in clinical scenarios such as compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome, chronic viral sepsis or inadequate vaccine function, TLR signalling may be inadequate. TLR agonists may augment the innate response and are being investigated.
