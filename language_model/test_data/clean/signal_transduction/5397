The activation and expansion of na√Øve T cells require costimulatory signals provided by CD28 and TNF family members. In contrast, for many years it was believed that memory T cells do not require CD28 costimulation for expansion during secondary responses. This was based on in vitro experiments that suggested the re-activation of memory T cells is somewhat independent of costimulation. Recent in vivo evidence, however, has challenged this and shown that both CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells require CD28 costimulation for maximal expansion and pathogen clearance. This requirement has important implications for host immunity, vaccine development and immunotherapeutics.
