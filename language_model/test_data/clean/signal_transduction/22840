The formation and organization of skeletal tissue is strongly influenced by mechanical stimulation. There is increasing evidence that gravitational stress has an impact on the expression of early response genes in mammalian cells and may play a role in the formation of extracellular matrix. In particular, osteoblasts may be unique in their response to gravitational stimuli since in these cells microgravity has been reported to reduce collagen synthesis, while in fibroblasts the opposite effect was observed. Here, we have investigated the influence of hypergravity induced by centrifugation on the collagen synthesis of human osteoblast-like cells (hOB) and studied the possible involvement of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling cascade. Collagen synthesis was significantly increased by 42+/-16% under hypergravity at 13 x g, an effect paralleled by the enhanced expression of the collagen I alpha 2 (COL1A2) mRNA. No difference was seen in the proportion of collagen types I, III, and V synthesized by hOB. Hypergravity induced a markedly elevated phosphorylation of the p44/42 MAP kinases (ERK 1/2). The inhibition of this pathway suppressed the hypergravity-induced stimulation of both collagen synthesis as well as COL1A2 mRNA expression by about 50%. Our results show that the collagen synthesis of non-transformed hOB is stimulated under hypergravitational conditions. This response appears to be partially mediated by the MAP kinase pathway.
