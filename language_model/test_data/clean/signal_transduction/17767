The object of this theme is to offer new perspectives on the effect of aging on signal-transduction pathways associated with agonist-induced contraction of smooth muscle cells from the colon. Smooth muscle cells from old rats (32 mo old) exhibit limited cell length distribution and diminished contractility. The observed reduced contractile response may be due to the effect of aging on signal-transduction pathways, especially an inhibition of the tyrosine kinase-Src kinase pathway, a reduced activation of the PKC pathway, and a reduced association of contractile proteins [heat shock protein 27 (HSP27)-tropomyosin, HSP27-actin, actin-myosin]. Levels of HSP27 phosphorylation are also reduced compared with adult rats.
