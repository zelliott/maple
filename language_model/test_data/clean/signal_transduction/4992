Lymphocyte activation must be tightly regulated to ensure sufficient immunity to pathogens and prevent autoimmunity. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) serve critical roles in this regulation by controlling the functions of key receptors and intracellular signaling molecules in lymphocytes. In some cases, PTPs inhibit lymphocyte activation, whereas in others they promote it. Here we discuss recent progress in elucidating the roles and mechanisms of action of PTPs in lymphocyte activation. We also review the accumulating evidence that genetic alterations in PTPs are involved in human autoimmunity.
