Anticancer drug development using the platform of glutathione (GSH), glutathione S-transferases (GST) and pathways that maintain thiol homeostasis has recently produced a number of lead compounds. GSTpi is a prevalent protein in many solid tumors and is overexpressed in cancers resistant to drugs. It has proved to be a viable target for pro-drug activation with at least one candidate in late-stage clinical development. In addition, GSTpi possesses noncatalytic ligand-binding properties important in the direct regulation of kinase pathways. This has led to the development and testing of agents that bind to GSTpi and interfere with protein-protein interactions, with the phase II clinical testing of one such drug. Attachment of glutathione to acceptor cysteine residues (glutathionylation) is a posttranslational modification that can alter the structure and function of proteins. Two agents in preclinical development (PABA/NO, releasing nitric oxide on GST activation, and NOV-002, a pharmacologically stabilized pharmaceutical form of GSSG) can lead to glutathionylation of a number of cellular proteins. The biological significance of these modifications is linked with the mechanism of action of these drugs. In the short term, glutathione-based systems should continue to provide viable targets and a platform for the development of novel cancer drugs.
