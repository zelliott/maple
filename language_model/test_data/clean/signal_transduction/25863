The antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions of the antimicrobial peptide, tilapia hepcidin (TH)2-3, were previously studied. Herein, we report the differential modulation of protein kinase C (PKC)-associated proteins by TH2-3, and the PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), in RAW264.7 macrophages. Treatment with TH2-3 at 40 or 80μg/ml did not affect the cell morphology, but TH2-3 at 120μg/ml produced morphological changes similar to those after treatment with PMA in RAW264.7 cells. The coexistence of the PKC inhibitor, Ro-31-8220, prevented morphological changes induced by either PMA or 120μg/ml TH2-3 in RAW264.7 cells. Since PMA is known to induce expression of the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, activation of the TNF-α promoter in response to TH2-3 and PMA treatments in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells was compared. In LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, TNF-α promoter activity was significantly suppressed by TH2-3, but not by PMA. In addition, PMA activated prostaglandin synthase-associated cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 proteins on the cell surface, while the presence of TH2-3 inhibited its expression. Western blotting demonstrated that the expressions of PKC-μ, phosphorylated (p)-PKCμ at serine (S)-744, and p-PKCδ were activated by PMA, but were suppressed by TH2-3. In addition, p-PKC at S-916 was activated by TH2-3 and inhibited by PMA. In conclusion, the differential regulation of PKC isoforms by PMA and TH2-3 may influence morphological changes and regulation of TNF-α in RAW264.7 cells.
