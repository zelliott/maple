In epithelia, junction proteins are endocytosed for modulation of cell-cell adhesion and cell polarity. In response to growth factors, the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin is internalized from the cell surface with degradation or recycling as potential fates. However, the cellular machinery involved in cadherin internalization and recycling remains controversial. Here we investigated EGF-induced E-cadherin internalization. EGF stimulation of MCF-7 cells resulted in Rac1-modulated macropinocytosis of the E-cadherin-catenin complex into endosomal compartments that colocalized with EEA1 and the sorting nexin, SNX1. Depletion of cellular SNX1 levels by siRNA resulted in increased intracellular accumulation and turnover of E-cadherin internalized from the cell surface in response to EGF. Moreover, SNX1 was also required for efficient recycling of internalized E-cadherin and re-establishment of epithelial adhesion. Together, these findings demonstrate a role for SNX1 in retrieval of E-cadherin from a degradative endosomal pathway and in membrane trafficking pathways that regulate E-cadherin recycling.
