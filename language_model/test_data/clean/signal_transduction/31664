Antimycin A (AMA) inhibits mitochondrial electron transport chain between cytochrome b and c. In the present study, we investigated the effects of dehydrocostus lactone on osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells in the presence of AMA with a focus on redox changes and PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling. AMA increased nitrotyrosin level and decreased NADPH level, activities of thioredoxin reductase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt (protein kinase B [PKB]), and phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Pretreatment with dehydrocostus lactone prior to AMA exposure significantly prevented the loss of NADPH, production of nitrotyrosine, and thioredoxin reductase inactivation induced by AMA. Moreover, dehydrocostus lactone increased activities of PI3K and Akt, and CREB phosphorylation inhibited by AMA. These results suggest that antioxidant activity and PI3K/Akt/CREB activation are related to the protective effect of dehydrocostus lactone against osteoblast damage induced by AMA.
