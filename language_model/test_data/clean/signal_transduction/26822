The objective of the ONCODEATH consortium [EU Research Consortium "ONCODEATH" (2006-2010)] was to achieve sensitization of solid tumor cells to death receptor related therapies using rational mechanism-based drug combinations of targeted therapies. In this collaborative effort, during a period of 42 mo, cell and animal model systems of defined oncogenes were generated. Exploitation of generated knowledge and tools enabled the consortium to achieve the following research objectives: (1) elucidation of tumor components which confer sensitivity or resistance to TRAIL-induced cell death; (2) providing detailed knowledge on how small molecule Hsp90, Aurora, Choline kinase, BRAF inhibitors, DNA damaging agents, HDAC and DNMT inhibitors affect the intrinsic apoptotic amplification and execution machineries; (3) optimization of combined action of TRAIL with these therapeutics for optimum effects with minimum concentrations and toxicity in vivo. These findings provide mechanistic basis for a pharmacogenomic approach, which could be exploited further therapeutically, in order to reach novel personalized therapies for cancer patients.
