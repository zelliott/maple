The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway regulates diverse biologic functions including cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) constitute one branch of the MAPK pathway that has been implicated in the regulation of cardiac differentiated growth, although the downstream mechanisms whereby ERK signaling affects this process are not well characterized. Here we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with ERK2 bait and a cardiac cDNA library to identify novel proteins involved in regulating ERK signaling in cardiomyocytes. This screen identified the LIM-only factor FHL2 as an ERK interacting protein in both yeast and mammalian cells. In vivo, FHL2 and ERK2 colocalized in the cytoplasm at the level of the Z-line, and interestingly, FHL2 interacted more efficiently with the activated form of ERK2 than with the dephosphorylated form. ERK2 also interacted with FHL1 and FHL3 but not with the muscle LIM protein. Moreover, at least two LIM domains in FHL2 were required to mediate efficient interaction with ERK2. The interaction between ERK2 and FHL2 did not influence ERK1/2 activation, nor was FHL2 directly phosphorylated by ERK2. However, FHL2 inhibited the ability of activated ERK2 to reside within the nucleus, thus blocking ERK-dependent transcriptional responsiveness of ELK-1, GATA4, and the atrial natriuretic factor promoter. Finally, FHL2 partially antagonized the cardiac hypertrophic response induced by activated MEK-1, GATA4, and phenylephrine agonist stimulation. Collectively, these results suggest that FHL2 serves a repressor function in cardiomyocytes through its ability to inhibit ERK1/2 transcriptional coupling.
