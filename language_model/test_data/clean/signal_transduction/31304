Systems biology aims to study the properties of biological systems in terms of the properties of their molecular constituents. This occurs frequently by a process of mathematical modelling. The first step in this modelling process is to unravel the interaction structure of biological systems from experimental data. Previously, an algorithm for gene network inference from gene expression perturbation data was proposed. Here, the algorithm is extended by using regression with subset selection. The performance of the algorithm is extensively evaluated on a set of data produced with gene network models at different levels of simulated experimental noise. Regression with subset selection outperforms the previously stated matrix inverse approach in the presence of experimental noise. Furthermore, this regression approach enables us to deal with under-determination, that is, when not all genes are perturbed. The results on incomplete data sets show that the new method performs well at higher number of perturbations, even when noise levels are high. At lower number of perturbations, although still being able to recover the majority of the connections, less confidence can be placed in the recovered edges.
