The BlaR1 protein is a penicillin-sensory transducer involved in the induction of the Bacillus licheniformis beta-lactamase. The amino-terminal domain of the protein exhibits four transmembrane segments (TM1-TM4) that form a four-alpha-helix bundle embedded in the plasma bilayer. The carboxyl-terminal domain of 250 amino acids (BlaR-CTD) fused at the carboxyl end of TM4 possesses the amino acid sequence signature of penicillin-binding proteins. This membrane topology suggests that BlaR-CTD and the BlaR-amino-terminal domain are responsible for signal reception and signal transduction, respectively. With the use of phage display experiments, we highlight herein an interaction between BlaR-CTD and the extracellular, 63-amino acid L2 loop connecting TM2 and TM3. This interaction does not occur in the presence of penicillin. This result suggests that binding of the antibiotic to BlaR1 might entail the release of the interaction between L2 and BlaR-CTD, causing a motion of the alpha-helix bundle and transfer of the information to the cytoplasm of the cell. In addition, fluorescence spectroscopy, CD, and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy experiments indicate that in contrast to the behavior of the corresponding Staphylococcus aureus protein, the beta-lactam antibiotic does not induce a drastic conformational change in B. licheniformis BlaR-CTD.
