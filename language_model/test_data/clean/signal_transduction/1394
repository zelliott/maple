One of the hallmarks of the aging process is the accumulation of oxidized proteins. Therefore, the accumulation of oxidized proteins is one of the key factors in the aging process. Oxidized proteins are normally repaired or degraded by the proteasomal system. This system is the most important intracellular protein degradation machinery, responsible for the degradation of oxidized proteins. For unknown reasons the removal of oxidized proteins is disturbed in aged cells. This leads to the accumulation of non-functional proteins. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the changes in the proteasomal system and the interference with these changes.
