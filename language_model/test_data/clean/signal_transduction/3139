AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an important regulator of energy homeostasis, is known to be activated during T cell activation. T cell activation by T cell receptor (TCR) engagement or its pharmacological mimics, PMA plus ionomycin (PMA/Io), induces immunomodulatory FasL and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. In this study, we examined the role and mechanisms of AMPK in PMA/Io-induced expression of FasL and COX-2 in Jurkat T human leukemic cells. Inhibition of AMPK by a pharmacological agent, compound C, or AMPKα1 siRNA suppressed expression of FasL and COX-2 mRNAs and proteins in PMA/Io-activated Jurkat cells. It also reduced secretion of FasL protein and prostaglandin E2, a main product of COX-2, in Jurkat cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes activated with PMA/Io or monoclonal anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28. Consistently, inhibition of AMPK blocked promoter activities of FasL and COX-2 in activated Jurkat cells. As protein kinase C theta (PKCθ) is a central molecule for TCR signaling, we examined any possible cross-talk between AMPK and PKCθ in activated T cells. Of particular importance, we found that inhibition of AMPK blocked phosphorylation and activation of PKCθ, suggesting that AMPK is an upstream kinase of PKCθ. Moreover, we showed that AMPK was directly associated with PKCθ and phosphorylated Thr538 of PKCθ in PMA/Io-stimulated Jurkat cells. We also showed that inhibition of PKCθ by rottlerin or dominant negative PKCθ reduced AMPK-mediated transcriptional activation of NF-AT and AP-1 in activated Jurkat cells. Taken together, these results suggest that AMPK regulates expression of FasL and COX-2 via the PKCθ and NF-AT and AP-1 pathways in activated Jurkat cells.
