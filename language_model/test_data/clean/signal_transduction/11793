Single-cell clones, designated E11S, C11R, and A1S, were obtained from the HuT-78 T cell line persistently infected with an isolate of Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), SIV/Mne. The infected clones, unlike uncloned uninfected HuT-78 cells, no longer expressed the CD4 marker and, after their CD3 receptors were cross-linked, had dramatically reduced intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) responses. In one clone, E11S, the unresponsiveness was not limited to the inositol phospholipid pathway of signaling since a reduction in CD3-mediated activation of protein tyrosine kinase-dependent phosphorylation also was evident in this SIV-infected clone. These results led us to test whether T lymphocytes from animals infected with SIV had defective [Ca2+]i responses prior to detectable changes in CD4 levels or lymphadenopathy. The [Ca2+]i responses to both CD3 mAb and CD2 mAb were 10-50% less in T cells from Walter Reed stage 2 animals than in healthy controls. This anergy was more pronounced in chronically infected animals progressing to Walter Reed stage 3/4. The responses of these animals could not be augmented even when combinations of CD3 and CD4 mAb were used. Both CD4+CD44lo T cells, which are not infected with SIV, and the CD4+CD44hi T cell subset, previously shown to be the reservoir of SIV infection in blood, had pronounced defective responses to CD3 mAb. Similarly, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were consistently unresponsive in chronically infected animals, again implying that an indirect mechanism, rather than SIV infection per se, may be responsible for this immune dysfunction.
