G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are versatile molecular machines that regulate the majority of physiological responses to chemically diverse hormones and neurotransmitters. Recent breakthroughs in structural studies have advanced our understanding of GPCR signaling, particularly the selectivity of ligand recognition and receptor activation of G proteins.
