The effect of prolactin action on nuclear polyphosphoinositide synthesis was investigated in isolated rat liver nuclei. An increased uptake of phosphate from [gamma 32P] adenosinetriphosphate was observed in both phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate with a maximum response at 10(-12) M concentration of hormone. Pulse-chase experiments in isolated nuclei following prolactin treatment indicate that the observed increase in accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is mainly due to a decrease in their rate of turnover possibly induced by a change in activity of polyphosphoinositide-specific monoesterases. In vitro prolactin also reduces the activity of nuclear phospholipase C specific for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Moreover, this feature is strongly supported by the concomitant decrease in nuclear diacylglycerol mass. Thus these data suggest that once prolactin reaches the nucleus an intranuclear signalling is evoked through inositol lipid metabolism.
