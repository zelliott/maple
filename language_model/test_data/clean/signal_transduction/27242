Infectious microorganisms can differently induce or inhibit apoptosis of immunocompetent effector and host cells. In this study we examined the influence of an infection by Candida albicans (C. albicans) on programmed cell death of monocytic U937 cells and human monocytes. Basal and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced DNA fragmentation of U937 cells was significantly inhibited by an infection with C. albicans. Enhanced apoptosis of U937 cells, induced by TNF-alpha, caused a diminished candidacidal activity of the effector cells, whereas inhibition of apoptosis by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was paralleled by an intensified host defense. Pretreatment of U937 cells or monocytes with the cyclooxygenase blocker indomethacin completely abolished the reduction of DNA fragmentation induced by the yeast. Studying the underlying mechanisms we found that C. albicans induced formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by U937. Exogenous administration of PGE2 down-regulated apoptosis of U937 or human monocytes to a similar extent as did fungal infection. Activation of protein kinase A by the cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cAMP inhibited U937 apoptosis, as did PGE2. On the other hand, rp-cAMP, a blocker of the cAMP-dependent signal transduction, restored and elevated DNA fragmentation levels down-regulated by C. albicans. U937 cells expressed the bcl-2 protein but the infection with fungi or PGE2 treatment did not increase proto-oncogene expression. Monocytic effector cells may therefore strengthen the defense against C. albicans by an autocrine feedback regulation via a PGE2-dependent, cAMP-transduced inhibition of apoptosis.
