HIMOXOL (methyl 3-hydroxyimino-11-oxoolean-12-en-28-oate) is a synthetic derivative of oleanolic acid (OA). HIMOXOL revealed the highest cytotoxic effect among tested synthetic OA analogs. In this study we focused on elucidating the cytotoxic mechanism of HIMOXOL in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. HIMOXOL reduced MDA-MB-231 cell viability with an IC50 value of 21.08±0.24μM. In contrast to OA, the tested compound induced cell death by activating apoptosis and the autophagy pathways. More specifically, we found that HIMOXOL was able to activate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, which was proven by observation of caspase-8, caspase-3 and PARP-1 protein activation in Western blot analysis. An increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein levels was also detected. Moreover, HIMOXOL triggered microtubule-associated protein LC3-II expression and upregulated beclin 1. This observed compound activity was modulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases and NFκB/p53 signaling pathways. Together, these data suggest that HIMOXOL, a synthetic oleanolic acid derivative which activates dual cell death machineries, could be a potential and novel chemotherapeutic agent.
