Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a single-transmembrane protein, which is involved in numerous cellular processes including cell adhesion, proliferation, maintenance of stemness of embryonic cells and progenitors, migration and invasion. Activation of signal transduction by EpCAM is warranted by regulated intramembrane proteolysis and nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain EpICD. Here, we describe matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) as a target gene of EpCAM signalling viaEpICD nuclear translocation. EpCAM and MMP7 expression pattern and levels positively correlated in vitro and in vivo, and were strongly elevated in primary carcinomas of the head and neck area. Hence, MMP7 is a novel target of EpCAM signalling.
