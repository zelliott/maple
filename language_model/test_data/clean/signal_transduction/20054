Dopamine (DA) signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a critical role in the processing of emotional information and memory encoding. Activation of DA D4 receptors within the prelimbic (PLC) division of the mPFC bidirectionally modulates emotional memory by strongly potentiating the salience of normally nonsalient emotional memories but blocking the acquisition of suprathreshold emotionally salient fear memories. Previous in vitro studies have shown that activation of cortical DA D4 receptors can bidirectionally modulate levels of α-calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase II (α-CaMKII), a molecule essential for learning and memory. Using an olfactory fear conditioning procedure in rats combined with microinfusions into the mPFC, we examined the potential role of D4 receptor-mediated control of emotional memory salience through signaling via CaMKII, cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA), and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) signaling. We report that CaMKII blockade prevents the ability of intra-mPFC DA D4 receptor activation to potentiate the salience of subthreshold fear memory. In contrast, blockade of either cAMP/PKA or PP1 signaling pathways rescued the blockade of suprathreshold fear memory via intra-mPFC D4 receptor activation. Our results demonstrate that modulation of emotional memory salience via intra-mPFC DA D4 receptor transmission depends upon downstream signaling via CaMKII, cAMP/PKA, and PP1 substrates.
