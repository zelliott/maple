Notch molecules are well conserved from Drosophila melanogaster to mammals and regulate a broad spectrum of various cell lineage commitment processes. Recent studies using inhibitors, transgenic mice and conditional loss-of-function approaches have demonstrated essential roles for Notch signaling in the differentiation of thymocytes and peripheral T cells, as well as B cells. Here we highlight parallels in the developmental regulation of mammalian lymphocytes and the D. melanogaster nervous system through Notch cooperation with the transcriptional regulators RBP-J (Su(H)), MINT (Hairless) and E2A (Ac-Sc-Da).
