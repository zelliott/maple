The gp120 envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) interacts with the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, but it is not known whether gp120 activates CXCR4-mediated signaling cascades in the same manner as its natural ligand, SDF1alpha. We assessed the effects of wild-type gp120 and a mutant gp120 that interacts with CXCR4 but not CD4 on CD4(-)/CXCR4(+) cells and CD4(+)/CXCR4(+) cells, respectively. Under both experimental conditions, the interaction of CXCR4 and gp120 resulted in their CD4-independent cointernalization. Both molecules were translocated into early endosomes, whereas neither protein could be detected in late endosomes. Binding of gp120 to CXCR4 resulted in a CD4-independent phosphorylation of Pyk2 and an induction of chemotactic activity, demonstrating that this interaction has functional consequences. Interestingly, however, whereas SDF1alpha activated the ERK/MAP kinase pathway, this cascade was not induced by gp120. Together, these results suggest that the pathology of HIV-1 infection may be modulated by the distinct signal transduction pathway mediated by gp120 upon its interaction with CXCR4.
