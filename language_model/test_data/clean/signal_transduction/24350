Anandamide is a neuroimmunoregulatory molecule that triggers apoptosis in a number of cell types including PC12 cells. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying anandamide-induced cell death in PC12 cells. Anandamide treatment resulted in the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p44/42 MAPK in apoptosing cells. A selective p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or dn-JNK, JNK1(A-F) or SAPKbeta(K-R), blocked anandamide-induced cell death, whereas a specific inhibitor of MEK-1/2, U0126, had no effect, indicating that activation of p38 MAPK and JNK is critical in anandamide-induced cell death. An important role for apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in this event was also demonstrated by the inhibition of p38 MAPK/JNK activation and death in cells overexpressing dn-ASK1, ASK1 (K709M). Conversely, the constitutively active ASK1, ASK1DeltaN, caused prolonged p38 MAPK/JNK activation and increased cell death. These indicate that ASK1 mediates anandamide-induced cell death via p38 MAPK and JNK activation. Here, we also found that activation of p38 MAPK/JNK is accompanied by cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and caspase activation (which can be inhibited by SB203580), suggesting that anandamide triggers a mitochondrial dependent apoptotic pathway. The caspase inhibitor, zVAD, and the mitochondrial pore opening inhibitor, cyclosporine A, blocked anandamide-induced cell death but not p38 MAPK/JNK activation, suggesting that activation of these kinases may occur upstream of mitochondrial associated events.
