The cytoplasmic C terminus of the beta2-adrenergic receptor and many other G protein-coupled receptors contains a dileucine sequence that has been implicated in endosome/lysosome targeting of diverse proteins. In the present study, we provide evidence for an essential role of this motif in the agonist-induced internalization of the beta2-adrenergic receptor. Mutation of Leu-339 and/or Leu-340 to Ala caused little changes in surface expression, ligand binding, G protein coupling, and signaling to adenylyl cyclase, when these receptors were transiently or stably expressed in CHO or HEK-293 cells. However, agonist-induced receptor internalization was markedly impaired in the L339,340A double mutant and reduced in the two single mutants. This impairment in receptor internalization was seen by using various approaches to determine internalization: binding of hydrophobic vs. hydrophilic ligands, loss of surface beta2-adrenergic receptor immunoreactivity, and immunofluorescence microscopy. The selective effects of these mutations suggest that the C-terminal dileucine motif is involved in agonist-induced internalization of the beta2-adrenergic receptor.
