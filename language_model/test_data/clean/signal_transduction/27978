G(16) can couple indiscriminately to a large number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), making it a prime candidate as a universal adaptor for GPCRs. In order to increase the promiscuity of Galpha(16), three chimeras incorporating increasing lengths of G(s)-specific residues (25, 44 or 81 residues) into the C-terminus of Galpha(16) were constructed and named 16s25, 16s44 and 16s81, respectively. The chimeras were examined for their ability to mediate receptor-induced stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC) and Ca(2+) mobilization. 16s25 was more effective than 16s44 and 16s81 at coupling to G(s)-linked receptors. 16s25 coupled productively to 10 different G(s)-coupled receptors examined and, for 50% of these receptors, 16s25-mediated PLC activities were higher than those mediated via Galpha(16). Similar results were observed for agonist-induced Ca(2+) mobilizations. These results show that incorporating the alpha5 helix of Galpha(s) into Galpha(16) can increase the promiscuity of 16s25 towards G(s)-coupled receptors.
