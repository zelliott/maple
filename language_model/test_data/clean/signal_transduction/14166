Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women worldwide. Various therapeutic approaches have been proposed, among which endocrine therapy has recently become popular due to the high sensitivity of breast tissues to steroids such as estrogens and progesterone. The underlying mechanisms of steroid regulation in breast cancer cell proliferation, invasiveness, metastasis and endocrine resistance, however, remain largely unknown. Steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) has attracted much attention because it is an important co-regulator and plays a pivotal role in modulating the transcriptional activities of steroid nuclear receptors. Accumulated research has established a strong correlation between SRC-1 and the pathological progression or disease-related features of breast cancer, which supports its potential as a target for specific therapeutic intervention in the clinical management of breast cancer. In addition, a diverse group of downstream molecules have also been shown to participate in various functional pathways related to SRC-1-associated regulation of breast cancer. These downstream molecules are also considered promising therapeutic targets, providing additional options for targeted treatments. In this review, the expression of SRC-1 in breast cancer and the close relationships between SRC-1 and the cell proliferation, invasiveness, metastasis and endocrine resistance of breast cancer will be discussed, followed by a brief summary of its putative functional mechanisms with an emphasis on the potential therapeutic role of SRC-1.
