The role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate as a second messenger in signal transduction has been well established in many cell types. However, conflicting reports have led to a controversy regarding the role, if any, of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate signalling in skeletal muscle. Indeed, expression of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor has not previously been demonstrated in skeletal muscle. In the present study we used in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and [3H]-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding to demonstrate that rat skeletal muscle fibres contain inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. RNAse protection and partial sequencing suggested that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors expressed in skeletal muscle was most similar to the non-neuronal form of the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. While in situ hybridization showed inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor mRNA in all types of skeletal myofibres, immunodetectable inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor protein and specific [3H]-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding sites were preferentially expressed in slow oxidative (type I) and fast oxidative-glycolytic (type IIA) fibres, but not in fast glycolytic (type IIB) fibres. These findings indicate that an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor is preferentially expressed in oxidative fibres of skeletal muscle.
