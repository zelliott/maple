In atopic dermatitis (AD) patients, IgE molecules are demonstrated on the surface of Langerhans cells (LC). Fc epsilon RI molecules, which are present on the surface of LC in AD patients as well as normal individuals, are responsible for this binding. In this study, we have investigated phenotypic and functional characteristics of Fc epsilon RI on epidermal and dermal cell populations. Epidermal and dermal cell suspensions were prepared enzymatically with dispase followed by either trypsin or collagenase treatment, respectively. Peripheral blood basophils were negatively selected by excluding other leukocytes with surface marker staining. Consistent with previous reports, both peripheral blood basophils and epidermal LC were positively stained with anti Fc epsilon RI monoclonal antibody. In addition, an Fc epsilon RI positive population was demonstrated among dermal HLA-DR positive cells. These cells express significant amounts of HLA-DR molecules (DRHi) and co-express CD 1 a molecules, which identifies them as LC-like dendritic APC of the dermis. No other Fc epsilon RI positive population was found in the other dermal DRMid or DR- populations, except for a minor DRLo population, presumably mast cells. To analyze whether these Fc epsilon RI molecules are signal transducing for LC, intracellular calcium mobilization after crosslinking of Fc epsilon RI was measured with flow cytometry. Following crosslinking, peripheral blood basophils clearly increased intracellular calcium. On the other hand, neither normal epidermal LC nor dermal DRHiCD1a + cells changed their intracellular calcium level after Fc epsilon RI crosslinking. These data indicate that normal epidermal and dermal LC, but not basophils, are resistant to calcium flux following Fc epsilon RI engagement.
