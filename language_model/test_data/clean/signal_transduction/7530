Considered for years as a 'renal hormone' leading to the control of renal excretion of minerals (explaining the term 'mineralocorticoid' used to describe this hormone), aldosterone is now recognized as a key factor in several diseases including hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmia, metabolic and kidney diseases, to cite only a few of them.

In this review article, the authors aim to cover information provided by patents of the years 2007 through 2012. The rationale of writing this article is to cover the most important patents that can progress the field with new important discoveries.

The recognition of its proinflammatory and fibrogenic effects and the discovery of extrarenal sites of expression of its receptor (the mineralocorticoid receptor or MR) support a broader implication in diseases of MR activation than previously anticipated and the possible novel therapeutic indications of MR antagonists.
