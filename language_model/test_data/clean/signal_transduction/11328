Absence of CD4 impairs the efficiency of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling in response to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-presented peptides. Here we use mice carrying a conditional Cd4 allele to study the consequences of impaired TCR signaling after the completion of thymocyte development. We show that loss of CD4 decreases the steady-state proliferation of T cells as monitored by in vivo labeling with bromo-deoxyuridine. Moreover, T cells lacking CD4 compete poorly with CD4-expressing T cells during proliferative expansion after transfer into lymphopenic recipients. The data suggest that T cells compete with one another during homeostatic proliferation, and indicate that the basis of this competition is TCR signaling.
