The balance between Th1 and Th2 response determines the outcome of Helicobacter pylori infection. Interferon (IFN)-gamma plays an inductive role in gastric inflammation, whereas interleukin (IL)-4 counterbalances Th1 response and suppresses the development of gastritis. Th cell response is regulated by co-stimulatory factors. A co-stimulatory molecule, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), plays an inhibitory role in IL-2-dependent cell growth and mediates an optimal inhibitory signal to Th1 and Th2 cells. We administered anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), which blocks CTLA-4 signalling, to examine the relative role for this signalling during maturation of Th1 and Th2 cells in H. pylori infection in mice. Mice treated by anti-CTLA-4 MoAb within the first week of infection showed an inhibition of gastric inflammation, accompanied by an increasing ratio of H. pylori-specific IgG1/IgG2a in serum following infection. Furthermore, the treatment resulted in the higher ratio of IL-4/IFN-gamma by splenocytes in response to H. pylori antigen at 6 weeks after infection, compared with untreated mice. These results suggest that the predominance of Th2 response by CTLA-4 blockade leads to an inhibition of the development of gastric inflammation. CTLA-4 signalling could contribute to the regulation of Th subsets and the development of gastric inflammation in H. pylori infection.
