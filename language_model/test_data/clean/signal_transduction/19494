Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is an inflammatory chemokine that promotes atherosclerosis and is a mediator of the response to arterial injury. We previously demonstrated that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and angiotensin II (Ang) induce the accumulation of MCP-1 mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells mainly by increasing mRNA stability. In the present study, we have examined the signaling pathways involved in this stabilization of MCP-1 mRNA. The effect of PDGF (BB isoform) and Ang on MCP-1 mRNA stability was mediated by the PDGF β and angiotensin II receptor AT1R, respectively, and did not involve transactivation between the two receptors. The effect of PDGF-BB was blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), but not by inhibitors of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Src, or NADPH oxidase (NADPHox). In contrast, the effect of Ang was blocked by inhibitors of Src, and PKC, but not by inhibitors of PI3 K, or NADPHox. The effect of PDGF BB on MCP-1 mRNA stability was blocked by siRNA directed against PKCδ and protein kinase D (PKD), whereas the effect of Ang was blocked only by siRNA directed against PKCδ. These results suggest that the enhancement of MCP-1 mRNA stability by PDGF-BB and Ang are mediated by distinct "proximal" signaling pathways that converge on activation of PKCδ. This study identifies a novel role for PKCδ in mediating mRNA stability in smooth muscle cells.
