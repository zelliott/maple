Stimulation of human platelets with concanavalin A resulted in a significant increase in the concentration of cytoplasmic free Ca2+. This effect was due to two different processes: Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores and Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium. Kinetic analysis revealed that the release of Ca2+ from internal storage sites occurred sooner than the opening of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. The ability of concanavalin A to induce a sustained increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration was antagonized and reversed by methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside, demonstrating that it was promoted by the interaction of the lectin with cell surface glycoproteins. Succinyl-concanavalin A, a dimeric derivative of the lectin, that does not promote patching/capping of the receptor, was able to bind to the platelet surface, and antagonized the effects of native concanavalin A. In addition, succinyl-concanavalin A, per se, was unable to induce Ca2+ mobilization in human platelets. Therefore, the action of the native concanavalin A was mediated by receptor clustering events. Concanavalin A mobilized Ca2+ from the same internal stores from which Ca2+ was mobilized in response to strong platelet agonists, such as thrombin and arachidonic acid. However, while thrombin was ineffective in inducing Ca2+ release after stimulation of platelets with ConA, ConA was able to cause a full discharge of Ca2+ from internal stores even in platelets previously stimulated with thrombin. These results demonstrate for the first time that the clustering of specific membrane glycoproteins can trigger platelet activation. The physiological implications during platelet aggregation are discussed.
