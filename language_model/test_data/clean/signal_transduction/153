To analysis the activity of transcriptional factors in endometrial cancer cell lines with different estrogen receptor subtypes.

The mRNA levels of estrogen receptor (ER) was detected by quantitative RT-PCR, and the activity of transcriptional factors was also analysed by 345-channel protein/DNA array in RL-952 (the expression status of ERalpha and ERbeta both positive), HEC-1A [ERalpha (+/-), while ERbeta negative] and HEC-1B (ERalpha and ERbeta both negative). The transcription factors of NFkappaBp65 and p38MAPK with different activity were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to confirm the results of protein/DNA array.

The mRNA levels of ERalpha in RL-952, HEC-1A and HEC-1B were (6780+/-282), (684+/-84) and (168+/-38) copy/ng, respectively. Among 345 candidate transcriptional factors, there were 28 factors associated with ER status. Compared with RL-952 cells, 13 transcriptional activity factors were concomitantly up-regulation, while 15 concomitantly down-regulation in HEC-1A and HEC-1B cells. Transcriptional activities of TTF (1)-1, NRF-1, TCE were significantly correlated with the high-expression status of ERalpha mRNA (r=0.523, P=0.037), while RFX123 and Ikaros were significantly correlated with the low-expression status of ERalpha mRNA (r=-0.312, P=0.041).

Transcriptional factors of TTF (1)-1, NRF-1, TCE may be associated with ER-mediated signal pathway, while RFX123 and Ikaros may be associated with non ER-mediated signal pathway in endometrial cancer.
