The ectoderm of the sea urchin embryo has been a useful system for understanding how regions of a simple epithelium are specified during early development, as well as how pattern formation leads to the correct localization of mesenchyme cells during morphogenesis. This study examines cell-cell signals that regulate precise patterning of ectoderm within the oral region of embryos of the sea urchin, Lytechinus variegatus. The oral ectoderm contains at least two types of patterned tissues: (1) the ectoderm that forms the stomodeum and (2) ectoderm expressing pattern information required for formation of parallel oral skeletal rods by primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs). Using microsurgical isolations and cell transplantation, we show (1) that cell-cell signaling is capable of producing new oral ectodermal structures until immediately prior to the gastrula stage, (2) that the presumptive oral ectoderm is not committed to produce oral structures until the early gastrula stage, (3) that oral ectodermal patterning cues for PMCs are highly local in character, and (4) that interactions between the tip of the archenteron and the presumptive oral ectoderm are not required for the differentiation of cells within either tissue. These studies suggest that short-range cell-cell signals within the ectoderm are involved in specifying regionalized oral ectodermal tissues immediately prior to gastrulation, and that this patterned ectoderm then influences the localization of skeletogenic mesenchyme cells in the oral region.
