Gliobastoma multiform (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain tumor, which is characterized by its infiltrative nature. Current standard therapy for GBMs consists of surgery followed by radiotherapy combined with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that this chemo-irradiation approach results in a significant increase in survival compared to radiotherapy alone. Nevertheless, due to tumor recurrence, the median survival time is still limited to approximately 15 months. Recently, several studies have focused on aberrant signal transduction in GBM, resistance mechanisms of GBM to TMZ and to radiotherapy. Attention has been focused on molecular targets including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, protein kinase C (pKC) pathway, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK), Wnt pathway and intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis pathways. In addition, research has been directed to radiotherapy and radiosensitizing agents, and cancer gene therapy as well. This article will address several resistance mechanisms of GBM to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and the recent preclinical and clinical studies on targeted therapy.
