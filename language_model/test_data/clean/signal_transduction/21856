Netrin-1 is critical for axonal pathfinding which shares similarities with formation of vascular network. Here we report that netrin-1 induction of angiogenesis is mediated by an increase in endothelial nitric oxide (NO*) production, which occurs via a DCC-dependent, ERK1/2-eNOS feed-forward mechanism. Exposure of mature aortic endothelial cells to netrin-1 resulted in a potent, dose-dependent increase in NO* production, detected by electron spin resonance. Scavenging NO* with 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) abolished netrin-1 stimulated angiogenesis. Netrin-1-stimulated NO* production or angiogenesis was inhibited by DCC antibody, DCC small interfering RNA (siRNA), specific inhibitors (PD98059, U0126), or siRNAs for MEK1/2. PTIO attenuated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating a feed-forward mechanism. Netrin-1 induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS(s1179, s116) and a rapid dephosphorylation of eNOS(t497). Only eNOS(s1179) was sensitive to U0126 or PTIO. These data characterized a mechanism whereby netrin-1 promotes angiogenesis, which may broadly relate to cardiovascular, neuronal and cancer physiology.
