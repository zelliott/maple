The evolution of aerobic metabolism such as respiration and photosynthesis resulted in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A common property of all ROS types is that they can cause oxidative damage to proteins, DNA, and lipids. This toxicity of ROS explains the evolution of complex arrays of nonenzymatic and enzymatic detoxification mechanisms in plants. However, increasing evidence indicates that plants also make use of ROS as signaling molecules for regulating development and various physiological responses. In this review, novel insights into the mechanisms of how plants sense and respond to ROS are discussed in the context of the biological effects and functions of ROS in plants.
