Gh protein is an heterodimer made up of two subunits alpha and beta. Different from the traditional monomeric and heterotrimeric G proteins, Ghalpha subunit exhibits both GTPase and transglutaminase activities whereas Ghbeta was identified as calreticulin. Activation of Gh by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) turns off transglutaminase activity and shifts Ghalpha to signal transducer. Thereafter, Ghalpha regulates downstream effectors. All these aspects are discussed in the present review, in order to shed new light on this atypical G protein.
