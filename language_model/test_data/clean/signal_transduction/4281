The potencies and intrinsic activities on cyclic AMP accumulation and lipolysis of various selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists were studied in brown adipocytes and compared to those of the nonselective, (-)-isoprenaline, and conventional beta 1- (dobutamine) and beta 2-adrenoceptor (salbutamol) agonists. (-)-Isoprenaline, dobutamine and salbutamol were more potent stimulants of lipolysis than of cyclic AMP accumulation, while the selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists had similar potencies for these two functions. Apparent pA2 values of the selective beta 1-(CGP20712A) and beta 2-adrenoceptor (ICI118551) antagonist for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase stimulation by (-)-isoprenaline and the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists, BRL37344, SR58611A, and ICI215001, indicated that (-)-isoprenaline can stimulate the enzyme through a relevant beta 1-adrenergic component, while the other drugs activate the enzyme mainly by acting on the beta 3-adrenoceptors. On the contrary, antagonism of the lipolysis yielded apparent pA2 values for CGP20712A and ICI118551, suggesting that (-)-isoprenaline, like all the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists, stimulated the brown adipose tissue lipid metabolism mainly through an action on beta 3-adrenoceptors.
