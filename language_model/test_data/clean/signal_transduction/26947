We investigated the effect of extracellular ATP on the interaction of epidermal growth factor (EGF) with its receptor in cultured renal epithelial cells, LLC-PK1. Pretreatment with ATP, but not adenosine, inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled EGF. The inhibition demonstrated by ATP resulted from a decrease in the affinity of EGF receptors for its ligand, with no change in the number of EGF receptors. Incubation of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 30 min mimicked the ATP-mediated inhibition. On the other hand, prolonged pretreatment with PMA, which leads to disappearance of protein kinase C activity, reversed the inhibition. In addition, pretreatment with the protein kinase C inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinoline sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine prevented the ATP-mediated inhibition. ATP triggered an increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels and translocation of protein kinase C from cytosol to membranes, consist with the stimulation of phospholipase C and the activation of protein kinase C. These results demonstrate that extracellular ATP attenuates the ligand binding affinity of EGF receptor via the stimulation of phospholipase C, leading to the activation of protein kinase C in the LLC-PK1 cells.
