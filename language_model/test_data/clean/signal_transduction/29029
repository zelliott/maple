The Wnt pathway plays an important role in development and in regulating adult stem cell systems. A variety of cellular processes is mediated by Wnt signaling, which includes cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, and cell motility. Loss of regulation of these pathways can lead to tumorigenesis, and the Wnt pathway has been implicated in the development of several types of cancers, including colon, lung, leukemia, breast, thyroid, and prostate. The Wnt pathway has also been associated with other lung diseases such as interstitial lung disease (ILD) and asthma. Our increasing understanding of the Wnt pathway offers great hope that new molecular-based screening tests and pharmaceutical agents that selectively target this pathway will be developed to diagnose and treat these diseases in the future.
