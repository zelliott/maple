The skin is directly and frequently exposed to a pro-oxidative environment, including ozone and UV-radiation. While ozone in the stratosphere protects against mutagenic UVC-radiation, it is also a major air pollutant in urban areas. With its strong oxidizing potential, ozone is perhaps one of the most reactive chemicals the skin ever encounters. Although a large body of evidence exists for ozone- induced oxidative stress in the respiratory tract, the current knowledge on its in vivo effect on cutaneous tissues is based on studies of the last 10 years. Acute ozone exposure damages the stratum corneum, depletes skin vitamin C and E and induces lipid and protein oxidation in upper epidermal layers. Secondary products penetrate into deeper skin layers and are capable of activating signal transduction pathways and inducing cell damage. It has been shown in a murine model, that environmentally relevant ozone concentrations can induce a stress response in the skin.
