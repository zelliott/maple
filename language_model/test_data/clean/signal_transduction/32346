Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) participate in autocrine and paracrine regulation in skeletal muscle. However, the link between these two signaling systems is not well established. Here, we studied cell proliferation as a possible consequence of the trophic effect of ATP in cultured skeletal mouse myoblasts and we tested the possibility that low concentrations of ROS represent the intermediate signaling molecule mediating this effect. Exposure to 10 Î¼M ATP increased proliferation of mouse myoblasts by ~20%. ATP also induced intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations, which were independent of extracellular Ca(2+). Both effects of ATP were prevented by suramin, a broad-spectrum purinergic P2 receptor antagonist. In contrast, the adenosine receptor blocker CGS-15943 did not modify the ATP-mediated effects. Consistent with this, adenosine per se did not change myoblast growth, indicating the direct action of ATP via P2 receptor activation. The proliferative effect of ATP was prevented after depletion of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) by the peroxidase enzyme catalase. Low-micromolar concentrations of exogenous H(2)O(2) mimicked the stimulatory effect of ATP on myoblast growth. DCF imaging revealed ATP-induced catalase and DPI-sensitive ROS production in myoblasts. In conclusion, our results indicate that extracellular ATP controls mouse myoblast proliferation via induction of ROS generation.
