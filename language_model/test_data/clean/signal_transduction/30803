AS160 is an Akt substrate of 160 kDa implicated in the regulation of both insulin- and contraction-mediated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake. The effects of aerobic exercise and subsequent insulin stimulation on AS160 phosphorylation and the binding capacity of 14-3-3, a novel protein involved in the dissociation of AS160 from GLUT4 vesicles, in human skeletal muscle are unknown. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were performed on seven men at rest and immediately and 3 h after a single bout of cycling exercise. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken before and after the clamps. The insulin sensitivity index calculated during the final 30 min of the clamp was 8.0 +/- 0.8, 9.1 +/- 0.5, and 9.2 +/- 0.8 for the rest, postexercise, and 3-h postexercise trials, respectively. AS160 phosphorylation increased immediately after exercise and remained elevated 3 h after exercise. In contrast, the 14-3-3 binding capacity of AS160 and phosphorylation of Akt and AMP-activated protein kinase were only increased immediately after exercise. Insulin increased AS160 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding capacity and insulin receptor substrate-1 and Akt phosphorylation, but the response to insulin was not enhanced by prior exercise. In conclusion, the 14-3-3 binding capacity of AS160 is increased immediately after acute exercise in human skeletal muscle, but this is not maintained 3 h after exercise completion despite sustained AS160 phosphorylation. Insulin increases AS160 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding capacity, but prior exercise does not appear to enhance the response to insulin.
