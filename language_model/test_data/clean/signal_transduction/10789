The failure of the immune system to provide protection against tumour cells is an important immunological problem. It is now evident that inadequate function of the host immune system is one of the main mechanisms by which tumours escape from immune control, as well as an important factor that limits the success of cancer immunotherapy. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that defects in dendritic cells have a crucial role in non-responsiveness to tumours. This article focuses on the functional consequences and recently described mechanisms of the dendritic-cell defects in cancer.
