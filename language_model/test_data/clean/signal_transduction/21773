The responses of single units located in the inferior colliculus of albino mice narcotized by barbital were registered. Pairs of low-intensity tone bursts were used as stimuli. The probability of the response to the second burst in the pair was obtained under two conditions: the presence and absence of spike activity in the reaction to the first burst. With a 50-ms interval between the bursts in the majority of units, the probability of response was lower in the presence of spike activity in response to the first burst. In a few number of units, the opposite tendency was observed. As the interburst interval increased up to 100 and 200 ms, the dependence of the response probability to the second burst on the presence of the firing to the first one gradually weakened. The suppression of inhibitory inputs by bicuculline emphasized the effect of the afterspike decrease in excitability rather than weakened it. Possible mechanisms of interdependence of spike responses to two consecutive signals are discussed.
