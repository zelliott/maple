In this Focus Issue of Science's STKE, which complements the Science Special Issue on germ cells, we take a closer look at cell signaling in germ cells. STKE highlights the migration of germ cells with an article that describes the different mechanisms controlling primordial germ cell movement and survival in mice and flies. Another article describes a mechanism for mediating plant self-incompatibility through control of the pollen tube, to prevent inappropriate delivery of incompatible sperm to the ovule. A common feature found in each of the organisms discussed, be they animal, insect or plant, is that signals from the surrounding tissues control survival and migration of the germ cells or resulting gametes.
