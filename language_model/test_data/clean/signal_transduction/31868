Opposite effects of amino acids on proliferation and differentiation of immune cells in organotypic culture of the spleen were demonstrated. It was found that methionine stimulates differentiation of CD5(+) lymphocyte precursors into T-helpers, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and B cells and induces proliferation of CD68(+)-macrophages. Glutamic acid and arginine induce proliferation of B cells, while histidine and leucine promote differentiation of precursors towards cytotoxic T cells. The opposite effects of amino acids on immune cells of the spleen are related to different hydrophobicity of their side chains determining the type of intermolecular interaction.
