Plants continuously analyze the nature of environmental light signals using an array of at least eight informational photoreceptors, each with differential functional roles. Molecular and genetic studies are identifying an increasing assembly of potential or established signalling intermediates involved in transducing perceived signals from these photoreceptors to photoresponsive genes. The emerging picture suggests a complex network with both separate and shared early signalling pathway segments which appear to converge to regulate developmentally important genes through a set of master regulators.
