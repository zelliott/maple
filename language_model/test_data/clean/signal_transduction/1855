Cyclophilins are peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerases that are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes and that are best known for being the cellular target of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). The activity of CsA is caused by the drug forming a complex with cyclophilin A and inhibiting the calmodulin-dependent phosphoprotein phosphatase calcineurin. We have investigated the role of CYP1, a cyclophilin-encoding gene in the phytopathogenic fungus Magnaporthe grisea, which is the causal agent of rice blast disease. CYP1 putatively encodes a mitochondrial and cytosolic form of cyclophilin, and targeted gene replacement has shown that CYP1 acts as a virulence determinant in rice blast. Cyp1 mutants show reduced virulence and are impaired in associated functions, such as penetration peg formation and appressorium turgor generation. CYP1 cyclophilin also is the cellular target for CsA in Magnaporthe, and CsA was found to inhibit appressorium development and hyphal growth in a CYP1-dependent manner. These data implicate cyclophilins as virulence factors in phytopathogenic fungi and also provide evidence that calcineurin signaling is required for infection structure formation by Magnaporthe.
