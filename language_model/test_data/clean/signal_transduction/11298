The human CB1 cannabinoid receptor couples to G(i/o) proteins and inhibits neuronal voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The role of the C-terminal tail of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor in G(i/o) protein coupling was examined using the superior cervical ganglion neuronal expression system. Deletion of the distal intracellular C-terminal tail (amino acids 418-472) slowed the kinetics and reduced the magnitude of Ca2+ channel inhibition. Deletion of the entire intracellular C-terminal tail (amino acids 401-472) abolished Ca2+ channel inhibition demonstrating the critical role of the proximal amino acids 401-417 of the C-terminal tail in G protein signaling. Expression of the C-terminal truncated receptors on the cell surface was examined using an N-terminal CB1 antibody. Both the C-terminal truncated receptors were expressed on the cell surface and were no different from wild type CB1 cannabinoid receptors. This study establishes that the proximal CB1 cannabinoid receptor intracellular C-terminal tail domain (amino acids 401-417) is critical for G(i/o) protein coupling and that the distal C-terminal tail domain (amino acids 418-472) profoundly modulates both the magnitude and kinetics of signal transduction. Thus, the C-terminal tail of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor has a wider role in G protein coupling than was previously thought.
