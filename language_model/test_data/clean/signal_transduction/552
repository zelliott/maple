Animals measure photoperiod (daylength) and adapt to seasonal changes in the environment by altering their physiology and behavior accordingly. Although this photoperiodic response has long been of interest, the underlying mechanism has only recently begun to be uncovered at the molecular level. Japanese quail provide an excellent model to study the molecular mechanism underlying the vertebrate photoperiodic response. The recent sequencing of the chicken genome allowed a system-level analysis of photoperiodic time measurement in quail, and this approach uncovered the key event in the photoperiodic signaling cascade that regulates seasonal reproduction. Long photoperiod-induced expression of thyrotropin in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland was found to trigger local thyroid hormone catabolism in the mediobasal hypothalamus, which increases the activity of the reproductive neuroendocrine system resulting in gonadal development. Since thyrotropin was only known to stimulate the thyroid gland, a traditional hypothesis-driven approach would not have been expected to predict this discovery. Thus, a functional genomics approach, which is a discovery-driven approach, provides new insights in the field of endocrinology.
