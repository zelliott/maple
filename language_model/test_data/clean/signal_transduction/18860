The Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) is highly susceptible to a number of intracellular pathogens. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), the primary macrophage-activating cytokine, plays a key role in the host defense against intracellular pathogens. The hamster IFN-gamma cDNA encodes a 174 amino acid protein that has an additional 17 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminus compared to IFN-gamma of mice and rats. A homologous C-terminal tail is also found in other non-murine rodents. The biological activity of hamster IFN-gamma had not been investigated previously so we first demonstrated the activity of native IFN-gamma in assays of IFN-gamma-induced receptor signaling and antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus. We then tested the hypothesis that the C-terminal tail of hamster IFN-gamma could influence its biological activity. A truncated hamster IFN-gamma, in which the C-terminal 17 aa were removed by insertion of a stop codon at the position corresponding to the stop codon in the mouse sequence, had approximately 10-fold greater activity than the full length protein when measured in the two bioassays. Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-hamster IFN-gamma antibodies specifically inhibited this biological activity. Collectively, these data indicate that this unique structural feature influences the biological activity of hamster IFN-gamma.
