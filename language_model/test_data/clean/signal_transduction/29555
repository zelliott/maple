The role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in regulation of meningioma growth and intracellular events transducing its signals are not established. In this study, we evaluated the effects of TGF-beta1 on basal meningioma cell proliferation in 10 primary human meningioma cell cultures and whether TGF-beta's signals are transduced by the Smad 2/3, MAPK/Erk kinase-1 (MEK-1)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Akt-p70(S6K) or p38-JUNK pathways in 5. We also tested whether neutralizing antibodies to TGF-beta alter CSF stimulation of meningioma cell proliferation. On average, TGF-beta reduced meningioma cell [3H]-thymidine incorporation to 58% of controls at 24% and to 61% of controls at 36 h. TGF-beta inhibition of meningioma cell proliferation was associated with a suggestion increased phosphorylation of Smad 2/3 in 2 cases and high basal phosphorylation in 3 but no change in activation of the MEK-1-MAPK, Akt-p70(S6K) or p38-JUNK pathways. As shown previously, CSF stimulated meningioma cell proliferation in the 3 cultures tested. Neutralizing antibody against TGF-beta augmented this stimulation in 2 of 3 cultures. These findings suggest that TGF-beta exerts a largely inhibitory effect on basal meningioma proliferation, perhaps in part through Smad 2/3.
