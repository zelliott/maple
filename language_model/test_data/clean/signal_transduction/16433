To explore the neurotoxic effect of acrylamide on nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways in male SD rats and its mechanism.

Fourteen male SD rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: control group, and ACR exposed group (40 mg/kg). Exposed SD rats were intragastrically administrated acrylamide (40 mg/kg) once daily for 12 days, the control rats were only administrated with normal saline by gavage. Neurobehavioral indexes including body weight, gait scores, nervous sensory to heat, foot splay in hindlimb landing were measured, then the contents of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanilic acid (HVA) in the striatum were analyzed by HPLC-fluorescence detection.

In comparison with control, there were significant differences in all neurobehavioral indexes (P < 0.05). The contents of DA in ACR exposed group decreased by 65.64% compared with the control group (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences of DOPAC and HVA content were found between ACR exposed group and control group.

Acrylamide may affect neurobehavior of rats and decrease the level of dopamine in striatum, thus induce a series of neurotoxic effects.
