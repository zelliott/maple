In a previous work we have reported evidences on the mitogenic activity of urokinase-type and tissue-type plasminogen activator (u-PA, t-PA) on serum-deprived human dermal fibroblasts. In this work we have studied the transcription-dependent changes of some cell-cycle related genes associated with the biological activity of PAs, as well as the possible involvement of protein tyr kinases (PTK) and/or protein kinase C (PKC) in the mitogenic signal transduction. The data obtained demonstrate that the growth factor activity of PAs is associated with: - a rapid transient activation of early response genes, c-fos, c-jun and c-myc; - the subsequent coordinated down-regulation of p53 and p21CIP1; - the constant expression of the MEK1 mRNA in every phase of the cell cycle. Quiescent (G0) cells did not express c-fos, c-jun, c-myc and cyclin A, but upon stimulation with mitogens (fetal calf serum (FCS), u-PA, t-PA) the cyclin A mRNA expression was observed in concomitance with the activation of DNA synthesis. Therefore u-PA, t-PA and FCS similarly modulate the expression of c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, p53, p21CIP1 and cyclin A with only slight differences likely related to the time required for activation of DNA synthesis. The PAs mitogenic stimulation of serum-starved cells was associated with the internalization of their molecules, as revealed by immunostaining. The biological activity of u-PA, t-PA, as well as that of limiting concentration of FCS (1%), was mediated by PTK and PKC. Conversely, PTK, but not PKC, was involved in the activation of the proliferative response of basic fibroblast growth factor in the same experimental conditions. In conclusion, u-PA and t-PA can utilize two different pathways, one depending on PTK and the other on PKC in a way similar to the mitogenic activity induced by low concentration of FCS (1%).
