Ran is an evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic GTPase. We previously identified a cDNA of TaRAN1, a novel Ran GTPase homologous gene in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and demonstrated that TaRAN1 is associated with regulation of genome integrity and cell division in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) systems. However, much less is known about the function of RAN in plant development. To analyze the possible biological roles of Ran GTPase, we overexpressed TaRAN1 in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa). TaRAN1 overexpression increased the proportion of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, which resulted in an elevated mitotic index and prolonged life cycle. Furthermore, it led to increased primordial tissue, reduced number of lateral roots, and stimulated hypersensitivity to exogenous auxin. The results suggest that Ran protein was involved in the regulation of mitotic progress, either in the shoot apical meristem or the root meristem zone in plants, where auxin signaling is involved. This article determines the function of RAN in plant development mediated by the cell cycle and its novel role in meristem initiation mediated by auxin signaling.
