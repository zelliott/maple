We demonstrated that urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) efficiently inhibits soluble and tumor cell-associated plasmin activity and subsequently inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The effect of UTI on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-induced stimulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and in the promyeloid leukemia U937 cells was studied. uPA antigen was evaluated in the cell lysate and in the conditioned media by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blot. TNF can promote the production of uPA in HUVEC and in U937 cells. The PKC inhibitors (H7, calphostin C, and staurosporine) inhibited TNF-induced uPA expression and secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of the expression of cell surface receptor-bound uPA by flow cytometry using uPA-specific MAb indicates that induction of uPA expression by TNF was inhibited when these cells were incubated with UTI. On the other hand, treatment of the cells with UTI alone failed to alter uPA production. UTI also reduced the secretion of uPA in TNF-treated cells. UTI was as effective as PKC inhibitors in inhibiting uPA expression by TNF. Incubation of the cells with UTI, however, had no effect on the ability of PMA to stimulate cell-associated uPA expression. These data suggest that UTI may influence the PKC-dependent protein kinase pathway in uPA expression. The study on intracellular pathways involved in UTI modulation of uPA will enhance our understanding of the role that UTI plays in uPA-mediated cellular invasion.
