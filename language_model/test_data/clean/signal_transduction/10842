Biochemical research has revealed that BMP signals are mainly mediated through ligand binding to the receptors followed by activation of Smad proteins. BMP signaling is subjected to regulation at extracellular level by noggin and at intracellular level by inhibitory-Smads. Analysis of transgenic mice in which BMP signals are activated or inactivated has been clarifying a role of BMP signaling during endochondral bone formation. BMPs promote chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, whereas Smad signaling regulates chondrocyte hypertrophy. Proper regulation of these signals is necessary for normal bone formation.
