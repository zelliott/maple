In vertebrate development, most signalling factors behave as morphogens, eliciting divergent cell fates according to their concentration. We ask how cells interpret morphogen concentration as it changes during the establishment of a gradient. Using dissociated blastula cells of Xenopus exposed to activin for only 10 minutes, we have followed the phosphorylation of tagged Smad2, the principal activin transducer, from a cytoplasmic pool to the nucleus in real time. We show that a changing concentration of extracellular activin is rapidly and continuously transduced to provide a corresponding nuclear concentration of Smad2, even though gene response may be delayed for several hours. Nuclear Smad2 concentration changes up as the extracellular concentration of activin increases. We conclude that cells interpret a changing extracellular concentration by maintaining a continuous flow of activated transducer from a large cytoplasmic pool to the nucleus where it is degraded. The volume of this flow determines the steady state concentration of Smad2 in the nucleus and this is used by cells to interpret extracellular morphogen concentration.
