Detection of cytosolic DNA activates a downstream signaling molecule called STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING). Inappropriate or excessive activation of STING can lead to autoimmune disease. A new paper in Cell addresses the important question of how STING-dependent signaling is normally constrained.
