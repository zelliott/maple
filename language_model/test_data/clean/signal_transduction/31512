Neurotensin exerts its actions in the central nervous system and the periphery through three identified receptors. Two of them, the NTS2 and NTS3, display unusual properties either because of their complex signal transduction mechanisms (NTS2) or because of their structural composition as a non-G-protein-coupled receptor (NTS3). Here, we review the transduction mechanisms, cellular trafficking, and potential physiological roles of these two unconventional receptors.
