Upon a wide range of cellular stresses, p53 is activated and inhibits malignant transformation through the transcriptional regulation of its target genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair. However, its involvement in posttranslational modifications of proteins has not yet been well characterized. Here, we report the novel role of p53 in the regulation of protein citrullination. p53 transactivated peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) through an intronic p53-binding site. The PADI4 gene encodes an enzyme catalyzing the citrullination of arginine residues in proteins, and ectopic expression of p53 or PADI4 induced protein citrullination. In addition, various proteins were citrullinated in response to DNA damage, but knockdown of PADI4 or p53 remarkably inhibited their citrullination, indicating the regulation of protein citrullination in a p53/PADI4-dependent manner. We found that PADI4 citrullinated the histone chaperone protein, nucleophosmin (NPM1), at the arginine 197 residue in vivo under physiologic conditions. Citrullination of NPM1 by PADI4 resulted in its translocation from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm, whereas PADI4 did not alter the localization of mutant NPM1 (R197K). Furthermore, ectopic expression of PADI4 inhibited tumor cell growth, and concordantly, the knockdown of PADI4 attenuated p53-mediated growth-inhibitory activity, demonstrating the significance of PADI4-mediated protein citrullination in the p53 signaling pathway
