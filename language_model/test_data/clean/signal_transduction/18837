It is well-established that the binding of N-formyl peptides to the N-formyl peptide receptor on neutrophils can be described by a kinetic scheme that involves two ligand-bound receptor states, both a low affinity ligand-receptor complex and a high affinity ligand-receptor complex, and that the rate constants describing ligand-receptor binding and receptor affinity state interconversion are ligand-specific. Here we examine whether differences due to these rate constants, i.e. differences in the numbers and lifetimes of particular receptor states, are correlated with neutrophil responses, namely actin polymerization and oxidant production. We find that an additional receptor state, one not discerned from kinetic binding assays, is required to account for these responses. This receptor state is interpreted as the number of low affinity bound receptors that are capable of activating G proteins; in other words, the accumulation of these active receptors correlates with the extent of both responses. Furthermore, this analysis allows for the quantification of a parameter that measures the relative strength of a ligand to bias the receptor into the active conformation. A model with this additional receptor state is sufficient to describe response data when two ligands (agonist/agonist or agonist/antagonist pairs) are added simultaneously, suggesting that cells respond to the accumulation of active receptors regardless of the identity of the ligand(s).
