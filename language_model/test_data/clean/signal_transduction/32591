Leptin is the product of the obese gene (ob), and is secreted in plasma from mature adipocytes. It has been recently reported that leptin is synthesized in granulosa and cumulus cells within the follicle of the ovary, and is present in mature human oocytes, suggesting possible roles of leptin in several aspects of pre- and post-ovulatory follicular development. On the other hand, STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) transcription factors are involved in leptin-associated signal transduction. In this report, we studied the expression of leptin receptor and STAT3 activation by leptin in metaphase 2 stage (M2) oocytes. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting showed that mRNA and protein of leptin receptor were expressed in M2 stage oocyte. Leptin at 15 ng/ml, the concentration observed in follicular fluid, caused tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in mouse M2 stage oocytes. These results suggest possible roles of leptin in several aspects during oocyte maturation by activating the STAT signal transduction pathway.
