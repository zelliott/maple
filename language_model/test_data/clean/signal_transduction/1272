In order to gain more insight into the pathogenesis of dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (DCM and HCM, respectively), we investigated the roles of certain cytokines that regulate apoptosis.

ELISA tests, performed to determine the plasma concentrations of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), the soluble Fas (sFas), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), revealed that DCM patients exhibit elevated concentrations of TNF-alpha, sFas, IL-6 and sIL-6R, while HCM patients have only high IL-6 and sIL-6R levels as compared with healthy individuals. Western blot analysis of the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, Bcl-2 and Bax proteins in myocardium samples demonstrated that DCM patients express increased levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and Bax, whereas HCM heart lysates display only elevated levels of Bcl-2. Annexin V binding assay of TNF-alpha-treated H9C2 cells indicated that the in vitro cytotoxicity of this cytokine involves apoptotosis and necrosis.

In accord with previous observations, our data indicate a strong activation of the pro-apoptotic TNF and Fas pathways in DCM patients, and an anti-apoptotic shift in HCM patients. These findings have a bearing on the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies, since apoptosis may account for certain dysfunctions observed in DCM, while IL-6 may elicit the hypertrophy characteristic of HCM.
