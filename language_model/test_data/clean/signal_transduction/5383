Neural stem cells (NSC) undergo apoptotic cell death during development of nervous system and in adult. However, little is known about the biochemical regulation of neuroprotection by neurotrophin in these cells. In this report, we demonstrate that Staurosporine (STS) and Etoposide (ETS) induced apoptotic cell death of NSC by a mechanism requiring Caspase 3 activation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and Lamin A/C cleavage. Although C17.2 cells revealed higher mRNA level of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) compared with TrkA or TrkB receptor, neuroprotective effect of both nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) mediated through the activation of tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) receptors. Moreover, both NGF and BDNF induced the activation of the phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Inhibition of Trk receptor by K252a reduced PARP cleavage as well as cell viability, whereas inhibition of p75(NTR) did not affect the effect of neurotrophin on neurotoxic insults. Thus our studies indicate that the protective effect of NGF and BDNF in NSC against apoptotic stimuli is mediated by the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathway via Trk receptors.
