γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have been developed to reduce amyloid-β (Aβ) production for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, cross-inhibitory activity on the processing of Notch can cause adverse reactions. To avoid these undesirable effects, γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) are being developed to selectively reduce toxic Aβ production without perturbing Notch signaling. As it is also known that GSIs can cause a paradoxical increase of plasma Aβ over the baseline after a transient reduction (known as Aβ-rebound), we asked if GSMs would cause a similar rebound and what the potential mechanism might be. Our studies were performed with one GSI (LY-450139) and two chemically distinct GSMs. Although LY-450139 caused Aβ-rebound as expected in rat plasma, the two GSMs did not. Inhibition of APP processing by LY-450139 induced an accumulation of γ-secretase substrates, α- and β-C-terminal fragments of APP, but neither GSM caused such an accumulation. In conclusion, we discover that GSMs, unlike GSIs, do not cause Aβ-rebound, possibly because of the lack of accumulation of β-C-terminal fragments. GSMs may be superior to GSIs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease not only by sparing Notch signaling but also by avoiding Aβ-rebound.
