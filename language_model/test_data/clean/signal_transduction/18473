Na√Øve T helper (Th) cells differentiate in response to antigen stimulation into either Th1 or Th2 effector cells, which are characterized by the secretion of different set of cytokines. Th2 differentiation, which is critical for allergic airway disease, is triggered by signals of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the cytokines generated during polarization, particularly IL-4. We determine here the potential role of the signaling adapter p62 in T-cell polarization. We report using p62-/- mice and cells that p62 acts downstream TCR activation, and is important for Th2 polarization and asthma, playing a significant role in the control of the sustained activation of NF-kappaB and late synthesis of GATA3 and IL-4 by participating in the activation of the IKK complex.
