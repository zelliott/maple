Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) signal transduction is organized by scaffold and adaptor proteins, which have specific subcellular distribution. On a way from the plasma membrane to the lysosome EGFRs are still in their active state and can signal from distinct subcellular locations. To identify organelle-specific targets of EGF receptor signaling on endosomes a combination of subcellular fractionation, two-dimensional DIGE, fluorescence labeling of phosphoproteins, and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry was applied. All together 23 EGF-regulated (phospho)proteins were identified as being differentially associated with endosomal fractions by functional organelle proteomics; among them were proteins known to be involved in endosomal trafficking and cytoskeleton rearrangement (Alix, myosin-9, myosin regulatory light chain, Trap1, moesin, cytokeratin 8, septins 2 and 11, and CapZbeta). Interestingly R-Ras, a small GTPase of the Ras family that regulates cell survival and integrin activity, was associated with endosomes in a ligand-dependent manner. EGF-dependent association of R-Ras with late endosomes was confirmed by confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting of endosomal fractions. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib was used to confirm EGF-dependent regulation of all identified proteins. EGF-dependent association of signaling molecules, such as R-Ras, with late endosomes suggests signaling specification through intracellular organelles.
