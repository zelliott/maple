Carpesium macrocephalum (CM) Fr. et Sav. (Compositae) has been used in Chinese folk medicine as an analgesic, hemostatic, antipyretic, and to suppress inflammatory conditions. In the present study we aimed to provide scientific evidence for the anti-inflammatory properties of CM extract and evaluate the intrinsic mechanisms involved in both in vitro and in vivo experimental models. In in vitro findings, CM significantly inhibited the LPS-stimulated release of proinflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, prostaglandin E2, and interleukin-6 in RAW264.7 macrophages in a concentration-dependent fashion. The attenuation of inflammatory responses in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells by CM was closely associated with the suppression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation, IκB-α degradation, and phosphorylation of Akt. CM treatment also attenuated the phosphorylation of STAT through TRIF dependent pathways in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. In vivo studies revealed that CM extract concentration dependently suppressed the acetic acid-induced vascular permeability in mice. Considering the data obtained regulation of multiple signaling mechanisms involving TRIF and Akt/NF-κB pathways might be responsible for the potent anti-inflammatory action of CM, substantiating its traditional use in inflammatory diseases.
