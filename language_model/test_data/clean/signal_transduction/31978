Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are key RNA viral sensors for triggering antiviral immunity. The underlying mechanisms for RLRs to trigger antiviral immunity have yet to be explored. Here we report the identification of TAPE (TBK1-associated protein in endolysosomes) as a novel regulator of the RLR pathways. TAPE functionally and physically interacts with RIG-I, MDA5, and IPS-1 to activate the IFN-β promoter. TAPE knockdown impairs IFN-β activation induced by RLRs but not IPS-1. TAPE-deficient cells are defective in cytokine production upon RLR ligand stimulation. During RNA virus infection, TAPE knockdown or deficiency diminishes cytokine production and antiviral responses. Our data demonstrate a critical role for TAPE in linking RLRs to antiviral immunity.
