The endothelium of the vascular beds is extremely diverse and exquisitely distinct with respect to the specific tissue compartment served by the vessels. The molecular identity and function of the instructive signals that tailor the tissue-specific endothelial phenotype have been largely undefined. Presumably, a complex, integrated network of signals derived from the tissue parenchyma and/or stromal compartments is responsible. Recently, we identified a novel angiogenic mitogen, endocrine-gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor, EG-VEGF, with a selective activity and very distinct expression pattern. Human EG-VEGF is expressed by steroid producing cells in the adrenal gland, placenta, testis and ovary, and is a mitogen for endothelial cells derived from these microvascular beds. EG-VEGF may represent the first of a novel class of tissue-specific angiogenic factors that function to regulate and fine-tune endothelial cell growth, structural and functional properties. The identification of other selective angiogenic molecules will allow insight into exciting, basic developmental issues and increase our armamentarium of factors for therapeutic angiogenic and anti-angiogenic strategies.
