Bacteriophytochromes (Bphs) are photoreceptors that help bacteria sense changes in light wavelength and intensity. Bphs contain a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore that, upon absorption of red or far-red light, undergoes a cis-trans isomerization that leads to a conformational change in the holoprotein. The conformation and type of Bph affects the expression of genes. The linear tetrapyrrole bound by Bphs is thought to come from O(2)-dependent cleavage of heme by a heme oxygenase. We have discovered that the absence of O(2) does not inhibit the normal function of two Bphs in the regulation of Rhodopseudomonas palustris light-harvesting complexes. These observations imply that: (i) a linear tetrapyrrole can be made anaerobically, either through anaerobic heme cleavage by a novel enzyme or directly from the heme precursor hydroxymethylbilane without ring cleavage; or (ii) that Bph-dependent signal transduction does not require a chromophore.
