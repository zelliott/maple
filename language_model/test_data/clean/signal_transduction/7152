In our previous studies in grass carp pituitary cells, local production of luteinizing hormone (LH) was shown to induce growth hormone (GH) production and gene expression, which constitutes a major component of the "intrapituitary feedback loop" regulating GH secretion and synthesis via autocrine/paracrine interactions between gonadotrophs and somatotrophs in the carp pituitary. To further investigate the signaling mechanisms mediating LH action at the transcriptional level, promoter studies were performed in GH3 cells co-transfected with the expression vector for carp LH receptor and luciferase-expressing reporter constructs with grass carp GH promoter. In this cell model, treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was effective in increasing GH promoter activity and the responsive sequence was mapped to position -616 and -572 of the grass carp GH promoter. GH promoter activation induced by hCG occurred with concurrent rise in cAMP production, CREB phosphorylation, and could be inhibited by inactivation of adenylate cyclase (AC), PKA, MEK1/2, P(38) MAPK, PI3K and mTOR. AC activation, presumably via cAMP production, could mimic hCG-induced CREB phosphorylation and GH promoter activity, and these stimulatory effects were also sensitive to the blockade of PKA-, MAPK- and PI3K- dependent cascades. These results, as a whole, suggest that LH receptor activation in the carp pituitary may trigger GH gene transcription through CREB phosphorylation as a result of the functional crosstalk of the cAMP/PKA pathway with MAPK-and PI3K-dependent cascades.
