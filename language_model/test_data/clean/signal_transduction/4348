In recent years, epidemiological studies have shown an increased risk of leukemia in children living near electric power distribution lines. Also, medical studies have shown that low frequency electromagnetic (EM) fields accelerate the healing of bone fractures. The stimulation of biosynthesis suggested by both epidemiological and clinical studies is observed in vitro, and indicates that EM fields stimulate the biosynthetic 'stress response' in cells. Studies of EM field effects on enzyme (Na,K-ATPase) function suggest that these effects should be considered in the design of molecular electronic devices.
