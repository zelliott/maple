Several macrophage scavenger receptors have been identified that bind and internalize modified low-density lipoprotein particles. Although the pathophysiologic roles played by these receptors in human disease are still unproven, data from murine models of atherosclerosis have demonstrated a significant role in atherosclerotic foam cell development and vascular lesion development for two receptors: the type A scavenger receptor (SR-A) and the type B scavenger receptor, CD36. This review addresses the regulation and potential role of CD36 in macrophage foam cell formation and atherosclerosis, with particular emphasis on the mechanisms by which CD36 expression is altered in response to lipid modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma signaling.
