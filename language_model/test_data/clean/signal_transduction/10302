Anandamide (AEA) exhibits anti-inflammatory effects. However, its role in the periodontal field remains unknown. Here, we found that gingival crevicular fluid contained a detectable level of AEA. The cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 were expressed by human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), and markedly upregulated under pathological conditions. AEA significantly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1) induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS in HGFs, and this effect was attenuated by AM251 and SR144528, selective antagonists of CB1 and CB2, respectively. Moreover, AEA completely blocked LPS-triggered NF-kappaB activation, implying that AEA may regulate hyperinflammatory reactions in periodontitis.
