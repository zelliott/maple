Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed RNA molecules >200 nucleotides in length. They comprise a diverse class of transcripts that structurally resemble mRNAs, but do not encode proteins. The characterization of lncRNAs and their acceptance as crucial regulators of numerous developmental and biological pathways have suggested that the lncRNA study has gradually become one of the hot topics in the field of RNA biology. In this article, we will highlight recent progress regarding lncRNAs studies, including their classification, biological functional characterization, and their potential roles in disease development.
