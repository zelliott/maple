Cellular communication is a fundamental process in biology. The interaction of adipocytes with macrophages is a key event in the development of common diseases such as type 2 diabetes. We applied an established bilayer cell co-culture system and comprehensive mass spectrometry analysis to detect proteome-wide the paracrine interaction of murine adipocytes and macrophages. Altogether, we identified 4486 proteins with at least two unique peptides of which 2392 proteins were informative for 3T3-L1 adipocytes and 2957 proteins for RAW 264.7 macrophages. Further, we observed over 12,000 phosphorylation sites of which we could assign 3,200 informative phosphopeptides with a single phosphosite for adipocytes and 4,514 for macrophages. Using protein set enrichment and phosphosite analyses, we deciphered regulatory protein pathways involved in cellular stress and inflammation, which can contribute to metabolic impairment of cells including insulin resistance and other disorders. The generated data sets provide a holistic, molecular pathway-centric view on the interplay of adipocytes and macrophages in disease processes and a resource for further studies.
