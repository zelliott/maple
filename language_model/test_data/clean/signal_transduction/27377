Confocal microscopy is a valuable tool for analysing cell and tissue structure. Compared to conventional microscopic techniques, it has the advantages of increased image resolution and the capability for 3-D reconstruction. The introduction of ion-sensitive fluorescent probes has enabled second messenger systems to be studied in relation to cell physiology and function. The confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) is best suited for this purpose. Cytosolic calcium signalling with the CLSM has enhanced our understanding of calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways. Given that calcium signalling plays a central role in cell in the mediation of cell functions, any aberration may induce pathological states.
