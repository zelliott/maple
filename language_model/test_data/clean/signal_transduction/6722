Highly flexible regulation of photosynthetic light reactions in plant chloroplasts is a prerequisite to provide sufficient energy flow to downstream metabolism and plant growth, to protect light reactions against photodamage, and to ensure controlled cellular signaling from the chloroplast to the nucleus. Such comprehensive regulation occurs via the control of excitation energy transfer to and between the two photosystems (PSII and PSI), of the electrochemical gradient across the thylakoid membrane (Î”pH), and of electron transfer from PSII to PSI electron acceptors. In this opinion article, we propose that these regulatory mechanisms, functioning at different levels of photosynthetic energy conversion, might be interconnected and describe how the concomitant and integrated function of these mechanisms might enable plants to acclimate to a full array of environmental changes.
