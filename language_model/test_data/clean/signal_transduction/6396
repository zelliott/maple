Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent calcineurin has been shown to have important roles in various Ca(2+) signaling pathways. We have previously reported that cnb-1(jh103) mutants, null mutants of a regulatory B subunit, displayed pleiotropic defects including uncoordinated movement and delayed egg laying in Caenorhabditis elegans. Interestingly, gain-of-function mutants of a catalytic A subunit showed exactly opposite phenotypes to those of cnb-1(null) mutants providing an excellent genetic model to define calcium-mediated signaling pathway at the organism level. Furthermore, calcineurin is also important for normal cuticle formation, which is required for maintenance of normal body size in C.elegans. Genetic interactions between tax-6 and several mutants including egl-30 and egl-10, which are known to be involved in G-protein signaling pathways suggest that calcineurin indeed regulates locomotion and serotonin-mediated egg laying through goa-1(Goalpha) and egl-30(Gqalpha). Our results indicate that, along with CaMKII, calcineurin regulates G-protein-coupled phosphorylation signaling pathways in C.elegans.
