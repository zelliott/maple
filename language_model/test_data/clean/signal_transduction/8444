Ex vivo expansion of skin epithelial stem cells has long attracted great interest because of the potential utilization in transplantation and gene therapy. The use of cultured stem or progenitor cells was limited by the lack of applicable culturing system with both satisfactory expansion efficacy and well suppressed differentiation ex vivo. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are responsible for cell growth and differentiation process. We investigated the function of p38 inhibitor SB203580 in the ex vivo expansion of skin epithelial progenitor cells by comparing media with or without addition of this inhibitor. Our results showed that the culturing medium with murine 3T3 feeder layers added with 10 microM SB203580 was more effective in promoting clonal growth of human skin epithelial progenitors or stem cells than the conventional medium without SB203580. The clone initial day in cells treated with 10 microM SB203580 came 2 d earlier with higher colony formation efficiency. The skin epithelial progenitor cells treated with 10 microM SB203580 formed clones that were uniformly smaller in size, longer in sustained proliferation, shorter in clone doubling time, higher in S-phase cells percentage, and lower in levels of differentiation markers such as K10 along with higher levels of stem-cell-associated markers such as p63, K15, and ABCG2 than those cultured in the conventional medium. Collectively, these results indicate that the p38 MAPK pathways inhibitor SB203580 can be used as a culture medium additive that helps to achieve more effective ex vivo expansion of skin epithelial progenitor cells.
