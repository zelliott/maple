Abnormal regulation of ion channels by members of the ABC transport protein superfamily has been implicated in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and in excessive Na+ absorption by airway epithelia in cystic fibrosis (CF). How ABC proteins regulate ion conductances is unknown, but must generally involve either the number or activity of specific ion channels. Here we report that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is defective in CF, reverses the regulation of the activity of single epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) by cAMP. ENaC expressed alone in fibroblasts responded to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with increased open probability (Po) and mean open time, whereas ENaC co-expressed with CFTR exhibited decreased Po and mean open time under conditions optimal for PKA-mediated protein phosphorylation. Thus, CFTR regulates ENaC at the level of single channel gating, by switching the response of single channel Po to cAMP from an increase to a decrease.
