In rat liver epithelial cells (GN4), angiotensin II (Ang II) and thapsigargin stimulate a novel calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK) also known as PYK2, CAKbeta, or RAFTK. Activation of CADTK by a thapsigargin-dependent increase in intracellular calcium failed to stimulate the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase pathway but was well correlated with a 30-50-fold activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In contrast, Ang II, which increased both protein kinase C (PKC) activity and intracellular calcium, stimulated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase but produced a smaller, less sustained, JNK activation than thapsigargin. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), which slowly activated CADTK, did not stimulate JNK. These findings suggest either that CADTK is not involved in JNK activation or PKC activation inhibits the CADTK to JNK pathway. A 1-min TPA pretreatment of GN4 cells inhibited thapsigargin-dependent JNK activation by 80-90%. In contrast, TPA did not inhibit the >50-fold JNK activation effected by anisomycin or UV. The consequence of PKC-dependent JNK inhibition was reflected in c-Jun and c-Fos mRNA induction following treatment with thapsigargin and Ang II. Thapsigargin, which only minimally induced c-Fos, produced a much greater and more prolonged c-Jun response than Ang II. Elevation of another intracellular second messenger, cAMP, for 5-15 min also inhibited calcium-dependent JNK activation by approximately 80-90% but likewise had no effect on the stress-dependent JNK pathway. In summary, two pathways stimulate JNK in cells expressing CADTK, a calcium-dependent pathway modifiable by PKC and cAMP-dependent protein kinase and a stress-activated pathway independent of CADTK, PKC, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase; the inhibition by PKC can ultimately alter gene expression initiated by a calcium signal.
