Homocysteine can be converted to its reactive thioester, homocysteine thiolactone. Cytotoxic properties of these amino thiols have been attributed to protein homocysteinylation, increased oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis. This study used pancreatic BRIN-BD11 beta-cells to examine functional defects caused by acute and long-term exposure to homocysteine thiolactone in comparison with homocysteine. Acute and long-term exposure to both agents caused concentration-dependent inhibitions of glucose-induced insulin secretion while impairing the insulin-secretory responses to alanine, KCl, elevated Ca(2+), forskolin and PMA. Acute exposures also caused significant reduction in the amplitude of KCl-induced membrane depolarisation but no effects on changes of intracellular Ca(2+) induced by alanine or KCl. Cellular insulin content and DNA damage were not altered following culture, however, there were early signs of apoptosis consistent with impaired cellular integrity. In conclusion, exposure to homocysteine thiolactone, like homocysteine, induced beta-cell dysfunction and demise by mechanisms independent of changes in membrane potential and [Ca(2+)](i).
