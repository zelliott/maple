Sphingosine kinases (SphKs) and their product sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) have been reported to regulate apoptosis and survival of liver cells. Cholestatic liver diseases are characterized by cytotoxic levels of bile salts inducing liver injury. It is unknown whether SphKs and/or S1P play a role in this pathogenic process. Here, we investigated the putative involvement of SphK1 and S1P in bile salt-induced cell death in hepatocytes. Primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) to induce apoptosis. GCDCA-exposed hepatocytes were co-treated with S1P, the SphK1 inhibitor Ski-II and/or specific antagonists of S1P receptors (S1PR1 and S1PR2). Apoptosis and necrosis were quantified. Ski-II significantly reduced GCDCA-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes (-70%, P<0.05) without inducing necrosis. GCDCA increased the S1P levels in hepatocytes (P<0.05). GCDCA induced [Ca(2+)] oscillations in hepatocytes and co-treatment with the [Ca(2+)] chelator BAPTA repressed GCDCA-induced apoptosis. Ski-II inhibited the GCDCA-induced intracellular [Ca(2+)] oscillations. Transcripts of all five S1P receptors were detected in hepatocytes, of which S1PR1 and S1PR2 appear most dominant. Inhibition of S1PR1, but not S1PR2, reduced GCDCA-induced apoptosis by 20%. Exogenous S1P also significantly reduced GCDCA-induced apoptosis (-50%, P<0.05), however, in contrast to the GCDCA-induced (intracellular) SphK1 pathway, this was dependent on S1PR2 and not S1PR1. Our results indicate that SphK1 plays a pivotal role in mediating bile salt-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes in part by interfering with intracellular [Ca(2+)] signaling and activation of S1PR1.
