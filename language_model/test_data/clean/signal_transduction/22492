Class IB phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110γ is a master regulator of both leukocyte and cardiomyocyte function. Whereas in the immune system p110γ is principally involved in the control of leukocyte chemotaxis and inflammatory reactions, in cardiomyocytes p110γ affects multiple aspects of β-adrenergic receptor signaling and cardiac function. Because inflammatory cell recruitment/activation and cardiac dysfunction are strictly connected, p110γ has recently been revealed as a promising target for drug design in the treatment of heart failure. This review discusses recent works that dissect the relative contribution of leukocyte p110γ and its cardiac counterpart in the onset and progression of pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling and the ensuing therapeutic implications.
