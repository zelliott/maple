Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare blood cell malignancy occurring in very young children. Yet, just as has been proven in other rare diseases, the study of JMML has provided us great insights into aberrant and dysregulated signal transduction through the Ras pathway, with the ultimate development of malignancy. Further, JMML investigations have also revealed to us much about the genetic predisposition to cancer.
