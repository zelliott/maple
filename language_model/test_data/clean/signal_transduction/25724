Pathophysiological aldosterone (aldo)/mineralocorticoid receptor signaling has a major impact on the cardiovascular system, resulting in hypertension and vascular remodeling. Mineralocorticoids induce endothelial dysfunction, decreasing vasorelaxation in response to acetylcholine and increasing the response to vasoconstrictors. Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is thought to mediate the vascular effects of aldo, but this has yet to be demonstrated in vivo. In this study, we analyzed the molecular and functional vascular consequences of aldo-salt challenge in the waved 2 mouse, a genetic model with a partial loss of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. Deficient EGFR activity is associated with global oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. A decrease in EGFR activity did not affect the arterial wall remodeling process induced by aldo-salt. By contrast, normal EGFR activity was required for the aldo-induced enhancement of phenylephrine- and angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction. In conclusion, this in vivo study demonstrates that EGFR plays a key role in aldosterone-mediated vascular reactivity.
