Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) remains incurable due to its inevitable pattern of relapse after treatment with current existing therapies. However, the promise of a cure for MCL lies in the burgeoning area of novel agents. In this study, we elucidated the therapeutic effect and mechanism of carfilzomib, a novel long-acting second-generation proteasome inhibitor, in MCL cells. We found that carfilzomib induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in both established MCL cell lines and freshly isolated primary MCL cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, carfilzomib was less toxic to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. The carfilzomib-induced apoptosis of MCL cells was mediated by the activation of JNK, Bcl-2, and mitochondria-related pathways. In addition, carfilzomib inhibited the growth and survival signaling pathways NF-ÎºB and STAT3. Interestingly, we discovered that expression of immunoproteasome (i-proteasome) subunits is required for the anti-MCL activity of carfilzomib in MCL cells. In MCL-bearing SCID mice/primary MCL-bearing SCID-hu mice, intravenous administration of 5 mg/kg carfilzomib on days 1 and 2 for 5 weeks slowed/abrogated tumor growth and significantly prolonged survival. Our preclinical data show that carfilzomib is a promising, potentially less toxic treatment for MCL. Furthermore, an intact i-proteasome, especially LMP2, appears to be necessary for its anti-MCL activity, suggesting that i-proteasome could serve as a biomarker for identifying patients who will benefit from carfilzomib.
