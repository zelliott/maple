The kidney contains a renin-angiotensin system that appears to regulate systemic blood pressure. Angiotensin II (Ang II) has stimulatory effects on sodium transport in multiple nephron segments via binding to plasma membrane AT(1) receptors. In the proximal tubule, Ang II production is substantial. The stimulatory effect of Ang II on proximal sodium transport is enhanced by renal nerves, and is associated with internalization of apical and basolateral receptors. In the cortical collecting duct, AT(1) receptors stimulate transport through apical sodium channels, and in the inner medulla, urea transport is enhanced by Ang II, contributing to increased sodium and water reabsorption. AT(1) receptors may also be linked to increased expression of certain tubular sodium transporters. In contrast to the stimulatory effects of AT(1) receptors on sodium transport, AT(2) receptors expressed in the adult kidney are linked to increased urinary sodium excretion and decreased blood pressure. This suggests that renal tubular AT(1) receptor activation serves as a protective mechanism to increase sodium reabsorption and blood pressure when extracellular fluid volume is threatened, whereas AT(2) receptors dampen this response. The interplay between these two receptor pathways in the kidney could have significant effects on long-term blood pressure control.
