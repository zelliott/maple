The localization of three key signal transduction components was indicated in rat heart tissue by immunocytochemical and histochemical experiment. It was shown that: 1. The M2 muscarinic receptors are localized along outer cell membranes and T-tubule membranes of cardiomyocytes but additionally at membranes of endothelial cells and fibroblasts. 2. Gia was found along outer cell membranes of cardiomyocytes and other cells of the heart and also inside the cells of the perinuclear space in close contact to the nuclei envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Goa were found to be associated mainly in atrial tissue, especially at the nerval (neuronal) endings located among the cardiac muscle cells. This was shown in parallel incubation with specific neuronal antibody as a marker for these structures. 3. Adenylyl cyclase was localized along the sarcolemma and the T-tubule membranes in normal cardiomyocytes of rat and guinea pig hearts. Under ischemic conditions, the adenylyl cyclase was also seen in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. The reasons for this changed localization need further elucidation. Binding of the adenylyl cyclase within the molecular structure of the membrane or variation of the marker penetration remain to be clarified.
