Phosphoinositides serve as important spatio-temporal regulators of intracellular trafficking and cell signalling events. In addition to their recognition by specific phosphoinositide binding domains present within cytoplasmic adaptor proteins or membrane integral channels and transporters phosphoinositides may affect membrane transport by eliciting conformational changes within proteins or by regulating enzymatic activities. During adaptor-mediated membrane traffic phosphoinositides form part of coincidence detection systems that aid in targeting pools of specific phosphoinositides to select intracellular transport pathways. In this review, we discuss potential mechanisms for conferring selectivity onto the phosphoinositide code as well as possible avenues for future research.
