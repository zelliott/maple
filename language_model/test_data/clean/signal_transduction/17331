The vascular system is the first organ to form in the developing mammalian embryo. The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in almost all vertebrate organs. The analysis of targeted mouse mutants has demonstrated essential roles of the Notch signaling pathway in embryonic vascular development. However, Notch signaling-deficient mice have so far not been examined in detail in the head region. The bHLH genes Hes1 and Hes5 are essential effectors for Notch signaling, which regulate the maintenance of progenitor cells and the timing of their differentiation in various tissues and organs. Here, we report that endothelial-specific Hes1 and Hes5 mutant embryos exhibited defective vascular remodeling in the brain. In addition, arterial identity of endothelial cells was partially lost in the brain of these mutant mice. These data suggest that Hes1 and Hes5 regulate vascular remodeling and arterial fate specification of endothelial cells in the development of the brain. Hes1 and Hes5 represent critical transducers of Notch signals in brain vascular development.
