Cellular senescence is, essentially, a permanent proliferation arrest induced by various cellular stresses or inappropriate stimuli. This arrest, which is associated with dramatic changes in cell morphology, metabolism and gene expression, involves a complex signalling network aiming at stable inactivation of CDKs, major cell cycle regulators. Notably, several tumour suppressors, such as p53, pRb or p16(Ink4a), play key roles both in the initiation of the senescence program and in its maintenance, which often involves epigenetic changes. While having widely recognized roles in tumour suppression and wound healing, senescence, like the roman god Janus, recently revealed another darker face. Mostly due to altered secretion phenotype favouring inflammation, senescent cells strongly influence surrounding tissue contributing to the development of age-related pathologies, including cancer.
