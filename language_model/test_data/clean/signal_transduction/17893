The role of cholera toxin and heat-labile enterotoxin in the pathogenesis of diarrhoeal disease has been well documented for many years. In addition to these deleterious effects, a wealth of data is accumulating that suggests that these toxins and their subunits might be used to modulate immune responses in a variety of beneficial ways. In this regard, the toxins can boost immune responses to unrelated antigens, leading to the possibility of their use in the generation of improved vaccines to a variety of pathogens. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that recombinant preparations of the nontoxic B subunits of the toxins have distinct immunomodulatory activities, with potential applications to the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. This article reviews our current understanding of the mechanisms of immune modulation by these fascinating proteins.
