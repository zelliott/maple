The expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) has been implicated in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. Here, we found that an antitumor antibiotic, ascofuranone, inhibits invasion and MMP-9 induction induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in human cell lines. Ascofuranone also inhibits the protein expression and transcription of MMP-9 induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The inhibition of MMP-9 induction was observed in human cancer cell lines as well as primary rat mesangial cells. Furthermore, as evidenced by MMP-9 promoter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, ascofuranone specifically inhibited MMP-9 gene expression by blocking PMA-stimulated activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1). In addition, ascofuranone suppressed PMA-induced phosphorylation of Ras, Raf, MEK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), upstream factors involved in AP-1activation, whereas the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK/mitogen-activated protein kinase was not affected by ascofuranone, suggesting that the primary target of ascofuranone for suppression of the AP-1 induction is present in upstream of ERK signaling pathway. These results suggest that the suppression of MMP-9 expression, at least in part, contributes to the antitumor activity of ascofuranone.
