Cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a common, bacterial second messenger that regulates diverse cellular processes in bacteria. Opposing activities of diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs) control c-di-GMP homeostasis in the cell. Many microbes have a large number of genes encoding DGCs and PDEs that are predicted to be part of c-di-GMP signaling networks. Other building blocks of these networks are c-di-GMP receptors which sense the cellular levels of the dinucleotide. C-di-GMP receptors form a more diverse family, including various transcription factors, PilZ domains, degenerate DGCs or PDEs, and riboswitches. Recent studies revealing the molecular basis of c-di-GMP signaling mechanisms enhanced our understanding of how this molecule controls downstream biological processes and how c-di-GMP signaling specificity is achieved.
