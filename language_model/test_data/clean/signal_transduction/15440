Activin is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and exerts certain effects on differentiation and apoptosis. We investigated the effects of activin on retinoblastoma cell line.

We used retinoblastoma cell line Y79. Intracellular signal transduction of activin was investigated with RT-PCR, immunofluorescence study, and luciferase reporter assay. The effect of activin on cell growth was examined with fluorescence cell viability assays. To determine the effect of activin on apoptosis, a TUNEL assay and an immunofluorescence study of cleaved PARP were performed. The effect of activin on cell differentiation was examined with RT-PCR and Western blotting.

Intracellular signal transduction of activin was confirmed in Y79 cells. Activin inhibited Y79 cell growth. Activin induced the expression of neural retina leucine zipper (Nrl) at the mRNA and protein levels.

Nrl is a specific gene in rod photoreceptor development and is a gene indispensable to differentiation into rod photoreceptors, so the present results suggest that activin affects the differentiation of retinoblastoma cells into rod photoreceptor cells.
