Recent progress in cytokine studies has made it possible to understand the pathophysiological roles of cytokines in multiple myeloma. Specifically, interleukin (IL)-6 is a potent growth factor for myeloma cells and is also responsible for the progressive bone resorption characteristic of this disease. On the basis of this evidence, clinical trials to interfere with IL-6 signals have been initiated for the treatment of patients with advanced myeloma. Such a new therapeutic approach as well as myeloblative therapy should be able to provide us with the breakthrough needed to prevail over this so far incurable disease.
