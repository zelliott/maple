Recent reports examining the mammalian kinesin relative Kif7 highlight the conserved role for microtubule motor proteins in Drosophila and vertebrate Hedgehog signalling. Mammalian Kif7 action centres at the primary cilium, an organelle absent from Drosophila. These studies raise interesting questions about the coupling of microtubule trafficking to the Hedgehog pathway.
