The decidual reaction and the formation of new vessels in the uterus are two crucial processes during embryo implantation. Previously, we observed that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) increases cyclooxygenase-2 derived - prostaglandin E2 production during implantation in the rat uterus and that it augments the expression of decidualization (IGFBP-1) and vascularization (IL-10) markers. Both cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) are known enzymes involved in these processes. Thus, we became interested in studying which factors contribute to LPA receptor-specific role during the decidual and the vascular reaction at implantation.

We adopted a pharmacological approach inÂ vitro incubating the uterus from rats on day 5 of gestation (day of implantation) with LPA, DGPP (a highly selective antagonist of LPA3, an LPA receptor) and cyclooxygenase and NOS selective and non-selective inhibitors. We determined NOS activity, prostaglandin E2 production and IGFBP-1 and IL-10 expression to evaluate decidualization and vascularization.

We observed that LPA augmented the activity of the inducible NOS isoform through LPA1/LPA3. Inducible NOS activity participated in the induction of cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E2 increase stimulated by LPA. Also, cyclooxygenase-2 derived prostaglandins mediated LPA-stimulatory action on NOS activity. Both cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible NOS mediated LPA effect on IGFBP-1 and IL-10 expression.

These results suggest the participation of LPA/LPA3 in the production of crucial molecules involved in vascularization and decidualization, two main processes that prepare the uterine milieu for embryo invasion during implantation.
