Despite androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) suppression of prostate cancer (PCa) growth, its overall effects on PCa metastasis remain unclear. Using human (C4-2B/THP1) and mouse (TRAMP-C1/RAW264.7) PCa cells-macrophages co-culture systems, we found currently used anti-androgens, MDV3100 (enzalutamide) or Casodex (bicalutamide), promoted macrophage migration to PCa cells that consequently led to enhanced PCa cell invasion. In contrast, the AR degradation enhancer, ASC-J9, suppressed both macrophage migration and subsequent PCa cell invasion. Mechanism dissection showed that Casodex/MDV3100 reduced the AR-mediated PIAS3 expression and enhanced the pSTAT3-CCL2 pathway. Addition of CCR2 antagonist reversed the Casodex/MDV3100-induced macrophage migration and PCa cell invasion. In contrast, ASC-J9 could regulate pSTAT3-CCL2 signaling using two pathways: an AR-dependent pathway via inhibiting PIAS3 expression and an AR-independent pathway via direct inhibition of the STAT3 phosphorylation/activation. These findings were confirmed in the in vivo mouse model with orthotopically injected TRAMP-C1 cells. Together, these results may raise the potential concern about the currently used ADT with anti-androgens that promotes PCa metastasis and may provide some new and better therapeutic strategies using ASC-J9 alone or a combinational therapy that simultaneously targets androgens/AR signaling and PIAS3-pSTAT3-CCL2 signaling to better battle PCa growth and metastasis at castration-resistant stage.
