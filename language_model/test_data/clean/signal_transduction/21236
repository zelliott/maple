CD40 is a 48 kDa glycoprotein predominantly expressed on B cells in both mouse and man, which interacts with a counterligand (CD40L), expressed on activated CD4+ T cells. CD40/CD40L interactions are now known to be essential for the initiation of antibody responses to T-dependent antigens. In this review we discuss the immunobiology of CD40, with a special emphasis on our own studies in the mouse. These have focused on signal transduction via CD40, the role of cytokines (both T cell-derived and B cell-derived) in CD40-mediated B cell activation, and the role of CD40 in protecting B cells from apoptotic cell death. The available data indicate clearly that this protein is a pivotal receptor on B cells, both for the delivery of activating signals and for promoting B cell survival.
