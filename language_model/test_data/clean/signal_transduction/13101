The sense of smell is mediated by the initiation of action potential in olfactory sensory neurons during odor stimulation. However, little is known about odorant-olfactory receptor (OR) recognition mechanisms. In the present work, we identified the structural motifs of odorant molecules required to activate mouse OR912-93 by detection of the odorant response using calcium measurement in cells transfected with OR and G(alpha)q and G(alpha)15 proteins. The use of sets of odorants led to the identification of ketones with an aliphatic carbon chain length >or= four carbon atoms and a carbonyl group preferentially located in position C2 or C3. The threshold of detection of these odorants is as low as 10(-6)-10(-8)m. No other odorant ligand, out of 70 representatives of the odorant world, was active. The human ortholog of OR912-93 is not functional, suggesting that apart from a stop-mutation located at the 5'-end that was corrected in the construct, it incurred other deleterious mutations during evolution.
