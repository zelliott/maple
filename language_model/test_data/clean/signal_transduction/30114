IA-2 (insulinoma-associated protein 2), a major autoantigen in type 1 diabetes, is a receptor-tyrosine phosphatase-like protein associated with the membrane of secretory granules of neural and endocrine-specific cells. Loss of IA-2 activity in the mouse results in reduced insulin release and additional phenotypes, consistent with a general effect on neurosecretion and hormone release. To gain further insight into the cellular mechanisms of IA-2 function, we have studied the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog, CeIA-2 encoded by the ida-1 gene. Using two independent putative null alleles of ida-1, we demonstrate that animals lacking CeIA-2 activity are viable and exhibit subtle defects. Genetic studies of mutants in ida-1 and several genes involved in neurosecretory vesicle cargo release and signaling highlight two roles for CeIA-2. First, CeIA-2 has a specific and novel genetic interaction with UNC-31/CAPS, a protein that has been shown in other systems to regulate dense-core vesicle cargo release. Second, loss of CeIA-2 activity enhances weak alleles in the insulin-like signaling pathway. These results suggest that CeIA-2 may be an important factor in dense-core vesicle cargo release with parallels to insulin signaling in mammals.
