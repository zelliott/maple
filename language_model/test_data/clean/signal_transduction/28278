Rho GTPases control signal transduction pathways that link cell surface receptors to a variety of intracellular responses. They are best known as regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, but in addition they control cell polarity, gene expression, microtubule dynamics and vesicular trafficking. Through these diverse functions, Rho GTPases influence many aspects of cell behavior. This review will focus specifically on their role in cell migration.
