Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of enzymes that play a ubiquitous role in intracellular signal transduction. Our understanding of the precise role of PKC has evolved considerably as a result of improved methodology and a better understanding of the signal transduction pathways. A number of primary pathways previously attributed to PKC have been re-examined and found to involve other kinases as our understanding of the PKC isozymes has evolved. PKC isozymes appear to play distinct, and in some cases opposing roles in the transduction of intracellular signals. The development of potent and selective PKC inhibitors, including isozyme-selective inhibitors, has opened new avenues for biochemical and pharmaceutical studies. The role of PKC in some of the pathways relevant to cardiovascular, peripheral microvascular, CNS, oncology, immune and infectious disease states are surveyed. A survey of the current generation of potent and selective ATP-competitive inhibitors is provided. The progress of PKC inhibitors currently in clinical development, including LY333531, ISIS 3521 (CGP 64128A), bryostatin 1, GF109203x, Ro 32-0432 and Ro 31-8220, Go 6976 and Go 7611, CPR 1006, and balanol (SPC 100840) are discussed.
