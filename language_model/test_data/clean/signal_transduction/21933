We have shown that thyroglobulin (Tg) is a potent autocrine regulator of thyroid-specific gene expression, and proposed that the accumulated follicular Tg within the colloid is a major factor in determining follicular function. In the present report, we examined the effect of Tg on the action of TSH/cAMP and iodine with special focus on the regulation of basolateral and apical iodide transporters; the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) and the pendred syndrome gene (PDS) by Tg. We show that expression of NIS and PDS are differentially regulated by Tg concentration and exposure time. In addition, we found that PDS gene was induced by TSH/cAMP and iodide in the presence of Tg. Based on these results, we propose a model for the physiological turnover of follicular function that is dynamically regulated by Tg.
