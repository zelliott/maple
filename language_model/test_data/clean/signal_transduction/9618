Nephrotoxicity is one of the important dose-limiting factors during cisplatin treatment. There is a growing body of evidence that activation of p53 has a critical role in cisplatin-induced renal apoptotic injury. The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1 decreases apoptosis through deacetylating of p53, and resveratrol is known as an activator of SIRT1. To study the role of SIRT1 in cisplatin-induced renal injury through interaction with p53, mouse proximal tubular cells (MPT) were treated with cisplatin and examined the expression level of SIRT1, acetylation of p53, PUMA-α, Bax, the cytosolic/mitochondrial cytochrome c ratio, and active caspase-3. The expression of SIRT1 was decreased by cisplatin. Resveratrol, a SIRT1 activator, ameliorated cisplatin-induced acetylation of p53, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity in MPT cells. In addition, resveratrol remarkably blocked cisplatin-induced decrease of Bcl-xL in MPT cells. Further specific SIRT1 inhibition with EX 527 or small interference RNA specific to SIRT1 reversed the effect of resveratrol on cisplatin-induced toxicity. Inhibition of p53 by pifithrin-α reversed the effect of EX527 in protein expression of PUMA-α, Bcl-xL, and caspase-3 and cytotoxicity in MPT cells. SIRT1 protein expression after cisplatin treatment was significantly decreased in the kidney. SIRT1 activation by resveratrol decreased cisplatin-induced apoptosis while improving the glomerular filtration rate. Taken together, our findings suggest that the modulation of p53 by SIRT1 could be a possible target to attenuate cisplatin-induced kidney injury.
