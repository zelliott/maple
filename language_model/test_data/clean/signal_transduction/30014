Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in all mammalian cells as a result of norman cellular metabolism and due to the activation of oxidant-producing enzymes in response to exogenous stimuli. The balance between ROS production and antioxidant defenses determines the degree of oxidative stress. Generation of ROS has been associated with cell signaling, stress responses, cell proliferation, aging and cancer development. The ability of ROS to induce cellular damage and to cause cell death opens the possibility to exploit this property in the treatment of cancer through a fee radical-mediated mechanism.
