High energy intake and excessive body fatness impair mammogenesis in prepubertal ruminants. High energy intake and excessive fatness also increase serum leptin. Our objective was to determine if an infusion of leptin decreases proliferation of mammary epithelial cells of prepubertal heifers in vivo. Ovine leptin at 100 microg/ quarter per d with or without 10 microg of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I was infused via the teat canal into mammary glands of prepubertal dairy heifers; contralateral quarters were used as controls. After 7 d of treatment, bromodeoxyuridine was infused intravenously and heifers were slaughtered approximately 2 h later. Tissue from 3 regions of the mammary parenchyma was collected and immunostained for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Ki-67), and caspase-3. Leptin decreased the number of mammary epithelial cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle by 48% in IGF-I-treated quarters and by 19% in saline-treated quarters. Leptin did not alter the number of mammary epithelial cells within the cell cycle, as indicated by Ki-67 labeling. Caspase-3 immunostaining within the mammary parenchyma was very low in these heifers, but leptin significantly increased labeling in saline-treated quarters. Leptin enhanced SOCS-3 expression in IGF-I-treated quarters but did not alter SOCS-1 or SOCS-5 expression. We conclude that a high concentration of leptin in the bovine mammary gland reduces proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. The reduced proliferation is accompanied by an increase in SOCS-3 expression, suggesting a possible mechanism for leptin inhibition of IGF-I action. Whether leptin might be a physiological regulator of mammogenesis remains to be determined.
