Angiotensin II (ANG II), acting through angiotensin type I (AT(1)) receptors on apical and basolateral surfaces of proximal tubule epithelial cells, increases sodium reabsorption in proximal tubules. Apical and basolateral receptors internalize after exposure to ANG II, but the role of internalization in receptor signaling and transport is not well defined. To determine the role of receptor internalization in ANG II-mediated receptor signaling and sodium transport, we stably expressed full-length and truncated AT(1A) receptors in opossum kidney cells. After stimulation with ANG II, wild-type receptors on apical and basolateral surfaces rapidly internalized, inhibited adenylate cyclase, and increased transcellular sodium transport. Truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of the AT(1A) receptor (TL314) resulted in receptors that were expressed on apical and basolateral surfaces but did not internalize, inhibit adenylate cyclase, or increase sodium transport. Because the cytoplasmic tail contains putative G protein coupling sites, mutant receptors that leave G protein interaction sites intact were designed. Cells expressing the truncation (TK333) or deletion (Del 315-329) also failed to internalize. When ANG II was added to basolateral surfaces of TK333 or Del 315-329, adenylate cyclase activity was inhibited and sodium transport was increased. In contrast, apical addition of ANG II was not associated with decreases in adenylate cyclase or increases in sodium transport. In conclusion, internalization pathways are important for AT(1A) receptor function in polarized proximal tubule epithelial cells. Apical AT(1A) receptors internalize before they interact with G proteins and signal cAMP. In contrast, basolateral AT(1A) receptors interact with G proteins and signal cAMP without internalizing.
