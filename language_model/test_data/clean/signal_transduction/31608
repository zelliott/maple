FSH is known to activate Gs/cAMP signaling pathway in Sertoli cells (SCs) to support spermatogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism of FSH-induced Gs/cAMP-independent Ca2+-influx in SCs is not clear. In this study, FSH indeed induced an immediate and dose-dependent intracellular Ca2+-elevation in rat SCs. In the presence of EDTA (2.5 mm) or in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the FSH-induced intracellular Ca2+-elevation was abolished. The confocal microscopic observation of Ca2+ image revealed that the SC cellular Ca2+ level was gradually increased after 50 sec of FSH treatment. Dantrolene, a blocker of intracellular Ca2+ release, did not affect this FSH-induced intracellular Ca2+ elevation. The pretreatment of rat SCs with phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PLC)-specific inhibitor, U73122 (3 and 10 microm), inhibited the FSH-induced Ca2+-influx in a dose-dependent manner, but treatment with Gs-specific inhibitor, NF449 (0.1 and 0.3 microm), did not. On the other hand, the activation of G alpha h was immediately induced by FSH in the rat SCs within 5 sec of treatment. The translocation of PLC-delta1 from cytosol to cell membrane and the formation of G alpha h /PLC-delta1 complexes occurred within 5 and 10 sec, respectively, of FSH exposure. The intracellular inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) production was also detected after 30 sec of FSH treatment. The synthetic peptide of PLC-delta1 (TIPWNSLKQGYRHVHLL), not Gs inhibitor, predominantly inhibited the FSH-induced PLC-delta1 translocation, formation of G alpha h /PLC-delta1 complex, intracellular IP3 production, and Ca2+ influx. In contrast, the peptide did not interfere with FSH-induced intracellular cAMP accumulation. In conclusion, the FSH-induced immediate Ca2+ influx is unambiguously mediated by an alternative G alpha h /PLC-delta1/IP3 pathway that is distinct from the Gs/cAMP pathway in rat SCs.
