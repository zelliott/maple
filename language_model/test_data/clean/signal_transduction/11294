Growth factor receptors of the tyrosine kinase family regulate proliferation of a variety of cell types. In some human cancers, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands often are overexpressed, leading to both constitutive and autocrine activation. Intracellular signaling via this receptor takes place through several mechanisms of action, including activation of ras and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Our previous studies have shown that human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines overexpress EGFR and do not increase proliferation in response to exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF). The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) has been used as a chemotherapeutic drug in the treatment of SCC. RA decreases proliferation of SCC lines, in part owing to inhibition of EGFR expression. However, we previously found that treatment of SCC lines with inhibitory doses of RA sensitized cells to the proliferative effects of EGF. We now present a mechanism of action for this effect. RA inhibited expression of EGFR and proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway. Expression of these molecules returned to basal levels within 24 h after RA withdrawal. RA also inhibited autocrine secretion of EGF, which returned to basal levels with slower kinetics. During this time, addition of exogenous EGF stimulated mitosis in SCC lines. These data suggested that signaling proteins downstream of overexpressed EGFR may have limited the mitotic response in SCC lines. In support of this hypothesis, overexpression of the EGFR adaptor protein Grb2 increased cell proliferation and restored EGF-induced mitosis.
