Protein kinase CK2 is one of the most conserved kinases in eukaryotic cells and plays essential roles in diverse processes. While we know that CK2 plays a role(s) in cell division, our understanding of how CK2 regulates cell cycle progression is limited. In this study, we revealed a regulatory role for CK2 in kinetochore function. The kinetochore is a multi-protein complex that assembles on the centromere of a chromosome and functions to attach chromosomes to spindle microtubules. To faithfully segregate chromosomes and maintain genomic integrity, the kinetochore is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms, including phosphorylation by Aurora B kinase. We found that a loss of CK2 kinase activity inhibits anaphase spindle elongation and results in chromosome missegregation. Moreover, a lack of CK2 activates the spindle assembly checkpoint. We demonstrate that CK2 associates with Mif2, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of human CENP-C, which serves as an important link between the inner and outer kinetochore. Furthermore, we show Mif2 and the inner kinetochore protein Ndc10 are phosphorylated by CK2, and this phosphorylation plays antagonistic and synergistic roles with Aurora B phosphorylation of these targets, respectively.
