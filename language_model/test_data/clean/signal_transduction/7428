Overexpression of transcription factors runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) and nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2 (NF-E2) was reported in granulocytes of patients with polycythemia vera and other myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Further, a transgenic mouse overexpressing the NF-E2 transgene was reported to be a model of MPN. We hypothesized that increased transcripts of RUNX1 and NF-E2 might characterize other polycythemic states with primary polycythemic features, that is, those with exaggerated erythropoiesis due to augmented erythropoietin (EPO) sensitivity. We tested the expression of RUNX1 and NF-E2 in polycythemic patients of diverse phenotypes and molecular causes. We report that RUNX1 and NF-E2 overexpression is not specific for MPN; these transcripts were also significantly elevated in polycythemias with augmented hypoxia-inducible factor activity whose erythroid progenitors were hypersensitive to EPO. RUNX1 and NF-E2 overexpression was not detected in patients with EPO receptor (EPOR) gain-of-function, suggesting distinct mechanisms by which erythroid progenitors in polycythemias with defects of hypoxia sensing and EPOR mutations exert their EPO hypersensitivity.
