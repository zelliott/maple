Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) negatively regulates the Raf/MEK/ERK and NF-κB pathway. The role of RKIP in rheumatoid FLS is unknown. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the function of RKIP in rheumatoid FLS. Rheumatoid FLS were transfected with either RKIP-expressing plasmids or RKIP small interfering RNA (siRNA). RKIP protein was detected in rheumatoid synovial tissue (ST) and FLS. RKIP overexpression significantly decreased IL-6 mRNA expression in TNF-α-stimulated rheumatoid FLS. RKIP overexpression also showed a decreased trend in IL-8, MMP-1, and MMP-3 mRNA expression in TNF-α-stimulated rheumatoid FLS. RKIP silencing resulted in significantly increased MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA expression in TNF-α-stimulated rheumatoid FLS. RKIP silencing also increased IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression in TNF-α-stimulated rheumatoid FLS, but this increase did not reach statistical significance. TNF-α-induced ERK and NF-κB activation was suppressed in FLS with RKIP overexpression. RKIP silencing resulted in a significantly higher invasion index in TNF-α-stimulated rheumatoid FLS compared to controls. These results suggest that RKIP might be a potential therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis.
