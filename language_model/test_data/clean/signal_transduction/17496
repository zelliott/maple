Mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria impaired neutrophil functions, e.g. chemiluminescence response, and leukotriene formation to a significantly higher degree as compared to nonmucoid P. aeruginosa bacteria. To study the cell biological requirements for the different cellular response pattern by mucoid and nonmucoid (NM) P. aeruginosa bacteria, further experiments were performed with purified alginate, the mucoid exopolysaccharide of P. aeruginosa (MEP). In this regard the MEP (alginate) significantly reduced the zymosan-induced leukotriene B4 (LTB4) formation (from 40 +/- 7 to 2 +/- 4 ng). The chemiluminescence response induced by NM bacteria was abolished when the bacteria were precoated with the MEP. Mucoid and NM P. aeruginosa bacteria interacted with components of the cellular signal transduction pathway to a different degree. Mucoid bacteria induced a 2-fold enhanced GTPase activity but activated the protein kinase C (PKC) to a lesser degree than NM P. aeruginosa bacteria. Prior exposure of neutrophils to the MEP increased the sodium fluoride (NaF)-induced GTPase activity and guanylylimidodiphosphate binding [Gpp(NH)p] by approximately 60 and 30%, respectively. The phorbol myristic acid-induced PKC activation was inhibited by 30-40% in the presence of the MEP. However, the MEP by itself was inactive in all assay systems. Our results indicate that the MEP represents an important component which modulates neutrophil responses of mucoid as compared to NM P. aeruginosa bacteria, e.g. the chemiluminescence response, LTB4 generation, and the interaction with components (G proteins, PKC) of the signal transduction pathway.
