The SAGA complex is a conserved, multifunctional co-activator that controls the transcription of many inducible genes in response to environmental changes. Recent studies have provided new insights into the functions of one of its subunits, Tra1/TRRAP, and suggest that it controls SAGA activity in response to external stimuli.
