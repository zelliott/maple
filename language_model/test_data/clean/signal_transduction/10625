Surface and intracellular staining coupled with flow cytometric analysis was used to show for the first time that human macrophages and a minor subset of peripheral blood monocytes have an internal pool of CD16A, which is mobilized and shed during Fc receptor for immunoglobulin G-mediated phagocytosis. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro led to a reduction in the phagocytosis-induced up-regulation in CD16A shedding. These results suggest that monocytes and macrophages may be a source of soluble CD16A, which is elevated in the serum of patients in a variety of disease states and that the mobilization and shedding of CD16A in response to phagocytosis are disrupted by HIV-1 infection.
