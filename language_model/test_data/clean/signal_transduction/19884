Microbe-associated molecular patterns are recognized by Toll-like receptors of the innate immune system. This recognition enables a rapid response to potential pathogens but does not clearly provide a way for the innate immune system to discriminate between virulent and avirulent microbes. We find that pulmonary infection of mice with type 3 translocation-competent Pseudomonas aeruginosa triggers a rapid inflammatory response, while infection with isogenic translocation-deficient mutants does not. Discrimination between translocon-positive and -negative bacteria requires caspase-1 activity in bone marrow-derived cells and interleukin-1 receptor signaling. Thus, the activation of caspase-1 by bacteria expressing type 3 secretion systems allows for rapid recognition of bacteria expressing conserved functions associated with virulence.
