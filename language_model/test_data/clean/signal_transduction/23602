In a previous study, vaccination with a live bivalent vaccine consisting of herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) and SB-1 was found to be associated with distinct cytokine expression patterns and the modulation of cytokine responses in the spleen. This vaccine could play a role in mediating protection against infection with the RB1B strain of Marek's disease virus. In the present study, vectors for chicken Toll-like receptor 1 (chTLR1) and 2 (chTLR2) expression were constructed and transfected into Vero cells. Nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cell (NF-kappaB) activation was detected after HVT infection. Compared with normal Vero cells, NF-kappaB activation was significantly inhibited by HVT in Vero cells transfected with chTLR1-1, chTLR1-2, or both. The results demonstrate the significant characteristics of HVT in activating TLR2 signaling. chTLR1 plays a key role in TLR2 subfamily-mediated NF-kappaB inhibition after HVT infection.
