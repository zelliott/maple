Interferons (IFNs) induce a 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A)-dependent ribonuclease L (RNase L) following virus-infection of mammalian cells. RNase L degrades both viral and cellular RNAs and restricts virus-proliferation. We have studied organization of RNase L gene in genomic DNA from the mouse liver by Southern blot analysis. Several BamHI, BglII, EcoRI, HincII, HindIII, NcoI, PstI, SacI, and XbaI restriction fragments hybridized to (32)P-labeled mouse RNase L cDNA and the 5'-proximal exon probes. Mouse RNase L gene exists as a single copy (>16 kb DNA) gene. A 5 kb HindIII and a 2.5 kb EcoRI DNA were detected as 5'-upstream DNA of the gene which may contain mouse RNase L promoter. Our results will help studying mouse RNase L gene promoter in further details.
