Global ablation of INSL3 hormone or its receptor RXFP2 in male mice results in cryptorchidism and infertility. Using novel LacZ knock-in Rxfp2 allele we demonstrated a strong expression of this gene in postmeiotic germ cells. RXFP2 was expressed in embryonic and neonatal gubernaculum. No RXFP2 expression was detected in cremaster muscles in adult mice. We produced a floxed allele of Rxfp2 and then deleted this gene in male germ cells in testes located in normal scrotal position. No differences in fertility or spermatogenesis of such males were found, suggesting non-essential role of INSL3 signaling in germ cell differentiation in adult males. We have also produced shRNA transgenic mice with reduced RXFP2 expression Such males manifested various degree of uni- and bilateral cryptorchidism. Total gene expression analysis of the mutant cremasteric sacs indicated misexpression of a significant number of genes in Wnt/beta-catenin and NOTCH pathways. Conditional deletion of beta-catenin or Notch1 genes in male gubernacular ligament resulted in its abnormal development. Our data suggest that beta-catenin and NOTCH1 pathways are potential targets of INSL3 signaling during gubernacular development.
