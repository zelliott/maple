We investigated the expression of Fas antigen (CD95) in the pure erythroid cell line AS-E2 in the presence and absence of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha induced apoptosis in AS-E2 cells, whereas IFN-gamma did not. In culture containing no IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha, AS-E2 cells expressed little Fas antigen. However, IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha both induced expression of Fas antigen and its mRNA within 24 hours after the stimulation. When anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (IgM) was added to AS-E2 cells after the induction of Fas expression, AS-E2 cells underwent apoptosis as shown by the induction of DNA fragmentation. This apoptotic change was inhibited by an inhibitor of caspase-3-like proteases (Ac-DEVD-CHO) and an inhibitor of CED-3/ICE family proteases (Z-Asp-CH2-DCB) but not by an inhibitor of caspase-1-like proteases (Ac-YVAD-CHO), suggesting a role for caspase-3-like proteases in Fas-receptor signaling. Although AS-E2 cells expressed Fas ligand mRNA, treatment with ZB4, an antibody that inhibits Fas-mediated cell death, failed to suppress IFN-gamma- or TNF-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that the late erythroid progenitor cells are negatively regulated by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, both of which are capable of inducing functional Fas expression.
