Proteins that terminate with a consensus sequence known as CAAX undergo a series of posttranslational modifications that include polyisoprenylation, endoproteolysis, and carboxyl methylation. These modifications render otherwise hydrophilic proteins hydrophobic at their C termini such that they associate with membranes. Whereas prenylation occurs in the cytosol, postprenylation processing is accomplished on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Among the numerous CAAX proteins encoded in mammalian genomes are many signaling molecules such as monomeric GTPases, including the Ras proteins that play an important role in cancer. In the course of their processing, nascent Ras proteins traffic from their site of synthesis in the cytosol to the endomembrane and then out to the plasma membrane (PM) by at least two pathways. Recently, retrograde pathways have been discovered that deliver mature Ras from the PM back to the Golgi. The Golgi has been identified as a platform upon which Ras can signal. Thus, the subcellular trafficking of Ras proteins has the potential to increase the complexity of Ras signaling by adding a spatial dimension. The complexity of Ras trafficking also affords a wider array of potential targets for the discovery of drugs that might inhibit tumors by interfering with Ras trafficking.
