The idiopathic erythrocytosis (IE) group of disorders is defined by an absolute increase in red cell mass and hematocrit without elevation of the megakaryocytic or granulocytic lineages. It is associated with a wide range of serum erythropoietin (Epo) levels and broadly falls into groups of raised/inappropriately normal or low/undetectable Epo levels. A spectrum of molecular defects has been described in association with IE, which reflects the heterogeneity of this disorder. To date the most common identified cause of IE has been mutations in the von Hippel Landau (VHL) protein, which results in aberrant oxygen sensing and dysregulated Epo production. Studying the molecular basis of IE will provide insights into the control of Epo synthesis and Epo-induced signaling pathways.
