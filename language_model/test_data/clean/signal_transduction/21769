To elucidate the roles of JAK/STATs signal pathway on anti-proliferative effects induced by IFN-alpha in MHCC97.

An IRF9 expression vector was transfected into MHCC97 with Dosper. The expression of IRF9, cycle regulating proteins and the forming of ISGF3 complex were detected using Western blot and EMSA, respectively. Cell proliferation and distribution were monitored using MTT and flow cytometry.

High expression of IRF9 restored the anti-proliferative response of MHCC97 on IFN-alpha treatment and delayed the cell transition from S phase to G2 phase induced by IFN-alpha.

The integrity and functions of JAK/STATs signal pathway played an important role in mediating the anti-proliferative effects of IFN-alpha in MHCC97.
