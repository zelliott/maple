In this study, we have investigated the expression of inhibin subunits and activin receptors (ActRs) in normal and malignant ovarian cells. Each product of the inhibin subunits (alpha, betaa, betab) and activin receptors (ActRs) amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were detected as a single band in human granulosa cells, surface epithelial cells (OSE), and the ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR 3 and SKOV 3. Western blot analysis was performed using polyclonal antibodies against ActR IIa or IIb peptides based on 13 COOH-terminal amino acids; cultured human granulosa cells were used as a positive control. Using ActR IIa antibody, one major band corresponding to approximately 80 kDa and one minor band corresponding to 105 kDa were observed in the samples. One single band at approximately 60 kDa was detected in OVCAR 3 and a 50 kDa band was detected with ActR IIb antibody in cultured granulosa cell, OSE and SKOV 3. Although no detectable change was induced in Smad 4 mRNA in OVCAR 3, Smad 2 mRNA levels were increased during 48 h treatment with activin A (50 ng ml(-1)). These data provide a better understanding as the first step in the mechanism of action of the activin in the epithelial ovarian carcinoma.
