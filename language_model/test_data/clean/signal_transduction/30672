Tara was identified as an interacting partner of guanine nucleotide exchange factor Trio and TRF1. Tara is proposed to be involved in many important fundamental cellular processes, ranging from actin remodeling, directed cell movement, to cell cycle regulation. Yet, its exact roles required further elucidation. Here, we identify a novel Tara-binding protein HECTD3, a putative member of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases. HECTD3 directly binds Tara in vitro and forms a complex with Tara in vivo. Overexpression of HECTD3 enhances the ubiquitination of Tara in vivo and promotes the turnover of Tara, whereas depletion of HECTD3 by small interfering RNA decreases Tara degradation. Furthermore, depletion of HECTD3 leads to multipolar spindle formation. All these findings suggest that HECTD3 may facilitate cell cycle progression via regulating ubiquitination and degradation of Tara.
