Fluo-3, one member of a family of new fluorescent Ca2+ indicators excitable at wavelengths in the visible (Minta, A., Kao, J. P. Y., and Tsien, R. Y. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8171-8178), has been tested in living cells. We demonstrate that fluo-3 can be loaded into fibroblasts and lymphocytes by incubation with the pentaacetoxymethyl ester of the dye and that the ester is hydrolyzed intracellularly to yield genuine fluo-3 capable of indicating changes in [Ca2+]i induced by agonist stimulation. Fluo-3 can also be microinjected into fibroblasts along with photolabile compounds such as nitr-5 and caged inositol trisphosphate for photorelease experiments. Fluo-3 permits continuous monitoring of [Ca2+]i without interference with use of UV-sensitive caged compounds. A procedure for combined use of ionophore and heavy metal ions in end-of-experiment calibration of fluo-3 intensities to give [Ca2+]i is also described.
