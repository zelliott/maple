Estradiol (E(2)) exerts not only genotropic but also nongenomic actions through nuclear estrogen receptors (ER). Here, we provide a novel paradigm for nongenomic E(2) signaling independent of nuclear ER. E(2) induces a rapid rise in the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) through membrane estrogen receptors in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. This E(2)-induced Ca(2+) signaling is not prevented by different ER blockers and cannot directly activate stably transfected c-fos promoter or the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38, ERK1/2, and SAPK/JNK, or NO production. However, the E(2)-induced rise in [Ca(2+)](i) specifically down-regulates the serum-stimulated activation of c-fos promoter and ERK1/2, and conversely, it specifically up-regulates lipopolysaccharide-stimulated activation of c-fos promoter, p38, and NO production. The E(2)-changed activation of c-fos promoter can be prevented by an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator. Our data indicate that E(2)-induced nongenomic Ca(2+) signaling through membrane ER is able to specifically modulate genotropic signaling pathways with impact on macrophage activation.
