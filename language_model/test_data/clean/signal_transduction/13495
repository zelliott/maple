The breakdown of inositol phospholipids is an important transmembrane signalling system that is composed of two kinds of signals: the diacylglycerol-protein kinase C signal, and the inositol trisphosphate-Ca2+ signal. Using membrane-permeable diacylglycerol, I-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), and calcium ionophore, A-23187, the effects of these chemicals on the epidermal adenylate cyclase system were investigated. OAG increased forskolin- and cholera toxin-induced cyclic AMP accumulations, but receptor adenylate cyclase responses were markedly decreased by treatment with OAG. The effects of OAG were inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7. Calcium ionophore, A-23187, had no effect on the epidermal adenylate cyclase responses. Combinations of OAG and A-23187 (as well as the calcium chelator, EGTA), showed that the action of OAG was mostly unaffected by the modulation of intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. The results suggest that among the signals triggered by the breakdown of inositol phospholipids, only diacylglycerol-protein kinase C signal is involved in the regulation of the epidermal adenylate cyclase system.
