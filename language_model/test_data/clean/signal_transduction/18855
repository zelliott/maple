The review outlines the presence and function of TGF-beta and PDGF family members in invertebrates. TGF-beta and PDGF play an important role in development, in immune and neuroendocrine responses and in the wound repair by activating the classical transduction pathways. Generally speaking, these cytokines appear very early in evolution and conserve their functions.
