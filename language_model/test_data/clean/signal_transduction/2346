In the present study, the effects of extracellular magnesium concentration ([Mg2+]ex) on stimulus-secretion coupling processes were investigated in rat gastric parietal cells in vitro. Extracellular magnesium reduction resulted in (1) an increase of basal intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]in), (2) an enhancement of both carbachol and thapsigargin-induced calcium responses, (3) an improved filling state of intracellular calcium stores, (4) an increase of both basal and carbachol-induced acid secretion, whereas intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclicAMP) levels and histamine stimulated acid secretion were not affected. The effects of high [Mg2+]ex were opposite to the described results, except that high [Mg2+]ex was able to decrease significantly histamine-stimulated cyclicAMP levels and acid secretion. These findings indicate a modulatory role of [Mg2+]ex on the intracellular signalling processes and acid secretory properties in rat parietal cells. These effects seemed to be mediated by regulating (1) calcium loading capacity of intracellular stores, (2) the permeability of the calcium influx pathway, and (3) the formation of cyclicAMP.
