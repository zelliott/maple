Aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) in a mast cell line resulted in activation of the p42 and the stress-activated p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Selective inhibition of these respective kinases with PD 098059 and SB 203580 indicated that p42 MAP kinase, but not p38 MAP kinase, contributed to the production of the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and the release of arachidonic acid in these cells. Neither kinase, however, was essential for FcepsilonRI-mediated degranulation or constitutive production of tumor growth factor-beta. Studies with SB 203580 and the p38 MAP kinase activator anisomycin also revealed that p38 MAP kinase negatively regulated activation of p42 MAP kinase and the responses mediated by this kinase.
