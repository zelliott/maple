Retinoic acid (RA) is known to cause MAPK signaling which propels G0 arrest and myeloid differentiation of HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells. The present studies show that RA up-regulated expression of SLP-76 (Src-homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte-specific phospho-protein of 76 kDa), which became a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in RA-treated cells. SLP-76 is a known adaptor molecule associated with T-cell receptor and MAPK signaling. To characterize functional effects of SLP-76 expression in RA-induced differentiation and G0 arrest, HL-60 cells were stably transfected with SLP-76. Expression of SLP-76 had no discernable effect on RA-induced ERK activation, subsequent functional differentiation, or the rate of RA-induced G0 arrest. To determine the effects of SLP-76 in the presence of a RA-regulated receptor, SLP-76 was stably transfected into HL-60 cells already overexpressing the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor, c-FMS, from a previous stable transfection. SLP-76 now enhanced RA-induced ERK activation, compared to parental c-FMS transfectants. It also enhanced RA-induced differentiation, evidenced by enhanced paxillin expression, inducible oxidative metabolism and superoxide production. RA-induced RB tumor suppressor protein hypophosphorylation was also enhanced, as was RA-induced G0 cell cycle arrest. A triple Y to F mutant SLP-76 known to be a dominant negative in T-cell receptor signaling failed to enhance RA-induced paxillin expression, but enhanced RA-induced ERK activation, differentiation and G0 arrest essentially as well as wild-type SLP-76. Thus, SLP-76 overexpression in the presence of c-FMS, a RA-induced receptor, had the effect of enhancing RA-induced cell differentiation. This is the first indication to our knowledge that RA induces the expression of an adapter molecule to facilitate induced differentiation via co-operation between c-FMS and SLP-76.
