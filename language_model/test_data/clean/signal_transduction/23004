Whether memory B cells possess altered differentiative potentials and respond in a qualitatively distinct fashion to extrinsic signals as compared with their naive precursors is a current subject of debate. We have investigated this issue by examining the participation of a predominant anti-arsonate clonotype in the primary and secondary responses in the spleens of A/J mice. While this clonotype gives rise to few Ab-forming cells (AFC) in the primary response, shortly after secondary immunization its memory cell progeny produce a massive splenic IgG AFC response, largely in the red pulp. Extensive clonal expansion and migration take place during the secondary AFC response but Ab V region somatic hypermutation is not reinduced. The primary and secondary germinal center (GC) responses of this clonotype are both characterized by ongoing V gene hypermutation and phenotypic selection, little or no inter-GC migration, and derivation of multiple, spatially distinct GCs from a single progenitor. However, the kinetics of these responses differ, with V genes containing a high frequency of total as well as affinity-enhancing mutations appearing rapidly in secondary GCs, suggesting either recruitment of memory cells into this response, or accelerated rates of hypermutation and selection. In contrast, the frequency of mutation observed per V gene does not increase monotonically during the primary GC response of this clonotype, suggesting ongoing emigration of B cells that have sustained affinity- and specificity-enhancing mutations.
