1. The present study investigates whether chemical sympathectomy compromises the relaxation of the rabbit femoral artery precontracted with serotonin. The vasodilating agents promoted cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation or opening of the potassium channels. The effect of denervation on the adenylyl cyclase transduction pathway was also studied. 2. 6-Hydroxydopamine treatment did not impair the relaxation to adenosine, 8-bromoadenosine-cAMP (a membrane-permeable analog of cAMP) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor). Moreover, denervation enhanced the relaxation to forskolin (a direct Gs-type protein activator) and pinacidil (a potassium channel opener). 3. Denervation modified neither adenosine diphosphate ribosylation of Gs- and Gi-proteins nor adenylyl cyclase activity.
