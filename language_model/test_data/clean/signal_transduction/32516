We have investigated the dynamics between free fibronectin receptors and clusters of them organized into adhesion plaques on CHO cells using the ability of these free integrins to be endocytosed and recycled to the plasma membrane. Indirect inhibition of the endocytic cycle by monensin resulted in the subsequent internalization of free receptors, which we followed by indirect immunostaining and confocal microscopy. Consequently, all the adhesive structures that were in equilibrium with free integrins became progressively disorganized. The cellular morphological changes were analyzed and correlated with the distribution of cell-substratum contacts viewed by confocal images obtained after immunostaining with antibodies raised against the fibronectin receptor, talin, vinculin and actin. After cell adhesion to fibronectin, blockage of the endocytic cycle induced disruption of the adhesion plaques that were mainly localized at the cell periphery, and disappearance of the stress fibers. However, the cells remained firmly attached to the substratum through focal contacts localized in the central part of the cell. These central focal contacts, but not the peripheral adhesion plaques, could form when the vesicular traffic was blocked prior to adhesion and they allowed the cells to attach and flatten onto the substratum. Whereas both adhesive structures contained the same receptors linked to talin and vinculin, the central adhesive structures were attached to a short stretch of actin but never permitted the organization of stress fibers.
