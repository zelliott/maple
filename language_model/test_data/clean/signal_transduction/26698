To investigate whether S. aureus could activate NF-κB signaling pathway in human osteoblasts.

Immunoblot and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were used to detect the degradation of I-κBα and activation of NF-κB in human osteoblasts following infection with S.aureus, respectively, and there were investigated the activated state of NF-κB signaling pathway in human osteoblasts. In addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the secretion of IL-6 in culture supernatants, which was represented as one of important cytokines in osteomyelitis, and an inhibitor of NF-κB, SN50, which was added to human osteoblasts culture prior to 1 hour at 50 µmol/L before the infection of S.aureus, was used to determine whether S.aureus-activated NF-κB signaling pathway regulates IL-6 secretion of human osteoblasts.

S.aureus could induce the degradation of I-κBα (I-κBα(15 min)/I-κBα(0 min) = 0.409 ± 0.245 and I-κBα(30 min)/I-κBα(0 min) = 0.061 ± 0.010) and activation of NF-κB in human osteoblasts in a time and dose-dependent manner following infection. In addition, the secretion of IL-6 in the supernatants of human osteoblasts ((2.17 ± 0.11) µg/L) was suppressed by 50 µmol/L SN50 compared to without the addition of SN50 ((3.58 ± 0.31) µg/L) (F = 174.25, P < 0.05).

S.aureus could activate NF-κB signaling pathway in human osteoblasts, which could regulate cytokines secretions of human osteoblasts.
