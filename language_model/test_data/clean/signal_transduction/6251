Cumulative evidence suggests that apoptosis plays a pivotal role in neuronal death after cerebral ischemia in various experimental animal models. The time-dependent molecular and biochemical sequelae that lead to apoptotic cell death after the interruption of cerebral blood flow have been established. Many neuroprotective agents that target cell death pathways have been failures, and alternative strategies need to be considered. One such strategy is to target the neuronal survival signaling pathway, which involves the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt (protein kinase B) pathway. It has been demonstrated that PI3-K/Akt and downstream phosphorylated Bad and proline-rich Akt substrate survival signaling cascades are upregulated in surviving neurons in the ischemic brain that overexpresses copper-zinc superoxide dismutase activity. These studies provide an impetus for novel therapeutic targets in neuroprotective strategies in stroke.
