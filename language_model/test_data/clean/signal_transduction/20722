There are conflicting data about the effect of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) on protein kinase C (PKC) enzyme activity. The aim of our study was to find out which type of phospholipids [phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate PI4,5P2 or the other phospholipids-phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidic acid (PA)] could be the source of 1,2-diacylglycerol (1,2-DAG) in PKC activation. In colon carcinoma cells (HT29) we observed a more than 2-fold increase in the PC pool and at the same time decreased tyrosine kinase activity (50%). With increasing incubation time EGF affects the pools of both phosphatidylinositols and other phospholipids parallel with the activation of the tyrosine kinase activity. EGF increases the activity of PKC in the HT29 cell line and PC could be the source of 1,2-DAG which may stimulate PKC activity.
