The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved regulatory molecules expressed in all eukaryotic cells. A striking feature of the 14-3-3 proteins is their ability to bind a multitude of functionally diverse signaling proteins, including kinases, phosphatases, and transmembrane receptors. This plethora of interacting proteins allows 14-3-3 to play important roles in a wide range of vital regulatory processes, such as mitogenic signal transduction, apoptotic cell death, and cell cycle control. In this review, we examine the structural basis for 14-3-3-ligand interactions, proposed functions of 14-3-3 in various signaling pathways, and emerging views of mechanisms that regulate 14-3-3 actions.
