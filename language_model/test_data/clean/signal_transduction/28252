Adapter molecules in a variety of signal transduction systems link receptors to a limited number of commonly used downstream signaling pathways. During T-cell development and mature T-cell effector function, a multichain receptor (the pre-T-cell antigen receptor or the T-cell antigen receptor) activates several protein tyrosine kinases. Receptor and kinase activation is linked to distal signaling pathways (PLC-gamma1 activation, Ca2+ influx, PKC activation and Ras/Erk activation) via the adapter protein LAT (Linker for Activation of T cells). Structure/function studies of LAT including expression of selected LAT point mutations in vivo reveals that these multiple pathways are integrated at the level of the LAT adapter. These studies suggest that similar levels of control may be found in other systems where adapter molecules are known to have important functions.
