Overexpression of CD30 and constitutive NF-kappaB activation characterizes tumor cells of Hodgkin's disease (HD), Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells. We report that in H-RS cells overexpression of CD30 leads to self-aggregation, recruitment of TRAF2 and TRAF5, and NF-kappaB activation, independent of CD30 ligand. CD30 and TRAF proteins co-localized in H-RS cell lines and in lymph nodes of HD. An adenovirus-vector carrying a decoy CD30 lacking the cytoplasmic region or a dominant negative IkappaBalpha mutant blocks NF-kappaB activation, down regulates IL-13 expression and induces apoptosis. Thus, in H-RS cells, ligand-independent activation of CD30 signaling drives NF-kappaB activation and this leads to constitutive cytokine expression, which provides a molecular basis for HD. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by adenovirus vector-mediated gene transfer may provide a novel strategy of cell- and target molecule-specific therapy for patients with HD.
