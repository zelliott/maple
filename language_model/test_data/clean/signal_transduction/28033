The enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell controls gastric acid secretion via histamine, generated by l-histidine decarboxylase (HDC). HDC expression is regulated by gastrin. However, gastrin is not alone in controlling ECL cell function. For example, the neural peptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) also increases ECL cell proliferation. To investigate a potential role of PACAP in regulating HDC expression, we generated a series of HDC promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and transiently transfected them into PC12 cells (stably expressing the gastrin-CCK-2 receptor). We found that PACAP regulates HDC promoter activity. This is temporally biphasic, involving both adenyl cyclase and phospholipase C-dependent pathways. Deletional analysis, block mutation, and EMSA demonstrated a PACAP-response element at -177 to -170, wholly necessary for the effects of PACAP and discrete from known gastrin-responsive elements. Discrete neural and endocrine pathways regulate ECL cells through different patterns of postreceptor signaling and promoter activation, which may be appropriate to their functions in vivo.
