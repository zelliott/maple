Current therapeutic approaches for advanced breast cancer frequently target receptors mediating cell survival and proliferation, such as the estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2. Although these approaches are effective for many patients, treatment resistance is common. Therefore, new treatment approaches are needed for patients with advanced breast cancer. Mammalian target of rapamycin is a highly conserved serine-threonine kinase that acts as a major signaling hub that integrates and synergizes with cellular proliferation, survival, and/or motility signals mediated by estrogen receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, and other receptor tyrosine kinases. Dysregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling occurs in various tumor types, including breast cancer, and has been associated with cancer pathogenesis, disease progression, and treatment resistance. Recent clinical trials show that combined inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin and estrogen receptor represents an effective strategy for treating hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer progressing on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy, and data from ongoing trials combining mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-targeted therapy are awaited. This review focuses on the molecular rationale underlying strategies to enhance sensitivity to treatment in hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive advanced breast cancer, the clinical efficacy of such approaches, and future perspectives.
