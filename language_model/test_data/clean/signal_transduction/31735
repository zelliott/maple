Strong anti-inflammatory activity has been found in Laminaria japonica dichloromethane fraction (LDF); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory activity are not reported. Our results indicated that LDF inhibited LPS-induced nitric oxide and prostaglandin E(2) production in a dose-dependent manner and suppressed the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in RAW 264.7 cells. Also, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 were remarkably reduced by LDF in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells. LDF greatly inhibited promoter activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and translocation of NF-κB subunits by prevention of the degradation of inhibitor κB-α in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells (p < 0.05). Moreover, LDF inhibited activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and AKT in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells. These results indicate that the LDF downregulates iNOS and COX-2 expressions through the suppression of NF-κB pathway associated with inhibition of multiple signaling proteins.
