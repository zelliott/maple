The knowledge of the mechanism of keratinocyte differentiation in culture is still uncompleted. The emergence of new technologies, such as cDNA microarrays or 2D electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry analysis, has allowed the identification of genes and proteins expressed in biological processes in keratinocytes. Here, we report a genome wide analysis of proliferating versus differentiated human HaCaT keratinocytes. We found that genes and proteins which take part in the cell cycle control, carbohydrate metabolism, cell auto-immunity, adhesion and cytokine signal transduction pathways were regulated in differentiated HaCaT keratinocytes. In addition, we identified seven proteins and 33 transcripts that had not been previously described as differentially expressed in proliferating versus differentiated HaCaT cells. Furthermore, some of these transcripts or proteins were similarly regulated in human primary keratinocytes and in human epidermis. The present study opens new areas of investigation in the comprehension of keratinocyte differentiation.
