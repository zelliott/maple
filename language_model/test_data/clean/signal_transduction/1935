Protein kinase A (PKA) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) are important signaling molecules. It is well known that PKA can specifically phosphorylate nNOS. But the underlying molecular mechanism is still obscure. Our data indicate that the protein inhibitor of nNOS (PIN) binds to protein kinase A inhibitors (PKIs), which suggests that PKIs, together with PIN, might mediate the phosphorylation of nNOS by PKA.
