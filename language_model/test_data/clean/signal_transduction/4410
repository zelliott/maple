The CD19 antigen plays an important role in clinical oncology. In normal cells, it is the most ubiquitously expressed protein in the B lymphocyte lineage. CD19 expression is induced at the point of B lineage commitment during the differentiation of the hematopoietic stem cell, and its expression continues through preB and mature B cell differentiation until it is finally down-regulated during terminal differentiation into plasma cells. CD19 expression is maintained in B-lineage cells that have undergone neoplastic transformation, and therefore CD19 is useful in diagnosis of leukemias and lymphomas using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and flow cytometry. Interestingly, CD19 is also expressed in a subset of acute myelogenous leukemias (AMLs) indicating the close relationship between the lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Because B lineage leukemias and lymphomas rarely lose CD19 expression, and because it is not expressed in the pluripotent stem cell, it has become the target for a variety of immunotherapeutic agents, including immunotoxins. Treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) with anti-CD19 mAbs coupled to biological toxins has proven to be effective in vitro and in animal models, and has shown some promising results in Phase I clinical trials. Recently, the analysis of anti-CD19 effects on lymphoma cell growth has highlighted a novel mechanism of immunotherapy. Engagement of cell surface receptors like CD19 by mAbs can have anti-tumor effects by the activation of signal transduction pathways which control cell cycle progression and programmed cell death (apoptosis).
