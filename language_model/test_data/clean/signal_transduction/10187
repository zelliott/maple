Several herpesviruses encode G-protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) proteins that are homologous to human chemokine receptors. In contrast to chemokine receptors, many vGPCRs signal in a ligand-independent (constitutive) manner. Such constitutive signaling is of major significance because various pathologies are associated with activating GPCR mutations. Constitutive activity of the human herpesvirus 8-encoded GPCR (ORF74), for example, is essential for its oncogenic potential to cause angioproliferative Kaposi's sarcoma-like lesions. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes four GPCRs, of which US28 and UL33 display constitutive activity in transfected, but also HCMV-infected, cells. In addition, US28 is activated by a broad spectrum of chemokines. Furthermore, both US28 and UL33 show promiscuous G-protein coupling, whereas chemokine receptors activate primarily G(i/o) proteins. Thus, these vGPCRs are versatile signaling devices, reprogramming cellular signaling networks to modulate cellular function after infection. By these means, these HCMV-encoded receptors might contribute to HCMV-related pathologies.
