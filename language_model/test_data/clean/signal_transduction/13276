In Arabidopsis, phytochrome A (phyA) is the primary photoreceptor mediating various plant responses to far-red (FR) light. Here we show that phyA signaling involves a combinatorial action of downstream intermediates, which controls overlapping yet distinctive sets of FR responses. FHY3 is a prominent phyA signaling intermediate sharing structural similarity to FAR1, a previously identified phyA signaling component. The fhy3 and far1 mutants display similar yet distinctive defects in phyA signaling; however, overexpression of either FHY3 or FAR1 suppresses the mutant phenotype of both genes. Moreover, overexpression of partial fragments of FHY3 can cause a dominant-negative interference phenotype on phyA signaling that is stronger than those of the fhy3 or far1 null mutants. Further, we demonstrate that FHY3 and FAR1 are capable of homo- and hetero-interaction. Our data indicate that FHY3, together with FAR1, defines a key module in a signaling network underlying phyA-mediated FR light responses.
