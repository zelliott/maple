During the process of B cell development, transcription factors, such as E2A and Ebf1, have been known to play key roles. Although transcription factors and chromatin regulators work in concert to direct the expression of B lineage-specific genes, little is known about the involvement of regulators for chromatin structure during B lymphopoiesis. In this article, we show that deletion of Srg3/mBaf155, a scaffold subunit of the SWI/SNF-like BAF complex, in the hematopoietic lineage caused defects at both the common lymphoid progenitor stage and the transition from pre-pro-B to early pro-B cells due to failures in the expression of B lineage-specific genes, such as Ebf1 and Il7ra, and their downstream target genes. Moreover, mice that were deficient in the expression of Brg1, a subunit of the complex with ATPase activity, also showed defects in early B cell development. We also found that the expression of Ebf1 and Il7ra is directly regulated by the SWI/SNF-like BAF complex. Thus, our results suggest that the SWI/SNF-like BAF complex facilitates early B cell development by regulating the expression of B lineage-specific genes.
