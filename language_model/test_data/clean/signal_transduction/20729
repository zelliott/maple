The oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+ evoked in pancreatic exocrine acinar cells by submaximal concentrations of the two phosphoinositidase-coupled agonists acetylcholine (ACh) and cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) have very different temporal patterns. In the present study we use digital video imaging of Fura-2 fluorescence to map the spatial distribution of Ca2+ during the oscillating responses to these two agonists. The spatial patterns induced are very different for each of these agonists. ACh oscillations are sinusoidal and initiated at the secretory pole of these morphologically and functionally polarized cells. As they spread across the cell, pronounced gradients in Ca2+ develop that persist throughout the oscillating response. CCK-8 induces a series of discrete Ca2+ transients of longer duration and lower frequency. These elevations in Ca2+ arise slowly, throughout the cells and without any detectable gradients in Ca2+. We consider that the different spatiotemporal patterns can be explained on the basis of a physiologically relevant interaction between Ins(1,4,5)P3 and protein kinase C in second messenger-mediated Ca2+ signalling.
