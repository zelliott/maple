The search for molecular mechanisms to stimulate sensory regeneration in the mammalian inner ear is commonly based upon developmental studies. This has revealed many genes that regulate the differentiation of sensory cells. A major challenge is to place these genes into the context of functional networks that describe developmental processes more fully and increase the chances of identifying useful therapeutic targets. We used a novel approach to identify genes that are functionally related to the transcription factor gata2. Temporal profiles of gene expression were derived from three conditionally immortal cell lines and clustered to those of gata2 by applying the gamma model for oligonucleotide signals, a statistical method that allows quantitative analysis of oligonucleotide array data. We derived an objective list of 28 genes that clustered with gata2 in all three cell lines. A number of these genes have known functional links with gata2. Genes encoding CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) and signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (Stat3) are especially interesting as they are known to bind gata proteins directly. The results provide strong evidence that our experimental approach can reveal functional relationships between genes that regulate fundamental processes in the differentiation of sensory cells in the inner ear.
