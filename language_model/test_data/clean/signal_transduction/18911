The relationship between EBV infection and sensitivity to death receptor (DR)-induced apoptosis is poorly understood. Using EBV- and EBV+ BJAB cells, we provide the first evidence that EBV can protect latently infected B cell lymphomas from apoptosis triggered through Fas or TRAIL receptors. Caspase 8 activation was impaired and cellular FLIP recruitment was enriched in death-inducing signaling complexes formed in EBV-infected BJAB cells relative to parent BJAB cells. Furthermore, latent membrane protein 1 expression alone could reduce caspase activation and confer partial resistance to DR apoptosis in BJAB cells. This protective effect was dependent on C-terminal activating region 2-driven NF-kappaB activation, which in turn up-regulated cellular FLIP expression in latent membrane protein 1+ BJAB cells. Thus, the ability of latent EBV to block DR apoptosis may help to ensure the survival of host cells during B cell differentiation, and contribute to the development of B cell lymphomas, especially in immunocompromised individuals.
