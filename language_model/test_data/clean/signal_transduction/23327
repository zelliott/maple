The mechanism of the regulatory roles of stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) on cell proliferation and apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) via the protein kinase C (PKC) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signalling pathways have been investigated. Rat aortic VSMCs were treated with control or an oxidised low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) atherosclerosis (AS) model. Cells exposed to the AS model were treated with SDF-1 plus inhibitors specific for PKC (Ro31-8220), CXCR4 (12G5) or NF-κB (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, PDTC). Cell proliferation was measured with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and apoptosis by flow cytometry. NF-κB protein expression was analysed using Western blotting. The proliferation rate in the AS model group was significantly higher than the control group, but lower than the SDF-1 group (P < 0.05). Apoptosis in the AS model group (ox-LDL) was significantly higher than the normal control group (P < 0.05). In addition, the apoptosis rate in the SDF-1 group was significantly lower than the normal control group (P < 0.05); however, there was no difference from the Ro31-8220 group. NF-κB protein expression in the SDF-1 group was significantly higher than the AS model (ox-LDL) group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, SDF-1 can promote the proliferation of VSMCs induced by ox-LDL and inhibit cell apoptosis, via the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis.
