The generation of a functional nervous system is dependent on precise pathfinding of axons during development. This pathfinding is directed by the distribution of local and long-range guidance cues, the latter of which are believed to be distributed in gradients. Gradients of guidance cues have been associated with growth cone function for over a hundred years. However, little is known about the mechanisms used by growth cones to respond to these gradients, in part owing to the lack of identifiable gradients in vivo. In the developing grasshopper limb, two gradients of the semaphorin Sema-2a are necessary for correct neuronal pathfinding in vivo. The gradients are found in regions where growth cones make critical steering decisions. Observations of different growth cone behaviors associated with these gradients have provided some insights into how growth cones respond to them. Growth cones appear to respond more faithfully to changes in concentration, rather than absolute levels, of Sema-2a expression, whereas the absolute levels may regulate growth cone size.
