As a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) responds to changes in extracellular free calcium concentration by inducing intracellular signalling. These CaR-induced signals then specifically modulate cellular functions such as parathyroid hormone secretion from the parathyroid glands and calcium reabsorption in the kidney and thus to understand how the CaR functions one must understand how it signals. CaR-induced signalling involves intracellular Ca2+ mobilisation/oscillations as well as the activation of various phospholipases and protein kinases and the suppression of cAMP formation. This review will detail the intracellular pathways by which the CaR is believed to elicit its physiological functions and summarises the evidence for cell- and agonist-specific differential signalling.
