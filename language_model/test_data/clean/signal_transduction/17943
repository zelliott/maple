The major function of the thymus is to eliminate developing thymocytes that are potentially useless or autoreactive, and select only those that bear functional T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) through fastidious screening. It is believed that glucocorticoids (GCs) are at least in part responsible for cell death during death by neglect. In this review, we will mainly cover the topic of the GC-induced apoptosis of developing thymocytes. We will also discuss how thymocytes that are fated to die by GCs can be rescued from GC-induced apoptosis in response to a variety of signals with antagonizing properties for GC receptor (GR) signaling. Currently, a lot of evidence supports the notion that the decision is made as a result of the integration of the multiple signal transduction networks that are triggered by GR, TCR, and Notch. A few candidate molecules at the converging point of these multiple signaling pathyways will be discussed. We will particularly describe the role of the SRG3 protein as a potent modulator of GC-induced apoptosis in the crosstalk.
