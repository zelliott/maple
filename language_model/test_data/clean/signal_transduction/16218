Regulation of tryptophan metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in dendritic cells (DCs) is a highly versatile modulator of immunity. In inflammation, interferon-γ is the main inducer of IDO for the prevention of hyperinflammatory responses, yet IDO is also responsible for self-tolerance effects in the longer term. Here we show that treatment of mouse plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) conferred regulatory effects on IDO that were mechanistically separable from its enzymic activity. We found that IDO was involved in intracellular signaling events responsible for the self-amplification and maintenance of a stably regulatory phenotype in pDCs. Thus, IDO has a tonic, nonenzymic function that contributes to TGF-β-driven tolerance in noninflammatory contexts.
