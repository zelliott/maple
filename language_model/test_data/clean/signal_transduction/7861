PF-4/CXCL4 is a member of the CXC chemokine family, which is mainly produced by platelets and known for its pleiotropic biological functions. Recently, the proteic product of a nonallelic variant gene of CXCL4 was isolated from human platelets and named as CXCL4L1. CXCL4L1 shows only 4.3% amino acid divergence in the mature protein, but exhibits a 38% amino acid divergence in the signal peptide region. We hypothesized that this may imply a difference in the cell type in which CXCL4L1 is expressed or a difference in its mode of secretion. In different types of transfected cells, CXCL4 and CXCL4L1 exhibited a distinct subcellular localization and a differential regulation of secretion, CXCL4 being stored in secretory granules and released in response to protein kinase C activation, whereas CXCL4L1 was continuously synthesized and secreted through a constitutive pathway. A protein kinase C-regulated CXCL4 secretion was observed also in lymphocytes, a cell type expressing mainly CXCL4 mRNA, whereas smooth muscle cells, which preferentially expressed CXCL4L1, exhibited a constitutive pathway of secretion. These results demonstrate that CXCL4 and CXCL4L1 exhibit a distinct subcellular localization and are secreted in a differentially regulated manner, suggesting distinct roles in inflammatory or homeostatic processes.
