In this issue of Cell, Norden et al. (2006) describe a new pathway, NoCut, that links the completion of chromosome segregation to the onset of cytokinesis in budding yeast. In NoCut, Aurora kinase (Ipl1) at the spindle midzone negatively regulates cytokinesis through two proteins previously identified to be involved in cell polarity, Boi1 and Boi2.
