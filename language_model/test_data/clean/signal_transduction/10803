MAIDS (murine AIDS) is caused by infection with the murine leukaemia retrovirus RadLV-Rs and is characterized by a severe immunodeficiency and T-cell anergy combined with a lymphoproliferative disease affecting both B- and T-cells. Hyperactivation of the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway is involved in the T-cell dysfunction of MAIDS and HIV by inhibiting T-cell activation through the T-cell receptor. In the present study, we show that MAIDS involves a strong and selective up-regulation of cyclo-oxygenase type 2 in the CD11b+ subpopulation of T- and B-cells of the lymph nodes, leading to increased levels of PGE2 (prostaglandin E2). PGE2 activates the cAMP pathway through G-protein-coupled receptors. Treatment with cyclo-oxygenase type 2 inhibitors reduces the level of PGE2 and thereby reverses the T-cell anergy, restores the T-cell immune function and ameliorates the lymphoproliferative disease.
