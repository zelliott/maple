Mast cell activation is associated with atopic and inflammatory diseases, but the natural controls of mast cell homeostasis are poorly understood. We hypothesized that CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) could function in mast cell homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that mast cells can recruit both Treg and conventional CD4(+) T cells (Tconv). Furthermore, Treg, but not Tconv, suppress mast cell FcepsilonRI expression. Despite the known inhibitory functions of IL-10 and TGFbeta1, FcepsilonRI suppression was independent of IL-10 and TGF-beta1 and required cell contact. Surprisingly, coculture with either Treg or Tconv cells suppressed IgE-mediated leukotriene C(4) production but enhanced cytokine production by mast cells. This was accompanied by a selective increase in FcepsilonRI-mediated Stat5 phosphorylation, which is a critical mediator of IgE-mediated cytokine secretion. These data are the first direct demonstration that mast cells can recruit Treg and illustrate that T cell interactions can alter the mast cell response.
