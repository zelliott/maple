Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by increased ovarian androgen production. We have developed a strategy to identify differentially transcribed genes in PCOS theca cells. Using long-term cultures of normal and PCOS theca cells, we are characterizing the complete repertoire of differentially transcribed genes, the common transcription factor mediators, and the signal transduction cascade(s) that are abnormal in PCOS theca cells. The latter will be interrogated for mutations/genetic variants linked to PCOS.
