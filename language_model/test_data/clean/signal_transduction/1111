Plus end tracking proteins (+TIPS) bind to microtubules. Results reported by Lee et al. and Zhou et al. in this issue of Neuron demonstrate that, via intracellular pathways signaling to +TIPs, microtubules can be a direct target of guidance cues in steering growth cones and regulating axon elongation.
