Recent studies have uncovered new roles for the notochord and floor plate in patterning adjacent cells, elaborating their importance as essential organizers of neural and paraxial tissue. The identification of key molecules that mediate the ability of notochord and floor plate to induce cells to adopt distinct fates has provided a first step in elucidating the mechanisms underlying these events.
