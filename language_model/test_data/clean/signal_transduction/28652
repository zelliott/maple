Apoptosis protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), the central element in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, is frequently absent or poorly expressed in metastatic melanomas, a tumor type showing a low degree of spontaneous apoptosis and a poor response to conventional therapies. In the present study, we used the Apaf-1-positive Me665/2/21 melanoma cell line to investigate the fate of Apaf-1 during cisplatin-induced apoptosis. As novel findings described for the first time in melanoma cells, we observed that Apaf-1 was markedly decreased during apoptosis, already at early stages of cell damage; concurrently, an immunoreactive N-terminal fragment of congruent with 26 kDa was evident. In spite of the remarkable decrease of Apaf-1 in apoptotic cells, caspase-9 was found to be processed and enzymatically active. Both Apaf-1 depletion and its proteolytic cleavage were markedly prevented in presence of the caspase-3/-7 inhibitor ac-DEVD-CHO. In presence of ac-DEVD-CHO, caspase-9 activity was also inhibited, along with a partially different pattern of caspase-9 processing forms. Unexpectedly, the inhibition afforded by ac-DEVD-CHO on several components, that is, caspase-3/-7 and caspase-9 activities, and Apaf-1 proteolytic degradation, did not abrogate the apoptotic morphology and cell detachment, nor the proteolytic degradation of crucial targets, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and lamin B. Together, our results suggest that caspase-3 and -7, proved to be dispensable for the above apoptosis-associated events, play a role on Apaf-1 handling and possibly on apoptosome function.
