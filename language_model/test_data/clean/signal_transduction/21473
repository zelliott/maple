CCR7 was described initially as a potent leukocyte chemotactic receptor that was later shown to be responsible of directing the migration of dendritic cells (DCs) to the lymph nodes where these cells play an important role in the initiation of the immune response. Recently, a variety of reports have indicated that, apart from chemotaxis, CCR7 controls the cytoarchitecture, the rate of endocytosis, the survival, the migratory speed, and the maturation of the DCs. Some of these functions of CCR7 and additional ones also have been described in other cell types. Herein we discuss how this receptor may contribute to modulate the immune response by regulating different functions in DCs. Finally, we also suggest a possible mechanism whereby CCR7 may control its multiple tasks in these cells.
