The block of differentiation in myeloid leukaemia can be overcome by treatment with a variety of agents including cytokines. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induce macrophage differentiation and growth arrest through activation of the Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) signal pathway in murine M1 myeloid leukaemia cells. Treatment of various other myeloid leukaemia lines with LIF or IL-6 did not lead to induction of differentiation. Several defects in the cytokine triggered Jak/Stat signal pathway were striking in these lines. They expressed a decreased or undetectable amount of at least one of the components of the specific cytokine receptor complexes. Three lines contained a constitutively activated Jak/Stat signal cascade and in two of them, lines C and BMC-63, this cascade was inducible by treatment with IL-6, despite of a very low density of IL-6-receptors. Apart from the cytokine receptors, additional components of the Jak/Stat signal cascade were altered in these lines. Expression and activation of the transcription factor Stat5a and the tyrosine kinase Jak2 were markedly decreased compared to M1 cells, suggesting a role of activated Stat5a in the induction of differentiation. These results demonstrate a direct correlation between alterations in the Jak/Stat signal pathway and the inability to differentiate after cytokine treatment of myeloid leukaemia cells.
