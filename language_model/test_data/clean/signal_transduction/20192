Prostate cancer (PCa) is a highly prevalent disease in older men of the western world and overall greatly affects the quality of life of elderly people.

Understanding the mechanism of prostate cancer onset and metastasis is the key to treating this disease successfully and increasing survivability.

In this study, we constructed crosstalk networks among prostate cancer (primary and metastatic) related pathways by integrating protein-protein interactions (PPI) and KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) pathways information. Total 11 pathways crosstalk with each other in primary prostate cancer and 7 pathways crosstalk with each other in metastatic prostate cancer.

Among these pathways, Notch signaling pathway and chemokine signaling pathway were found regulate multiple processes during prostate cancer progression.

Results from these studies will provide the groundwork for a combination therapy approach targeting multiple pathways which will likely be more effective than targeting one pathway alone.
