Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPK) are encoded by the NME genes, also called NM23. They catalyze the transfer of gamma-phosphate from nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates by a ping-pong mechanism involving the formation of a high energy phospho-histidine intermediate [1, 2]. Besides their known functions in the control of intracellular nucleotide homeostasis, they are involved in multiple physiological and pathological cellular processes such as differentiation, development, metastastic dissemination or cilia functions. Over the past 15 years, ten human genes have been discovered encoding partial, full length, and/or tandemly repeated Nm23/NDPK domains, with or without N-or C-terminal extensions and/or additional domains. These genes encode proteins exhibiting different functions at various tissular and subcellular localizations. Most of these genes appear late in evolution with the emergence of the vertebrate lineage. This review summarizes the present knowledge on these multitalented proteins.
