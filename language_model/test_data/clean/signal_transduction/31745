The aim of the present study was to discover the signaling pathways associated             with 2-(3-hydroxy-5-methoxy-phenyl)-6,7-methylenedioxyquinolin-4-one (YYK1)-induced             apoptosis in HL-60 human leukemia cells. YYK1 induced cytotoxic effects, cell             morphological changes, decreased the cell number and increased reactive oxygen             species (ROS) production and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in             HL-60 cells. YYK1-induced apoptosis was confirmed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl             transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Results from colorimetric             assays and western blot analysis indicated that activities of caspase-7/-3, caspase-8             and caspase-9 were increased in YYK1-treated HL-60 cells. Western blot analysis             showed that the protein levels of extrinsic apoptotic proteins (Fas/CD95, FasL             and FADD), intrinsic related proteins (cytochrome c, Apaf-1, AIF and Endo G),             the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and phosphorylated p38 MAPK were increased in HL-60 cells             after YYK1 treatment. Cell apoptosis was significantly reduced after pre-treatment             with N-acetylcysteine (NAC; a ROS scavenger) or diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI;             a NADPH oxidase inhibitor). Blockage of p38 MAPK signaling by SB202190 abolished             YYK1-induced Fas/CD95 upregulation and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. We conclude that             YYK1 induces both of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways via ROS-mediated             activation of p38 MAPK signaling in HL-60 human leukemia cells in vitro.
