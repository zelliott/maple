Not all of the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can be attributed to changes in angiotensin II and bradykinin levels. Because the cytoplasmic tail of ACE is phosphorylated, we determined whether ACE inhibitors affect the phosphorylation of ACE and whether ACE possesses the characteristics of a signal transduction molecule. The ACE inhibitors ramiprilat and perindoprilat, and the substrate bradykinin (but not angiotensin I), enhanced the activity of ACE-associated CK2 and the phosphorylation of ACE Ser1270 in cultured endothelial cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) coprecipitated with ACE, and stimulation of endothelial cells with ACE inhibitors increased the activity of ACE-associated JNK and elicited the accumulation of phosphorylated c-Jun in the nucleus. Ramiprilat was however unable to activate JNK or to stimulate the nuclear accumulation of c-Jun in endothelial cells expressing a S1270A ACE mutant or in ACE-deficient cells. Because the ACE inhibitor-induced increase in ACE expression has been linked to the formation of c-Jun homodimers, we investigated whether ACE signaling via JNK contributes to this response in vitro and in vivo. Prolonged ramiprilat treatment increased ACE expression in primary cultures of human endothelial cells and in vivo (mouse lung), a response that was prevented by pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125. Thus, ACE is involved in outside-in signaling in endothelial cells and "ACE signaling" may be an important cellular mechanism contributing to the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors.
