Signals delivered to antigen-presenting cells through CD40 are critical for the activation of immune responses. Intracellular tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) are key elements of the signal transduction pathways of many TNF receptor family members, including CD40. We show for the first time that engagement of CD40 in intact B cells induces the rapid translocation of TRAF2 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. We found that CD40 engagement also results in its recruitment, together with TRAF2 and TRAF3, to membrane microdomains, regions of the plasma membrane enriched in signaling molecules such as the Src family kinases. Using a membrane-permeable chelator of zinc or a mutant TRAF2 molecule, we show that the putative zinc-binding domains of TRAFs contribute to their recruitment to microdomains and to the downstream activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase. We suggest that the zinc RING and zinc finger domains of TRAFs are required for communication between CD40 and microdomain-associated signaling molecules and may serve a similar role in the signal transduction pathways of other TNF receptor family members.
