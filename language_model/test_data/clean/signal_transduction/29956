Previously, 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-OHC) and 6-nitro-7-hydroxycoumarin (6-NO2-7-OHC) have been shown to be potent and selective anti-proliferative agents to the human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell line, A-498. Their effect on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK's) was investigated. 6-NO2-7-OHC was shown to alter the phosphorylation status of ERK1/ERK2, p38 and SAPK, while 7-OHC activated ERK1/ERK2 but had no effect on p38 and SAPK. Also, 7-OHC inhibited topoisomerase II mediated relaxation of DNA, while neither compound was a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR). Therefore, 6-NO2-7-OHC, rather than 7-OHC, modulated signalling events associated with cellular differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting its mechanism of action may be the promotion of cellular maturation and/or death. Consequently, 6-NO2-7-OHC may represent a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of RCC's.
