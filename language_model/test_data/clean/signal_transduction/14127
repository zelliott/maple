We hypothesized that both adiponectin and leptin affect the growth of porcine skeletal muscle cells, with fatty acids acting as modifiers in adipokine action and that both adipokines influence the gene expression of their receptors. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of recombinant adiponectin and leptin on cell number (DNA) and DNA synthesis rate with and without oleic acid supplementation, on cell death, and on key intracellular signaling molecules of proliferating porcine myoblasts in vitro. Moreover, the mRNA expression of genes encoding for the leptin and adiponectin receptors (LEPR, ADIPOR1, ADIPOR2) as affected by leptin or adiponectin was examined. Recombinant porcine adiponectin (40 μg/mL) and leptin (20 ng/mL) increased DNA synthesis rate, measured as [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation (P < 0.01), reduced cell viability in terms of lactate dehydrogenase release (P < 0.05), or lowered DNA content after 24 h (P < 0.05). In adiponectin-treated cultures, oleic acid supplementation increased DNA synthesis rate and reduced cell number in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Both adiponectin (P = 0.07) and leptin (P < 0.05) induced a transient activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) after 15 min, followed by decreases after 60 and 180 min (P < 0.05). Adiponectin tended to increase c-fos activation (P = 0.08) and decreased p53 activation at 180 min (P = 0.03). Both adiponectin and leptin down-regulated the abundance of ADIPOR2 mRNA and, transiently, of LEPR mRNA (P < 0.05). In conclusion, adiponectin and leptin may adversely affect the growth of porcine myoblasts, which is related to p44/42 MAPK signaling and associated with changes in ligand receptor gene expression.
