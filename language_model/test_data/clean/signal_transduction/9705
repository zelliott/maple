Dynamic changes in gene expression are tightly controlled during development, as a single totipotent zygote gives rise to distinct cell lineages. The establishment and maintenance of these diverse transcriptional programs rely on changes of chromatin state, mainly through histone modifications. Polycomb and Trithorax complexes participate in setting apart active and inactive genes by respectively repressing and activating key developmental regulators in different cell types. Over the last decade, our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying their activities has greatly improved, but the signals targeting these proteins to specific regions of the genome are still poorly understood, particularly in vertebrates. Recent findings highlight the highly dynamic activities of Polycomb and Trithorax complexes in vivo. Surprisingly, although their role in transcriptional regulation is deeply conserved during evolution, the time sequence in which they act seems to vary across species.
