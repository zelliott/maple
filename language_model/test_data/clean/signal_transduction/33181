Many growth factors including epidermal growth factor (EGF) induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the c-Cbl proto-oncogene product, whose function, however, remains unclear. Recently, Sli-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of c-Cbl, was found to be a negative regulator of let-23-mediated vulval induction pathway, suggesting that c-Cbl may negatively regulate EGF receptor (EGFR)-mediated signaling. In this study, by an antisense RNA approach, we examined the effects of expression level of c-Cbl on EGFR signaling and showed that overexpression of c-Cbl reduces and antisense repression of c-Cbl enhances autophosphorylation of EGF receptors and activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. However, in contrast to the Sli-1 protein, the expressed amount of c-Cbl does not affect activation of the Ras pathway, suggesting that the EGFR-mediated signaling pathways are differently regulated by c-Cbl among nematodes and mammals.
