In the absence of progesterone (P), the anti-P at the receptor RU486 reduces basal and GnRH-stimulated LH secretion both in vivo and in vitro, demonstrating the existence of a ligand-independent activation of progesterone receptor (LIAPR). The aim of the present study was to determine which component of the intracellular LH secretory pathway activated by GnRH is responsible for LIAPR. To do this, anterior pituitary dispersed cells from female rats in proestrus, cultured in the presence of 17beta-estradiol, were incubated with activators or inhibitors of PKC, cAMP-PKA signalling pathways or intracellular calcium (Ca2+) traffic, in the presence or absence of RU486. Results showed that RU486 reduced both GnRH- and the PKC activator PMA-induced LH secretion. In GnRH-stimulated cells incubated with the PKC inhibitor BIS-I or treated with PMA "overnight", RU486 had no effect on reduced LH secretion, nor on stimulated LH secretion elicited by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Moreover, when GnRH- or PMA-treated cells were co-incubated with 1 microM of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine or the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM, RU486 potentiated the expected inhibition of these drugs on LH secretion. Activation (forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP) or inhibition (MDL-12,330A) of the cAMP-PKA signalling cascade affected neither the GnRH- and PMA-induced increase of LH secretion nor the reduction of LH secretion due to RU486. Taken together, the data point to the existence of a Ca2+ -independent PKC-PR cross-talk mechanism as part of the intracellular signalling of GnRH-stimulated LH secretion.
