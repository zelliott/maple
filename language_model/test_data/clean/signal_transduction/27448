This study provides an initial characterization of basic morphological properties of cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from rat preglomerular resistance vessels and of the functional coupling of angiotensin II (ANG II) receptors to cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i (fura 2 fluorescence photometry). Renal VSMC were isolated from interlobular arteries and afferent arterioles (< 50 microns) using an iron oxide sieving method and compared with rat aortic VSMC cultured under similar conditions. Quiescent monolayers maintained uniform morphology and [Ca2+]i signaling profile between passages 3 and 10. Arteriolar and aortic VSMC were spindle shaped and expressed smooth muscle-specific alpha-actin and myosin heavy chains SM-1 and SM-2. ANG II caused a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i, followed by a sustained plateau phase at 50-60% of the peak value. The initial maximum [Ca2+]i responses were dose dependent and of similar magnitude in renal arteriolar and aortic VSMC. ANG II (10(-7) M) increased [Ca2+]i from 50 to 240 nM in arteriolar and from 57 to 201 nM in aortic VSMC (P < 0.001 for both). Inhibition of ANG II effects on [Ca2+]i revealed significant signaling through distinct AT-receptor subtypes (losartan and PD-123319 sensitive) in renal arteriolar VSMC. In contrast, only losartan was effective in aortic VSMC. The AT2-receptor ligand CGP-42112 had no effect in either vessel type. Our results demonstrate that cultured arteriolar VSMC have anatomical similarities to aortic VSMC and functional differences in AT-receptor signaling in response to ANG II. This novel preparation should provide a useful approach with which to investigate cellular mechanisms concerning receptor coupling to signaling pathways involved in vascular reactivity of arteriolar VSMC in the microcirculation in general and the kidney in particular.
