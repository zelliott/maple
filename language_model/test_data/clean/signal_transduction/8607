Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common malignancy, and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The overall 5-year survival rate of patients with esophageal cancer remains low at 10% to 40% due to late diagnosis, metastasis, and resistance of the tumor to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. NF-kappaB is involved in the regulation of cell growth, survival, and motility, but little is known about the role of this signaling pathway in the tumorigenesis of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the most common form of esophageal cancer. This study aims to explore the functions of NF-kappaB in human ESCC progression and to determine whether targeting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway might be of therapeutic value against ESCC. Our results from human ESCC cell lines and ESCC tissue indicated that NF-kappaB is constitutively active in ESCC. Exposure of ESCC cells to two NF-kappaB inhibitors, Bay11-7082 and sulfasalazine, not only reduced cancer cell proliferation, but also induced apoptosis and enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin. In addition, Bay11-7082 and sulfasalazine suppressed the migration and invasive potential of ESCC cells. More importantly, the results from tumor xenograft and experimental metastasis models showed that Bay11-7082 had significant antitumor effects on ESCC xenografts in nude mice by promoting apoptosis, and inhibiting proliferation and angiogenesis, as well as reduced the metastasis of ESCC cells to the lungs without significant toxic effects. In summary, our data suggest that NF-kappaB inhibitors may be potentially useful as therapeutic agents for patients with esophageal cancer.
