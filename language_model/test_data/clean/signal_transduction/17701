Central Glia-4 (CG-4) glioma cells exhibit Na(+)-dependent glutamate uptake, and mRNA for each of the GLT, GLAST, and EAAC glutamate transporters was found in the cells by RT-PCR. However, GLT protein in CG-4 cells was not detected by Western blotting. The Wnt-1 oncogene markedly decreased the expression of the mRNAs for GLT and GLAST glutamate transporters in CG-4 glioma cells. This effect of Wnt-1 is in direct contrast to its previously published effects on C6 astrocytoma cells where Wnt-1 induces the expression of GLT, but not protein, and on PC12 pheochromocytoma cells where Wnt-1 induces GLAST. We suggest that these differences in the ability of Wnt-1 to induce or repress GLT and GLAST are due to differences in Wnt-1 dosages or Wnt-1-induced signaling pathways in these cells. The abnormal translation of the GLT RNA in Wnt-1-expressing C6 cells was ascribed to some abnormality in the processing of the GLT transcript. Consistent with this idea is the finding that GLT mRNA was translated in Wnt-1-expressing C6 cells when the GLT mRNA required no splicing before translation occurred.
