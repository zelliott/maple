The production of IL-12 is required for immunity to many intracellular pathogens. Recent studies have shown that c-Rel, a member of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, is essential for LPS-induced IL-12p40 production by macrophages. In this study, we demonstrate that c-Rel is also required for IL-12p40 production by macrophages in response to Corynebacterium parvum, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, anti-CD40 and low molecular weight hyaluronic acid. However, c-Rel(-/-) mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii produce comparable amounts of IL-12p40 to infected wild-type mice and have an IL-12-dependent mechanism of resistance to this infection. Furthermore, c-Rel was not required for IL-12p40 production by macrophages or dendritic cells in response to soluble Toxoplasma Ag, and neutrophils from c-Rel(-/-) mice contain normal amounts of preformed IL-12p40. Together these studies reveal the presence of c-Rel-dependent pathways critical for IL-12p40 production in response to inflammatory stimuli and demonstrate a novel c-Rel-independent pathway of IL-12p40 production during toxoplasmosis.
