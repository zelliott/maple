To clarify the molecular mechanism and significance of homologous desensitization of platelet-activating factor (PAF) signaling, we examined the effect of PAF on PAF receptor mRNA expression in rat mesangial cells by Northern blot analysis. Treatment of the cells with PAF (10(-7)-10(-8) M) reduced the expression of PAF receptor mRNA in 1 h, and this reduction was recovered by pretreatment of mesangial cells with a specific PAF receptor antagonist, WEB-2086 (10(-6) M), or a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10(-6) M), for 10 min. PAF-stimulated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) formation was measured by radioimmunoassays specific for each substance. Reduction of PAF receptor mRNA expression was mimicked by treatment of the cells with PGE2 (10(-6) M) or dibutyryl-cAMP (10(-3) M), a cell-permeable analog of cAMP. These results, taken together, suggest that PAF receptor mRNA expression is downregulated by exposure to PAF in cultured mesangial cells. This homologous downregulation is mediated by cAMP production through PGE2 synthesis.
