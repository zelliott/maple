Previous studies have shown that cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) plays anti-apoptotic and antioxidative role against cell death induced by serum-deprivation (SDP) in an immortalized prion protein gene-deficient neuronal cell line derived from Rikn prion protein (PrP) gene-deficient (Prnp(-/-)) mice, which ectopically produce excess Doppel (Dpl) (PrP-like glycoprotein). To investigate whether PrP(C) inhibits apoptotic neuronal cell death without Dpl, an immortalized cell line was established from the brain of ZrchI Prnp(-/-) mice, which do not show ectopic expression of Dpl. The results using a ZrchI neuronal Prnp(-/-) cell line (NpL2) showed that PrP(C) potently inhibited SDP-induced apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, PrP(C) expression enhanced the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in NpL2 cells. These results indicate that Dpl production did not affect anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative functions of PrP, suggesting that PrP(C) may be directly correlated with protection against oxidative stress.
