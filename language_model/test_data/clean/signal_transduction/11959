β-Arrestins are well-known regulators and mediators of G protein-coupled receptor signalling, and accumulating evidence reveals that they are functionally involved in inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Of the two β-arrestins, β-arrestin 1 is documented to play regulatory roles in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), whereas the role of β-arrestin 2 is less clear. Here, we show that β-arrestin 2-deficient mice displayed the exacerbated and sustained symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. At the cellular level, deficiency of β-arrestin 2 led to a decreased number of Foxp3(+) CD4(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells in peripheral lymphoid organs of EAE mice. Consistently, our in vitro observations also revealed that loss of β-arrestin 2 impaired the conversion of Foxp3(-) CD4(+) T cells into Foxp3(+) CD4(+) inducible Treg cells. Taken together, our data suggest that β-arrestin 2 plays a regulatory role in MS, that is opposite to that of β-arrestin 1, in autoimmune diseases such as MS, which is at least partially through regulation of iTreg cell differentiation.
