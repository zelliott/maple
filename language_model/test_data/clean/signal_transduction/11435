The Jak family of protein-tyrosine kinases are crucial for the signaling of a large number of different polypeptide ligands, including the interferons, many cytokines, erythropoietin, and growth factors. Through their interaction with receptors, the Jaks initiate a signaling cascade resulting in the activation of gene transcription and ultimately a cellular response to various ligands. In addition to their role in cellular signaling, alteration of Jak activity has been implicated in several disease states. In identifying Jak2-interacting proteins with the yeast two-hybrid system, we cloned the human homologue of the Drosophila melanogaster tumor suppressor gene lethal () tumorous imaginal discs, which encodes the protein Tid56. Drosophila Tid56 and its human homologue hTid-1 represent members of the DnaJ family of molecular chaperones. The TID1 gene encodes two splice variants hTid-1(S) and hTid-1(L). We confirmed the interaction between Jak2 and hTid-1(S) or hTid-1(L) by immunoprecipitation from COS-1 cells expressing these proteins. The interaction between endogenous hTid-1 and Jak2 was shown in HEp2 cells. We further showed that hTid-1 interacts with the human interferon-gamma (Hu-IFN-gamma) receptor subunit IFN-gamma R2. In addition, using a chimeric construct where the extracellular domain of IFN-gamma R2 was fused to the kinase domain of Jak2, we showed that hTid-1 binds more efficiently to the chimera with an active kinase domain than to a similar construct with an inactive kinase domain. Additionally, the data demonstrate that hTid-1 isoforms as well as Jak2 interact with Hsp70/Hsc70 in vivo, and the interaction between Hsp70/Hsc70 and hTid-1 is reduced after IFN-gamma treatment. Furthermore, both hTid-1(S) and hTid-1(L) can modulate IFN-gamma-mediated transcriptional activity.
