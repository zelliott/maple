Cancer seriously threatens the health of humans. The mechanism underlying the carcinogenesis, however, is unclear. Among all the related hypotheses, the lately postulated 'cell brain' theory, challenging the conventional theory that gene abnormalities are the major players in carcinogenesis, is catching more and more attentions. According to this theory, the complex composes of the centrosome, centrioles, and connecting microtubules, and acts as the commandeering center of a cell in the structures and functions, equals to the brains of human being and animals, centering all the cellular activities. As far as carcinogenesis is concerned, cancer was interpreted by this theory as a brain illness' rather than a genetic disease. This article, based on the latest findings, reevaluated the roles of the composing parts of cell brain, discussed their correlations to cancer development, and further explored the mechanisms of carcinogenesis including hepatocarcinogenesis. It will contribute not only to improving cancer diagnosis and prevention but also to the design of novel anticancer agents, particularly the centrosome/cell brain-targeting agents.
