Cleft palate is one of the most common birth defects. Both environmental and genetic factors are involved in this disorder. Here, we investigated the function of Wnt10a in proliferation and apoptosis of mouse embryonic palatal mesenchymal (MEPM) cells. Expression of Wnt10a was down-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in transfected MEPM cells containing Wnt10a-specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmid. Down-regulation of Wnt10a inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in the S phase in MEPM cells. Moreover, apoptosis was significantly increased in MEPM cells of Wnt10a gene silencing. Finally, the expression of β-catenin was markedly reduced in MEPM cells transfected with shRNA plasmid, indicating that the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was involved in the alterations of cell proliferation and apoptosis induced by Wnt10a knockdown. Thus, our findings reveal that Wnt10a regulates proliferation and apoptosis of MEPM cells at least partially through the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
