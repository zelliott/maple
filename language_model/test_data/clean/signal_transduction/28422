Aster scaber T. (Asteraceae) has been used in traditional Korean and Chinese medicine to treat bruises, snakebites, headaches, and dizziness. (-)-3,5-Dicaffeoyl-muco-quinic acid (DQ) isolated from A. scaber induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. It has been reported that the activation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk 1/2) and phosphoinositide 3 (PI3) kinase plays a crucial role in the NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. This study showed that the effect of DQ on neurite outgrowth is mediated via the Erk 1/2 and PI3 kinase-dependent pathways like NGF. Furthermore, DQ stimulated the phosphorylation of Trk A. Overall, DQ elicited the differentiation of PC12 cells through Trk A phosphorylation followed by Erk 1/2 and PI3 kinase activation.
