To seek effective drugs inhibiting herpes simplex virus (HSV-2) with the signal pathway required by virus replication as the target spot.

HSV-2-induced Vero cytopathic effect was observed, and MTT method was adopted to detect call activity, in order to assess the antiviral capacity of freeze dried powder of aqueous extracts of Saururus chinensis (AESC). Western blot was used to check the effect of AESC on signal pathway induced by HSV-2 virus in HeLa cells.

AESC obviously inhibits the pathway activation of CPE induced by HSV-2 infection and NF-kappaB required for virus replication. The inhibition ratio of AESC freeze dried powder at 0.10, 0.03, 0.01 and 0.003 g x L(-1) were (70.68 +/- 3.39)%, (61.74 +/- 2.13)%, (39.31 +/- 1.10)% and (18.54 +/- 3.44)%, respectively. The IC50 was determined at (0.023 +/- 0.004) g x L(-1). The inhibition concentration of the positive control acyclovir was 0.001 g x L(-1) (5.0 x 10(-6) mol x L(-1)). The best administration time was from 2 h before infection to 6 h after infection. Western blot also showed that AESC can notably inhibit HSV-2-induced NF-kappaB nuclear transfer.

AESC can inhibit HSV-2 virus replication, which is related to the pathway activation of NF-kappaB required for virus replication.
