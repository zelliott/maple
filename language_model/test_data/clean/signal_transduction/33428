With nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and p53 functions generally having disparate outcomes for cell survival and cell division, understanding how these pathways are coordinated following a common activation signal such as DNA damage has important implications for cancer therapy. Conflicting reports concerning NF-kappaB and p53 interplay in different cell line models prompted a reexamination of this issue using mouse primary thymocytes and embryonic fibroblasts, plus fibroblasts transformed by E1A12S. Here, we report that following the treatment of these cells with a range of stress stimuli, p53 and NF-kappaB were found to regulate cell cycling and survival independently.
