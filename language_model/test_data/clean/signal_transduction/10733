The sphingomyelin-derived messenger ceramides provoke neuronal apoptosis through caspase-3 activation, while the neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) promotes neuronal survival and inhibits caspase-3 activity. However, the mechanisms leading to the opposite regulation of caspase-3 by C2-ceramide and PACAP are currently unknown. Here, we show that PACAP prevents C2-ceramide-induced inhibition of mitochondrial potential and C2-ceramide-evoked cytochrome c release. C2-ceramide stimulated Bax expression, but had no effect on Bcl-2, while PACAP abrogated the action of C2-ceramide on Bax and stimulated Bcl-2 expression. The effects of C2-ceramide and PACAP on Bax and Bcl-2 were blocked, respectively, by the JNK inhibitor L-JNKI1 and the MEK inhibitor U0126. L-JNKI1 prevented the alteration of mitochondria induced by C2-ceramide while U0126 suppressed the protective effect of PACAP against the deleterious action of C2-ceramide on mitochondrial potential. Moreover, L-JNKI1 inhibited the stimulatory effect of C2-ceramide on caspase-9 and -3 and prevented C2-ceramide-induced cell death. U0126 blocked PACAP-induced Bcl-2 expression, abrogated the inhibitory effect of PACAP on ceramide-induced caspase-9 activity, and promoted granule cell death. The present study reveals that C2-ceramide and PACAP exert opposite effects on Bax and Bcl-2 through, respectively, JNK- and ERK-dependent mechanisms. These data indicate that the mitochondrial pathway plays a pivotal role in the pro- and anti-apoptotic effects of C2-ceramide and PACAP.
