Circulating IL-6 levels correlate with the severity of blood-stage malaria in humans and mouse models, but the impact of IL-6 classic signaling through membrane IL-6Rα, as well as IL-6 trans-signaling through soluble IL-6Rα, on the outcome of malaria has remained unknown. In this study, we created IL-6Rα-deficient mice that exhibit a 50% survival of otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria of the genus Plasmodium chabaudi. Inducing IL-6 trans-signaling by injection of mouse recombinant soluble IL-6Rα in IL-6Rα-deficient mice restores the lethal outcome to malaria infection. In contrast, inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling via injection of recombinant sGP130Fc protein in control mice results in a 40% survival rate. Our data demonstrate that IL-6 trans-signaling, rather than classic IL-6 signaling, contributes to malaria-induced lethality in mice, preceded by an increased inflammatory response. Therefore, inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling may serve as a novel promising therapeutic basis to combat malaria.
