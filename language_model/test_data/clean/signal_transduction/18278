Stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor KIT play an important role in various biologic phases, such as hematopoiesis, reproduction, and regeneration. It has been possible to measure both soluble SCF and soluble KIT using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay since 1993 and 1995, respectively. Although the significance of interaction of soluble SCF with soluble KIT has not yet been elucidated, in certain diseases proteins fluctuate in human sera. We found that serum SCF levels were fivefold higher in patients with chronic renal failure than levels in healthy controls. We review the results of the analysis of SCF. In addition, possible pathologic mechanisms in various clinical abnormalities and the clinical potential for recombinant human SCF are discussed.
