Recent studies suggest a complex regulatory network in female gametophyte of angiosperm. The cell-cell communication between female gametes was confirmed during their maturation and functional specialization. The mitochondria-responsive signaling may play a critical role in this process. Here, we briefly summarized the recent discussion on this topic and proposed a two-pathway's mechanism for regulating coordinated development of the female gamete cells.
