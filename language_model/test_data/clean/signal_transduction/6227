Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB play important roles in learning and memory. Memory acquisition is associated with an increase in BDNF mRNA and TrkB activation in specific brain areas. Pharmacologic and genetic deprivation of BDNF or TrkB results in an impairment of memory. Activation of the mitogen-associated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways is involved in BDNF-dependent learning and memory. A frequent single nucleotide polymorphism in the targeting region of the human BDNF gene (val66met) is associated with poorer episodic memory and abnormal hippocampal neuronal function in humans. The interaction of BDNF/TrkB signaling with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors is important for spatial learning and memory, and an Src-family tyrosine kinase Fyn may play a key role in this interaction by linking TrkB with NR2B.
