Cellular senescence and apoptosis are two metabolically related and seemingly synergistic processes that are involved in tissue maintenance and homeostasis, anti-tumor protection, and age-related diseases. Despite this apparent co-operativity, senescence can inhibit apoptosis in certain conditions. Here, we describe senescence-apoptosis relationships in human epidermal cells by comparing apoptosis-related effector concentrations in keratinocyte cultures and epidermal skin cells at various stages of ageing. Using western blots, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence, we determined the amounts of apoptotic effectors in aged cells compared to young ones, in parallel with beta-galactosidase activity at neutral pH (senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, SA beta-gal), found to be a good indicator of cellular ageing. We observed increased levels of several Fas-mediated apoptosis effectors (Fas, Fas ligand, FADD, FLICE), both in cell cultures at advanced passages and in skin cells of aged donors (above 45 years). Furthermore, we found that while the pro-apoptotic p53 increased, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 declined. In spite of this, the extent of spontaneous apoptosis did not change in senescent keratinocyte cultures. The cells, however, became notably more susceptible to apoptosis when kept in exhausted growth medium, or upon Fas receptor activation by anti-Fas antibody binding. Our results are consistent with recent findings in senescent fibroblasts, showing that the death-signaling pathway is enhanced at senescence.
