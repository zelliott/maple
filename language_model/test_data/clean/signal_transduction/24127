RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) proteins are GTPase-activating proteins for the Galpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins and act to regulate signaling by rapidly cycling G protein. RGS proteins may integrate receptors and signaling pathways by physical or kinetic scaffolding mechanisms. To determine whether this results in enhancement and/or selectivity of agonist signaling, we have prepared C6 cells stably expressing the mu-opioid receptor and either pertussis toxin-insensitive or RGS- and pertussis toxin-insensitive Galpha(o). We have compared the activation of G protein, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, stimulation of intracellular calcium release, and activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway between cells expressing mutant Galpha(o) that is either RGS-insensitive or RGS-sensitive. The mu-receptor agonist [d-Ala(2),MePhe(4),Gly(5)-ol]enkephalin and partial agonist morphine were much more potent and/or had an increased maximal effect in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase and in activating MAPK in cells expressing RGS-insensitive Galpha(o). In contrast, mu-opioid agonist increases in intracellular calcium were less affected. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the GTPase-activating protein activity of RGS proteins provides a control that limits agonist action through effector pathways and may contribute to selectivity of activation of intracellular signaling pathways.
