Staurosporine is a potent apoptosis inducer, but its mechanism remains to be clarified. We investigated the involvement of PTEN in staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Ishikawa cells, from an endometrial carcinoma cell line, expressed a high amount of PTEN mRNA but did not express the PTEN protein because of protein truncations. We isolated clones expressing the steady-state level of the PTEN protein from PTEN-null Ishikawa cells by transfection. The obtained clones showed reduced proliferative activity and reduced anchorage-independent cell growth with the augmented p27(Kip1). These cell lines were sensitized to apoptosis by staurosporine. A low concentration of UCN-01 did not affect apoptosis, but a high concentration augmented apoptosis in the PTEN-expressing clone. Alpha-sphingosine and H-7 did not affect apoptosis in these cell lines. PI3K inhibition augmented staurosporine-induced apoptosis in the parental cell line, but not in the PTEN-expressing clone. In the clone, phosho-Akt/PKB and phospho-Bad (Ser-136) were downregulated. Staurosporine reduced the levels of phospho-Akt/PKB and phospho-Bad (Ser-136) in all the cell lines, but the reduction was most significant in the PTEN-expressing clone. These results suggest that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/PKB signaling pathway might be associated with staurosporine-induced apoptosis in Ishikawa cells.
