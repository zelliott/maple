Ras and Akt are signaling proteins that mediate fundamental aspects of normal growth and development in many organisms. When the Ras and Akt pathways become overly active, malignant transformation of normal tissue can occur. The combined activity of these two proteins has generated the transformation of human cell cultures and tumor formation in mice. In this review we highlight malignant glioma as a tumor type in which Ras and Akt pathways cooperate to cause tumorigenesis and regulate translation. The downstream components of these pathways have provided therapeutic targets that are currently being tested in clinical trials.
