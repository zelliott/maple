Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OX-LDL) contributes significantly to the development of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanisms of OX-LDL-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation are not completely understood. Therefore, we investigated the effect of OX-LDL on cell proliferation associated with a specific pattern of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by [3H]thymidine incorporation and p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation in canine cultured VSMCs. OX-LDL-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation and p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in VSMCs. Pretreatment of these cells with pertussis toxin (PTX) for 24 hours attenuated the OX-LDL-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation and p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation, indicating that these responses were mediated through a receptor coupled to a PTX-sensitive G protein. In cells pretreated with PMA for 24 h and with either the PKC inhibitor staurosporine or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein for 1h, substantially reduced the [3H]thymidine incorporation and p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation in response to OX-LDL. Removal of Ca(2+) by addition of BAPTA/AM plus EGTA significantly inhibited OX-LDL-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation and p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation, indicating the requirement of Ca(2+) for these responses. OX-LDL-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation and p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation was completely inhibited by PD98059 (an inhibitor of MEK1/2) and SB203580 (an inhibitor of p38 MAPK). Furthermore, we also showed that overexpression of dominant negative mutants of Ras (RasN17) and Raf (Raf-301) completely suppressed MEK1/2 and p42/p44 MAPK activation induced by OX-LDL and PDGF-BB, indicating that Ras and Raf may be required for activation of these kinases. Taken together, these results suggest that the mitogenic effect of OX-LDL is mediated through a PTX-sensitive G-protein-coupled receptor that involves the activation o Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway similar to those of PDGF-BB in canine cultured VSMCs.
