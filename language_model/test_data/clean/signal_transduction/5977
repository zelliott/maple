The DNA helicase RecQ is required for proper induction of the SOS response to replication stress in Escherichia coli. Unwinding of stalled replication forks by RecQ family helicases in bacteria, and possibly in eukaryotes, may provide a means of damage signaling and recovering stalled replication forks.
