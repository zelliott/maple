Activation, proliferation, or programmed cell death of T lymphocytes are dependent on controlled reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) production and ATP synthesis in mitochondria. The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Delta Psi(m)) also plays a decisive role in cell survival by controlling activity of redox-sensitive caspases. T lymphocytes of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) exhibit mitochondrial hyperpolarization, increased ROI production, diminished intracellular glutathione levels, cytoplasmic alkalinization, and ATP depletion that mediate enhanced spontaneous and diminished activation-induced apoptosis and sensitize lupus T cells to necrosis. These redox and metabolic checkpoints represent novel targets for pharmacological intervention in SLE.
