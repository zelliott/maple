Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and its downstream signaling targets are implicated in the process of apoptosis induced by external stimuli, in several mammalian systems. In this report, we demonstrate, that medfly (Ceratitis capitata) hemocytes do undergo apoptosis during larval development. In particular, we show using Western blot, ELISA and flow cytometry analysis, that FAK expression silencing in transfected by FAK double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) hemocytes, enhances twofold hemocyte apoptosis, by signaling through Src, MEK/ERK, and PI-3K/Akt signaling pathways. FAK expression silencing, in response to FAK dsRNA treatment, blocks partially the phosphorylation of its downstream targets. Pre-incubation of hemocytes, with specific inhibitors of FAK downstream signaling molecules, demonstrated that all these inhibitors reduced hemocyte viability and enhanced the magnitude of apoptosis about threefold. This data suggest that these pathways contribute to hemocyte survival and/or death during development. The expression and phosphorylation of FAK, Src, PI-3K p85a, Akt, and ERK signaling molecules appear to be dependent upon developmental stages. The expression and phosphorylation of the above signaling molecules, in annexin-positive and annexin-negative hemocytes is also distinct. The maximum expression and phosphorylation of FAK, Src, PI-3K p85a, Akt, and ERK appeared in annexin-positive hemocytes, in both early and late apoptotic hemocytes. The novel aspect of this report is based on the fact that hemocytes attempt to suppress apoptosis, by increasing the expression/phosphorylation of FAK and, hence its downstream targets signaling molecules Src, ERK, PI-3K p85a, and Akt. Evidently, the basic survival pathways among insects and mammals appear to remain unchanged, during evolution.
