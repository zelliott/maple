It is generally admitted that the pathogenesis of perivascular and interstitial cardiac fibrosis involves the response to two types of stimuli: a hormonal one, mainly involving the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the more recently described endothelin system, and a hemodynamic stimulus, particularly high blood pressure. We propose in the present review a third step which, although not exclusive, interacts with the hormonal and hemodynamic ones, and involves inflammatory mechanisms. Indeed, hypertension is invariably associated with inflammatory cell infiltration either in the intimal part of large vessels or in the adventitial region of arterioles. This has led us to hypothesize that arterial wall cells may trigger the initial communications attracting inflammatory cells to the perivascular region. In this paper, we review the proinflammatory intercellular communications as well as the intracellular signaling which confer an inflammatory phenotype to arteries. In this context, the profibrogenic and proinflammatory effects of hemodynamic overload and peptidergic systems such as angiotensin II and endothelin are considered. The study of the inflammatory process is not without interest, especially in view of the strong modulating effect of the inflammatory mediators both on the inflammatory process itself and on the fibrotic process. The principal and the most potent mediators are reviewed. Finally, the hypothesis that the inflammatory process could be in reality an immune specific process is suggested.
