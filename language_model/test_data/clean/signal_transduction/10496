Among peroxins involved in peroxisome biogenesis, only Pex8p is predominantly intraperoxisomal at steady state. Pex8p is necessary for peroxisomal matrix protein import via the PTS1 and PTS2 pathways. It is proposed to bridge two peroxisomal membrane subcomplexes comprised of the docking (Pex13p, Pex14p, Pex17p) and RING (Pex2p, Pex10p, Pex12p) peroxins and is also implicated in cargo release of PTS1 proteins in the matrix. We show that Pichia pastoris Pex8p (PpPex8p) enters the peroxisome matrix using two redundant pathways in a Pex14p-dependent, but Pex2p-independent, manner, showing that the intact importomer and RING subcomplex are not required for its import. One pathway depends on the TPR motifs in Pex5p, the C-terminal PTS1 sequence (AKL) in PpPex8p, and the intraperoxisomal presence of this peroxin. The alternative pathway uses the PTS2 receptor, Pex7p, its accessory protein, Pex20p, and a putative PTS2 motif in PpPex8p, but does not require intraperoxisomal PpPex8p. Pex20p interaction with PpPex8p is independent of Pex7p, but the interaction of PpPex8p with Pex7p requires Pex20p. These data suggest a direct interaction between PpPex8p and Pex20p. Our studies shed light on the mechanism and evolution of the dual import pathways for PpPex8p.
