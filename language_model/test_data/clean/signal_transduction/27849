Identification of a counterstructure for the human cytomegalovirus-encoded major histocompatibility complex class I-related gene product, UL18, has led to the discovery of a novel family of immunoreceptors, termed leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LIRs). The LIRs are differentially expressed in cells of the dendritic cell, monocytic and lymphocytic lineages, and appear to mediate diverse roles in immune regulation. This review summarizes the expression, distribution, and signaling capacities of the LIRs and discusses possible roles of the LIRs in both inhibition and activation of the cellular responses.
