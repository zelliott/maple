Quorum sensing (QS) regulation appears to be a consequence of interbacterial communication by which bacteria of one or even different species learn about their current population density and react in a defined way to that information. QS-regulation is a three step process: in the first step specific signaling molecules are produced and secreted to the exterior space. In the second step, the molecules accumulate e.g. with growing population density. In the last step, a supra-threshold concentration of the molecules is extra- or intra-cellularly sensed by the bacteria and leads to a cascade of regulatory activities. While Gram-negative bacteria can employ five or more different chemical classes of signaling molecules, Gram-positive cocci predominantly use special oligopeptides for specific signaling.

Examples of QS-regulatory effects on virulence factor expression in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis are given. In these bacteria, QS-regulation appears to be crucial for displaying tissue invasiveness and/or biofilm formation.

The high specificity of the initial signal sensing and the importance for expressing special virulence traits make this type of gene expression control a promising target for the development of novel therapeutics. The options for such therapies are critically discussed based on practical experiences with interference in S. aureus QS-regulation.
