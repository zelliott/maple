How the unique chromatin configuration of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) integrates inputs from exogenous stimuli to maintain pluripotency remains largely unknown. The ESC-specific ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling (esBAF) complex maintains the accessibility of the target sites of Stat3, a leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signalling effector, by preventing repressive localized polycomb-mediated trimethylation of Lys 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3).
