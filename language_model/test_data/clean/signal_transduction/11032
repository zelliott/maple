According to our suggested hypothesis, long-term memory is a collection of "gnostic units," selectively tuned to past events. The formation of long-term memory occurs with the involvement of constantly appearing new neurons which differentiate from stem cells during the process of neurogenesis, in particular in adults. Conversion of precursor neurons into "gnostic units" selective in relation to ongoing events, supplemented by the involvement of hippocampal "novelty neurons," which increase the flow of information needing to be fixed in long-term memory. "Gnostic units" form before the informational processes occurring in the ventral ("what?") and dorsal ("where?") systems. Formation of new "gnostic units" selectively tuned to a particular event results from the combination of excitation of the detector for stimulus characteristics and the novelty signal generated by "novelty neurons" in the hippocampus.
