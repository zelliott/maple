Microorganisms often use small chemicals or secondary metabolites as informational cues to regulate gene expression. It is hypothesized that microorganisms exploit these signals to gain a competitive advantage. Here, we present examples of pathogens that use this strategy to exclude other microorganisms from the site of infection. An emerging theme is that inhibiting these systems presents a novel approach to antimicrobial therapies.
