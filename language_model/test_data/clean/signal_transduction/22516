The link between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induction of autophagy has been well documented, but the molecular mechanisms regulating this phenomenon are only beginning to be elucidated. Autophagy is now being appreciated as an integral part of the cellular response to many diverse types of cellular stresses including nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, and likely the mechanism(s) for each type of stress vary considerably. The cellular outcome of inducing autophagy in response to stress is also quite complex, and depends on many factors including cellular context, type and magnitude of stress.
