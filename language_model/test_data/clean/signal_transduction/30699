Anti-HLA Abs have been shown to contribute to the process of transplant vasculopathy by binding to HLA class I molecules expressed by the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the graft and transducing intracellular signals that elicit cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to determine the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in HLA class I-induced endothelial cell proliferation and to explore in depth the relationship between mTOR complexes and their downstream targets following ligation of HLA class I molecules by anti-HLA Abs. We used small interfering RNA technology to abrogate mTOR, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (rictor), or regulatory associated protein of mTOR (raptor) to study the function of these gene products to activate proteins involved in MHC class I-induced cell proliferation and survival. Knockdown of mTOR inhibited class I-mediated phosphorylation of proteins downstream of mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex 2. Furthermore, knockdown of mTOR, rictor, or raptor blocked HLA class I-induced endothelial cell proliferation. Long-term pretreatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin significantly blocked both mTOR-raptor and mTOR-rictor complex formation. Interestingly, rapamycin also blocked class I-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser(473) and Bcl-2 expression. These results support the role of anti-HLA Abs in the process of transplant vasculopathy and suggest that exposure of the graft endothelium to anti-HLA Abs may promote proliferation through the mTOR pathway.
