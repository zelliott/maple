Repulsive signaling plays a prominent role in regulating cell-cell interactions and is fundamental to multiple developmental processes. A proper balance between repulsion from and adhesion to other cells or the extracellular matrix is also important. Semaphorin-Plexin and ephrin-Eph ligand-receptor pairs compose two major repulsive signaling systems. Recent advances have elucidated mechanisms by which Semaphorin-Plexin and ephrin-Eph signaling control repulsion versus adhesion. Semaphorins act through a complex signaling pathway to inhibit integrin-mediated adhesion, allowing cell repulsion. Ephrin-Eph interactions can directly mediate cell adhesion and several mechanisms control whether ephrin-Eph binding and signaling induces repulsion or adhesion.
