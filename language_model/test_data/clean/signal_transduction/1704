Oxylipins comprise a group of biologically active compounds whose structural diversity is generated by the coordinate action of lipases, lipoxygenases, and a group of cytochromes P450 that are specialized for the metabolism of hydroperoxy fatty acids. Research on oxylipins has focused mainly on the biosynthesis of the plant signaling molecule jasmonic acid, and its role in the regulation of developmental and defense-related processes. Recent genetic studies indicate that metabolic precursors of jasmonate are active as signals in their own right, and that the synthesis and perception of jasmonates is critical for wound-induced systemic defense responses. Increasing evidence indicates that the collective biological importance of oxylipins in plants is comparable to that of the eicosanoid family of lipid mediators in animals.
