The diphosphoinositol polyphosphates comprise a group of highly phosphorylated compounds which have a rapid rate of metabolic turnover through tightly-regulated kinase/phosphohydrolase substrate cycles. The phosphohydrolases occur as multiple isoforms, the expression of which is apparently carefully controlled. Cellular levels of the diphosphoinositol polyphosphates are regulated by cAMP and cGMP in a protein kinase-independent manner. These inositides can also sense a specific mode of intracellular Ca2+ pool depletion. In this review, we will argue that these are characteristics of highly significant cellular molecules.
