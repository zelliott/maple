To investigate the effects of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and the Rho/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway on adhesion of dental pulp cells (DPCs).

Human DPCs were cultured ex vivo. After treatment of LPA and Y-27632, a specific ROCK inhibitor, changes in focal contacts (FCs) were examined by immunofluorescent staining. Activation of FCs proteins was examined by measuring tyrosine 397 phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin using immunoblotting. The data were analysed by Student's t-test.

The immunofluorescent staining indicated LPA stimulation induced larger focal adhesion in the cell periphery, compared with the control. Inhibition of ROCK by Y-27632 decreased the formation of FCs markedly, even in the LPA-stimulated cells. LPA also increased the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin at 30min (P<0.05) and FAK at 5 and 30min (P<0.05). Furthermore, p-paxillin levels declined immediately after Y-27632 treatment and remained low at 5, 30, 60min. Y-27632 also suppressed the effects of LPA on p-paxillin and p-FAK at 5 and 30min (P<0.05).

LPA activated Rho and then subsequently activated ROCK, suggesting that LPA influences the FCs of DPCs by modulating tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin via the Rho/ROCK pathway.
