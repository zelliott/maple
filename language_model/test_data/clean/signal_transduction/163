YCP, a novel (1,4)-alpha-D-glucan, was isolated from the mycelium of the marine filamentous fungus Phoma herbarum YS4108. In this work, we investigated a YCP-binding cellular receptor expressed by macrophages and the intracellular signal transduction pathways involved in YCP-induced macrophage activation.

Fluorescence-labeled YCP (fl-YCP) was prepared using the CDAP-activation method. Fluorescence confocal laser microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were used to analyze the effect of fl-YCP on macrophages. To characterize the properties of the YCP receptor, carbohydrates and antibodies were used to inhibit the binding of fl-YCP to macrophages. Moreover, we investigated the role of membrane receptors Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Toll-like receptor 6 (TLR6) and complement receptor 3 (CR3). We also examined the role of the p38 kinase pathway in mediating nitric oxide (NO) production.

YCP had an in vitro stimulatory effect on the release of NO in macrophage, and fl-YCP can bind directly to receptors on the surface of macrophages in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Competition studies show that LPS, laminarin, anti-TLR4 antibody and anti-CD11b (CR3) antibody could inhibit fl-YCP binding to macrophages. Conversely, mannose, anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR6 antibody could not. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with YCP resulted in significant activation of p38 in a time-dependent manner. The specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 abrogated YCP-induced NO generation. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with anti-TLR4 antibody and anti-CR3 antibody significantly reduced YCP-induced NO production and p38 activation.

We have demonstrated that YCP-induced NO production occurs through the TLR4 and CR3 membrane receptors in a p38 kinase-dependent manner in macrophages.Acta Pharmacologica Sinica (2009) 30: 1008-1014; doi: 10.1038/aps.2009.93.
