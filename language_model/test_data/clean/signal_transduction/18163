The effect of a temporal gradient in shear and steady shear on the activity of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/ERK2), c-fos, and connexin43 (Cx43) in human endothelial cells was investigated. Three laminar flow profiles (16 dyn/cm(2)), including impulse flow (shear stress abruptly applied for 3 s), ramp flow (shear stress smoothly transitioned at flow onset), and step flow (shear stress abruptly applied at flow onset) were utilized. Relative to static controls, impulse flow stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 8.5- to 7.5-fold, respectively at 10 min, as well as the mRNA expression of c-fos 51-fold at 30 min, and Cx43 8-fold at 90 min. These high levels of mRNA expression were sustained for at least 4 h. In contrast, ramp flow was unable to significantly induce gene expression and even inhibited the activation of ERK1/ERK2. Step flow, which contains both a sharp temporal gradient in shear stress and a steady shear component, elicited only moderate and transient responses, indicating the distinct role of these fluid shear stimuli in endothelial signal transduction. The specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase PD-98059 inhibited impulse flow-induced c-fos and Cx43 mRNA expression. Thus these findings implicate the involvement of ERK1/ERK2, c-fos, and Cx43 in the signaling pathway induced by the temporal gradient in shear.
