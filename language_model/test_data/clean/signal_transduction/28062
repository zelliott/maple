In tumor-bearing mice and cancer patients, tumor progression is often associated with altered hematopoiesis leading to the accumulation of myeloid cells. Extensive studies in preclinical models indicate that these cells share the CD11b and the Gr-1 markers, possess a mixed mature-immature myeloid phenotype, and are responsible for the induction of T-cell dysfunctions, both tumor-specific and nonspecific. Moreover, CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) myeloid cells are described under different unrelated situations associated with temporary impairment of the T-lymphocyte reactivity. This review examines recent findings on the nature, properties, and mechanisms of action of these myeloid suppressor cells (MSCs).
