The geomagnetic field (GMF) is steadily acting on living systems, and influences many biological processes. In animals, the mechanistic origin of the GMF effect has been clarified and cryptochrome has been suggested as a chemical magnetoreceptor. Here we propose a possible role for the GMF variations in plant evolution.
