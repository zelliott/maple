Binding fibrinogen to activated glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa is the final common pathway of platelet aggregation and has become a successful target for antiplatelet therapy. In the present study, we found that a small chemical compound, 3,4-methyl-enedioxy-beta-nitrostyrene (MNS), exhibited potent and broad-spectrum inhibitory effects on human platelet aggregation caused by various stimulators. Moreover, addition of MNS to human platelets that had been aggregated by ADP caused a rapid disaggregation. We demonstrated that the antiaggregatory activity of MNS is due to inhibition of GPIIb/IIIa activation by measuring the binding amount of PAC-1 in platelets. In contrast, MNS is not a direct antagonist of GPIIb/IIIa, because MNS did not affect fibrinogen binding to fixed ADP-stimulated platelets. By investigating how MNS inhibits GPIIb/IIIa activation, we found that MNS potently inhibited the activity of tyrosine kinases (Src and Syk) and prevented protein tyrosine phosphorylation and cytoskeletal association of GPIIb/IIIa and talin, but it had no direct effects on protein kinase C, Ca2+ mobilization, Ca2+-dependent enzymes (myosin light chain kinase and calpain), and arachidonic acid metabolism, and it did not affect the cellular levels of cyclic nucleotides. Therefore, MNS represents a new class of tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently prevents GPIIb/IIIa activation and platelet aggregation without directly affecting other signaling pathways required for platelet activation. Because MNS inhibits GPIIb/IIIa functions in a manner different from GPIIb/IIIa antagonists, this feature may provide a new strategy for treatment of platelet-dependent thrombosis.
