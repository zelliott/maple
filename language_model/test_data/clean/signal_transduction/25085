We report the presence of interleukin (IL)-8-immunoreactive molecules in hemocytes from the mollusc Mytilus galloprovincialis. Functional studies demonstrate that recombinant human (rh)IL-8 provokes conformational changes, induces chemotaxis, and increases bacterial phagocytic activity in hemocytes. rhIL-8 induces cell shape changes via protein kinase A and C pathways. These morphological changes are followed by reorganization of the actin microfilaments. The findings suggest that, as previously reported for other cytokines, IL-8 is well conserved and deeply involved in immune functions from invertebrates to mammals.
