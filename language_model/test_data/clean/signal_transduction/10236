Interleukin (IL)-12 immunotherapy is highly effective against established immunogenic tumors. However, nonimmunogenic tumors fail to respond to IL-12 therapy. Analysis of tumor rejection of the immunogenic tumors shows that a preexisting antitumor immune response is required for an effective IL-12 response. It is not known whether this lack of a preexisting host antitumor immune response is a limiting factor for the lack of response to IL-12 therapy by nonimmunogenic tumors.

Experiments were done using the spontaneously arising nonimmunogenic metastatic murine breast 4T1 carcinoma in normal and STAT6 knockout BALB/c mice.

4T1 is nonimmunogenic in normal mice, and established subcutaneous tumors are resistant to immunotherapy with cyclophosphamide (Cy) plus IL-12. However, in STAT6 knockout mice, 4T1 becomes immunogenic, and established 4T1 tumors are eradicated by Cy plus IL-12. Adoptive transfer of spleen cells from normal mice into STAT6 knockout mice before tumor inoculation reduces both the immunogenicity and response to Cy plus IL-12 immunotherapy of 4T1 in the recipient mice.

Cy plus IL-12 immunotherapy can eradicate nonimmunogenic tumors as long as a preexisting immunity is established in the tumor-bearing host. Furthermore, the STAT6 pathway is likely involved in the suppression of the development of host antitumor immunity.
