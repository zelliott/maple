Leptin is an endocrine and a growth factor which is important for regulation of body fat, feeding, and energy homeostasis. The anti-obesity function of leptin has been recently extended to reproduction, puberty and pregnancy as an endocrine signal to the hypothalamus. Leptin controls the functional integrity of the feto-placental unit thereby maintaining pregnancy by virtue of its immunomodulatory property via T lymphocytes or other proto-oncogenes. Dysregulation of autocrine/paracrine function of leptin at feto-placento-maternal interface may be implicated in the pathogenesis of recurrent miscarriage gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine fetal growth retardation including disturbance of fetal bone turnover. This review will focus on the role of leptin in normal and abnormal pregnancy and fetal growth.
