The inability of the adult injured mammalian spinal cord to successfully regenerate is not well understood. Studies suggest that both extrinsic and intrinsic factors contribute to regeneration failure. In this review, we focus on intrinsic factors that impact regeneration, in particular integrin receptors and their downstream signaling pathways. We discuss studies that address the impact of integrins and integrin signaling pathways on growth cone guidance and motility and how lessons learned from these studies apply to spinal cord regeneration in vivo.
