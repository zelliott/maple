A novel calcium-dependent protein kinase gene (designated as IiCPK2) was cloned from tetraploid Isatis indigotica. The full-length cDNA of IiCPK2 was 2585 bp long with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1878 bp encoding a polypeptide of 625 amino acid residues. The predicted IiCPK2 polypeptide included three domains: a kinase domain, a junction domain (or autoinhibitory region), and a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain (or calcium-binding domain), which presented a typical structure of plant CDPKs. Further analysis of IiCPK2 genomic DNA revealed that it contained 7 exons, 6 introns and the length of most exons was highly conserved. Semi-quantitative RTPCR revealed that the expression of IiCPK2 in root, stem and leaf were much higher in tetraploid sample than that in diploid progenitor. Further expression analysis revealed that gibberellin (GA3), NaCl and cold treatments could upregulate the IiCPK2 transcription. All our findings suggest that IiCPK2 might participate in the cold, high salinity and GA3 responsive pathways.
