beta-catenin plays a central part in cell adhesion as a structural component of the cadherin complex. In a seemingly disparate role, it is also important in embryo patterning, and now has emerged as a leading actor in carcinogenesis. beta-catenin achieves its diverse functions by interacting with many partners. The recent structure of the core domain from beta-catenin suggests how this talented molecule can achieve its many functions.
