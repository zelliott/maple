Receptor agonists that initiate fluid secretion in salivary gland epithelial cells also increase protein phosphorylation. To assess contributions of tyrosine phosphorylation to secretion, changes in muscarinic receptor-initiated secretion (estimated from sodium pump-dependent increases in oxygen consumption) were measured in parotid acinar cells exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, like the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone, tyrphostins AG10 and AG18 increased the rate of oxygen consumption and reduced cellular ATP by approximately 90% in the absence of the muscarinic agonist carbachol, indicating that these tyrphostins uncouple mitochondria. Exposure of isolated mitochondria to five structurally related tyrphostins demonstrated that their relative potencies as uncouplers differed from their in vitro kinase-inhibitory potencies due to different molecular requirements for the two effects. AG10 and AG18 blocked parotid phosphorylation events only at concentrations that reduced ATP content. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein reduced ATP content by 15-20% and weakly uncoupled isolated mitochondria, but its inhibition of carbachol-mediated protein kinase Cdelta tyrosine phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation appeared attributable to blocking tyrosine kinases directly. Carbachol itself rapidly reduced ATP content by 15-20%. Carbachol, 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl adenosine 5'-triphosphate (P2X(7) receptor agonist), AG10, AG18, and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone rapidly activated the fuel sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); however, only AMPK activation by carbachol and BzATP was due to sodium pump stimulation. AG10 and AG18 also activated AMPK and/or uncoupled mitochondria in PC12, HeLa, and HEK293 cells. These studies demonstrate that some tyrosine kinase inhibitors produce cellular effects that are mechanistically different from their primary in vitro characterizations and, as do salivary secretory stimuli, promote rapid metabolic alterations that initiate secondary signaling events.
