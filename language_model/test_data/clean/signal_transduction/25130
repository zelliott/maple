Bronchial glands, which consist of mucous and serous cells, are abundant in human airways, playing a major role in the airway secretion. Cl(-) secretion is accompanied by water transport to the lumen in the acinar cells of bronchial glands. Agonists that increase [Ca(2+)]i induce the Cl(-) secretion in bronchial glands. Ca(2+) release from a IP(3)-sensitive Ca(2+) pool at the apical portion stimulates and opens Ca(2+)-sensitive Cl(-) channels at the apical membrane, producing Cl(-) secretion in bronchial glands. K(+) channels at the basolateral membranes are Ca(2+)-sensitive and activated by Ca(2+) release from a cADPribose-sensitive Ca(2+) pool, maintaining the Cl(-) secretion in bronchial glands. Further, cADP ribose in concert with IP(3) induce [Ca(2+)]i oscillation, inducing Cl(-) secretion in bronchial glands. Some tyrosine kinases are involved in the Cl(-) secretion in bronchial glands. Mucous and serous cells in bronchial glands take part in mucin secretion and the secretion of defensive substances (glycoconjugates), respectively. [Ca(2+)]i oscillations are shown to play a central role in the exocytosis of secretory granules in serous cells of bronchial glands. Other signal transductions of mucin and glycoconjugates in airway gland cells remain to be studied, although agonists which increase [cAMP]i are also well known to induce mucin and glycoconjugate secretion from airway glands.
