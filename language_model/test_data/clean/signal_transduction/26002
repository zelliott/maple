SapC-DOPS is a newly combined compound consisting of saposin C and dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS). Our recent study showed that SapC-DOPS exhibits anti-tumor activity. However, SapC-DOPS has recognition elements of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4; therefore, we want to know whether SapC-DOPS can induce abnormal immunoreaction via identification TLRs.

We investigated the capacity of SapC-DOPS to induce cytokines in vivo and in vitro and analyzed the involvement of TLR and NF-kB in these cytokines production.

SapC-DOPS could activate the cytokine production by peripheral macrophages, enhance the expressions of TLR4 and stimulate the NF-κB nuclear translocation. PDTC, an NF-κB inhibitor, could decrease the SapC-DOPS inducible TNF-α and IL-1β production.

SapC-DOPS was similar to LPS in the immune response and may induce the production of cytokines in macrophages via the TLR4 signaling pathway and, at least in part, the alteration of the NF-κB pathway.
