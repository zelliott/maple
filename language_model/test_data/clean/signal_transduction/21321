23A2 myoblasts expressing GAP-resistant, constitutively active G12V:H-Ras (A2:G12V:H-Ras myoblasts) display a transformed morphology and do not undergo mitogen-deprivation-induced differentiation or the associated apoptosis. To determine the phenotype induced by F156L:H-Ras, a constitutively active mutant with enhanced nucleotide exchange activity rather than impaired GAP-stimulated GTPase activity, myoblast cell lines were established that stably express F156L:H-Ras at levels of H-Ras comparable to the A2:G12V:H-Ras myoblasts. These A2:F156L:H-Ras myoblast cell lines do not possess a transformed morphology, and while differentiation and apoptosis are impaired, these processes are not abrogated as in the A2:G12V:H-Ras myoblasts. Surprisingly, while expression of either G12V:H-Ras or F156L:H-Ras results in constitutive signaling through PI3-kinase, only cells expressing G12V:H-Ras additionally possess constitutive signaling through MAPK, and NFkappaB. Pharmacological abrogation of the Ras-induced constitutive PI3-kinase signal, however, is not responsible for the impaired differentiation or apoptosis in either A2:G12V:H-Ras myoblasts or A2:F156L:H-Ras myoblasts. Thus, our data suggest that a pathway distinct from those that signals through MAPK, NFkappaB or PI3-kinase is responsible for the impaired differentiation and apoptosis in 23A2 skeletal myoblasts expressing constitutively active Ras.
