To compare activation of G proteins by opioid receptors, opioid agonist-stimulated guanosine 5'-O-(3-[35S]thiotriphosphate) ([35S]GTP gamma S) binding in the presence of excess GDP was assayed in membranes from NG108-15 (delta) and SK-N-SH (primarily mu) cells. Basal [35S]GTP gamma S binding consisted of a single class of low-affinity sites (KD 400-500 nM). Addition of agonists produced a high-affinity site 100-300-fold higher in affinity than the basal site. The receptor/transducer amplification factor (ratio of activated G protein Bmax to opioid receptor Bmax) was 10-fold higher for SK-N-SH mu receptors than for NG108-15 delta receptors. Chronic delta agonist ([D-Ser2]-Leu-enkephalin-Thr; DSLET) treatment of NG108-15 cells resulted in an 80% loss of DSLET-stimulated [35S]-GTP gamma S binding within 1 h. Morphine treatment of SK-N-SH cells decreased mu agonist ([D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin; DAMGO)-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding by 45% after 16 h, with no effect after 1 h. Loss of agonist response was due to a decrease in the Bmax of activated G proteins with no change in the KD. These results provide a quantitative description of G protein activation occurring on acute and chronic exposure to opioid agonists.
