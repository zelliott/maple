B lymphocyte generation in bone marrow (BM) compensates for cell loses. The Fas / Fas ligand (FasL) pathway has been implicated in apoptosis of various cell types. Abnormalities of the Fas receptor or of FasL expression are associated with excessive T cell proliferation and autoimmunity. To examine the role of the Fas / FasL system in B cell differentiation, we created double-chimeric mice by transferring both C57BL / 6 (B6)-Fas(+) and lpr-FasL(+) BM cells into RAG-2(- / -) hosts. Equal numbers of stem cells were co-injected into sublethally irradiated recipients, and their progeny were studied by using antibodies directed against the B6-Ly5. 1(+)5.2(+) and lpr-Ly5.1(-)5.2(+) populations. A longitudinal study lasting for up to 6 months revealed that cells of the lpr phenotype dominated the B6 phenotype in the BM, as a result of their active proliferation. Analysis of the B cell compartment showed more lpr than B6 cells among immature HSA(hi)B220(lo) populations. In contrast, the lpr and B6 phenotypes were equally represented among mature B cells. BM transfer to second hosts indicated that B6-derived B cell progenitors were absent from the first host. These data suggest that activation of the Fas / FasL pathway disturbs the early steps of B cell development and might therefore contribute to the onset of autoimmune disorders.
