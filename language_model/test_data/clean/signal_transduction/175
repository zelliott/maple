Adult human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) containing or consisting of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an important source in tissue homeostasis and repair. Although many processes involved in their differentiation into diverse lineages have been deciphered, substantial inroads remain to be gained to synthesize a complete regulatory picture. The present study suggests that structural conformation of extracellular collagen I, the major organic matrix component in musculoskeletal tissues, plays, along with differentiation stimuli, a decisive role in the selection of differentiation lineage. It introduces a novel concept which proposes that structural transition of collagen I matrix regulates cell differentiation through distinct signaling pathways specific for the structural state of the matrix. Thus, on native collagen I matrix inefficient adipogenesis is p38-independent, whereas on its denatured counterpart, an efficient adipogenesis is primarily regulated by p38 kinase. Inversely, osteogenic differentiation occurs efficiently on native, but not on denatured collagen I matrix, with a low commencement threshold on the former and a substantially higher one on the latter. Osteogenesis on collagen I matrices in both structural conformations is fully dependent on ERK. However, whereas on native collagen I matrix osteogenic differentiation is Hsp90-dependent, on denatured collagen I matrix it is Hsp90-independent. The matrix conformation-mediated regulation appears to be one of the mechanisms determining differentiation lineage of BMSCs. It allows a novel interpretation of the bone remodeling cycle, explains the marked physiological aging-related adipogenic shift in musculoskeletal tissues, and can be a principal contributor to adipogenic shift seen in a number of clinical disorders.
