The Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases Fyn and Lyn are expressed in lymphocytes. Fyn is expressed in T cells at elevated levels and is associated with the T cell antigen receptor complex, whereas Lyn is expressed in B cells and is associated with membrane-bound immunoglobulin. Thus, these kinases are suggested to participate in antigen-mediated signal transduction in lymphocytes. Previous report showed that fyn was also expressed in brain, but its cellular distribution was not examined. Expression of Lyn in neural tissues was not previously reported. Here we report that both fyn and lyn are expressed in discrete regions of the brain. To throw light on their functions in the brain, we investigated their expressions during brain ontogenesis in mice. In situ hybridization analysis showed that Fyn mRNA was specifically expressed in neurons of embryos and newborn mice. In adult animals, fyn mRNA was expressed in oligodendrocytes as well as neurons. In contrast, the expression of lyn mRNA was relatively low in brains of embryos and newborn mice, but in adults the transcript was specifically expressed in the granular layer of the cerebellum. Therefore, the Fyn and Lyn kinases may regulate distinct functions of specific cells during brain development. The specific expressions of Fyn and Lyn in both lymphatic and neural tissues could suggest common signalling mechanisms in the immune system and central nervous system.
