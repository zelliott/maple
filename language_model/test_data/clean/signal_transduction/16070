Chronic pulmonary disease and heart failure reduce drug clearance and consequently enhance adverse drug reactions. The mechanisms of action underlying the regulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and membrane carrier proteins by hypoxia, and the clinical consequences of the regulation of CYP by hypoxia, alone or combined with other conditions have been elucidated in the last decades. Overall, a reduced drug clearance appears to be associated with hypoxemia.

In this review, the mechanisms of action underlying hypoxia-induced regulation of CYP enzymes are discussed. The authors also revise the effects of hypoxia on serum mediators, signal transduction pathways, orphan nuclear receptors, transcription factors and post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating CYP and membrane carrier proteins expression. Additionally, the paper also discusses the clinical repercussions of hypoxia-induced changes in CYP and membrane carrier proteins activity.

Acute systemic hypoxia down-regulates selected CYP isoforms and up-regulates CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, changing the metabolic clearance of drugs and endogenous compounds biotransformed by these isoforms as well as the kinetics. In patients with acute hypoxia, the dosage of drugs, biotransformed by CYP isoforms, may need to be adjusted. Tissue hypoxia enhances the expression of efflux membrane carrier proteins, increasing the probability of drug resistance.
