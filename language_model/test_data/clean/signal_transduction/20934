Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF1 were found as components of the TNFR2 signaling complex, which exerts multiple biological effects on cells such as cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cell death. In the TNFR2-mediated signaling pathways, TRAF2 works as a mediator for activation signals such as NF-kappaB, but the role of TRAF1 has not been previously determined. Here we show in transgenic mice that TRAF1 overexpression inhibits antigen-induced apoptosis of CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Our results demonstrate a biological role for TRAF1 as a regulator of apoptotic signals and also support the hypothesis that the combination of TRAF proteins in a given cell type determines distinct biological effects triggered by members of the TNF receptor superfamily.
