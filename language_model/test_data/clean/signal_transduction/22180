The plasticity of the central nervous system helps form the basis for the neurobiology of learning and memory. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is the main form of synaptic plasticity, reflecting the activity level of the synaptic information storage process, and provides a good model to study the underlying mechanisms of learning and memory. The glutamate receptor-mediated signal pathway plays a key role in the induction and maintenance of LTP, and hence the regulation of learning and memory. The progress in the understanding of the glutamate receptors and related signal transduction systems in learning and memory research are reviewed in this article.
