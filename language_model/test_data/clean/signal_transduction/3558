Helicobacter pylori CagA is delivered into gastric epithelial cells, where undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at the Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motif to interact with Src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) oncoprotein. CagA also binds to partitioning-defective 1 (PAR1) polarity-regulating kinase via the CagA multimerization (CM) sequence. To investigate pathophysiological role of CagA-SHP2 and/or CagA-PAR1 interaction in H. pylori infection, we generated H. pylori isogenic strains producing a phosphorylation-resistant CagA and a CagA without CM sequence. Infection studies revealed that deregulation of epithelial cell motility was more prominent in the wild-type strain than in the mutant strains. Thus, both CagA-SHP2 and CagA-PAR1 interactions are involved in the pathogenicity of cagA-positive H. pylori.
