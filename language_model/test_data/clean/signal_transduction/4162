Pulsatile secretion of hormones are observed in many endocrine systems. Here we discuss the significance of pulsatile patterns of hormone secretion for the regulation of endocrine target tissues in physiology and pathophysiology. New approaches to analyze endocrine rhythms are introduced that may enable to better define the temporal patterns of secretion relevant for the regulation of distinct processes in complex in vivo systems. This may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of endocrine diseases.
