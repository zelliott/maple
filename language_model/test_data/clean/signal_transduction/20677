A description of the molecular make-up of the ancestral multicellular animal is emerging from the growing availability of molecular biological and biochemical data gleaned from the study of modern members of ancient groups of animals. We use the distributions of classes of transcription factors, signal transduction systems and other molecular innovations among metazoan phyla to infer some of the characteristics of the first animals.
