This study aims to investigate in vitro the effect of the VDR agonist BXL-01-0029 onto IFNγ/TNFα-induced CXCL10 secretion by human skeletal muscle cells compared to elocalcitol (VDR agonist), methylprednisolone, methotrexate, cyclosporin A, infliximab and leflunomide; to assess in vivo circulating CXCL10 level in subjects at time of diagnosis with IMs, before therapy, together with TNFα, IFNγ, IL-8, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1β and IL-10, vs. healthy subjects.

Human fetal skeletal muscle cells were used for in vitro studies; ELISA and Bio-Plex were used to measure cell supernatant and IC50 determination or serum cytokines; Western blot and Bio-Plex were for cell signaling analysis.

BXL-01-0029 decreased with the highest potency IFNγ/TNFα-induced CXCL10 protein secretion and targeted cell signaling downstream of TNFα in human skeletal muscle cells; CXCL10 level was the highest in sera of subjects diagnosed with IMs before therapy and the only one significantly different vs. healthy controls.

Our in vitro and in vivo data, while confirm the relevance of CXCL10 in IMs, suggested BXL-01-0029 as a novel pharmacological tool for IM treatment, hypothetically to be used in combination with the current immunosuppressants to minimize side effects.
