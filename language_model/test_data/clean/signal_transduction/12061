The Ras superfamily G-proteins are monomeric proteins of approximately 21kDa that act as a molecular switch to regulate a variety of cellular processes. The structure of the Ras superfamily G-proteins, their regulators as well as posttranslational modification of these proteins leading to their membrane association have been elucidated. The Ras superfamily G-proteins interact at their effector domains with their downstream effectors via protein-protein interactions. Mutational activation or overexpression of the Ras superfamily G-proteins has been observed in a number of human cancer cases. Over the years, a variety of approaches to inhibit the Ras superfamily G-proteins have been developed. These different approaches are discussed in this volume.
