B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by clonally expanded and molecularly heterogeneous populations of B lymphocytes with impaired apoptotic mechanisms. This occurs as a result of multiple genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, including chromosomal aberrations and enhancer region hypomethylation, often impinging on intracellular signaling pathways that are essential to normal B-cell activation, proliferation, and survival. The B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling is one such pathway usurped by malignant B cells, as exemplified by the early phase clinical success achieved by small-molecule agents targeting key players involved in the pathway. Such new targeted agents, including those that inhibit the function of Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K), and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), along with the current standard therapy comprising chemo-immunotherapies with or without B-cell depleting biologic agent rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody), should expand the armamentarium for CLL therapy. We review the therapeutic agents currently in clinical development which target different effectors of the malignant BCR signaling, and discuss their overlapping and discriminating translational opportunities in the context of CLL treatment.
