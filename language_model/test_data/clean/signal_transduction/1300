Plasmodesmata (Pd) are channels in the plant cell wall that in conjunction with associated phloem form an intercellular communication network that supports the cell-to-cell and long-distance trafficking of a wide spectrum of endogenous proteins and ribonucleoprotein complexes. The trafficking of such macromolecules is of importance in the orchestration of non-cell autonomous developmental and physiological processes. Plant viruses encode movement proteins (MPs) that subvert this communication network to facilitate the spread of infection. These viral proteins thus represent excellent experimental keys for exploring the mechanisms involved in intercellular trafficking and communication via Pd.
