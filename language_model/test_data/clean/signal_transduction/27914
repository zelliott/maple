Addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to cells in the form of LPS-soluble (s)CD14 complexes induces strong cellular responses. During this process, LPS is delivered from sCD14 to the plasma membrane, and the cell-associated LPS is then rapidly transported to an intracellular site. This transport appears to be important for certain cellular responses to LPS, as drugs that block transport also inhibit signaling and cells from LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice fail to exhibit this transport. To identify the intracellular destination of fluorescently labeled LPS after its delivery from sCD14 into cells, we have made simultaneous observations of different organelles using fluorescent vital dyes or probes. Endosomes, lysosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus were labeled using Texas red (TR)-dextran, LysoTrackertrade mark Red DND-99, DiOC6(3), and boron dipyrromethane (BODIPY)-ceramide, respectively. After 30 min, LPS did not colocalize with endosomes, lysosomes, or endoplasmic reticulum in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, although some LPS-positive vesicles overlapped with the endosomal marker, fluorescent dextran. On the other hand, LPS did appear to colocalize with two markers of the Golgi apparatus, BODIPY-ceramide and TRITC (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate)-labeled cholera toxin B subunit. We further confirmed the localization of LPS in the Golgi apparatus using an epithelial cell line, HeLa, which responds to LPS-sCD14 complexes in a CD14-dependent fashion: BODIPY-LPS was internalized and colocalized with fluorescently labeled Golgi apparatus probes in live HeLa cells. Morphological disruption of the Golgi apparatus in brefeldin A-treated HeLa cells caused intracellular redistribution of fluorescent LPS. These results are consistent with the Golgi apparatus being the primary delivery site of monomeric LPS.
