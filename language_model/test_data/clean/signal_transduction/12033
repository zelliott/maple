To investigate the effect of RNA interfering TLR4 signal pathway on phagocytosis of Kupffer cells.

RAW2647 mice mononuclear macrophage leukemia cells were observed. The tested group was interfered by Tlr4-mus-1567 RNA which had the best result confirmed by QPCR, cells interfered by Negative Control RNA as NC group, and normal cell as control. We perform the phagocytosis test on each group.

The tested group has lower phagocytes percentage than control (17.67% +/- 3.51% vs 32.00% +/- 3.00%, P < 0.01), and lower phagocytic index (46.33% +/- 7.51% vs 82.00% +/- 6.08%, P < 0.01).

Decreased phagocytic activity was observed on Kupffer cells by RNA interference.
