Oncogenic activation of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase is common in different human cancers. We found that the pyrazolo-pyrimidine PP1 inhibited RET-derived oncoproteins with a half maximal inhibitor concentration of 80 nM. Furthermore, RET/PTC3-transformed cells treated with 5 microM of PP1 lost proliferative autonomy and showed morphological reversion. PP1 prevented the growth of two human papillary thyroid carcinoma cell lines that carry spontaneous RET/PTC1 rearrangements and blocked anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity in nude mice of NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing the RET/PTC3 oncogene. These findings suggest targeting RET oncogenes with PP1 or related compounds as a novel treatment strategy for RET-associated neoplasms.
