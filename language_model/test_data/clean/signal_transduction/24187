The role of nitric oxide (NO)/guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism was investigated in rat hepatocytes. Treatment with NO donors, which are known to activate soluble guanylyl cyclase, inhibited in parallel fatty acid synthesis de novo and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity. This effect was mimicked by 8-Br-cGMP and abolished by KT5823, a selective inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Furthermore, specific and hydrolysis-resistant activators of PKG, and inhibitors of Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum, were also effective in inhibiting both fatty acid-synthesizing activities. These results suggest that this biological action of NO is regulated by a signaling cascade involving soluble guanylyl cyclase, cGMP, and PKG, and may be mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, 8-Br-cGMP was able to stimulate fatty acid oxidation by two different mechanisms: the relieving of malonyl-CoA-dependent inhibition by lowering levels of this product of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and a malonyl-CoA-independent stimulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. Taken together, results of this study suggest that NO/cGMP signaling pathway is endowed with regulatory properties in fatty acid metabolism, and may have a physiological role in the control of this metabolism in liver.
