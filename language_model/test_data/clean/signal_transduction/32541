To study the role of K+ channels and membrane potential in alpha-adrenergic responses of the rat liver, lipophilic K+ channel blockers quinidine and 4-aminopyridine were used or external Cl- was replaced with gluconate, an impermeant ion. Glucose release, O2 uptake, portal pressure, and K+ flux were measured in the isolated perfused liver. The alpha-agonist phenylephrine caused biphasic changes in each parameter, a fast transient followed by sustained elevated responses. Infusion of 5 mM 4-aminopyridine, 0.1 mM quinidine, or gluconate prior to phenylephrine inhibited each parameter, with the greatest inhibition occurring during the second phase. A similar pattern was seen with 2 mM EGTA. This contrasts with the full inhibition of all responses following exposure to the alpha-antagonist phentolamine. Infusion of each inhibitor at the peak of the sustained phase inhibited all responses. Phenylephrine-stimulated release of K+ was augmented in the presence of EGTA and was inhibited by 4-aminopyridine or quinidine. In contrast, beta-adrenergic stimulation of glucose release and K+ flux were not affected by the K+ channel blockers. Phenylephrine-stimulated glucose release from hepatocyte suspensions decreased by about 50% in the presence of 4-aminopyridine, EGTA, or gluconate. The results are discussed in terms of a potential role for K+ channels in alpha-adrenergic signal transduction in the liver.
