Our results open a new therapeutic opportunity to treat NSCLC using GSIs. Interestingly, GSIs have been used in long-term treatments in AlzheimerÂ´s patients without major side effects (although without improving the course of the disease). The accumulated knowledge on the pharmacology of GSIs should pave the way to test these compounds in NSCLC patients.
