B lymphocyte development is characterized by deletion, via apoptosis, of immature cells that are stimulated via the B cell receptor in the absence of a second signal. We have investigated whether platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent B lymphocyte activator, can provide a complementary signal with B cell receptor ligation to abrogate apoptosis. Cross-linking of the surface IgM on Ramos B lymphoblastoid cells using anti-IgM Abs (2 microg/ml) caused programmed cell death in 34 +/- 5.4% of the cells. Coincubation of PAF (10(-7)M) with alphaIgM led to a significant decrease in apoptotic cells as measured by DNA laddering and TUNEL assay (13.8 +/- 3%). The effect of PAF was dose dependent (10(-7)-10(-9) M) and was inhibited by the specific PAF receptor antagonist, WEB 2170. PAF protected cells from the effect of alphaIgM for up to 1 h after it was added. alphaIgM-induced programmed cell death in Ramos cells was blocked by catalase and, therefore, is caused in part by the production of toxic hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide. We investigated the action of PAF on markers of intracellular oxidation. H2O2 in low doses induced apoptosis, via production of OH. radicals. PAF inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis in Ramos cells; it also attenuated H2O2- and alphaIgM-mediated increases in hydroxyl radical (OH.) as measured by the oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate to 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein and blocked the depletion of reduced glutathione induced by alphaIgM. PAF maintained IgM secretion, which was greatly inhibited by incubation with alphaIgM alone. These data indicate that PAF potentially provides an important cosignal to surface IgM-stimulated Ramos cells by inhibiting apoptosis. This is in part due to the activity of PAF in the oxidant/ antioxidant pathway.
