Although accumulation of dendritic cell (DC) precursors occurs in bone marrow, the terminal differentiation of these cells takes place outside bone marrow. The signaling, regulating this process, remains poorly understood. We demonstrated that this process could be differentially regulated by Notch ligands: Jagged-1 (Jag1) and Delta-like ligand 1 (Dll1). In contrast to Dll1, Jag1, in vitro and during induced myelopoiesis in vivo, prevented DC differentiation by promoting the accumulation of their precursors. Although both ligands activated Notch in hematopoietic progenitor cells, they had an opposite effect on Wnt signaling. Dll1 activated Wnt pathways, whereas Jag1 inhibited it via downregulation of the expression of the Wnt receptors Frizzled (Fzd). Jag1 suppressed fzd expression by retaining histone deacetylase 1 in the complex with the transcription factor CSL/CBF-1 on the fzd promoter. Our results suggest that DC differentiation, during induced myelopoiesis, can be regulated by the nature of the Notch ligand expressed on adjacent stroma cells.
