Signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) proteins play an important role in signaling through a variety of cytokine and growth factor receptors. Each of the Stat proteins is activated in a ligand-specific manner. Only the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Stat1 and Stat2 are critical for the ligand-specific activation of interferon signaling. In this study we determined the domains in Stat3 protein that contribute to interleukin 6 (IL-6)-specific phosphorylation. Based on evidence that Stat3, but not Stat1, is activated in the presence of low levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor, we constructed various swap mutants between Stat3 and Stat1 and examined their response to IL-6 after their transient expression into COS7 cells. The region upstream of the SH2 domain was exchangeable between Stat1 and Stat3, whereas the region carboxyl-terminal to the SH2 domain of Stat3 was critical to phosphorylation by IL-6. However, unlike Stat1 and Stat2 in interferon signaling, the swap mutant in which 5 amino acid residues just carboxyl-terminal to the tyrosine phosphorylation site (Tyr705) in Stat3 was replaced by the corresponding region derived from Stat1 was not phosphorylated in response to IL-6. Substituting 1 amino acid (Lys709) at position +4 relative to Tyr705 abolished the tyrosine phosporylation of Stat3 in response to IL-6. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that these mutants were associated with gp130 at an extent similar to wild-type Stat3. Taken together, these results show that the amino acid residues immediately carboxyl-terminal to the tyrosine phosphorylation site are involved in IL-6-specific activation of Stat3.
