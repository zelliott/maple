Recent results provide insight into the temporal and spatial relationship governing lck-dependent fyn activation and demonstrate TCR/CD4-induced activation and translocation of lck into lipid rafts and the ensuing activation of colocalized fyn. The prediction follows that directly targeting lck to lipid rafts will bypass the requirement for juxtaposing TCR and CD4-lck, and rescue cellular activation mediated by Ab specific for the constant region of TCRbeta chain. The present study uses a family of murine IL-2-dependent CD4(+) T cell clonal variants in which anti-TCRCbeta signaling is impaired in an lck-dependent fashion. Importantly, these variants respond to Ag- and mAb-mediated TCR-CD4 coaggregation, both of which enable the coordinated interaction of CD4-associated lck with the TCR/CD3 complex. We have previously demonstrated that anti-TCRCbeta responsiveness in this system correlates with the presence of kinase-active, membrane-associated lck and preformed hypophosphorylated TCRzeta:zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa complexes, a phenotype recapitulated in primary resting CD4(+) T cells. We show in this study that forced expression of wild-type lck achieved the same basal composition of the TCR/CD3 complex and yet did not rescue anti-TCRCbeta signaling. In contrast, forced expression of C20S/C23S-mutated lck (double-cysteine lck), unable to bind CD4, rescues anti-TCRCbeta proximal signaling and cellular growth. Double-cysteine lck targets lipid rafts, colocalizes with >98% of cellular fyn, and results in a 7-fold increase in basal fyn kinase activity. Coaggregation of CD4 and TCR achieves the same outcome. These results underscore the critical role of lipid rafts in spatially coordinating the interaction between lck and fyn that predicates proximal TCR/CD3 signaling.
