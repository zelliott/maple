IFNλR1 is a member of the class II cytokine receptor family, and it associates with IL-10R2 to form a functional receptor complex, IFNλR. This receptor complex transduces signals from IFNλs (IFNλ1, IFNλ2, and IFNλ3), promoting antiviral and antiproliferative activities similar to those of type I IFNs. In an effort to further understand signal transduction through IFNλR1, we used bioinformatics analysis and identified a tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-binding motif in the intracellular domain of IFNλR1. In subsequent immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, IFNλR1 was shown to immunoprecipitate with TRAF6 and was pulled down by GST-TRAF6. Endogenous IFNλR1 and TRAF-6 interaction implies that these proteins really interact in the cells. This interaction was abrogated upon mutation of the TRAF6-binding motif in IFNλR1. Furthermore, the interaction between IFNλR1 and TRAF6 inhibited TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation, likely due to a reduction in TRAF6 autoubiquitination. Moreover, co-expression of IFNλR1 with TRAF6 significantly increased the stability of IFNλR1, thereby prolonging its half-life and enhancing its steady-state level in cultured cells.
