The adhesive interactions of activated mast cells with the extracellular matrix play an important role in anchorage and cellular motility. In this report we demonstrate that IL-3-dependent bone marrow-derived mast cells adhere to plate-bound vitronectin with high affinity in a saturable and dose-dependent manner. This adhesion interaction is unique in that it does not require prior mast cell activation through Fc epsilon RI or after treatment with PMA. It is inhibited by divalent cation chelation and by competitive inhibition with a synthetic Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate-Serine tetrapeptide. Polyclonal antisera for alpha v beta 3, an integrin known to bind vitronectin, inhibits attachment to plate-bound vitronectin in a dose-dependent manner. Comparison of the adhesion interactions for vitronectin, fibronectin, and laminin indicate that adhesion to vitronectin is greater than that seen with either fibronectin or laminin, either in the presence or absence of PMA. FACS analysis using a monoclonal hamster anti-murine vitronectin receptor (alpha v) antibody followed by a fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-hamster IgG revealed no change in surface vitronectin receptor expression after Fc epsilon RI-mediated cell activation. Proliferation assays with correction for cell viability revealed a 25% increase in cell number above the maximal IL-3 response over a 24-h period of adhesion to a vitronectin-coated surface and a 41% increase over 96 h of adhesion to vitronectin. Binding to plate-bound vitronectin was not able to sustain cell viability in the absence of IL-3. Thus, IL-3-dependent bone marrow-derived mast cells adhere to vitronectin, an extracellular matrix protein present throughout connective tissues. This interaction generates a signal that results in the augmentation of the maximal IL-3-dependent mast cell proliferative response, thus demonstrating at least one way in which the interaction between mast cells and extracellular matrix alter the biologic responsiveness of the mast cell.
