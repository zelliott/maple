Single immunoglobulin IL-1-related receptor (SIGIRR), which is also known as Toll/interleukin-1 receptor 8, is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) family. Different from other typical IL-1R superfamily members, SIGIRR seems to exert negatively modulates in immune responses. Several previous studies demonstrated that SIGIRR influences chronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, such as intestinal inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Recent work has explored the role of SIGIRR in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), for example, the role of SIGIRR protects the mice from hydrocarbon oil-induced lupus has been reported. These results indicate that SIGIRR may represent a novel target for the treatment of SLE. In this review, we will discuss the SIGIRR and the therapeutic potential of modulating the pathway in SLE.
