Classical metastatic melanoma therapy is disappointing but important progress has been made in the understanding of melanoma biology. Genetic lesions and several intracellular signaling pathways that could serve as targets for novel therapy have been identified and a number of new agents are under evaluation. Promising tumor cell targets were identified in the cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. New therapeutic approaches, besides monoclonal antibodies and vaccination, include an increasing number of small molecules that have been shown to interfere restrictively with intracellular signaling pathways in melanoma and decrease proliferation, survival, migration or invasion. Other agents can interfere with stromal components of melanoma, such as angiogenesis and components of the immune system.
