Cultured oligodendrocytes produce extensive membrane sheets that contain an internal lacy network of vein-like structures composed of microtubules, actin filaments, and 2'3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (CNPase). These cytoplasmic vein-like structures surround domains of myelin basic protein (MBP). Using the antibiotic filipin, that binds to cholesterol, the relationship between plasma membrane cholesterol and cytoskeleton in membrane sheets was examined. Our results show that cholesterol was relatively uniformly distributed within the plasma membranes of prefixed control oligodendrocyte membrane sheets. When live cultures were extracted with Triton X-100, however, a subpopulation of cholesterol molecules remained colocalized with cytoskeleton in the membrane sheets. Activation of two well-characterized signaling pathways that differentially affect microtubule and actin filament stability in membrane sheets resulted in an apparent massive lateral movement of cholesterol molecules away from membrane regions overlying internal MBP domains to membrane tracts directly overlying cytoplasmic cytoskeletal veins. Depolymerization of microtubules by colchicine resulted in redistribution of cholesterol directly over actin filaments, whereas depolymerization of actin filaments by cytochalasin B resulted in redistribution of cholesterol directly over CNPase/microtubular veins. These data suggest that cholesterol forms an association with cytoskeletal components or proteins associated with cytoskeleton. These data also suggest that cholesterol, via interactions with cytoskeleton, plays a role in signaling pathways in oligodendrocyte membrane sheets.
