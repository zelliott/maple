Recent advances in our understanding of axis formation and patterning in zebrafish relate the developmental mode of this aspiring genetic model organism to higher vertebrates. The effect of UV irradiation and lithium treatment, as well as detailed early lineage analyses, have shed some light on dorsoventral axis formation. However, the molecular mechanism of axis formation, as well as the identity of a fish Nieuwkoop center, are still open issues. A Vg1 homolog is expressed in zebrafish, and activin as well as the mouse nodal gene product have been demonstrated to induce mesoderm and ectopic axes, respectively, in zebrafish. The zebrafish organizer is defined by the expression domains of goosecoid, axial, and lim1. The cyclops gene is involved in maintaining goosecoid expression in axial mesoderm of the head. Large mutagenesis screens provide the basis for a genetic analysis of axis formation.
