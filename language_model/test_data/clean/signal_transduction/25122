The activity of transcription factors is often modulated by signal responsive protein kinases. Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors are regulated by IkappaB inhibitors, the phosphorylation of which causes ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and activation of target genes. Here we report pulldown and immunoprecipitation experiments showing that a mammalian 66 kDa protein kinase binds murine c-Rel, both in vitro and in vivo. This kinase appears to have at least two binding sites on c-Rel, a proline-directed serine/ threonine substrate specificity similar to MAP kinases and to specifically phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of murine c-Rel at an ERK consensus site.
