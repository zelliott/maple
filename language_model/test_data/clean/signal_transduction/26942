The CD45 protein is a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase that is required for normal T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signaling. A chimeric complementary DNA encoding the intracellular enzymatically active portion of murine CD45 preceded by a short amino-terminal sequence from p60c-src was transfected into CD45- T cells. Expression of this chimeric protein corrected most of the TCR signaling abnormalities observed in the absence of CD45, including TCR-mediated enhancement of tyrosine kinase activity and Ca2+ flux. Thus, the enzymatically active intracellular portion of CD45 is sufficient to allow TCR transmembrane signaling.
