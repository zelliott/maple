Signal transduction networks of different cell types show a large variety in their structural design. In this paper, basic structural properties of signal transduction networks are investigated. For this, such networks with the recently developed method of network expansion are analysed. This method allows for a structural analysis of networks by calculating signal expansion profiles when provided with certain compounds, for example growth factors, inactive kinases and so on (seed compounds), to initiate such an expansion. The presented results may put forth valuable hints on the evolution of signalling networks.
