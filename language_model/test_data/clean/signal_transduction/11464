Oligonucleotide DNA microarrays were used for a genome-wide analysis of immune-challenged Drosophila infected with Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria, or with fungi. Aside from the expression of an established set of immune defense genes, a significant number of previously unseen immune-induced genes were found. Genes of particular interest include corin- and Stubble-like genes, both of which have a type II transmembrane domain; easter- and snake-like genes, which may fulfil the roles of easter and snake in the Toll pathway; and a masquerade-like gene, potentially involved in enzyme regulation. The microarray data has also helped to greatly reduce the number of target genes in large gene groups, such as the proteases, helping to direct the choices for future mutant studies. Many of the up-regulated genes fit into the current conceptual framework of host defense, whereas others, including the substantial number of genes with unknown functions, offer new avenues for research.
