The interaction between microglia and T cells is important in the development of central nervous system inflammation. This may result in full T cell activation, a partial state of activation, anergy or apoptosis of the 'responding' T cell. Here, we demonstrate that neonatal rodent microglia not only fail to initiate a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), but suppress background T cell proliferation. Even after activation with gamma-IFN or following phagocytosis, microglia remain unable to support a MLR. By contrast, gamma-IFN-activated microglia are able to activate memory T cells in a recall assay resulting in cytokine (gamma-IFN) release and modest T cell proliferation. Although the stimulation index is small, functional relevance is demonstrated. Supernatants from the recall assay stimulate gamma-IFN-dependent activation of a STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) factor within resting microglia. This demonstrates that memory T cells not only receive sufficient stimulation from the gamma-IFN-activated microglia to proliferate and produce cytokines, but that there is also a reciprocal stimulation of resting microglia. Importantly, this provides evidence that activated microglia have the potential to propagate immune responses in the central nervous system, but are unlikely to initiate a primary response.
