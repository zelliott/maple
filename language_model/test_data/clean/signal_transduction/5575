Complement receptor proteins CR2 (CD21) and CR1 (CD35) have been identified as components of the murine B cell co-receptor complex. Gene expression profiles between naïve WT, C3-/-, and CD21/35-/- B cells demonstrate enhanced expression of a Ca(2+)-modulating gene, Pcp4, in WT mice compared to the complement-deficient animals. Increased expression of Pcp4 is also coincident with B cell maturation into end stage phenotypes. Prolonged activation of B cells via cross-linking of the BCR (but not CR1/CR2 alone) leads to increased expression of Pcp4 and suppressed Ca(2+) release. In total these data demonstrate that the expression of Pcp4 in naïve resting mature B cells is dependent upon tonic stimulation from the CR1/CR2 proteins via a C3 ligand, and that antigen specific B cell activation can also elevate Pcp4 expression that is coincident with suppression of calcium-dependent responses.
