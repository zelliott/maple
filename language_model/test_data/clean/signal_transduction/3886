F3 is a developmentally regulated adhesive glycoprotein expressed by subpopulations of central and peripheral neurons which mediates neurite growth and fasciculation via cis- and trans-interactions with cell-surface or matrix components. We previously reported on the characterization of the F3 gene 5' flanking region in which we identified promoter and enhancer elements. Here, we report on the functional organization of the F3 gene regulatory regions. We show that the F3 promoter is built of linearly arranged positive and negative elements scattered through the 5' flanking region of the F3 gene and the 1st exon (exon 0). Neural- and cell type-specific expression of F3 appears to be governed by elements located in the most proximal promoter region which includes a neural-specific enhancer. In retardation assays, all these cis-acting elements bind nuclear proteins, three of which interact with the identified enhancer element while a single species interacts with sequences located within exon 0. Some of these proteins are also specifically expressed within the brain, indicating that they could correspond to neural-specific trans-acting factors. Elements located immediately upstream of the cell type-specific enhancer and within exon 0 are responsible for regulation of F3 expression by cAMP and retinoic acid.
