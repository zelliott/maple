Inositol phosphates (IPs), such as 1,4,5-inositol-trisphosphate (IP(3)), comprise a ubiquitous intracellular signaling cascade initiated in response to G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C. Classical methods for measuring intracellular accumulation of these molecules include time-consuming high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation or large-volume, gravity-fed anion-exchange column chromatography. More recent approaches, such as radio-receptor and AlphaScreen assays, offer higher throughput. However, these techniques rely on measurement of IP(3) itself, rather than its accumulation with other downstream IPs, and often suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratios due to the transient nature of IP(3). The authors have developed a miniaturized, anion-exchange chromatography method for measuring inositol phosphate accumulation in cells that takes advantage of signal amplification achieved through measuring IP(3) and downstream IPs. This assay uses centrifugation of 96-well-formatted anion-exchange mini-columns for the isolation of radiolabeled inositol phosphates from cell extracts, followed by low-background dry-scintillation counting. This improved assay method measures receptor-mediated IP accumulation with signal-to-noise and pharmacological values comparable to the classical large-volume, column-based methods. Assay validation data for recombinant muscarinic receptor 1, galanin receptor 2, and rat astrocyte metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 are presented. This miniaturized protocol reduces reagent usage and assay time as compared to large-column methods and is compatible with standard 96-well scintillation counters.
