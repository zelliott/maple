We identify an essential role for the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp tripeptide) moiety in vivo during adult peripheral neuron regenerative growth. Beyond a peripheral nerve transection there were rises in the fibronectin extracellular matrix, and striking rises in the mRNA and protein expression of integrin subunits sensitive to RGD/fibronectin signalling. Neuron perikarya, axons and Schwann cells all expressed RGD/fibronectin sensitive integrins after injury. To evaluate the significance of RGD/fibronectin-integrin interactions, we infused solutions of a pentapeptide including the RGD motif (sRGD) serially and directly within the milieu of early axon growth across rat sciatic transection injuries. While low dose infusions of sRGD facilitated early axon ingrowth, we encountered inhibition of ingrowth and bridge formation with higher doses of sRGD indicating competitive disruption of RGD/fibronectin-integrin signalling. Fibronectin RGD moieties serve a critical and important role during peripheral axon outgrowth.
