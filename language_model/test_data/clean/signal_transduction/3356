Transient or chronic hyperglycaemia increases the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and aldehydes. The accumulation of reactive aldehydes is implicated in the development of diabetic complications. Methylglyoxal, a glucose dependent Î±-dicarbonyl might be the most important reactive aldehyde in diabetes and its complications. Diabetes was the first disease in which evidence emerged for the increased formation of methylglyoxal in the cells and in the serum. Methylglyoxal has a toxic effect on insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells, and on modifications of proteins and nucleic acids. Moreover, methylglyoxal is one of the major precursors of advanced glycation end-products. The glyoxalase enzyme system that exists in all mammalian cells is catalyzing the detoxification of methylglyoxal. This review summarizes the methylglyoxal metabolism in normoglycaemic and hyperglycamic conditions and the role of methylglyoxal in the development of late diabetic microvascular complications.
