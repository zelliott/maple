Two different inhibitory domains, N-terminus and central domain, keep FOXM1c almost inactive despite its strong transactivation domain. Here, we demonstrate that cyclin E/Cdk2, cyclin A/Cdk2, and cyclin A/Cdk1 activate FOXM1c. Cyclin E/Cdk2 does not target its transactivation domain or its DNA-binding domain. Instead, its activating effect strictly depends on the presence of either the central domain or the N-terminus of FOXM1c and thus is completely lost if both inhibitory domains are deleted. Cyclin E/Cdk2 activates FOXM1c by releasing its transactivation domain from the repression by these two inhibitory domains. However, it does not directly increase the transactivation potential of the TAD. The DNA-binding is not affected by cyclin E/Cdk2, neither directly nor indirectly. These two activating effects of cyclin E/Cdk2 via central domain and N-terminus are additive. Cyclin A/Cdk2 and cyclin A/Cdk1 show similar characteristics. GSK-3alpha, another proliferation-associated kinase, represses FOXM1c.
