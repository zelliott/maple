Neural stem cells/progenitors that give rise to neurons and glia have been identified in different regions of the brain, including the embryonic retina. Recently, such cells have been reported to be present, in a mitotically quiescent state, in the ciliary epithelium of the adult mammalian eye. The retinal and ciliary epithelium stem cells/progenitors appear to share similar signaling pathways that are emerging as important regulators of stem cells in general. Yet, they are different in certain respects, such as in the potential to self-renew. These two neural stem cell/progenitor populations not only will serve as models for investigating stem cell biology but also will help explain the relationships between embryonic and adult neural stem cells/progenitors.
