The neurite outgrowth inhibitor protein Nogo-A has been identified as an inhibitor of axonal regeneration, and Nogo-B as a regulator of vasculature remodeling, but the additional roles of Nogo isoforms, especially Nogo-C, have obtained little attention. Nogo-C is weakly expressed in liver and kidney compared to the high expression in skeletal muscle. Here we detected the weak expression of Nogo-C in human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, and found that Nogo-C expressed in HEK293 could induce cell apoptosis. Further experiments demonstrated the activation of JNK/SAPK and c-Jun, but not p38 in Nogo-C expressed cells. And JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 could reduce cell apoptosis induced by Nogo-C. Furthermore, the activation of caspase-3 and PARP, the expression and phosphorylation of p53 were also detected. The data first revealed Nogo-C expressed in HEK293 confers apoptosis by inducing caspase-3 and p53 activation through the JNK-c-Jun-dependent pathway.
