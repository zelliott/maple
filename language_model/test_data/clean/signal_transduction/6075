While enhanced expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 has been observed in human skin epidermal cancer, the mechanisms underlying COX-2 expression have not been completely elucidated. Recently, a role for the phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3) kinase pathway in COX-2 expression has attracted attention. We investigated COX-2 expression, PI3 kinase activity, and the phosphorylation level of Akt, a downstream effector of PI3 kinase, in the human skin cancer cell line HSC-5. Compared to the nontumorigenic keratinocyte HaCaT, in HSC-5 cells, COX-2 protein expression and PI3 kinase activity were increased. The PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 reduced COX-2 expression in HSC-5 cells and, contrary to our expectation, the phosphorylation of Akt was significantly decreased. The expression of Bcl-2, which is regulated by Akt, was reduced, and apoptosis was induced in HSC-5 cells compared to HaCaT cells. COX-2 inhibitor NS398 up-regulated Akt phosphorylation. These results imply that constitutively over-expressed COX-2 down-regulates the Akt phosphorylation through a negative feedback mechanism.
