The functional selectivity of adrenergic ligands for activation of β1- and β2-AR (adrenoceptor) subtypes has been extensively studied in cAMP signalling. Much less is known about ligand selectivity for arrestin-mediated signalling pathways. In the present study we used resonance energy transfer methods to compare the ability of β1- and β2-ARs to form a complex with the G-protein β-subunit or β-arrestin-2 in response to a variety of agonists with various degrees of efficacy. The profiles of β1-/β2-AR selectivity of the ligands for the two receptor-transducer interactions were sharply different. For G-protein coupling, the majority of ligands were more effective in activating the β2-AR, whereas for arrestin coupling the relationship was reversed. These data indicate that the β1-AR interacts more efficiently than β2-AR with arrestin, but less efficiently than β2-AR with G-protein. A group of ligands exhibited β1-AR-selective efficacy in driving the coupling to arrestin. Dobutamine, a member of this group, had 70% of the adrenaline (epinephrine) effect on arrestin via β1-AR, but acted as a competitive antagonist of adrenaline via β2-AR. Thus the structure of such ligands appears to induce an arrestin-interacting form of the receptor only when bound to the β1-AR subtype.
