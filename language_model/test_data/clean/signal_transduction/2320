Muscarinic receptors are expressed in smooth muscle throughout the body. In most instances, the muscarinic receptor population in smooth muscle is composed of mainly the M2 and M3 subtypes in an 80% to 20% mixture. The M3 subtype mediates phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium mobilization, whereas the M2 subtype mediates an inhibition of cAMP accumulation. In addition, a variety of ionic conductances are elicited by muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic agonists stimulate a nonselective cation conductance that is pertussis toxin-sensitive and dependent on calcium. The pertussis toxin-sensitivity of this response suggests that it is mediated by M2 receptors. Following agonist induced depolarization of smooth muscle, voltage dependent calcium channels are activated to enable an influx of calcium. In some instances, muscarinic agonists enhance this conductance through a mechanism involving protein kinase C, whereas in other instances, muscarinic agonists suppress this calcium conductance. Smooth muscle often contains calcium activated potassium channels that tend to repolarize the membrane following calcium influx. Activation of muscarinic receptors suppresses this potassium conductance in some smooth muscles. Under standard conditions, muscarinic agonists elicit pertussis toxin-insensitive contractions through activation of the M3 receptor. When most of the M3 receptors are inactivated, it is possible to measure a pertussis toxin-sensitive contractile response to muscarinic agonists that is most likely mediated through M2 receptors. M2 receptors also cause an indirect contraction by inhibiting the relaxant effects of agents that increase cAMP (e.g., forskolin and isoproterenol).
