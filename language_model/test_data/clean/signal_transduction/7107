Our recent study suggested that metadherin (MTDH) is overexpressed in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Here, we further investigated its role in promoting metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). An immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that MTDH is elevated and positively correlated with metastasis in 189 primary SCCHN tissues. In vitro experiments demonstrated that MTDH overexpression enhanced the migratory and invasive ability of SCCHN cells. Moreover, MTDH induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by both regulating morphological changes and mediating the expression of the biomolecular makers E-cadherin and vimentin. In addition, MTDH mediated AKT activation, and all of the above effects were nearly completely blocked by the inhibition of AKT. Our results suggested that MTDH might promote the metastasis of SCCHN through AKT signalling pathway mediated-EMT.
