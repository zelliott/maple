Arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been shown to have a unique sensitization effect whereby repeated injection of AVP into a lateral cerebral ventricle or a mediobasal region of the rat forebrain below the lateral septum and including the anterior hypothalamus referred to as the ventral septal area, causes enhanced motor responses to the ligand. To elucidate possible neuronal mechanisms responsible for AVP sensitization, 1) we determined the dose and the time required for the development and expression of AVP sensitization, and 2) we tested the hypotheses that AVP sensitization may result in a) alteration of septal AVP V1 receptor affinity or number, and/or b) alteration of septal AVP V1 receptor signal transduction (phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis) mechanisms. Our behavioral data show that the magnitude of AVP sensitization varies with dose and time, and the effect is dependent on the time interval between injections, in that an initial intracerebroventricular AVP injection enhances the sensitivity of the animals to the motor effects of similar AVP injections given 6 h to 6 days later but not to injections given hourly or weekly. No changes in septal AVP binding site density and affinity, as measured by [3H]AVP binding to septal synaptic plasma membrane, were found in sensitized animals; [3H]inositol monophosphate stimulation in response to AVP in septal slices, however, was found to be significantly enhanced. This enhanced [3H]inositol monophosphate stimulation appears specific to a V1-type receptor because it was significantly reduced in the presence of the V1 receptor antagonist, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP, and was not found using oxytocin or the V2 receptor agonist, DDAVP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
