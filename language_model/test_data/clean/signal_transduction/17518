The complex functions played by beta 2 integrins in mediating a large variety of adhesive interactions of leukocytes are highly regulated. This regulation results in transient adaptations/associations, permitting physical and functional recycling of these receptors during chemotaxis, phagocytosis and target-cell killing. The structural definition of these adaptations will lead not only to a better understanding of how these receptors are regulated in leukocytes but also shed valuable light on how these integrins integrate diverse extracellular signals into spatially and temporaly coordinated cellular responses.
