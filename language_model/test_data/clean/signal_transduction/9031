Our understanding of, and approach to, pulmonary arterial hypertension has undergone a paradigm shift in the past decade. Once a condition thought to be dominated by increased vasoconstrictor tone and thrombosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension is now seen as a vasculopathy in which structural changes driven by excessive vascular cell growth and inflammation, with recruitment and infiltration of circulating cells, play a major role. Perturbations of a number of molecular mechanisms have been described, including pathways involving growth factors, cytokines, metabolic signaling, elastases, and proteases, that may underlie the pathogenesis of the disease. Elucidating their contribution to the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension could offer new drug targets. The role of progenitor cells in vascular repair is also under active investigation. The right ventricular response to increased pressure load is recognized as critical to survival and the molecular mechanisms involved are attracting increasing interest. The challenge now is to integrate this new knowledge and explore how it can be used to categorize patients by molecular phenotype and tailor treatment more effectively.
