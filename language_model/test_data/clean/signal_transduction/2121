CD22 is a B cell-restricted glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and signaling. Since CD22 is likely to play an important role in interactions between B cells and other cells, and in regulating signaling thresholds, we characterized the expression of murine CD22 during different stages of B cell development. In contrast to previous reports, we show that CD22 is expressed on B cell progenitors prior to expression of IgM. IL-7-responsive B cell precursors from the fetal liver and early B lineage cells (B220+IgM-) from the bone marrow both express a low density of surface CD22. The majority of the earliest B cell progenitors (B220+IgM-CD43+) in the bone marrow, however, do not express CD22. As B cells mature, the density of CD22 molecules on the cell surface increases. B220brightIgM+ bone marrow cells express high levels of CD22, as do splenic B cells. The correlation of CD22 levels with B cell maturation is replicated in an in vitro culture system, which distinguishes stages of B cell development based on function. Following activation of mature resting splenic B cells with anti-mu mAb or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), levels of CD22 decrease. Finally, we show that the addition of anti-CD22 mAb augments the proliferative response of both anti-mu- and LPS-stimulated B cells, suggesting a role for CD22 in diverse signaling pathways.
