Activated oncogenes are the dominant drivers of malignant progression in human cancer, yet little is known about how the transformation from proto-oncogene to activated oncogene drives the expression of transformed phenotypes. An isogenic model of HER-2-mediated transformation of human mammary epithelial cells was used along with HER-2-amplified human breast cancers to investigate how HER-2 activation alters its properties as a signaling molecule and changes the networks of HER-2-regulated genes. Our results show that full oncogenic activation of HER-2 is the result of a transition in which activated HER-2 acquires dominant signaling properties that qualitatively alter the network of genes regulated by the activated oncogene compared with the proto-oncogene. Consequently, gene expression programs related to invasion, cell stress, and stemness become regulated by HER-2 in a manner not observed in nontransformed cells, even when HER-2 is overexpressed. Our results offer novel insights into biological processes that come under the control of HER-2 after it acquires full oncogenic potential.
