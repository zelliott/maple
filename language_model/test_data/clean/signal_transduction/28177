Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane cellular receptors that link the cell to its underlying substratum. Alterations in integrin expression and signaling have been implicated in many aspects of tumorigenesis and metastasis including cell survival, migration, and invasion. In prostate cancer, the progression from normal to metastatic cells is accompanied by changes in the repertoire of integrins expressed and up-regulation of key adhesion-dependent signaling pathways. Recent work from several laboratories indicates the emergence of new mechanisms for the regulation of growth and migratory pathways by integrin engagement. These pathways are likely to provide novel sites of therapeutic intervention for the treatment of prostate cancer.
