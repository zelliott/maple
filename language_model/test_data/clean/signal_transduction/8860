CK2 is a regulatory kinase implicated in embryonic development and in cancer. Among the CK2 substrates is beta-catenin, a protein with dual function in Wnt signaling and cell adhesion. Previously, we reported that CK2 activity is required for beta-catenin stability and we identified threonine (T) 393 as a major CK2 phosphorylation site in beta-catenin. However, it is not known whether phosphorylation at T393 increases beta-catenin stability and if so, what is the mechanism. In this study we investigate the molecular mechanism of beta-catenin stabilization through phosphorylation at T393. We found that pseudophosphorylation of beta-catenin at T393 resulted in a stable activated form of beta-catenin with decreased affinity for Axin in vitro. This phosphomimetic mutant also displayed decreased regulation by Axin in vivo in a bioassay in Xenopus laevis embryos. In contrast, the binding of T393 pseudophosphorylated beta-catenin to E-cadherin was unaffected. Further analysis showed that pseudophosphorylation at T393 did not prevent beta-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3beta. Interestingly, we found that in the presence of pseudophophorylated beta-catenin and another activated form of beta-catenin, the recruitment of GSK3beta to Axin is enhanced. These findings indicate that phosphorylation of T393 by CK2 may affect the stability of beta-catenin through decreased binding to Axin. In addition, the increased recruitment of GSK3beta to the destruction complex in the presence of activated beta-catenin mutants could be a feedback mechanism to suppress overactive Wnt signaling.
