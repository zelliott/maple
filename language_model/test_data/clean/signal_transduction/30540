The influence of nerve stimulation pattern on transmitter release inhibition by L-citrulline, the co-product of NO biosynthesis by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), was studied in the rat phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm. We also investigated the putative interactions between NOS pathway and the adenosine system. L-citrulline (10-470 microM), the NOS substrate L-arginine (10-470 microM) and the NO donor 3-morpholinylsydnoneimine (SIN-1, 1-10 microM), concentration-dependently inhibited [(3)H]-acetylcholine ([(3)H]-ACh) release from rat motor nerve endings. Increasing stimulus frequency from 5 Hz-trains to 50 Hz-bursts enhanced [(3)H]-ACh release inhibition by l-arginine (47 microM) and L-citrulline (470 microM), whereas the effect of SIN-1 (10 microM) remained unchanged. NOS inhibition with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (100 microM) prevented the effect of L-arginine, but not that of L-citrulline. Adenosine deaminase (2.5 U/ml) and the adenosine transport inhibitor, S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine (10 microM), attenuated release inhibition by L-arginine and L-citrulline. With 5 Hz-trains, blockade of A(1) receptors with 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentyl xanthine (2.5 nM), but not of A(2A) receptors with ZM241385 (10nM), reduced the inhibitory action of l-arginine and L-citrulline; the opposite was verified with 50 Hz-bursts. Blockade of muscarinic M(2) autoreceptors with AF-DX116 (10 nM) also attenuated the effects of L-arginine and L-citrulline with 50 Hz-bursts. L-citrulline (470 microM) increased basal adenosine outflow via the equilibrative nucleoside transport system sensitive to NBTI (10 microM), without significantly (P>0.05) changing the nucleoside release subsequent to nerve stimulation. Data indicate that NOS-derived L-citrulline negatively modulates [(3)H]-ACh release by increasing adenosine outflow channelling to A(1) and A(2A) receptors activation depending on the stimulus paradigm. While adenosine acts predominantly at inhibitory A(1) receptors during 5 Hz-trains, inhibition of ACh release by L-citrulline at 50 Hz-bursts depends on the interplay between adenosine A(2A) and muscarinic M(2) receptors.
