CPS-2, a Cordyceps sinensis polysaccharide, has been demonstrated to have significant therapeutic activity against chronic renal failure. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism. In this study, we found that CPS-2 could inhibit PDGF-BB-induced human mesangial cells (HMCs) proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, CPS-2 notably suppressed the expression of α-SMA, PDGF receptor-beta (PDGFRβ), TGF-β1, and Smad 3 in PDGF-BB-treated HMCs. Furthermore, PDGF-BB-stimulated ERK activation was significantly inhibited by CPS-2, and this inhibitory effect was synergistically potentiated by U0126. CPS-2 could prevent the PDGFRβ promoter activity induced by PDGF-BB, and return expression of PDGFRβ, TGF-β1, and TGFβRI to normal levels while cells were under PDGFRβ and ERK silencing conditions and transfected with DN-ERK. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that CPS-2 reduces PDGF-BB-induced cell proliferation through the PDGF/ERK and TGF-β1/Smad pathways, and it may have bi-directional regulatory effects on the PDGF/ERK cellular signaling pathway.
