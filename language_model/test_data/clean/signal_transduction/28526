The cardiovascular system is richly endowed with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), members of the largest family of plasma membrane-localized receptors. During the last 10 years, it has become increasingly clear that many, if not all, GPCRs function in oligomeric complexes, as either homo- or hetero-oligomers. This review explores the mechanistic implications of GPCR dimerization and/or oligomerization on receptor activation and interactions with G proteins. The effects of GPCR oligomerization on receptor pharmacology, GPCR-mediated signaling, and potential contributions to GPCR crosstalk will be considered in the context of receptors important in the cardiovascular system. Our evolving understanding of the structural and functional consequences of GPCR oligomerization may provide novel and more selective sites for pharmacological tuning of cardiovascular function.
