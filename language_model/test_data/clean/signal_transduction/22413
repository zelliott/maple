Detection of chemical compounds in food sources is based on the activation of 7 transmembrane gustatory receptors (GRs) in mammals and in insects such as Drosophila, although the receptors are not conserved between the classes. Different combinations of Drosophila GRs are involved in the detection of sugars, but the activated signaling cascades are largely unknown. Because 7 transmembrane receptors usually couple to G-proteins, we tried to unravel the intracellular signaling cascade in taste neurons by screening heterotrimeric G-protein mutant flies for gustatory deficits. We found the subunit Goα to be involved in feeding behavior and cell excitability by different transgenic and pharmacological approaches. Goα is involved in the detection of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, but not with trehalose and maltose. Our studies reveal that Goα plays an important role in the perception of some sweet tastants. Because the perception of other sweet stimuli was not affected by mutations in Goα, we also found strong indication for the existence of multiple signaling pathways in the insect gustatory system.
