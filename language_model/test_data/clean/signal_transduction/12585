Following a fibrogenic stimulus, the hepatic stellate cell (HSC) transforms from a quiescent to an activated cell type associated with increased proliferation, collagen and smooth muscle alpha-actin (alphaSMA) expression. Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog Deleted on Chromosome Ten (PTEN), a tumor suppressor phosphatase, has been shown to play a role in several nonmalignant diseases. Here, we investigated the role of PTEN during HSC activation.

Rat HSCs 2 days after isolation were transduced with adenoviruses expressing either the wild-type (WT) or a dominant negative form of PTEN, and culture-associated activation of HSCs, including morphological changes, expression of alphaSMA and alpha1(I) collagen, and cell proliferation, were evaluated. Apoptosis of HSCs was detected by measuring activity of caspase 3/7. Phosphorylation status of Akt, p70(S6K), and Erk was detected by Western blotting.

Overexpression of WT-PTEN inhibited phenotypic changes were associated with HSC activation, including morphological changes, expression of alphaSMA and alpha1(I) collagen, and HSC proliferation, including cyclin D1 expression. WT-PTEN expression also induced apoptosis in HSCs with increased caspase 3/7 activity. Expression of WT-PTEN also caused decreased activation of Akt, p70(S6K), and Erk signaling pathways.

Taken together, these findings show that PTEN represents an important negative regulator for transactivation of HSCs. This may have important implications for the design of therapeutic strategies to prevent the progression of liver fibrosis.
