The chemical signaling pathways which orchestrate lung cell responses in hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease are poorly understood. The present study examined temporal alterations in lung basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) in a well characterized rat model of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension. By immunohistochemical analysis, there were progressive increases in bFGF in airway, vascular and gas exchange regions of MCT-treated rat lungs. Increases in bFGF preceded the onset of right ventricular hypertrophy at day 21 after MCT administration. Enhanced bFGF immunostaining was observed as early as day 4 in focal areas of the parenchyma, and by day 14 there was enhanced bFGF staining in alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and alveolar septa, which persisted through day 21. In conducting airways, there was elevated bFGF immunostaining in the smooth muscle cell (SMC) layer by days 4 and 7 and in the ciliated epithelium and its basement membrane at days 14 and 21. Cells morphologically similar to Clara cells in the luminal surfaces of bronchioles stained intensely on days 14 and 21. In the nucleus and cytoplasm of medial SMCs within pulmonary arteries, there was a progressive increase in bFGF staining starting at day 4. Lung bFGF mRNA was increased slightly at days 1, 4 and 7, while lung bFGF protein, as judged by western blot analysis, was increased at days 14 and 21 compared to controls. The present results, considered in teh light of teh documented roles of bFGF in vascular cell migration, growth and synthesis of extracellular matrix components, suggest that bFGF may contribute to the structural remodeling processes underlying the development of chronic pulmonary hypertension in MCT-treated rats.
