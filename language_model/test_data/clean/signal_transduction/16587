1. Severe persistent asthma is accompanied by structural changes in the airway, referred to as remodelling. The mechanisms driving airway remodelling are poorly understood. 2. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is increased in the airways of patients with asthma. Many of the effects of TGF-beta are mediated by connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). 3. Overexpression of CTGF is linked to many fibrotic diseases, but its exact role in airway remodelling is unknown. 4. Connective tissue growth factor mediates cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival, extracellular matrix synthesis and has a role in angiogenesis. 5. Current asthma therapies do not inhibit CTGF induction. 6. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the role of CTGF in airway remodelling may lead to new therapeutic strategies for asthma.
