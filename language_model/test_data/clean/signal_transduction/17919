ProSAAS (encoded by mouse gene Pcsk1n) is a recently described neuroendocrine secretory pathway protein that is cleaved into smaller peptides that may function in cell-cell signalling. ProSAAS and its processing intermediates are also potent inhibitors of prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), which is encoded by mouse gene Pcsk1. In order to gain insight into the function of proSAAS, we have examined the distribution of several proSAAS-derived peptides and PC1 by immunohistochemistry throughout mouse development. The distribution patterns of both SAAS and PC1 are broad from E9 to E11, with some enrichment in neural tube-derived tissues. By E15, the expression of SAAS is largely restricted to neuroendocrine tissues known to produce bioactive peptides. In general, the expression pattern of PC1 overlaps with that of SAAS and other proSAAS-derived peptides, consistent with the hypothesis that proSAAS functions as an endogenous PC1 inhibitor.
