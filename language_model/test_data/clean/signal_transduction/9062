Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins, and notably members of the RGS-R4 subfamily, control vasocontractility by accelerating the inactivation of GÎ±-dependent signaling. RGS5 is the most highly and differently expressed RGS-R4 subfamily member in arterial smooth muscle. Expression of RGS5 first appears in pericytes during development of the afferent vascular tree, suggesting that RGS5 is a good candidate for a regulator of arterial contractility and, perhaps, for determining the mass of the smooth muscle coats required to regulate blood flow in the branches of the arterial tree. Consistent with this hypothesis, using cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), we demonstrate RGS5 overexpression inhibits G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated hypertrophic responses. The next objective was to determine which physiological agonists directly control RGS5 expression in VSMCs. GPCR agonists failed to directly regulate RGS5 mRNA expression; however, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) acutely represses expression. Downregulation of RGS5 results in the induction of migration and the activation of the GPCR-mediated signaling pathways. This stimulation leads to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases directly downstream of receptor stimulation, and ultimately VSMC hypertrophy. These results demonstrate that RGS5 expression is a critical mediator of both VSMC contraction and potentially, arterial remodeling.
