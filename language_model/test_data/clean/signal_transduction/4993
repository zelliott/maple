Adipose-tissue-derived signaling molecules, including the adipokines, are emerging as key candidate molecules that link obesity with cancer. Peritumoral, stromal, adipose tissue and secreted adipokines, particularly leptin, have important roles in breast cancer biology. For example, leptin signaling contributes to the metabolic features associated with breast cancer malignancy, such as switching the cells' energy balance from mitochondrial Î²-oxidation to the aerobic glycolytic pathway. Leptin also shapes the tumor microenvironment, mainly through its ability to potentiate both migration of endothelial cells and angiogenesis, and to sustain the recruitment of macrophages and monocytes, which in turn secrete vascular endothelial growth factor and proinflammatory cytokines. This article presents an overview of current knowledge on the involvement of leptin in the pathogenesis and progression of breast cancer, highlighted by human, in vitro and animal studies. Data are presented on the functional crosstalk between leptin and estrogen signaling, which further contributes to promotion of breast carcinogenesis. Finally, future perspectives and clinical applications in which leptin and the leptin receptor are considered as potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer are reviewed.
