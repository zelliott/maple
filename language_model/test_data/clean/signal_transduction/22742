We have reported that immortalized Schwann cells (SC) express the insulin-like growth factor I receptor and IGF-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5). IGF-I promotes SC survival and protects IGFBP-5 in SC-conditioned medium from proteolysis. In the current study we examined the roles of IGF-I and IGFBP-5 in primary SC. IGF-I enhances primary SC differentiation and gene and protein expression of IGFBP-5 and the myelinating protein, P0. SC that stably overexpress human IGFBP-5 also have higher levels of P0 gene expression. The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor (LY294002), but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor (PD98059), blocks IGF-I enhancement of IGFBP-5 gene and protein expression. Collectively, these results suggest that IGF-I promotes SC differentiation, and this may occur in part by enhancing IGFBP-5 expression via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activation. These data support a link between enhanced IGFBP-5 expression and cellular differentiation.
