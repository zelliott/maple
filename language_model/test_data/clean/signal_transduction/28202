Fibroblasts play an important role in reparative and inflammatory processes by synthesizing extracellular matrix components and releasing growth factors and cytokines. Fibroblast apoptosis has been observed at the termination phase of reparative or fibrotic responses, but its regulation in this context is poorly known. We investigated the susceptibility of human dermal fibroblasts (DF) to Fas-induced apoptosis and its regulation by extracellular factors potentially involved in immune-mediated inflammation and repair. DF expressed all components of the Fas apoptotic pathway: surface Fas, Fas-associated protein with death domain, and caspase-8 proteins. However, Fas activation resulted in caspase-8 activation and apoptosis only in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX). DF constitutively expressed Fas-associated death domain-like IL-1-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) that was drastically down-regulated by CHX. Exogenous growth factors, cytokines, and adherence to the extracellular matrix shifted the balance of FLIP-caspase-8 proteins and modified the susceptibility of DF to Fas- or Fas-CHX-induced apoptosis. Short-term serum deprivation, suspension culture, and pretreatment with IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha increased, whereas long-term serum-free culture and pretreatment with TGF-beta or IL-10 decreased the apoptotic susceptibility of DF. Surface Fas expression was only modified by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, whereas all studied factors modified FLIP-caspase-8 protein expression, consistently with their pro- or antiapoptotic effects. Antisense FLIP oligonucleotides prevented resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis in DF. FLIP-caspase-8 balance seems tightly regulated in fibroblasts by extracellular factors that determine their susceptibility to Fas- or Fas-CHX-induced apoptosis. Th1 and Th regulatory cytokines display opposite effects on fibroblast apoptosis that suggest that their pro- or antifibrotic effects involve direct effects on fibroblast survival.
