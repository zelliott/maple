Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a member of the Cys-Cys chemokine family. Two related MCP-1 receptors have been identified (CC-CKR2A and CC-CKR2B), although the precise kinetics of ligand binding and calcium signaling of these receptors has yet to be investigated. To examine this more closely, the human MCP-1 receptors were cloned and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Membranes prepared from cells expressing CC-CKR2B bind MCP-1 selectively and with high affinity (Kd = 120 pM). MCP-1 stimulation of recombinant CHO cells expressing CC-CKR2B induces a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ through both receptor-operated Ca2+ channels and mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and leads to a rapid temperature-dependent internalization of the ligand/receptor complexes. In contrast, recombinant CHO cells expressing CC-CKR2A, and membranes prepared from these cells, fail to bind detectable levels of MCP-1. However, MCP-1 stimulation of cells expressing CC-CKR2A induces a small but significant increase in intracellular Ca2+. Repeated stimulation of these cells with MCP-1 leads to a potentiation of the response to a level comparable to that seen in cells expressing CC-CKR2B. These observations suggest that the levels of cell surface CC-CKR2A are controlled by novel mechanisms.
