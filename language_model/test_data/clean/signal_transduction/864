The dachsous (ds) gene encodes a member of the cadherin family involved in the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway that controls the establishment of planar cell polarity (PCP) in Drosophila. ds is the only known cadherin gene in Drosophila with a restricted spatial pattern of expression in imaginal discs from early stages of larval development. In the wing disc, ds is first expressed distally, and later is restricted to the hinge and lateral regions of the notum. Flies homozygous for strong ds hypomorphic alleles display previously uncharacterized phenotypes consisting of a reduction of the hinge territory and an ectopic notum. These phenotypes resemble those caused by reduction of the canonical Wnt signal Wingless (Wg) during early wing disc development. An increase in Wg activity can rescue these phenotypes, indicating that Ds is required for efficient Wg signaling. This is further supported by genetic interactions between ds and several components of the Wg pathway in another developmental context. Ds and Wg show a complementary pattern of expression in early wing discs, suggesting that Ds acts in Wg-receiving cells. These results thus provide the first evidence for a more general role of Ds in Wnt signaling during imaginal development, not only affecting cell polarization but also modulating the response to Wg during the subdivision of the wing disc along its proximodistal (PD) axis.
