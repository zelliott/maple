Cultured cells of the Japanese quail embryo were labeled with 3H-glucosamine, fixed, suspended and inoculated into built-up cultures of the homologous cells. The transfer of insoluble components of labeled cell surface into the cells of underlaying cell sheet was revealed. A decrease in the cell incubation temperature up to 4 degrees C blocks the process. The exchange of cell surface sites between contacting cells seems to be one of the possible ways of information transmission from one cell into another during contact regulation of cell proliferation.
