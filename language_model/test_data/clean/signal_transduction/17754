Many organs respond to both sex steroids and growth factors. Regulation of these pathways is integral to cell-cell communications during development and aberrant changes cause disease pathogenesis. Traditionally, paracrine and endocrine actions of growth factors and steroid hormones are considered independently. Recently, new data indicated that activin/TGFbeta and sex steroid signalling are linked; explicitly, that the pathways cross-talk intracellularly. Here we present new perspectives on these interactions, using examples predominantly from the prostate, as it is a well-characterised organ in this context. While this information provides insight to the potential mechanisms behind these interactions, it also presents a new challenge; the action of any of these factors cannot be considered exclusively without considering the impact on the other biological pathways.
