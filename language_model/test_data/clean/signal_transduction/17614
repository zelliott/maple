Thromboxane A2 (TxA2) is the main arachidonic acid metabolite in human platelets and exhibits two major activities; stimulation of platelet function, including secretion of platelet-derived storage products, e.g., 5-HT, PDGF, and vasoconstriction. Platelet hyperreactivity is typical for advanced stages of atherosclerosis and is paralleled by elevated circulating thromboxane levels. This is the target for TX-antagonistic compounds. Three classes of selective compounds are available: inhibitors of thromboxane synthase, antagonists of thromboxane receptors, and mixed-type agents. Positive experimental data with all of these compounds are available. However, clinical experience is limited and, in general, not convincing. This review discusses possible reasons for that and suggests that, in particular, the use of combined-type agents as antithrombotics may be superior to acetyl-salicylic acid in several forms of ischemic cardiovascular diseases.
