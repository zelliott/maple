The Fgf10 signaling pathway plays an important role in early stages of mouse embryonic palatal development, which is associated with cell proliferation and differentiation. The objective of this study was to assess whether dexamethasone and vitamin B(12) affected the Fgf10 signal pathway of mouse embryonic palate.

Immunohistochemical studies were performed for expression of Fgf10, Fgfr2b, and sonic hedgehog and for cell proliferation and apoptosis of mouse embryonic palate.

The expression of Fgf10, Fgfr2b, and sonic hedgehog was changed in mouse embryonic palate after dexamethasone and vitamin B(12) treatment, resulting in reduced and restored proliferation of mesenchymal cells.

Dexamethasone and vitamin B(12) affected the Fgf10 signaling pathway and cell proliferation of mouse embryonic palate. Cell apoptosis was not altered after dexamethasone and vitamin B(12) exposure.
