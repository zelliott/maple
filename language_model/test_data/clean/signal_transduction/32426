A series of T cell lines transfected to stably express HIV-1 envelope (env) glycoproteins were analyzed for viability and for T cell signaling. One transfectant was distinguished by its stable expression of gp120 and gp41, whereas the remainder of the T cell lines were similar to previously reported env-expressing T cells in synthesizing predominantly unprocessed env glycoprotein gp160. All of the transfectants were additionally constructed to express tat and rev proteins. None of these cell lines displayed growth abnormalities or spontaneous cell fusion, although the cell line synthesizing env gp120/gp41 could be induced to fuse and die when cocultured with a second cell expressing surface CD4. A cell line expressing only gp160 and the transfectant expressing gp160, gp120, and gp41 could be triggered normally via CD3-cross-linking as measured by protein tyrosine phosphorylation and by the induction of the CD69 activation marker. At levels of env protein expression sufficient to mediate syncytium formation and to kill cells, these HIV-1 env transfectants displayed no intrinsic T cell signaling abnormalities, suggesting that mechanisms other than a direct intracellular action of the tat or env proteins may be contributing to the deficit in Ag-specific T cell activation described subsequent to HIV infection in vivo and in vitro.
