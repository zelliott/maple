β-Transducin repeats-containing protein (β-TrCP) is the substrate recognition subunit of the SCF (SKP1, CUL1, and F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. SCF(β-TrCP) ubiquitinates specifically phosphorylated substrates to promote their subsequent destruction by the 26S proteasome and plays a critical role in various human diseases including tumorigenesis. We and others (Duan S et al. Mol Cell 44: 317-324, 2011; Gao D et al. Mol Cell 44: 290-303, 2011; Zhao Y et al. Mol Cell 44: 304-316, 2011) recently reported that SCF(β-TrCP) regulates cell growth and autophagy by controlling the ubiquitination and destruction of DEPTOR, an endogenous mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. In this review, we discuss β-TrCP's new downstream substrate, DEPTOR, as well as summarize the novel functional aspects of β-TrCP in controlling cell growth and regulating autophagy, in part through governing the stability of DEPTOR.
