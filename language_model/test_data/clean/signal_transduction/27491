The signaling events induced upon cross-linking of the human FcgammaRIIa1 (CD32) which contains an immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its intracellular region, were investigated in the promyelocytic HL-60 cells. It is shown here that the FcgammaRIIa1 engagement recruits the Ras pathway in these cells, as evidenced by the tyrosine-phosphorylation of the Shc adaptator protein and of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2). However, p95vav, a molecule able to interact with Rac-1 and to regulate cytoskeletal reorganization, was also found to be phosphorylated. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Vav is associated with SLP-76 upon FcgammaRIIa1 activation. A strong phosphorylation of p120cbl was also observed. The phosphorylation of molecules such as p95vav, SLP-76 and p120cbl suggests that FcgammaRIIa1 triggering also activates signaling pathways other than the Ras pathway.
