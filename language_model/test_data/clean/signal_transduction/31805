The 40S ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is a conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to the AGC family of protein kinases, which also includes Akt and many others. S6K1 is the principal kinase effector downstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). S6K1 is sensitive to a wide range of signaling inputs, including growth factors, amino acids, energy levels and hypoxia. S6K1 relays these signals to regulate a growing list of substrates and interacting proteins in control of oncogenic processes, such as cell growth and proliferation, cell survival and apoptosis and cell migration and invasion. Several lines of evidence suggest an important role for S6K1 in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. S6K1 directly phosphorylates and activates ERÎ±. Furthermore, S6K1 expression is estrogenically regulated. Therefore, hyperactivation of mTORC1/S6K1 signaling may be closely related to ER-positive status in breast cancer and may be utilized as a marker for prognosis and a therapeutic target.
