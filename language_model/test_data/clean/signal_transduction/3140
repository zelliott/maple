In atherosclerosis macrophages contribute to disease progression. After infiltrating atherosclerotic lesions they accumulate oxLDL (oxidized low density lipoproteins) and differentiate into foam cells. During this process inhibition of TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4)-dependent IFNβ expression occurs. To understand molecular mechanisms how oxLDL inhibits LPS-induced IFNβ expression in macrophage-derived foam cells, we analyzed the impact of oxLDL on signaling pathways upstream of IFNβ expression. We identified mono-ubiquitination of TANK (TRAF family member-associated NFκB activator), a scaffold protein of the TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing IFNβ)-dependent TLR4-signaling cascade. Modified TANK inhibits recruitment of TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) to TRAF3 (TNF receptor associated factor 3) and the subsequent activation of the transcription factor IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3). OxLDL stimulates TANK mono-ubiquitination by subsequent activation of IRAK1/4 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases 1 and 4) and Pellino3 downstream of SR-A1 (scavenger receptor-A1). Our observations highlight the regulatory impact of IRAK1/4 and Pellino3 on the TRIF-dependent TLR4-signaling cascade, which might be of general importance for disease conditions associated with macrophage pathologies such as atherosclerosis.
