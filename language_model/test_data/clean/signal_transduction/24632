The modulatory influences of phorbol esters on the functional responsiveness of human peripheral blood neutrophils have been investigated. These studies focused on measurements of the levels of cytoplasmic free calcium and of tyrosine phosphorylation as well as on their ability to mount an oxidative response. Short incubation times (< 1 min) with low concentrations of phorbol esters (5-50 nM) were shown to enhance the above indices of neutrophil responsiveness to chemotactic factors such as fMet-Leu-Phe and leukotriene B4. On the other hand, a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of calcium mobilization and superoxide production was also observed. The effects of the phorbol esters were stereo-specific and were antagonized by a novel protein kinase C inhibitor (RO 318220) but were not affected by the oxidative burst inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium. Pre-incubation of the cells with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) altered in a concentration-dependent manner the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe. In addition, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erbstatin inhibited the priming of the mobilization of calcium induced by PDBu. These data demonstrate the rapidity of the effects of the activation of protein kinase C, their potential to modulate positively the early events of the excitation-response coupling sequence and the complexity of the functional interrelationships among the various cellular activation pathways available to human neutrophils and other non-muscle cells.
