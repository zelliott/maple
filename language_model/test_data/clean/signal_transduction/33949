Neuroendocrine hormones such as growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) have been demonstrated to accelerate the recovery of the immune response after chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation and to enhance the restoration of immunity in individuals infected with HIV and in normal individuals with compromised immune systems associated with aging. As the mechanism of action of these hormones has been elucidated, it has become clear that they are integral members of the immunological cytokine/chemokine network and share regulatory mechanisms with a wide variety of cytokines and chemokines. The members of this cytokine network induce and can be regulated by members of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of intracellular proteins. In order to take advantage of the potential beneficial effects of hormones such as GH or PRL, it is essential to take into consideration the overall cytokine network and the regulatory effects of SOCS proteins.
