CD38, a surface glycoprotein of unrestricted lineage, is an ectoenzyme (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribosyl cyclase/cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase) that regulates cytoplasmic calcium. The molecule also performs as a receptor, modulating cell-cell interactions and delivering transmembrane signals, despite showing a structural ineptitude to the scope. CD38 ligation by agonistic monoclonal antibodies induced signals leading to activation of the lytic machinery of natural killer (NK) cells from adults; similar signals could not be reproduced in YT and NKL, 2 CD16(-) human NK-like lines. It was hypothesized that CD38 establishes a functional cooperation with professional signaling molecules of the NK cell surface. The present work answers the question about the molecule exploited by CD38 for signaling in NK cells, using as a model CD16(-) NK lines genetically corrected for CD16 expression. Our results indicate that a functional CD16 molecule is a necessary and sufficient requisite for CD38 to control an activation pathway, which includes calcium fluxes, tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP70 and mitogen-activated protein kinase, secretion of interferon-gamma, and cytotoxic responses. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and cocapping experiments also showed a surface proximity between CD38 and CD16. These results were confirmed by using the NKL cell line, in which CD16(+) and CD16(-) variants were obtained without genetic manipulation. Together, our findings show CD38 to be a unique receptor molecule that cannot signal by itself but whose receptor function is rescued by functional and physical associations with a professional signaling structure that varies according to lineage and environment. This molecule is CD16 in NK cells.
