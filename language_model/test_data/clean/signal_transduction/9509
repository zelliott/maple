Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) initiates apoptosis in tumor cells upon binding to its cognate agonistic receptors, death receptors 4 and 5 (DR4 and DR5). The activity of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) survival pathway is often increased in cancer, influencing both cell proliferation and apoptosis. We hypothesized that inhibiting the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) using NVP-AEW541, a small molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the IGF-1R, could increase death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptosis in colon cancer cells.

The analyses were performed by caspase assay, flow cytometry, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation and fluorescent microscopy.

Preincubation with NVP-AEW541 surprisingly decreased apoptosis induced by recombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) or an agonistic DR4 antibody while sensitivity to an agonistic DR5 antibody was increased. NVP-AEW541 could inhibit IGF-1-induced activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. The effects of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on TRAIL-induced apoptosis were similar to those of NVP-AEW541, further supporting a role for IGF-1R-mediated activation of PI3K. We show that PI3K inhibition enhances DR5-mediated caspase 8 processing but also lowers DR4 membrane expression and DR4-mediated caspase 8 processing. Inhibition of PI3K reduced rhTRAIL sensitivity independently of the cell line preference for either DR4- or DR5-mediated apoptosis signaling.

Our study indicates that individual effects on DR4 and DR5 apoptosis signaling should be taken into consideration when combining DR-ligands with PI3K inhibition.
