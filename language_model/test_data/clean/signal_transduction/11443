Nitric oxide (NO) plays a well-known role in regulating endocellular adaptive changes to acute hypoxia and ischemia. The reversible inhibition of complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain fulfils a cytoprotective function, whereas the progressive inhibition of complex I and II reveals the onset of irreversible oxidative damage due to persistent NO production in response to prolonged hypoxia and/or ischemia. In hypoxic or ischemic human myocardial cells, death may be caused by apoptosis or necrosis following the activation of the biomolecular signal transduction mechanisms. The activation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) followed by ERK (extracellular regulated kinase) and p21waf is necessary in this respect. The myocardial cell is well known for its postmitotic nature and through their activation these kinases aim to repair DNA damaged by oxidative stress in order to guarantee the survival of the cell itself. A direct correlation has been found between the activation of these kinases and NO production. It was decided to carry out this study in hypoxic and ischemic human heart ventricular tissue in order to confirm this connection.

In 10 patients undergoing cardiac valvular replacement, ventricular samples were collected before aortic clamping, after 15 min of ischemia and after 60 minutes during which the patients received doses of hematic cardioplegic solution at regular intervals.

The results show a rapid increase in NO production in response to ischemia followed by a tendency for levels of this element to fall. MAPK, ERK and p21waf activation was parallel to No production, irrespective of the repeated administration of hematic cardioplegic solution. The heart tissue examined 60 minutes after aortic clamping came from a ventricular area subject to preconditioning mechanisms. In view of this, the data obtained must be seen in terms of the close correlation between the mitochondrial action played by NO and the contemporary and consequent activation of unique signal transduction mechanisms.

This may prove important to our understanding of preconditioning mechanisms involving the myocardial and confirms the role played by the said kinases with regard to the survival of hypoxic and ischemic human heart tissue. Although not final, these deductions may be important in clinical and therapeutic terms for the management of critical patients.
