Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are among the best-studied heparin-binding proteins, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans regulate FGF signalling by direct molecular association with FGF and its tyrosine kinase receptor, FGFR. Two recently determined crystal structures of FGF-FGFR-heparin complexes have provided new structural information on how heparin binds to FGF and FGFR, and lead to different models for receptor dimerisation.
