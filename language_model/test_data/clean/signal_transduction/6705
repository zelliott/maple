T2D is a metabolic and inflammatory disease characterized by deteriorating β-cell function and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Low-grade inflammation and innate immune system activation lead to β-cell failure. Recently, SFAs have been proposed as triggers of metabolism-associated inflammation through the TLR family of PRRs. In this review, recent progress in defining the molecular basis of FFA-associated TLR2/4 activation and signaling in β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis is summarized. Furthermore, we highlight links between TLRs and diabetic complications, insulin resistance, and autophagy. This knowledge may facilitate novel strategies to abrogate inflammation in T2D.
