Locally formed arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites are important as modulators of many aspects of renal tubular function, including regulation of the activity of tubular Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase. Here we examined the ontogeny of the AA metabolic pathways regulating proximal convoluted tubular (PCT) Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in infant and adult rats. Eicosatetraynoic acid, an inhibitor of all AA-metabolizing pathways, abolished this effect. AA inhibition of PCT Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase was blocked by the 12-lipoxygenase inhibitor baicalein in infant but not in adult rats and by the specific cytochrome P-450 fatty acid omega-hydroxylase inhibitor 17-octadecynoic acid in adult but not in infant rats. The lipoxygenase metabolite 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and the cytochrome P-450 metabolite 20-HETE both inhibited PCT Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in a protein kinase C-dependent manner, but the effect was significantly more pronounced in infant PCT. Lipoxygenase mRNA was only detected in infant cortex. Expression of renal isoforms of cytochrome P-450 mRNA was more prominent in adult cortex. In summary, the AA metabolic pathways that modulated the activity of rat renal proximal tubular Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase are age dependent.
