T-cell activation consists of multiple layers of signaling events. Interleukin-2 production is of interest for many, since its expression determines a critical difference between partial and full T-cell activation. To achieve full activation of T cells, it is necessary for the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) to be engaged for an extended period of time. However, why extended stimulation is required for full T-cell activation is not understood at the molecular level. In this review, orchestrated events of TCR signal transduction will be analyzed in a kinetic manner and connected toward the understanding of the mechanism of T-cell activation. Based on recent results, a model of the mechanism that dictates the threshold between partial and full T-cell activation is proposed.
