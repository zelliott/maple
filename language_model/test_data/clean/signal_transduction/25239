Recent studies, particularly of genetically altered mice, have greatly improved our understanding of the molecular basis underlying the development of the vascular system. Endothelial signalling systems, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor system and the angiopoietin/Tie2 system, were identified as central regulators of embryonic angiogenesis. The complex interactions between these and other endothelial signalling systems are beginning to emerge. Placenta (2000), 21, Supplement A, Trophoblast Research, 14, S11-S15.
