Organisms constantly undergo various stresses within their life span, which can damage their DNA. In order to maintain genomic stability and counteract the development of unwanted genomic mutations, organisms have evolved a DNA-damage response (DDR) to protect their genome. Due to the critical roles played by DDR in genomic stability, its defects can lead to cellular transformation and potentially tumorigenesis. Consequently, this also provides the opportunity to specifically target tumor cells due to a weakened ability to tolerate genotoxic stresses. In this lies a treatment strategy in which the inhibition of remaining DDR pathways can hyper-sensitize tumors to chemotherapeutic agents while minimizing deleterious effects to healthy cells. Therefore it is important to understand the genotypic background of specific tumors to determine which DDR pathways remain and can be targeted for inhibition. Tumor therapies based on the DDR are ideal not only as a means of increasing the effectiveness of current chemotherapies but also as a means to selectively target tumor cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed. Thus, targeting DDR components as a means of increasing effectiveness and discrimination of current chemotherapeutic tumor treatments is currently the focus of many studies and clinical trials.
