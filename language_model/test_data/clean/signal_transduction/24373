Nucleotides such as ATP and UTP are everywhere. They play a key role in transducing mechanosensory signals via P2Y receptors in the large intestine or colon, leading to secretion of the sensory mediator 5-HT, and act as autocrine, paracrine, or neurocrine mediators in neural reflexes regulating chloride secretion.
