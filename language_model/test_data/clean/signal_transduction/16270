Integrative genomics approaches associating DNA structure and transcriptomic analysis should allow the identification of cascades of events relating to tumor aggressiveness. While different genome alterations have been identified in pituitary tumors, none have ever been correlated with the aggressiveness. This study focused on one subtype of pituitary tumor, the prolactin (PRL) pituitary tumors, to identify molecular events associated with the aggressive and malignant phenotypes. We combined a comparative genomic hybridization and transcriptomic analysis of 13 PRL tumors classified as nonaggressive or aggressive. Allelic loss within the p arm region of chromosome 11 was detected in five of the aggressive tumors. Allelic loss in the 11q arm was observed in three of these five tumors, all three of which were considered as malignant based on the occurrence of metastases. Comparison of genomic and transcriptomic data showed that allelic loss impacted upon the expression of genes located in the imbalanced region. Data filtering allowed us to highlight five deregulated genes (DGKZ, CD44, TSG101, GTF2H1, HTATIP2), within the missing 11p region, potentially responsible for triggering the aggressive and malignant phenotypes of PRL tumors. Our combined genomic and transcriptomic analysis underlines the importance of chromosome allelic loss in determining the aggressiveness and malignancy of tumors.
