The coagulation protease Factor Xa (Xa)(1) triggers a variety of cellular responses that may be important for inflammatory reactions to tissue injury. Protease-activated receptors (PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4) can mediate Xa signaling in heterologous expression systems. However, other candidate Xa receptors have been described, and the extent to which one or more PARs account for Xa signaling in relevant differentiated cells is unknown. We examined Xa signaling in endothelial cells from wild-type and PAR-deficient mice. Wild-type endothelial cells responded to agonists for PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4. Relative to wild-type, Xa-triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis was reduced by 60-75% in Par2 -/- endothelial cells, by 20-30% in Par1 -/- endothelial cells, and by approximately 90% in Par2 -/- endothelial cells treated with a PAR1 antagonist. Similar results were obtained when ERK1/2 phosphorylation was used to assess Xa signaling. Thus PAR2 is the main endogenous Xa receptor in these endothelial cell preparations and, together, PAR2 and PAR1 appear to account for approximately 90% of endothelial Xa signaling. By contrast, in fibroblasts, PAR1 by itself accounted for virtually all Xa-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis. This information is critical for the design and interpretation of knockout mouse studies to probe the possible roles of Xa signaling in vivo.
