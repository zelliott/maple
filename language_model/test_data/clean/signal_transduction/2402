3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), (S)-3-hydroxyphenylglycine and (S)-4-carboxy-3-hydroxyphenylglycine (S-4C3HPG) stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in neonatal rat cortical slices, but with lower maximal effect, in comparison with 2S,1'S,2'S-2-(2'-carboxycyclopropyl)glycine (L-CCG I) or (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclo-pentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD). DHPG, 1S,3R-ACPD, and S-4C3HPG also evoked a rapidly desensitizing increase in [Ca2+]i in cortical layers of neonatal brain slices. (R,S)-alpha-methyl-4-tetrazolyl-phenylglycine (MTPG), and (R,S)-alpha-methyl-4-phosphono-phenylglycine (MPPG) inhibited the increase of phosphoinositide hydrolysis elicited by 1S,3R-ACPD but not that by R,S-DHPG. In contrast, the selective group II receptor agonist (1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-amino-bicyclo-[3.1.0]-hexane-2,6-dicarboxylate (LY 354740) potentiated the response of R,S-DHPG. Finally, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, a membrane permeant analogue of cAMP, reversed the stimulatory effect of 1S,3R-ACPD and S-4C3HPG on phosphoinositide hydrolysis and [Ca2+]i mobilization, without affecting the response induced by R,S-DHPG. These data suggest that, in neonatal rat cortex, the activation of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors potentiates the phosphoinositide hydrolysis and [Ca2+]i responses mediated by group I metabotropic glutamate receptors.
