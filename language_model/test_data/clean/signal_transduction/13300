Plants monitor informational light signals using three sensory photoreceptor families: the phototropins, cryptochromes and phytochromes. Recent advances suggest that the phytochromes act transcriptionally by targeting light signals directly to photoresponsive promoters through binding to a transcriptional regulator. By contrast, the cryptochromes appear to act post-translationally, by disrupting extant proteosome-mediated degradation of a key transcriptional activator through direct binding to a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby elevating levels of the activator and consequently of target gene expression.
