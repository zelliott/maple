Being unable to move away from their places of germination, in order to avoid excess metal-induced damages, plants have to evolve different strategies and complex regulatory mechanisms to survive harsh conditions. While both ROS and auxin are documented to be important in plant response to metal stress, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between ROS and auxin in metal stress are poorly understood. In this review, we provide an update on the regulation of plant responses to metal-stress by ROS and auxin signaling pathways, primarily, with a focus on the copper, aluminum and cadmium stress. We aim at surveying the mechanisms underlying how metal stress modulates the changes in auxin distribution and the network of ROS and auxin in plant response to metal stress based on recent studies.
