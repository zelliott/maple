The predominant product of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity in the colon, prostaglandin (PG) E2 promotes intestinal tumorigenesis. Expression of the PGE2 receptor EP4 is upregulated during colorectal carcinogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the role of elevated PGE2-EP4 receptor signalling in the protumorigenic activity of PGE2 by increasing EP4 receptor expression in HT-29 human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (HT-29-EP4) by stable transfection. Elevated PGE2-induced EP4 receptor activity in HT-29 cells increased resistance to spontaneous apoptosis and promoted anchorage-independent growth, but had no effect on proliferation of HT-29-EP4 cells. EP4 receptor activation by PGE2 in HT-29-EP4 cells also led to development of fluid-filled cysts, which was associated with increased tight junction protein (occludin and zonula occludens-1) expression. Overexpression of the EP4 receptor in HT-29 cells led to basal EP4 receptor signalling in the absence of exogenous PGE2, which was explained by autocrine activity of endogenous, COX-2-derived PGE2 and constitutive, ligand-independent EP4 receptor activity. The predominant signalling pathway mediating antiapoptotic activity downstream of PGE2-EP4 receptor activation in HT-29-EP4 cells was elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which was associated with phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein. EP4 receptor activation led to a small increase in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 protein levels but inhibition of ERK phosphorylation did not abrogate the antiapoptotic activity of PGE2. However, PGE2-EP4 receptor signalling did not lead to trans-activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor in HT-29 cells. Inhibition of protumorigenic PGE2-EP4 receptor signalling represents a potential strategy for anti-CRC therapy that may avoid the toxicity associated with systemic COX inhibition.
