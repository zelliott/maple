In this study, we determined conditions leading to the development of colitis in mice with nucleotide binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) deficiency, a susceptibility factor in Crohn's disease. We found that NOD2-deficient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) produced increased amounts of interleukin (IL)-12 in the presence of ovalbumin (OVA) peptide and peptidoglycan or recombinant E. coli that express OVA peptide (ECOVA). Furthermore, these APCs elicited heightened interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses from cocultured OVA-specific CD4+ T cells. We then demonstrated that NOD2-deficient mice adoptively transferred OVA-specific CD4+ T cells and that administered intrarectal ECOVA developed colitis associated with the expansion of OVA-specific CD4+ T cells producing IFN-gamma. Importantly, this colitis was highly dependent on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) function since it was suppressed in NOD2 and TLR2 double-deficient mice. Thus, NOD2-deficient mice become susceptible to colitis as a result of increased TLR2 responses when they have the capacity to respond to an antigen expressed by mucosal bacteria.
