In the recent years, a tremendous amount has been learned about the pathophysiology and molecular biology of the cardiac angiotensin II system. Interestingly, the angiotensin II appears to have several effects on cardiac electrophysiology, which have not been fully appreciated so far. Therefore, this review will highlight on the basic knowledge of signal transduction and electrophysiological effects of angiotensin II, which may have an impact on the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmia.
