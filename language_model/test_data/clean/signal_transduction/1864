The physiological activity of exogenous 4-Cl-IAA, as compared to IAA, was examined in maize coleoptile segments. It was found that in this model system 4-Cl-IAA is much more active in the stimulation of elongation than IAA. Simultaneous measurements of growth and external pH indicated that administration of either IAA or 4-Cl-IAA resulted in medium acidification. The kinetics of the pH changes, however, were faster after the addition of 4-Cl-IAA. In contrast to IAA, the coleoptile segments treated with chlorinated auxin were not able to increase medium pH after its initial drop. The re-addition of IAA after 5 h further enhanced growth over the next 2 h by 31%. By contrast, the re-addition of 4-Cl-IAA at the same time protocol as IAA did not cause an additional effect. The administration of 10 microM IAA induced in maize coleoptile cells a transient depolarization followed by a slow hyperpolarization of their membrane potential. In contrast to IAA, 4-Cl-IAA at 1 microM caused an immediate hyperpolarization of the membrane potential which, on average, was 2-fold greater than for IAA. The results reported here provide further evidence that 4-Cl-IAA is much more active, as compared to IAA, in stimulating the growth of maize coleoptile segments. Although it has not been directly demonstrated here, a plausible interpretation for the high 4-Cl-IAA activity is that, at least in part, it might be caused via a reduced metabolism of 4-Cl-IAA. Furthermore, for the first time, the data show that membrane potential responds to 4-Cl-IAA in a qualitatively different fashion than to IAA. These findings may, in turn, suggest a specific signal transduction pathway to 4-Cl-IAA in maize coleoptile cells.
