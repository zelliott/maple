Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critical patients. Proteomic analysis of plasma from individuals with ARDS could elucidate new biomarkers for diagnosis and pathophysiology and identify potential ARDS treatment targets. In this study, we recruited 26 patients (15 controls, 11 ARDS). The ARDS group was subdivided into two groups depending on the type of injury: (1) direct lung injury (AD) and (2) indirect lung injury (AI). Using iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) analysis, we identified 2429 peptides representing 132 plasma proteins. Among these, 16 were differentially expressed in ARDS patients, including 11 overlapping proteins between the AI and AD group and 5 AI-specific proteins. Protein annotation revealed that lipid transport and complement activation were significantly enriched in the biological process category, and lipid transporter, transporter, and serine-type peptidase activities were significantly enriched in the molecular function category. IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) signaling pathways revealed that the overlapping proteins were involved in a variety of signaling pathways, including those underlying acute phase response; liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) and farnesoid X (FXR)/RXR activation; clathrin-mediated endocytosis; atherosclerosis; interleukin (IL)-12; complement system; and cytokine, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species production in macrophages. We present the first proteomic analysis of ARDS plasma using the iTRAQ approach. Our data provide new biomarker candidates and shed light on potential pathological mechanisms underlying ARDS.
