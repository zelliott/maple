Two Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated malignancies, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and posttransplant lymphoma, rarely have mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, suggesting that a viral protein interferes with p53 function. The EBV oncogene, LMP1, induces expression of the cellular antiapoptotic genes bcl-2 and A20 and could in this way interfere with p53-mediated apoptosis. Two derivatives of the p53-null epithelial cell line H1299 were prepared, one of which (H1299-p53) stably expressed a temperature-sensitive (ts) p53 protein, and another (H1299-p53+LMP1) which stably expressed both ts-p53 and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). At the permissive temperature, the p53 protein in the H1299-p53 cell line transcriptionally activated two of its target genes, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and the mdm2 gene product, in an LMP1-independent manner. Upon serum withdrawal at the permissive temperature, p53-mediated apoptosis was induced in 50 to 60% of the cells. In the H1299-p53 cell line which stably expressed LMP1, however, only 20 to 25% of the cells underwent apoptosis. While stable expression of LMP1 did not affect levels of bcl-2 family members in these cells, it did induce expression of A20. Stable expression of A20 in the H1299-p53 cell line inhibited p53-mediated apoptosis equivalent to inhibition by LMP1. The induction of A20 may underlie the ability of LMP1 to protect EBV-infected epithelial cells from p53-mediated apoptosis.
