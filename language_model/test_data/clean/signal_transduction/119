Abnormal activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been linked to several types of human cancers, and the development of small-molecule inhibitors of this pathway represents a promising route toward novel anticancer therapeutics. A cell-based screen performed in our laboratories identified a new class of Hh pathway inhibitors, 1-amino-4-benzylphthalazines, that act via antagonism of the Smoothened receptor. A variety of analogues were synthesized and their structure-activity relationships determined. This optimization resulted in the discovery of high affinity Smoothened antagonists, one of which was further profiled in vivo. This compound displayed a good pharmacokinetic profile and also afforded tumor regression in a genetic mouse model of medulloblastoma.
