Histamine exerts multiple biological actions through one of three receptor subtypes (H1, H2, and H3). This review focuses on new developments regarding the structure and function of the H2 receptor. In addition to the important role this receptor plays in stimulating gastric acid secretion, recent studies have demonstrated that it is also involved in regulating gastrointestinal motility and intestinal secretion. The potential role of the H2 receptor in regulating cell growth and differentiation has also been added to the list of actions this biogenic amine may exert in both normal and transformed tissues. Molecular cloning of the gene indicates that it has the structural characteristics of a heptahelical G protein-linked receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of this receptor reveal the presence of key amino acids within the third and fifth transmembrane domains that are critical for ligand recognition. Molecular approaches have also shed light on the structural components of the H2 receptor important in regulating desensitization and internalization. Although the H2 receptor was classically thought to couple to the adenylate cyclase pathway, recent work with the cloned receptor indicates that it can also activate the phosphoinositide signaling cascade through an independent G protein-dependent mechanism. The novel observation that histamine may stimulate c-fos gene expression lends further support to the possible role of this receptor in regulating cell growth and differentiation.
