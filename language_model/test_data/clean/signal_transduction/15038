Ricin is a toxin isolated from castor beans that has potential as a weapon of bioterrorism. This glycoprotein consists of an A-chain (RTA) that damages the ribosome and inhibits protein synthesis and a B-chain that plays a role in cellular uptake. Ricin activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 signaling pathways; however, a role for these pathways in ricin-induced cell death has not been investigated. Our goals were to determine if RTA alone could activate apoptosis and if the JNK and p38 pathways were required for this response. Comparable caspase activation was observed with both ricin and RTA treatment in the immortalized, nontransformed epithelial cell line, MAC-T. Ribosome depurination and inhibition of protein synthesis were induced in 2-4h with 1microg/ml RTA and within 4-6h with 0.1microg/ml RTA. Apoptosis was not observed until 4h of treatment with either RTA concentration. RTA activated JNK and p38 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner that preceded increases in apoptosis. Inhibition of the JNK pathway reduced RTA-induced caspase activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In contrast, inhibition of the p38 pathway had little effect on RTA-induced caspase 3/7 activation. These studies are the first to demonstrate a role for the JNK signaling pathway in ricin-induced cell death. In addition, the MAC-T cell line is shown to be a sensitive in vitro model system for future studies using RTA mutants to determine relationships between RTA-induced depurination, ribotoxic stress, and apoptosis in normal epithelial cells.
