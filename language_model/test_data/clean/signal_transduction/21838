Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are rapidly recruited to tissues upon injury or infection. There, they can encounter local and/or recruited immature dendritic cells (iDCs), a colocalization that could promote at least transient interactions and mutually influence the two leukocyte populations. Using human live blood PMNs and monocyte-derived iDCs, we examined if these leukocytes actually interacted and whether this influenced DC function. Indeed, coculture with live but not apoptotic PMNs led to up-regulation of membrane CD40, CD86, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR on DCs. Whereas CD40 up-regulation was dependent on soluble factors released by PMNs, as determined in cultures conducted in different chambers, cell contact was necessary for CD86 and HLA-DR up-regulation, a process that was inhibited by anti-CD18 antibodies, indicating that CD18 ligation was required. We also found that via a cell contact-dependent mechanism, DCs acquired Candida albicans-derived antigens from live as well as from apoptotic PMNs and could thus elicit antigen-specific T lymphocyte responses. Altogether, our data demonstrate the occurrence of cross-talk between human PMNs and DCs and provide new insights into the immune processes occurring upstream of the interactions between DCs and T lymphocytes.
