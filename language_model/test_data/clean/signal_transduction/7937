The detailed structure of molecular networks, including their dependence on conditions and time, are now routinely assayed by various experimental techniques. Visualization is a vital aid in integrating and interpreting such data. We describe emerging approaches for representing and visualizing systems data and for achieving semantic zooming, or changes in information density concordant with scale. A central challenge is to move beyond the display of a static network to visualizations of networks as a function of time, space and cell state, which capture the adaptability of the cell. We consider approaches for representing the role of protein complexes in the cell cycle, displaying modules of metabolism in a hierarchical format, integrating experimental interaction data with structured vocabularies such as Gene Ontology categories and representing conserved interactions among orthologous groups of genes.
