Ion channels in mammal sperm, including Ca2+, Na+, K+, Cl- and HCO3- channels, each play a key role in the process of sperm capacitation. Ca2+, HCO3- and ROS, as signal molecules, activate soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) with the cooperation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), Ca2+ and intracellular pH and, via a cross talk between the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and tyrosine phosphatase signaling pathways, promote the biological effect of sperm capacitation.
