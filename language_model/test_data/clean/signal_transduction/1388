In addition to the well-known genomic action of aldosterone, resulting in delayed effect (1-2 h), a very rapid nongenomic effect (1-2 min) of aldosterone has been recognized recently. The nongenomic action pathway of aldosterone involves: signal perception by protein membrane receptors, induction of the synthesis of messenger molecules such as cAMP, IP3, and DAG, and a change of Ca2+ concentration in the cell cytosol. The target of these rapid responses are also ion channels and exchangers. The nongenomic mechanisms of aldosterone action cooperate with its genomic action in some instances.
