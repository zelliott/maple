Overexpression of phytochrome B (phyB) in Arabidopsis has previously been demonstrated to result in dominant negative interference of phytochrome A (phyA)-mediated hypocotyl growth inhibition in far-red (FR) light. This phenomenon has been examined further in this study and has been found to be dependent on the FR fluence rate and on the availability of metabolizable sugars in the growth medium. Poorly metabolized sugars capable of activating the putative hexokinase sensory function were not effective in eliciting the phytochrome interference response. Overexpressed phyB lacking the chromophore-binding site was also effective at inhibiting the phyA response, especially at higher fluence rates of FR. Overexpressed phyB produces the dominant negative phenotype without any apparent effect on phyA abundance or degradation. It is possible that phyA and phyB interact with a common reaction partner but that either the energy state of the cell or a separate sugar-signaling mechanism modulates the phytochrome-signaling interactions.
