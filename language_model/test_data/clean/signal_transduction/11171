Vasculogenesis-the formation of blood vessels de novo from endothelial cells-and angiogenesis-the process of blood vessel remodeling-are regulated by a number of signal transduction pathways, some specific to the vascular system and others used more broadly during embryogenesis. Recent evidence in both zebrafish and mouse suggests a role for Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Hh signaling can target endothelial cells directly or can stimulate blood vessel support cells to produce vascular growth factors. Current studies are aimed at determining how the Hh cascade interacts with the other signaling pathways to promote vessel differentiation.
