To ascertain if EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) induces p53 expression via NF-kappa B signaling.

A nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line, Tet-on-LMP1 HNE2, transfected with LMP1, the expression of which was regulated by tetracycline, was used in this study. Functional activity of NF-kappa B was determined by luciferase reporter assay and expression of p53 and bcl-2 was detected by Western blot.

LMP1 induced p53 expression via NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Induction of p53 expression could be blocked by phosphorothiate analogs of antisense oligonucleotides to NF-kappa B p65 and LMP1, but not by NF-kappa B p50. However, it seemed that LMP1 had no influence on bcl-2 expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Induction expression of p53 by EBV-encoded LMP1 implies that p53 may act as a mediator in apoptosis triggered by LMP1, which brings about a complex balance in nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis.
