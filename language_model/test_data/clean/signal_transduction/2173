Calmodulin and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase are vital components of a number of common intracellular events. Calmodulin, a ubiquitous Ca2+-dependent effector protein, regulates multiple processes in eukaryotic cells, including cytoskeletal organization, vesicular trafficking, and mitogenesis. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase participates in events downstream of the receptors for insulin and other growth factors. Here we demonstrate by coimmunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography that Ca2+/calmodulin associates with Src homology 2 domains in the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, thereby significantly enhancing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in vitro and in intact cells. Furthermore, CGS9343B, a calmodulin antagonist, inhibited basal and Ca2+-stimulated phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol in intact cells. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism for modulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and provide a direct link between components of two fundamental signaling pathways.
