Three new furostanol saponins (FSs) were recently isolated from the dried bulbs of Allium macrostemon and were shown to have antiplatelet effects. This study investigated the inhibitory capabilities of these compounds on adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced human platelet activation. FS-1, when compared with the other 2, had a potent inhibitory effect on ADP-induced platelet aggregation and on the expression of P-selectin and integrin Î²-3. FS-1 also inhibited Ca mobilization and significantly decreased phosphorylated AKT expression in ADP-activated platelets. The suppression by FS-1 of ADP-induced platelet activation and aggregation shown in this study indicate its potential for therapeutic applications.
