Components of cherry trees have been used as traditional herbal remedies for various diseases. These components are known to possess antioxidative effects. However, the mechanisms underlying cherry tree component-mediated antioxidative effects remain largely unknown. This study focused on cherry leaves extract (CLE) and examined the mechanism underlying the effect of CLE on tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH)-induced melanocytic cell death with DNA damage. Interestingly, CLE prevented t-BOOH-induced cell death with reduction in DNA damage, p38 kinase activation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. CLE-mediated suppression of cell death with reduction of DNA damage, p38 kinase activity and ROS production was prevented by a thioredoxin (Trx) system inhibitor but not by a glutathione (GSH) system inhibitor. Finally, data showed that CLE prevented t-BOOH-induced reduction of Trx2 but not Trx1 and Trx reductases (TrxR1 and TrxR2) protein expression. Thus, our results suggest that CLE prevents t-BOOH-induced reduction in Trx2 expression, promotion of ROS production, activation of p38 kinase, and increase in DNA damage and that it protects against cell death.
