Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors regulate cellular lipogenesis and lipid homeostasis. Recent studies reveal expanding roles for SREBPs with the description of new regulatory mechanisms, the identification of unexpected transcriptional targets, and the discovery of functions for SREBPs in type II diabetes, cancer, immunity, neuroprotection, and autophagy.
