Three novel ethylene response factor (ERF) genes, BkERF1, BkERF2.1 and BkERF2.2, were isolated from a medicinal plant, Bupleurum kaoi. The deduced BkERFs contain a canonical nuclear localization signal and an ERF/AP2 DNA binding domain. RNA gel blot analysis revealed that BkERF1 and BkERF2.1 were ubiquitously expressed at low levels in all parts of mature plants, and that BkERF2.2 was expressed at moderate levels in vegetative tissues. Exogenous application of methyl jasmonate induced BkERF1/2.1/2.2 transcripts. BkERF2.2 transcript levels were slightly increased by addition of ethephon and salicylic acid. BkERFs were localized in the plant nucleus and functioned as transcriptional activators. In B. kaoi cells overexpressing BKERFs, inoculation with Botrytis cinerea increased expression of some defense genes which are associated with enhanced disease resistance. Similarly, overexpression of BkERFs in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in elevated mRNA levels of the defense gene PDF1.2, and in enhanced resistance to B. cinerea. Collectively, these results provide evidence that BkERFs mediate the expression of defense-related genes in plants.
