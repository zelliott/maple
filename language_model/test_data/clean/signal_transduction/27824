The responsiveness of granulosa cells to FSH (cAMP) changes as these cells switch from the proliferative stage in growing follicles to the terminally differentiated, nonproliferating stage after LH-induced luteinization. To analyze this transition, two well characterized culture systems were used. 1) Granulosa cells isolated from immature rats were cultured in serum-free medium, a system that permits analysis of dynamic, short-term responses to hormones/cAMP. 2) Granulosa cells from preovulatory (PO) follicles that have been exposed in vivo to surge concentrations of hCG (PO/ hCG) were cultured in medium containing 1% FBS, a system that permits analyses of cells that have undergo irreversible, long-term changes associated with luteinization. To analyze the biochemical basis for the switch in cAMP responsiveness, the localization of A-kinase pathway components was related to the expression of two cAMP target genes, aromatase (CYP19) and serum-and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (Sgk). Components of the A-kinase pathway were analyzed by Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence using specific antibodies to the C subunit, RIIalpha/beta subunits, CREB (cAMP-regulatory element binding protein), phospho-CREB, CBP (CREB binding protein), and Sgk. Cellular levels of C subunit and CREB were similar in all cell types and hormone treatments. CREB and CBP were nuclear; RIIalpha/beta was restricted to a cytoplasmic basket-like structure. Addition of FSH to immature granulosa cells caused rapid nuclear import of C subunit within 1 h. Nuclear C subunit decreased by 6 h after FSH but could be rapidly reimported to the nucleus by the addition of forskolin at 6, 24, or 48 h. Nuclear C subunit was associated with the rapid but transient increases in phospho-CREB. FSH induced Sgk in a biphasic manner in which the protein was nuclear at 1 h and cytoplasmic at 48 h. Aromatase mRNA was only expressed at 24-48 h after FSH, a pattern that was not altered by phosphodiesterases or phosphatases. In the luteinized (PO/hCG) granulosa cells, immunoreactive C subunit was localized in a punctate pattern in the nucleus as well as to a cytoplasmic basket-like structure, a distribution pattern not altered by forskolin. Aromatase, Sgk, and phospho-CREB were expressed at elevated levels in a non-forskolin-responsive manner. Most notable, both phospho-CREB and Sgk were preferentially localized in a punctate pattern within the cytoplasm and not altered by forskolin. Collectively, these data indicate that when granulosa cells differentiate to luteal cells the subcellular localization (nuclear vs. cytoplasmic) of A-kinase pathway components changes markedly. Thus, either the mechanisms of nuclear import and export or the presence of distinct docking sites (and functions ?) dictate where A-kinase, phospho-CREB and Sgk are localized in granulosa cells compared with the terminally differentiated luteal cells.
