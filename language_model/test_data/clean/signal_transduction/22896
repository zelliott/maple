The interaction between Ca2+ and cAMP in the mediation of ecdysteroid secretion from prothoracic glands (PGs) of Bombyx mori was investigated in vitro. Omission of Ca2+ from the PGs' incubation medium decreased basal ecdysteroid secretion from day 3 until day 6. On day 6, the ability of forskolin or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to stimulate ecdysteroid secretion was affected by the omission of Ca2+ from the medium. The cAMP agonist Sp-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate (Sp-cAMPS) and the cAMP analogue dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) stimulated ecdysteroid secretion even in the absence of Ca2+ from the medium. The Sp-cAMPS-stimulated ecdysteroid secretion was inhibited by the cAMP antagonist Rp-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate (Rp-cAMPS) and the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil. Both the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and the L-type Ca2+ channel agonist S(-) Bay K 8644 could stimulate ecdysteroid secretion. The A23187-induced ecdysteroid secretion was partially inhibited by Rp-cAMPS. The combined results indicate that Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways can cooperatively, as well as independently, stimulate ecdysteroid secretion from the PGs.
