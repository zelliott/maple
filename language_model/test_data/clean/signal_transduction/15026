Chromogranin A (CgA), a neuroactive glycoprotein, is associated with microglial activation cascades implicated in neurodegeneration. Here we show that CgA-dependent inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and stress responses in microglia involved signalling via scavenger receptors (SR), since SR class-A (SR-A) ligands blocked iNOS expression, mitochondrial depolarisation, apoptosis and glutamate release. Furthermore, block of SR-A ameliorated CgA-induced microglial neurotoxicity. In contrast, block of CD36, or the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) did not prevent CgA-induced microglial activation and neurotoxicity. Thus, manipulation of specific scavenger receptor-coupled signalling pathways may provide avenues for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases implicating microglial activation with chromogranin peptides.
