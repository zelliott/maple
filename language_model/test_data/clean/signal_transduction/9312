The activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce inflammation that are one of key etiological conditions for the development of many chronic inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis and diabetes. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists play a crucial role in improving glucose and lipid homeostasis in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Evidence is growing that benefits of PPARγ agonists may also be derived from the anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties of these agents. However, the role of rosiglitazone in regulating LPS-induced vascular inflammation has yet to be fully elucidated. The current study demonstrated that rosiglitazone exerted a potent anti-inflammatory action via decreasing interleukin-18 (IL-18), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), TLR4 and increasing PPARγ in LPS-induced VSMCs. Furthermore, treatment of VSMCs with the TLR4 blocker or TLR4 small-interfering RNA presented that the regulatory effects of rosiglitazone on LPS-mediated inflammation in VSMCs were dependent on TLR4. Interestingly, the results indicated that beneficial effects of rosiglitazone on LPS-induced inflammation in VSMCs were mediated via interference of TLR4 and its downstream signaling components including Toll-interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIF), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and interferon-gamma inducible protein 10 (IP-10). In summary, PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone exerts anti-inflammatory property by antagonizing LPS-mediated inflammation in VSMCs. More importantly, the regulation of the TRIF-dependent TLR4 signaling pathway (TLR4/TRIF/ IRF3/IP-10) provides new insight to understand the mode of action of rosiglitazone for its anti-inflammatory effects.
