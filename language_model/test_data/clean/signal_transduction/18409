Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in exocrine tissue from the avian nasal salt gland are coupled to phospholipase C and generate inositol phosphate and Ca(2+) signals upon activation. An early effect of receptor activation in the secretory cells is a transient accumulation of c-Fos protein. In cooperation with constitutively expressed Jun, Fos presumably serves as a transcription factor altering gene expression during cell growth and differentiation processes in the gland associated with adaptation to osmotic stress in animals. Nothing is known, however, about the mAChR-dependent signaling pathways leading to Fos expression in these cells. By incubation of isolated nasal gland tissue in short-term culture with activators or inhibitors of signaling pathways and quantitative Western blot analysis of Fos abundance, we have now identified the sustained elevation of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase as intermediate signaling elements for the regulation of c-Fos by muscarinic receptor activation. It is suggested that p38 MAP kinase, rather than exclusively mediating stress responses, is involved in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation controlled by G protein-coupled receptors.
