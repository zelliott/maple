N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM) is a hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic agent. This agent was administered in the form of drinking water which contained 200 mg of NNM/liter. Its time-dependent intake profile showed four phases over 20 weeks, followed by a fifth phase where only water was supplied. Most frequently, hepatocellular carcinoma appeared between the end of phase IV and the beginning of phase V. At 5 weeks of NNM administration, foci of altered hepatocytes (FAH) containing 100-1000 hepatocytes could be isolated together with free hepatocytes by the collagenase perfusion method. When these foci were grown on the William's Medium E containing hormonally defined medium, they were able to survive approximately twice as long as normal hepatocytes At 10 weeks of NNM administration, few FAH were isolated together with free hepatocytes. The hepatocytes which had been placed under extended chemical stress showed increased heat tolerance (7 to 8 h) at 43 degrees C, while normal hepatocytes could survive 3 to 4 h. At the neoplastic phase spanning the end of the 20 weeks of the NNM administration and water phase, the rats bearing hepatocellular carcinoma entered the terminal stage, where observable tumor masses could be isolated from the tumor bearing liver and tested for ex vivo growth in tissue culture. After stabilization of the isolated primary hepatoma cells through 10 passages of propagation on William's Medium E or minimal Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, their gene expression profile was analyzed by DNA microarray and compared with the profile of normal hepatocytes. The comparison revealed that upregulation involved ribosome-dependent protein synthesis, including 40S ribosomal proteins (S4, S7, S18, S20), 60S ribosomal proteins (L6, L21, L32, L37, P1), initiation factor 4A, and elongation factor 1alpha.
