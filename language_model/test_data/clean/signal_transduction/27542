Interaction of antibodies to ganglioside GM1 with Neuro2a cells was studied to investigate the role of GM1 in cell signaling. Binding of anti-GM1 to Neuro2a cells induced the formation of 3H-inositol phosphates (3H-IPs) and elevated the intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i. The rise in [Ca2+]i was due to the influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium and release from intracellular Ca2+ pools. The Ca2+ influx pathway did not allow the permeation of Na+ or K+. The influx was inhibited by amiloride, a specific blocker of T-type Ca2+ channels, whereas nifedipine and diltiazem, blockers of L-type Ca2+ channels, did not have any effect. Thus, anti-GM1 appears to activate a T-type Ca2+ channel in Neuro2a cells. The intracellular Ca2+ release was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with neomycin sulfate, phorbol dibutyrate, and pertussis toxin (PTx), which also inhibited the 3H-IP formation in Neuro2a cells. Addition of caffeine neither elevated the [Ca2+]i nor affected the anti-GM1-induced [Ca2+]i rise. The data reveal that the binding of anti-GM1 to Neuro2a cells activates phospholipase C via a PTx-sensitive G protein, which leads to formation of IPs and release of Ca2+ from inositol trisphosphate-sensitive pool of endoplasmic reticulum. Anti-GM1 also arrested the differentiation of Neuro2a cells in culture and significantly stimulated their proliferation. This stimulatory effect of anti-GM1 on cell proliferation was blocked by amiloride but not by PTx, suggesting that the influx of Ca2+ was essentially required for cell proliferation. Our data suggest a role for GM1 in the regulation of transmembrane signaling events and cell growth.
