The central neural mechanisms underlying differences in cardiovascular variability between wakefulness, non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS), and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) remain poorly understood. These mechanisms may involve hypocretin (HCRT)/orexin signaling. HCRT signaling is linked to wake-sleep states, involved in central autonomic control, and impaired in narcoleptic patients. Thus, we investigated whether HCRT signaling plays a role in controlling cardiovascular variability during spontaneous behavior in HCRT-deficient mice. HCRT-ataxin3 transgenic mice lacking HCRT neurons (TG), knockout mice lacking HCRT peptides (KO), and wild-type controls (WT) were instrumented with electrodes for sleep recordings and a telemetric blood pressure transducer. Fluctuations of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart period (HP) during undisturbed wake-sleep behavior were analyzed with the sequence technique, cross-correlation functions, and coherent averaging of SBP surges. During NREMS, all mice had lower SBP variability, greater baroreflex contribution to HP control at low frequencies, and greater amplitude of the central autonomic and baroreflex changes in HP associated with SBP surges than during wakefulness. During REMS, all mice had higher SBP variability and depressed central autonomic and baroreflex HP controls relative to NREMS. HP variability during REMS was higher than during NREMS in WT only. TG and KO also had lower amplitude of the cardiac baroreflex response to SBP surges during REMS than WT. These results indicate that chronic lack of HCRT signaling may cause subtle alterations in the control of HP during spontaneous behavior. Conversely, the integrity of HCRT signaling is not necessary for the occurrence of physiological sleep-dependent changes in SBP variability.
