Diffuse Large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is characterized by a markedly heterogeneous clinical course and response to therapy that is not appreciated with standard histopathologic and immunophenotypic evaluations. Analysis of global gene expression using DNA microarrays has the potential to improve the classification of lymphomas. Molecular profiling may allow the description of specific disease subtypes with similar clinical behavior and outcome. In addition, gene expression profiling has led to the discovery of new putative genes and a better understanding of aberrant signaling pathways. These insights may lead to the discovery of new targeted therapies. This review describes the progress that has been made in our understanding of DLBCL as a result of gene expression profiling.
