Enormous progress has been made in the last several years in delineating signal transduction pathways associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis. The components of these pathways, which include both oncogenes and tumor suppressors, may provide viable targets for therapeutic intervention for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. This review highlights some of these recent biologic and pharmacologic advances, focusing on the ras pathway and on p53-dependent apoptosis.
