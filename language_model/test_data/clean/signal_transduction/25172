Studies on cell cycle regulation and cancer genetics have revealed that multiple cell cycle regulatory proteins play key roles in oncogenesis. These can be categorized in three sets. First; p16INK4-Cyclin D1-RB pathway, which controls G1 to S progression of the cell cycle, second; p53 pathway, which is involved in DNA damage repair, and third; p27KIP1 CDK inhibitor, a negative regulator of cell cycle, and decreased expression of which has been correlated to poor prognosis in cancer patients. Among these, p16INK4, RB and p53 are tumor suppressor genes, and p27 has been pointed out to be haplo-insufficient for tumor suppression. Involvement of these cell cycle regulatory proteins in lung cancer will be discussed.
