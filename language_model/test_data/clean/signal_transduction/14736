Preeclampsia is a potentially fatal complication of human pregnancy characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, and edema. Placental oxidative stress is a key element in the pathogenesis of the syndrome and results in the release of a cocktail of factors, including proinflammatory cytokines and apoptotic debris, that in turn cause activation of the maternal endothelium. The intermediary molecular mechanisms underlying this release are unknown, but they represent a potential target for therapeutic interventions. We examined activation of signaling pathways during hypoxia-reoxygenation of villous explants in vitro. Hypoxia-reoxygenation activated the p38 and stress-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the nuclear factor-kappaB pathways. Downstream consequences included increased tissue concentrations and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta, increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2, and increased apoptosis. Administration of vitamins C and E to explants blocked activation of the p38 and stress-activated protein kinase MAPK and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways. Vitamin administration or p38 pathway inhibition also reduced cyclooxygenase-2 expression, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta secretion, and the levels of apoptosis. We conclude that oxidative stress is a potent inducer of placental synthesis and release of proinflammatory factors. Most of these effects are mediated through the p38 MAPK and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways and can be effectively blocked by vitamins C and E in vitro.
