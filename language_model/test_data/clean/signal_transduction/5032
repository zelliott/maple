Chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is critical for successful cartilage regeneration. Several methods have been developed to attempt to chondrogenic differentiation, because chondrogenic differentiated cells can form stable cartilage and induce expression of a cartilage-specific phenotype. In this study, we found that both H-89 and microRNA-23b induced differentiation into chondrocyte of hMSCs through down-regulation of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. The small molecule, H-89, was identified by PCA analysis as a potential mediator of chondrogenic differentiation. H-89 induced the expression of the chondrocyte marker, aggrecan, as well as miR-23b. We searched that miR-23b regulates protein level of PKA. When miR-23b was transfected into hMSCs, chondrogenic differentiation was induced. We confirmed the target of miR-23b using a reporter gene assay. Furthermore, not only H-89 or miR-23b-treated cells, but also cell co-treated with H-89 and miR-23b differentiated into chondrocytes. Our results indicate that H-89 induces the expression of endogenous miR-23b, thereby inducing chondrogenic differentiation by negatively inhibition of PKA signaling.
