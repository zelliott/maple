G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonist-activated transformation of NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells has been documented by many workers. Our present interest is in the growth control exerted by these agonists. The mechanisms involved in GPCR agonist-activated growth regulation are not known and investigations using existing cell lines are complicated by the endogenous expression of numerous different GPCRs as well as by the fact that these cell lines are cultured in serum that contains naturally occurring agonists for these receptors. To study the agonist induced growth response of cells transfected with either delta-opioid or serotonin-5HT2C neurotransmitter receptor genes, we have developed new clonal cell lines derived from NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. These new cell lines, designated with the suffix 3T3DA, can be cultured stably in serum-free, hormone-defined medium: insulin is the only exogenous growth factor added to the culture medium of proliferating 3T3DA cell lines, and their proliferation can be stopped and started by the respective removal or addition of insulin. Micromolar concentrations of agonists were used to activate the corresponding opioid and serotonin receptors over periods extending to 6 days. We observed distinct patterns of GPCR-specific, agonist-activated growth regulation in serum-free cultures, but not in serum-supplemented cultures. At concentrations > 10 microM, morphine inhibits growth of delta-opioid receptor-expressing cells by 40% with respect to normal 3T3DA cells. Opioid agonist induced inhibition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) production as well as growth down-regulation are pertussis toxin sensitive indicating that the exogenously expressed delta-opioid receptors demonstrate classical opioid receptor signaling. The presence of 1 microM serotonin stimulates growth of serotonin-5HT2C receptor- expressing cells by approximately 100% with respect to normal 3T3DA cells. Neither the untreated nor the agonist-treated cells form colonies in soft agar, indicating that they retain anchorage-dependent growth control. These cell lines provide a simple system that could be used as a tool for probing the complex molecular mechanisms associated with GPCR agonist-activated growth control.
