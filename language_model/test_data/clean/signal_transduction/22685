Injury to the central nervous system leads to cellular changes not only in the affected neurons but also in adjacent glial cells. This neuroglial activation is a consistent feature in almost all forms of brain pathology and appears to reflect an evolutionarily-conserved program which plays an important role for the repair of the injured nervous system. Recent work in mice that are genetically-deficient for different cytokines (M-CSF, IL-6, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1) has begun to shed light on the molecular signals that regulate this cellular response. Here, the availability of cytokine-deficient animals with reduced or abolished neuroglial activation provides a direct approach to determine the function of the different components of the cellular response leading to repair and regeneration following neural trauma.
