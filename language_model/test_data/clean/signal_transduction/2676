Integrin receptors can mediate transmembrane signaling in response to ligand binding. To further examine the role of the integrin alpha subunit in these signaling functions, we assessed the contribution of the alpha 6 cytoplasmic domain variants to the signaling properties of the alpha 6 beta 1 integrin using P388D1 cells that had been transfected with either the alpha 6A or the alpha 6B cDNA. The alpha 6A beta 1 and alpha 6B beta 1 receptors induced marked quantitative differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins after binding to laminin. Specifically, the alpha 6A cytoplasmic domain was more effective than the alpha 6B cytoplasmic domain in inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of three major proteins (molecular mass, 120, 110, and 76 kDa). In addition to these proteins, we also observed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein paxillin was increased significantly more by alpha 6A beta 1 integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin than by that of alpha 6B beta 1. This differential pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation induction does not appear to be a secondary event initiated by cell shape changes. Also, differences in tyrosine phosphorylation in the alpha 6 transfectants were not evident in response to attachment to other substrates. These findings provide biochemical evidence for functional differences between alpha subunit cytoplasmic domain variants of the same integrin.
