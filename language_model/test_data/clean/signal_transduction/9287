Cell migration is the hallmark of cancer regulating anchorage independent growth and invasiveness of tumor cells. Hyaluronan (HA), an ECM polysaccharide is shown to regulate this process. In the present report, we demonstrated, supplementation of purified recombinant hyaluronan binding protein 1(HABP1/p32/gC1qR) from human fibroblast cDNA enhanced migration potential of highly invasive melanoma (B16F10) cells. Exogenous HABP1 adhered to the cell surface transiently and was shown to interact and colocalize with α(v)β(3) integrin, a regulatory molecule of cell migration. In HABP1 treated cells, the phosphorylation of nuclear factor inducing kinase (NIK) and IκBα was observed, followed by nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of NFκB, along with its DNA-binding and transactivation, resulting in upregulation of MT1-MMP expression and finally MMP-2 activation. To substantiate our findings, prior to HABP1 treatment, the expression of NIK was reduced by small interfering RNA mediated knockdown and confirmed the inhibition of nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of NFκB and upregulation of MT1-MMP expression. In addition, the use of curcumin, an anti-cancer drug, or GRGDSP, the blocking peptide along with exogenous HABP1, inhibited such NFκB-dependent pathway, confirming that HABP1-induced cell migration is α(v)β(3) integrin-mediated and downstream signaling by NFκB. Finally, we translated the in vitro data in mice model and observed enhanced tumor growth with higher MT1-MMP expression and MMP-2 activation in the tumors upon injection of HABP1 treated melanoma cells. The treatment of curcumin, the anticancer drug along with HABP1, inhibited the migration, expression of MT1-MMP and activation of MMP-2 and finally tumor growth supports the involvement of HABP1 in tumor formation.
