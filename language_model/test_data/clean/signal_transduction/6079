G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are cellular surface proteins that span seven transmembrane domains and constitute the largest family of receptors in the genome. They are highly expressed in the central nervous system, and particularly in the hypothalamus, a structure known to be involved in the regulation of energy balance. This review describes the cellular distribution of GPCRs within hypothalamic regions involved in the control of energy balance, and their signaling pathways. An approach which uses knowledge of these features might help to identify and prioritize targets for drug development and strengthen our understanding of the neurobiology of eating disorders.
