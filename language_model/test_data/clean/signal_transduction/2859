Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) are expressed at high levels in the central nervous system (CNS), however their function in the CNS is not well understood. The immortalized neuronal cell line (BK1), derived from a transgenic mouse central nervous system tumor, expresses high levels of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) and demonstrates both morphologic and biochemical changes when treated with basic FGF (FGF-2). We have derived subclones of BK1 cells with varying degrees of FGF responsiveness by transfecting either a wild type (FRW) or a truncated (FRX) form of FGFR1. Cells expressing high levels of FGFR1 rapidly and uniformly respond to FGF, while cells expressing FRX fail to respond to FGF, either morphologically or by the expression of molecular markers. These BK1 subclones will prove useful to study FGFR mediated signal transduction and FGFR responsive genes in a CNS derived cell. These studies also demonstrate that a dominant negative FGF receptor can be used as a tool to elucidate the function of FGF in the central nervous system.
