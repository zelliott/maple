Contemporary data on the possibility of primary nuclear action of protein and peptide hormones are analyzed and summarized. Experimental data on the nuclear accumulation of protein and peptide hormones and their receptors, ligand dependence of nuclear translocation of membrane receptors, intranuclear distribution of membrane receptors, and dependence of nuclear accumulation of membrane receptors on the cell type are discussed. Evidence and hypothesis on the possible mechanisms of intracellular and transnuclear transport of protein and peptide hormones and their receptors, and association of nuclear translocation with cell proliferation are presented. Putative mechanisms of realization of the signal functions of protein and peptide hormones in the nucleus, including activation of autonomous nuclear signal cascades and phosphorylation of nuclear proteins, and the possibility of direct interaction of the nuclear pool of membrane receptors with transcription factors and DNA are analyzed. A possible biological role of primary nuclear action of protein and peptide hormones is discussed.
