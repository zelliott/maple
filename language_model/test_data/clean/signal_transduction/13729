DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) constitute one of the most dangerous forms of DNA damage. In actively replicating cells, these breaks are first recognized by specialized proteins that initiate a signal transduction cascade that modulates the cell cycle and results in the repair of the breaks by homologous recombination (HR). Protein signaling in response to double strand breaks involves phosphorylation and ubiquitination of chromatin and a variety of associated proteins. Here we review the emerging structural principles that underlie how post-translational protein modifications control protein signaling that emanates from these DNA lesions.
