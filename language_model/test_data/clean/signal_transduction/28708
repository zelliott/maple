Six well-characterized photoreceptor families function in Nature to mediate light-induced signal transduction: the rhodopsins, phytochromes, xanthopsins, cryptochromes, phototropins, and BLUF proteins. The first three catalyze E/Z isomerization of retinal, phytochromobilin, and p-coumaric acid, respectively, while the last three all have a different flavin-based photochemistry. For many of these photoreceptor proteins, (many of) the details of the conversion of the light-induced change in configuration of their chromophore into a signaling state and eventually a biological response have been resolved. Some members of the rhodopsins, the xanthopsins, and the phototropins are so well characterized that they function as model systems to study (receptor) protein dynamics and (un)folding.
