As a marker of macrophage activation, IL-1 alpha was measured after stimulation of murine resident peritoneal macrophages (RPM) with endotoxin-associated protein (EP). Significant IL-1 alpha was produced by EP-stimulated RPM from both C3H/OuJ and C3H/HeJ mouse strains. This EP-mediated IL-1 alpha production was blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors including genistein and tyrphostin, suggesting the involvement of a protein tyrosine kinase in the activation of RPM by EP. Immunoblot analysis using antiphosphotyrosine antibody showed that EP induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 71 kD protein (p71). The p71 and the spleen tyrosine kinase p72syk found in other cell types share common features including: similar molecular weight, PKC independent tyrosine phosphorylation, and inhibition of phosphorylation by piceatannol. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis using anti-p72syk antibody detected the p72syk kinase in EP-activated RPM. These results suggest that the activation of RPM involves an early tyrosine phosphorylation of p72syk or a p72syk-like protein.
