Dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of immune reactions. They control early innate responses, regulate long-lasting adaptive immunity and contribute to the maintenance of self-tolerance. DCs continuously monitor the environment through a multifaceted innate antigen receptor repertoire and, in response to perturbations, start a complex genetic reprogramming that leads to a complete activation of innate and, then, adaptive immune responses. This review discusses how DCs become efficient activators of NK and, subsequently, T cells following a microbial encounter.
