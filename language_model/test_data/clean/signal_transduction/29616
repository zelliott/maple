First identified as part of the Rous sarcoma oncogene product Src, SH3 (Src Homology 3) domains play an important role in intercellular communication and intracellular signal transduction. A high-throughput assay for ligand binding to SH3 domains--SH3 domain proteins immobilized on a membrane--allows rapid visualization of numerous SH3 domain protein-protein interactions with no expensive equipment or radioactivity required. Once the array is constructed or obtained commercially, the procedure is straightforward: The protein of interest is cloned into a fusion-tagged expression vector and expressed in bacteria, the prepared bacterial extract is incubated with the array membrane, and the signal is measured using a chemiluminescence detection system.
