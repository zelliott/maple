In addition to their original function as cell cycle regulators, retinoblastoma (Rb) family members were recently reported to modulate the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible role of pRb2/p130 in the sensitivity of ovarian cancer to camptothecin, doxorubicin, and taxol.

pRb2/p130 was overexpressed in the CAOV-3 ovarian cancer cell line, and the effect of pRb2/p130 overexpression on sensitivity to apoptosis trigged by IC(50) doses of different drugs was evaluated by various methods, including 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometry, and Western blot analyses.

The results reported in this study support the conclusion that overexpression of pRb2/p130 in the CAOV-3 ovarian cancer cell line lacking wild-type p53 is able to inhibit apoptosis triggered by camptothecin and doxorubicin through the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase signaling transduction pathway. Conversely, taxol-induced cell death is not influenced by the pRb2/p130 protein level.

A careful analysis of pRb2/p130 expression in tumor specimens could help to identify the best clinical protocol to be used for each patient, improving efficacy and tolerance and therefore offering additional progress in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
