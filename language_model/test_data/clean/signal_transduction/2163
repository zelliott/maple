High Ca2+ concentrations can develop near Ca2+ sources during intracellular signaling and might lead to localized regulation of Ca2+-dependent processes. By shifting the amount of Ca2+ and other cations associated with ATP, local high Ca2+ concentrations might also alter the substrate available for membrane-associated and cytoplasmic enzymes. To study this, simultaneous equations were solved over a range of Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations to determine the general effects of Ca2+ on the concentrations of free and Ca2+- and Mg2+-bound forms of ATP. To obtain a more specific picture of the changes that might occur in smooth muscle cells, mathematical models of Ca2+ diffusion and regulation were used to predict the magnitude and time course of near-membrane Ca2+ transients and their effects on the free and bound forms of ATP near the membrane. The results of this work indicate that changes in free Ca2+ concentration over the range of 50 nM-100 microM would result in significant changes in free ATP concentration, MgATP concentration, and the CaATP-to-MgATP concentration ratio.
