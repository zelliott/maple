Activation-induced cell death (AICD) of T cells is one of the major mechanisms of peripheral tolerance. The regulation of AICD by IL-4 is poorly understood. In this study, we report that AICD in IL-4-deficient T cells is significantly reduced compared with that in wild-type T cells. This impaired AICD correlates with the failure to induce degradation of cellular FLIP. IL-4-mediated enhancement of AICD and cellular FLIP degradation requires a Janus kinase/STAT-6 signaling pathway. Unexpectedly, these effects of IL-4 could be blocked by a neutralizing anti-IL-2 Ab, and addition of rIL-2 could completely restore the defective AICD in IL-4-deficient T cells. Furthermore, IL-4 regulates the T cell thresholds for IL-2 signaling during AICD. These data suggest that IL-4 promotes AICD via an IL-2-dependent mechanism.
