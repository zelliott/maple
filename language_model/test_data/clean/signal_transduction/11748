We have characterized the specific binding of [3H]-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate in the white and gray matter of normal human brain and in cerebral tumors as an index of the availability of protein kinase C enzyme molecules. White matter has less than 50% phorbol-ester-binding capacity in comparison to gray matter. The binding is lower in tumors of glial origin when compared with normal white matter. Tumors of nonglial origin such as neurinoma and meningioma have a lower binding capacity than glial tumors. Metastatic tissues have the lowest binding capacity. The analysis of binding parameters in tumors and in the corresponding normal peritumoral tissues confirms the decreased binding capacity of neoplastic tissues in comparison to tissues not undergoing malignant transformation. These data suggest that brain glial tumors have a low availability of protein kinase C enzyme molecules and point to the potential involvement of this system in malignant transformation of human brain cells.
