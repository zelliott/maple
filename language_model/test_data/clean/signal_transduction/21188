Noradrenaline (NA) (1-10 microM), dibutyryl-cAMP (1-5 mM), and forskolin (10-20 microM) increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in isolated arginine-vasopressin (AVP)-containing neurons in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON). The NA-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in AVP-containing neurons was abolished by a specific alpha1-antagonist, prazosin (1 microM) and was markedly reduced when treated with a protein kinase A (PKA) blocker, H89 (40 microM). The NA-induced [Ca2+]i was not altered by a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, calphostin C (0.1 microM) and a PKC activator, TPA (100 nM). In general, NA, a known neurotransmitter in the SON, activates AVP-containing neurons via alpha1-receptor which is linked to stimulation of cAMP-PKA-regulated Ca2+ signaling pathway.
