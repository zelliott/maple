A new artificial cell adhesive protein was engineered by grafting the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, the minimal recognition signal of fibronectin for interaction with integrins, to a calpastatin segment by in vitro mutagenesis. The mutagenized protein showed cell adhesive activity in addition to calpain inhibitory activity. The RGD signal grafted to the calpastatin segment was recognized by the vitronectin receptor but not by the fibronectin receptor.
