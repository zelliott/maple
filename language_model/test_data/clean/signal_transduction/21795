Astrocyte production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 is important in central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and inflammatory diseases such as HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). TIMPs and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) regulate the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. An imbalance between TIMPs and MMPs is associated with many pathologic conditions. Our recently published studies uniquely demonstrate that HAD patients have reduced levels of TIMP-1 in the brain. Astrocyte-TIMP-1 expression is differentially regulated in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. In this and the adjoining report (Gardner et al., 2006), we investigate the mechanisms that may be involved in differential TIMP-1 regulation. One mechanism for TIMP-1 downregulation is the production of anti-inflammatory molecules, which can activate signaling pathways during chronic inflammation. We investigated the contribution of transforming growth factor (TGF)-signaling in astrocyte-MMP/TIMP-1-astrocyte regulation. TGF-beta1 and beta2 levels were upregulated in HAD brain tissues. Co-stimulation of astrocytes with IL-1beta and TGF-beta mimicked the TIMP-1 downregulation observed with IL-1beta chronic activation. Measurement of astrocyte-MMP protein levels showed that TGF-beta combined with IL-1beta increased MMP-2 and decreased proMMP-1 expression compared to IL-1beta alone. We propose that one of the mechanisms involved in TIMP-1 downregulation may be through TGF-signaling in chronic immune activation. These studies show a novel extracellular regulatory loop in astrocyte-TIMP-1 regulation.
