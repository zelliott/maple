Ovarian cancer (OVC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality among women in Europe and the United States. Its early detection is difficult due to the lack of specificity of clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, late diagnosis is a major contributor to the poor survival rates for OVC, which can be attributed to the lack of specific sets of markers. Aside from patients sharing a strong family history of ovarian and breast cancer, including the BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes mutations, the most used biomarker is the Cancer-antigen 125 (CA-125). CA-125 has a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 97 % in epithelial cancer (stage III or IV). However, its sensitivity is 30 % in stage I cancer, as its increase is linked to several physiological phenomena and benign situations. CA-125 is particularly useful for at-risk population diagnosis and to assess response to treatment. It is clear that alone, CA-125 is inadequate as a biomarker for OVC diagnosis. There is an unmet need to identify additional biomarkers. Novel and more sensitive proteomic strategies such as MALDI mass spectrometry imaging studies are well suited to identify better markers for both diagnosis and prognosis. In the present review, we will focus on such proteomic strategies in regards to OVC signaling pathways, OVC development and escape from the immune response.
