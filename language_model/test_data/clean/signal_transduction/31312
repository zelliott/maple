Zinc/cysteine coordination environments in proteins are redox-active. Oxidation of the sulfur ligands mobilizes zinc, while reduction of the oxidized ligands enhances zinc binding, providing redox control over the availability of zinc ions. Some zinc proteins are redox sensors, in which zinc release is coupled to conformational changes that control varied functions such as enzymatic activity, binding interactions, and molecular chaperone activity. Whereas the released zinc ion in redox sensors has no known function, the redox signal is transduced to specific and sensitive zinc signals in redox transducers. Released zinc can bind to sites on other proteins and modulate signal transduction, generation of metabolic energy, mitochondrial function, and gene expression. The paradigm of such redox transducers is the zinc protein metallothionein, which, together with its apoprotein, thionein, functions at a central node in cellular signaling by redistributing cellular zinc, presiding over the availability of zinc, and interconverting redox and zinc signals. In this regard, the transduction of nitric oxide (NO) signals into zinc signals by metallothionein has received particular attention. It appears that redox-inert zinc has been chosen to control some aspects of cellular thiol/disulfide redox metabolism. Tight control of zinc is essential for redox homeostasis because both increases and decreases of cellular zinc elicit oxidative stress. Depending on its availability, zinc can be cytoprotective as a pro-antioxidant or cytotoxic as a pro-oxidant. Any condition with acute or chronic oxidative stress is expected to perturb zinc homeostasis.
