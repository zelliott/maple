Chemokines and their receptors are part of polarized T helper 1 (Th1)- and Th2-mediated immune responses which control trafficking of immunogenic cells to sites of inflammation. The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 CXCL-12 (SDF-1) and its ligand the CXCR4 chemokine receptor are important regulatory elements. CXCR4 is expressed on the surface of CD4(+) T cells, dendritic cells and B lymphocytes. Levels of CXCR4 mRNA were increased in pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) of 4-week-old non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice in comparison to Balb/C mice. However, a significant reduction of CXCR4 was noticed at 12 weeks both at the mRNA and protein levels while expression increased in the inflamed islets. The percentage of SDF-1 attracted splenocytes in a transwell chemotaxis assay was significantly increased in NOD versus Balb/c mice. SDF-1 attracted T cells completely abolished the capacity of diabetogenic T cells to transfer diabetes in the recipients of an adoptive cell co-transfer. When T splenocytes from NOD females treated with AMD3100, a specific CXCR4 antagonist, were mixed with diabetogenic T cells during adoptive cell co-transfer experiments, prevalence of diabetes in the recipients rose from 33% to 75% (P < 0.001). This effect was associated with an increase of interferon (IFN)-gamma mRNA and a reduction of interleukin (IL)-4 mRNA levels both in PLNs and isolated islets. AMD3100 also reduced IL-4 and IL-10 production of plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28-stimulated splenocytes. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that AMD3100 reduced the number of CXCR4(+) and SDF-1 positive cells in the inflamed islets. We can conclude that the CXCL-12/CXCR4 pathway has protective effects against autoimmune diabetes.
