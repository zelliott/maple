Experimental evidence has demonstrated the importance of FGF signalling in morphogenesis of the mandibular processes. FGFs transmit their signals through four tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptors (FGFRs). Alternative splicing in FGFRs including FGFR2 generates different isoforms that exhibit different ligand-specificities, exclusive tissue distributions and specific biological functions. Despite extensive information regarding the isoform-specific patterns of expression Fgfr2c and Fgfr2b during morphogenesis of many organs, a comparative analysis of these specific isoforms in the chick mandible has not been reported. To better understand the function of FGFR2 in mandibular morphogenesis, we have analysed the expression Fgfr2b, Fgfr2c and their putative ligands Fgf10 and Fgf9, in the developing chick mandibular processes by in situ hybridisation and RT-PCR. Our observations show that Fgfr2b was primarily expressed in the mandibular epithelium while Fgfr2c was expressed in the mandibular mesenchyme including Meckel's cartilage. Fgf9 and Fgf10 were expressed in a variety of craniofacial regions including the mandibular epithelium and mesenchyme respectively. The temporal and spatial distributions of Fgfr2b, Fgfr2c, Fgf10 and Fgf9 in the developing mandible reported in this study make them attractive candidates for involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal signalling interactions that are known to be necessary for proper mandibular outgrowth and morphogenesis.
