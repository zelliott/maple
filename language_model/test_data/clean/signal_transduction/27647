Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and glycosphingolipids are assembled on the leukocyte surface within membrane microdomains, which also accommodate a set of cytoplasmic signalling molecules (Src family kinases, G-proteins, linker proteins). Recent results suggest that these membrane specializations mediate not only signal transduction via GPI-proteins and glycolipids but also play important roles in initiation of signalling via immunoreceptors.
