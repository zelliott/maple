Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a CC chemokine that attracts monocytes and T lymphocytes. Its receptor (CCR2) is a heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) whose signal transduction pathways for chemotaxis have not been completely defined. Because other GPCRs stimulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, we examined this pathway's activity in response to MCP-1. MCP-1 induced rapid and transient activation of MAPK in human monocytes and in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing CCR2B. This effect was largely insensitive to pertussis toxin and wortmannin, and was protein kinase C-dependent and protein tyrosine kinase-independent. PD 098059, an inhibitor of MEK activation, not only prevented MAPK activation but also inhibited MCP-1-induced chemotaxis. Because pertussis toxin and wortmannin also efficiently inhibit chemotaxis but do not completely inhibit MAPK activation, these data may define non-overlapping signal transduction pathways that all must be activated to produce chemokine-mediated chemotaxis.
