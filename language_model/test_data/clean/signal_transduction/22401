Microparticles (MPs) derived from platelets, monocytes, endothelial cells, red blood cells, and granulocytes may be detected in low concentrations in normal plasma and at increased levels in atherothrombotic cardiovascular diseases. The elucidation of the cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of circulating MPs is crucial for improving our understanding of their pathophysiological role in health and disease. The flopping of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is the key event that will ultimately lead to the shedding of procoagulant MPs from activated or apoptotic cells. Research over the last few years has revealed important roles for calcium-, mitochondrial-, and caspase-dependent mechanisms leading to PS exposure. The study of Scott cells has unraveled different molecular mechanisms that may contribute to fine-tuning of PS exposure and MP release in response to a variety of specific stimuli. The pharmacological modulation of MP release may have a substantial therapeutic impact in the management of atherothrombotic vascular disorders. Because PS exposure is a key feature in pathological processes different from hemostasis and thrombosis, the most important obstacle in the field of MP-modulating drugs seems to be carefully targeting MP release to relevant cell types at an optimal level, so as to achieve a beneficial action and limit possible adverse effects.
