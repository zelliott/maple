Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy associated with psoriasis. Psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, characterized by hyperproliferation and aberrant differentiation of keratinocytes. PsA and PsO can be considered as a unique disease and are immune-mediated diseases and both innate and adaptive immunity play a role in their pathogenesis. Initially, PsO and PsA were thought to be Th1-mediated diseases, however, in the last years, several studies have shown the role of interleukin 17 (IL-17) and Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of PsA and PsO. Th17 cells have been detected in dermal infiltrates of psoriatic lesions as well as in synovial fluid. Interleukin (IL)-23, produced by antigen presenting cells (APC), especially by dendritic cells (DC), is the key regulator cytokine for Th17 and IL-17 production. In this review we discuss the role of IL-17 and IL-23 in the pathogenesis of PsO and PsA and their role as therapeutic targets for PsO and PsA treatment.
