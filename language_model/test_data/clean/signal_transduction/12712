The striking difference in evolution of type I IFN genes of fish and mammals poses the question of whether these genes are induced through similar or different signalling pathways in the two vertebrate groups. Previous work has shown that expression of both Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) IFNa1 and mammalian IFN-beta genes is dependent on IRF and NF-kappaB elements in their promoters. In mammals, IFN-beta transcription is induced through the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway where the adaptor protein IPS-1 plays a key role in the signal transduction. In this work we show that an Atlantic salmon homologue of IPS-1 (AsIPS-1) mediates activation of the salmon IFNa1 promoter and an NF-kappaB driven promoter. AsIPS-1 shares only 18% identity in amino acid sequence with human IPS-1, but possesses the CARD, proline-rich and transmembrane domains found in mammalian IPS-1. Overexpression of AsIPS-1 resulted in induction of an antiviral state in the cells apparently due to induction of IFN. Deletion of the CARD and transmembrane domains of AsIPS-1 abolished its ability to activate the IFNa1 promoter and the NF-kappaB driven promoter, and thus its ability to induce an antiviral state. AsIPS-1 is located to mitochondria similar to human IPS-1. Taken together, IPS-1 plays a key role in the induction of Atlantic salmon IFNa1, which appears to be the first and major IFN induced in host cells upon recognition of viral dsRNA.
