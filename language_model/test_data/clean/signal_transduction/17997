The PII protein is Escherichia coli's cognate transducer of the nitrogen signal to the NRII (NtrB)/NRI (NtrC) two-component system and to adenylyltransferase. Through these two routes, PII regulates both amount and activity of glutamine synthetase. GlnK is the recently discovered paralogue of PII, with a similar trimeric x-ray structure. Here we show that PII and GlnK form heterotrimers, in E. coli grown in nitrogen-poor medium. In vitro, fully uridylylated heterotrimers of the two proteins stimulated the deadenylylation activity of adenylyltransferase, albeit to a lower extent than homotrimeric PII-UMP. Fully uridylylated GlnK did not stimulate, or hardly stimulated, the deadenylylation activity. We propose that uridylylated PII/GlnK heterotrimers fine-regulate the activation of glutamine synthetase. The PII/GlnK couple is a first example of prokaryotic signal transducer that can form heterotrimers. Advantages of hetero-oligomer formation as molecular mechanism for fine-regulation of signal transduction are discussed.
