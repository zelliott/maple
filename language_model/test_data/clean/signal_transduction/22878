Signaling through G-protein coupled receptors is one of the most prevalent and important methods of transmitting information to the inside of cells. Many mathematical models have been proposed to describe this type of signal transduction, and the ternary complex (ligand/receptor/G-protein) model and its derivatives are among the most widely accepted. Current versions of these equilibrium models include both active (i.e. signaling) and inactive conformations of the receptor, but do not include the dynamics of G-protein activation or receptor desensitization. Yet understanding how these dynamic events effect response behavior is crucial to determining ligand efficacy. We developed a mathematical model for G-protein coupled receptor signaling that includes G-protein activation and receptor desensitization, and used it to predict how activation and desensitization would change if either the conformational selectivity (the effect of ligand binding on the distribution of active and inactive receptor states) or the desensitization rate constant was ligand-specific. In addition, the model was used to explore the implications of measuring responses far downstream from G-protein activation. By comparing the experimental data from the beta(2)-adrenergic, micro-opioid, D(1)dopamine, and neutrophil N -formyl peptide receptors with the predictions of our model, we found that the conformational selectivity is the predominant factor in determining the amounts of activation and desensitization caused by a particular ligand.
