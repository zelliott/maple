Cells use phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms to regulate the activity of several proteins required to transmit information from the cell surface to the nucleus. Recent studies have significantly increased our knowledge regarding the structure/function of one major regulator of cell phosphorylation: protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This review will discuss the role of PP2A in virology and parasitology.
