Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a 76-amino-acid chemokine that is considered to be an important chemotactic factor for monocytes. MCP-1 is expressed in the macrophage-rich areas of atherosclerotic lesions. A recent report indicated that MCP-1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) is induced by the stimulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha via the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) pathway. In this study, we examined the effects of JNK inhibitor (JNKI-1), on MCP-1 expression. The results of this study indicated that the expression of MCP-1 mRNA and protein were stimulated in the presence of TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha stimulated the phosphrylation of JNK, however, JNKI-1 inhibited the TNF-alpha stimulated MCP-1 secretion and gene expression. As expected, JNKI-1 blocked the stimulatory effect of TNF-alpha on the MCP-1 promoter activity. In conclusion, JNKI-1 partially inhibits the TNF-alpha-induced MCP-1 expression in HUVECs, and therefore JNKI-1 may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of diseases such as atherosclerosis.
