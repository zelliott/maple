Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mgs1 protein, which possesses DNA-dependent ATPase and single strand DNA annealing activities, plays a role in maintaining genomic stability. We found that mgs1 is synthetic lethal with rad6 and exhibits a synergistic growth defect with rad18 and rad5, which are members of the RAD6 epistasis group important for tolerance of DNA damage during DNA replication. The mgs1 mutant is not sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, but the mgs1 rad5 double mutant has increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea and a greatly increased spontaneous mutation rate. Growth defects of mgs1 rad18 double mutants are suppressed by a mutation in SRS2, encoding a DNA helicase, or by overexpression of Rad52. More over, mgs1 mutation suppresses the temperature sensitivity of mutants in POL3, encoding DNA polymerase delta. mgs1 also suppresses the growth defect of a pol3 mutant caused by expression of Escherichia coli RuvC, a bacterial Holliday junction resolvase. These findings suggest that Mgs1 is essential for preventing genome instability caused by replication fork arrest in cells deficient in the RAD6 pathway and may modulate replication fork movement catalyzed by yeast polymerase delta.
