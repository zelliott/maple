Netrins, a family of secreted molecules, play important roles in axon pathfinding during nervous system development. Although phosphatidylinositol signaling has been implicated in this event, how netrin-1 regulates phosphatidylinositol signaling remains poorly understood. Here we provide evidence that netrin-1 stimulates phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis in cortical neurons. This event appears to be mediated by DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), but not neogenin or Unc5h2. Netrin-1 induces phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) tyrosine phosphorylation. Inhibition of PLC activity attenuates netrin-1-induced cortical neurite outgrowth. These results suggest that netrin-1 regulates phosphatidylinositol turnover and demonstrate a crucial role of PLC signaling in netrin-1-induced neurite elongation.
