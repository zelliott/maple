The hypothesis that neuroepithelial endocrine (NEE) cells control spontaneous tone in isolated guinea pig tracheal preparations was examined. Epithelium-denuded preparations were unable to develop a normal oscillating tone in 12% oxygen (corresponding to systemic arterial oxygen levels) and, instead, developed a strong, smooth tone, similar to the "classic" tone in 94% oxygen. Inhibition of the hydrogen peroxide-producing NADPH oxidase in the NEE cells by 20 microM diphenyleneiodonium chloride transformed, in intact preparations in 94% oxygen, the tone from a strong, smooth type to an oscillating tone of considerably less force. Similar experiments in denuded preparations showed no change of tone and no oscillations. After pretreatment with the catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2, 4-triazole (1 mM), addition of 2 mM hydrogen peroxide to intact preparations displaying the oscillating tone caused a transformation to a strong, smooth type. These findings support the hypothesis that the spontaneous tone in this preparation is largely controlled by the oxygen-sensing NEE cells. For the first time, previous findings on isolated cells can be linked to effects in intact tissue preparations. The results also suggest that the regulation by the NEE cells involves the release of powerful relaxing and contracting factors from the epithelium.
