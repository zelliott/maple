Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved cell-cell signaling system that controls the fate of cells during development. In this review, we will summarize the literature that notch signaling during development controls nephron number and segmentation and therefore could influence kidney disease susceptibility. We will also review the evidence that Notch is reactivated in adult-onset diabetic kidney disease where it promotes the development of nephropathy including glomerulopathy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and possibly arteriopathy and inflammation. Finally, we will review the evidence that blockade of pathogenic Notch signaling alters the natural history of diabetic nephropathy and thus could represent a novel therapeutic approach to the management of diabetic kidney disease.
