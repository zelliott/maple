Heart failure is a common clinical syndrome characterized by increased levels of circulating catecholamines and extensive abnormalities in the beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) system. Interestingly, whether dampening of betaAR signals is beneficial or detrimental for the failing cardiomyocyte is still controversial. In this review we will discuss a number of studies addressing the role of betaAR dysfunction in the development and progression of cardiomyocyte failure, and novel possible strategies to ameliorate cardiomyocyte contractility in heart failure through the normalization of betaAR signaling.
