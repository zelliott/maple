Pain results from the processing of a large number of signals produced at different levels of the central and peripheral nervous system, which are generated in response to stimuli from the environment or from the organism itself. One of the strategies for generating new analgesics consists in studying the molecular bases that underlie the detection of painful stimuli, that is to say, the receptors. One receptor that plays a very important role in sensory and pain physiology is TRPV1, which is responsible for detecting mechanical, chemical and thermal stimuli. AIMS. The aim of this study is to discuss the structural and functional aspects of the TRPV1 channel, as well as its participation in certain pathological processes and the possible perspectives for clinical research.

TRPV1 activation in sensory neurons generates signals that reach the central nervous system, where they are interpreted as pain, as well as triggering the peripheral release of pro-inflammatory substances that make other neurons sensitive to subsequent stimuli. TRPV1 is a receptor that is structurally similar to other voltage-dependent ion channels, with the capacity to detect and integrate several different stimuli from the environment, such as dangerously high temperatures or irritants. Furthermore, the activity of this channel is linked to several signalling chains related with inflammatory processes.

The central role of TRPV1 in the physiology of pain will surely encourage the development of drugs aimed at this receptor which can be used in the treatment of several types of pain.
