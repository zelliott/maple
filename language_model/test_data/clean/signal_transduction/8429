Natural killer T (NKT) cells are innate-like lymphocytes that recognize lipid antigens and have been shown to enhance B-cell activation and antibody production. B cells typically recruit T-cell help by presenting internalized antigens recognized by their surface antigen receptor. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient means whereby human B cells present lipid antigens to NKT cells, capturing the antigen using apolipoprotein E (apoE) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R). ApoE dramatically enhances B-cell presentation of alpha-galactosylceramide (alphaGalCer), an exogenous CD1d presented antigen, inducing activation of NKT cells and the subsequent activation of B cells. B cells express the LDL-R on activation, and the activation of NKT cells by B cells is completely LDL-R dependent, as shown by blocking experiments and the complete lack of presentation when using apoE2, an isoform of apoE incapable of LDL-R binding. The dependence on apoE and the LDL-R is much more pronounced in B cells than we had previously seen in dendritic cells, which can apparently use alternate pathways of lipid antigen uptake. Thus, B cells use an apolipoprotein-mediated pathway of lipid antigen presentation, which constitutes a form of innate help for B cells by NKT cells.
