CCN6 (WISP3) is an extracellular matrix protein that exerts tumor suppressive functions in breast cancer, where its decreased expression is a feature of advanced disease. However, neither its role nor mechanism of action in breast cancer metastasis has been established. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which constitute ligands of the TGF-β superfamily, are multifunctional cytokines that induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell invasion, and metastasis. In this study, we identify a CCN6-BMP4-TAK1 kinase signaling pathway that controls the ability of the p38 MAP kinase to regulate acinar morphogenesis and invasion of breast cells. ShRNA-mediated attenuation of CCN6 in human mammary epithelial cells led to BMP4 upregulation as a major response to exposure to the TGF-β superfamily. CCN6 attenuation also induced BMP4-mediated activation of the Smad-independent TAK1 and p38 kinases. Conversely, ectopic expression of CCN6 in breast cancer cells antagonized BMP4-mediated TAK1/p38 activation and invasive capacity, both by binding BMP4 protein as well as decreasing BMP4 protein levels. Effects on BMP4 and p38 were confirmed in vivo where they correlated with decreased metastasis. In clinical specimens, we found that CCN6 expression was inversely associated with BMP4 and phospho-p38 levels in 69% of invasive breast carcinomas examined, consistent with the functional results. Together our findings identify a novel modifier pathway through which CCN6 acts to limit breast cancer invasion and metastasis.
