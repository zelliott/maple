Consumption of Vibrio parahaemolyticus via contaminated shellfish results in inflammatory gastroenteritis characterised by severe diarrhoea, nausea and stomach cramps. This study investigated the translocation of V. parahaemolyticus across a Peyer's patch M cell-like Caco-2/Raji B co-culture model system, as M cells represent a primary site of infection for many pathogenic bacteria. Vibrio parahaemolyticus translocated across co-culture monolayers in higher numbers as compared to Caco-2 monolayers. Moreover, the bacteria induced a greater disruption of the transepithelial resistance in M cell-like co-cultures than in Caco-2 monocultures. Virulence factors associated with this pathogen include two type three secretion systems (TTSS-1 and TTSS-2). TTSS-1 had no effect on translocation efficiency, with TTSS-2 exhibiting a modest enhancing effect. ERK activity was required for optimal translocation 1 h postinfection, however, neither ERK nor the JNK and p38 MAPK were required at 2 h pi. Additionally, TER disruption in response to bacterial infection occurred independently of the TTSS and MAPK activation. It was concluded that V. parahaemolyticus causes TER disruption of M cell-like co-cultures and translocates in high numbers across the M cell-like co-culture monolayer. These data implicate M cells as important sites for V. parahaemolyticus invasion across the intestinal epithelium during infection.
