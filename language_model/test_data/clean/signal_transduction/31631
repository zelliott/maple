Observations of hereditary glomerular disease support the contention that podocyte intercellular junction proteins are essential for junction formation and maintenance. Genetic deletion of most of these podocyte intercellular junction proteins results in foot process effacement and proteinuria. This review focuses on the current understanding of molecular mechanisms by which podocyte intercellular junction proteins such as the nephrin-neph1-podocin-receptor complex coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics and thus intercellular junction formation, maintenance, and injury-dependent remodeling.
