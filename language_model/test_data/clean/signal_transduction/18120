We have investigated the functional coupling of alpha and beta isoforms of the human thromboxane A(2) receptor (TP) to Galpha(16) and Galpha(12) members of the G(q) and G(12) families of heterotrimeric G proteins in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell lines HEK.alpha10 or HEK.beta3, stably over-expressing TPalpha and TPbeta, respectively. Moreover, using HEK.TP(Delta328) cells which over-express a variant of TP truncated at the point of divergence of TPalpha and TPbeta, we investigated the requirement of the C-tail per se in mediating G protein coupling and effector activation. Both TPalpha and TPbeta couple similarly to Galpha(16) to affect increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) and mobilisation of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) in response to the TP agonist U46619. Whilst both TP isoforms mediated [Ca(2+)](i) mobilisation in cells co-transfected with Galpha(12), neither receptor generated corresponding increases in IP(3), indicating that the Galpha(12)-mediated increases in [Ca(2+)](i) do not involve PLC activation. Verapamil, an inhibitor of voltage dependent Ca(2+) channels, reduced [Ca(2+)](i) mobilisation in TPalpha and TPbeta cells co-transfected with Galpha(12) to approximately 40% of that mobilised in its absence, whereas [8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4, 5-trimethoxybenzoate, hydrochloride] (TMB-8), an antagonist of intracellular Ca(2+) release, had no effect on [Ca(2+)](i) mobilisation by either receptor isoform co-transfected with Galpha(12). Despite the lack of differential coupling specificity by TPalpha and TPbeta, TP(Delta328) signalled more efficiently in the absence of a co-transfected G protein compared to the wild type receptors but, on the other hand, displayed an impaired ability to couple to co-transfected Galpha(11), Galpha(12) or Galpha(16) subunits. In studies investigating the role of the C-tail in influencing coupling to the effector adenylyl cyclase, similar to TPalpha but not TPbeta, TP(Delta328) coupled to Galpha(s), leading to increased adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), rather than to Galpha(i). Whereas TP(Delta328) signalled more efficiently in the absence of co-transfected G protein compared to the wild type TPalpha, co-transfection of Galpha(s) did not augment cAMP generation by TP(Delta328). Hence, from these studies involving the wild type TPalpha, TPbeta and TP(Delta328), we conclude that the C-tail sequences of TP are not a major determinant of G protein coupling specificity to Galpha(11) and Galpha(16) members of the G(q) family or to Galpha(12); it may play a role in determining G(s) versus G(i) coupling and may act as a determinant of coupling efficiency.
