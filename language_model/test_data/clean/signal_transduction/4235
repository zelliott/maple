Molecules involved in communication and signal transduction play a key role in the control of cell growth and differentiation. Growth factors are multifunctional regulatory peptides acting through membrane receptors, a number of which has tyrosine kinase activity. Downstream, cytoplasmic substrates transduce the signal to the nucleus. This cascade can be altered by structural mutations or by deregulation and thus participate to tumorigenesis.
