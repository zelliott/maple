Opiates have long been used as analgesics to relieve pain associated with various medical conditions. Here, we evaluated the effect and mechanism of mu opioid signaling on the intestinal wound healing response and assessed downstream pathways known to be protective against intestinal injury. Mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 days or 4% DSS for 5 days followed by 7 days of water. The mu opioid receptor (MOR)-specific agonist [D-Arg2,Lys4]dermorphin-(1,4)-amide (DALDA) and the antagonist cyprodime were injected s.c. daily for in vivo studies or used for in vitro analysis. We found that MOR activation attenuated DSS-induced histologic and gross intestinal injury and weight loss; diminished Ifng, Tnf, and Il6 mRNA expression; and promoted intestinal healing during recovery. DALDA also enhanced colonocyte proliferation (Ki-67 staining) by 350%. MOR activation increased Stat3 phosphorylation in both DALDA-treated mice and the CMT-93 cell line. Importantly, DALDA-induced colonocyte migration was completely ablated by shStat3 knockdown. Together, this work shows that MOR activation protects against and enhances recovery from DSS-induced intestinal injury. This is associated with an increase in Stat3 activation. Furthermore, Stat3 is required for DALDA-induced colonocyte migration. Consequently, manipulation of MOR signaling may represent a novel means to promote mucosal healing and to maintain intestinal homeostasis after intestinal injury.
