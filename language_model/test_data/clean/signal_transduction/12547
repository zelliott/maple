Competency for DNA replication is functionally coupled to the activation of histone gene expression at the onset of S phase to form chromatin. Human histone nuclear factor P (HiNF-P; gene symbol HINFP) bound to its cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) responsive coactivator p220(NPAT) is a key regulator of multiple human histone H4 genes that encode a major subunit of the nucleosome. Induction of the histone H4 transcription factor (HINFP)/p220(NPAT) coactivation complex occurs in parallel with the CDK-dependent release of pRB from E2F at the restriction point. Here, we show that the downstream CDK-dependent cell cycle effector HINFP is genetically required and, in contrast to the CDK2/cyclin E complex, cannot be compensated. We constructed a mouse Hinfp-null mutation and found that heterozygous Hinfp mice survive, indicating that 1 allele suffices for embryogenesis. Homozygous loss-of-function causes embryonic lethality: No homozygous Hinfp-null mice are obtained at or beyond embryonic day (E) 6.5. In blastocyst cultures, Hinfp-null embryos exhibit a delay in hatching, abnormal growth, and loss of histone H4 gene expression. Our data indicate that the CDK2/cyclin E/p220(NPAT)/HINFP/histone gene signaling pathway at the G1/S phase transition is an essential, nonredundant cell cycle regulatory mechanism that is established early in embryogenesis.
