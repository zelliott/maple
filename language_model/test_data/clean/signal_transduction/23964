The role of cAMP in beta(2)-adrenoceptor signaling and its functional relevance in adult rat heart has been the subject of considerable controversy. Therefore, we investigated the beta(2)-adrenoceptor pathways in both adult cardiomyocytes and in the intact hearts of Wistar rats with respect to protein kinase A (at Ser16)-, the key event in shortening of relaxation time, and CaM kinase II (at Thr17)-dependent phospholamban phosphorylation.

Contractile and cellular beta(1)/beta(2)-adrenergic responses were studied in parallel on the same perfused rat heart. (-)Isoproterenol and the beta(2)-adrenergic agonists zinterol and procaterol were used to discriminate the beta-adrenoceptor subtype-related actions.

Beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation induces protein kinase A-dependent phospholamban phosphorylation in both adult cardiomyocytes and in adult hearts of rats. The beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated shortening of relaxation time in the heart correlates with Ser16 phosphorylation. Adenosine elicited antiadrenergic action on both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic signaling cascades by reducing the phosphorylation status of phospholamban. Only beta(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation produced significant CaM kinase II-related Thr17 phosphorylation, troponin I phosphorylation and activation of phosphorylase a.

Our findings clearly show that beta(2)-adrenoceptor signaling is coupled to phospholamban phosphorylation and shortening of relaxation time in the adult rat heart.
