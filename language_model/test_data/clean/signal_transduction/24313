Lysyl oxidase (LO), which catalyzes the oxidation of lysine residues, was previously shown to have anti-oncogenic activity on ras-transformed cells. Since oncogenic Ras mediates transformation, in part, through the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), we tested here the effects of LO on NF-kappa B activity. Expression of LO in ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells led to decreased NF-kappa B binding and activity, as well as the expression of the NF-kappa B target gene c-myc. Importantly, ectopic expression of LO led to a dramatic decrease in colony formation by ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells, a finding comparable to the expression of the I kappa B alpha dominant-negative mutant, which could be rescued by p65/p50 NF-kappa B subunit expression. LO was unable to directly inhibit the activity of ectopically expressed p65 and c-Rel NF-kappa B subunits, suggesting that LO affected an upstream signaling pathway(s) induced by Ras. Consistent with this hypothesis, LO expression decreased both the rate of I kappa B alpha turnover and the activities of IKK alpha and IKK beta. Moreover, the ectopic expression of a constitutively active version of either kinase reversed the negative effects of LO. Ras can induce NF-kappa B via both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and Raf/MEK pathways. LO potently downregulated the PI3K and Akt kinases, while partially inhibiting MEK kinase activity. Expression of a constitutively activated, myristylated Akt or PDK1 was able to counteract the effect of LO on NF-kappa B, whereas constitutively activated Raf was only partially effective. Importantly, LO blocked membrane localization of Akt and PDK1 in Ras-transformed cells. Overall, these results strongly argue that the anti-oncogenic effects of LO on ras-mediated transformation are due to its ability to inhibit signaling pathways that lead to activation of NF-kappa B.
