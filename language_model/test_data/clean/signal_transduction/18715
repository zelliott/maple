The presence of an autocrine adrenergic and cholinergic intra/intercellular signal transduction network in the human epidermis contributes significantly to homeostatic and compensatory responses regulating vital functions in keratinocytes and melanocytes. The ligands produced control autocrine and paracrine loops to initiate responses through cognate receptors expressed within the same or adjacent cells. The epidermal adrenergic signal controls calcium homeostasis, cell growth, differentiation, motility, and pigmentation via the beta2 and alpha1 adrenoceptors. The cholinergic system is highly complex comprising both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors with multiple subtypes and this system plays an important role in keratinocyte cell cycle progression, differentiation, directional migration, adhesion, and apoptotic secretion. Moreover, lymphocytes also express adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. Both types of signal transduction receptors are coupled to classical intracellular second messenger pathways, including cAMP-, cGMP-, and calcium-mediated downstream responses. To date, it has been recognized that several dermatoses such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, Mal de Meleda, vitiligo, palmoplantar pustulosis, and pemphigus may be mediated, in part, by the non-neuronal adrenergic/cholinergic systems. A detailed understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of the adrenergic/cholinergic network in the skin could offer the development of specific drugs for novel treatment modalities.
