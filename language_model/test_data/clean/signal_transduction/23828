Persistent maladaptive memories that maintain drug seeking and are resistant to extinction are a hallmark of addiction. As such, disruption of memory reconsolidation after retrieval has received attention for its therapeutic potential. Unrestrained reconsolidation may have the opposite effect, leading to reiterative and cumulative strengthening of memory over long periods of time. Here we review the molecular mechanisms underlying reconsolidation of appetitive and drug-rewarded memories, and discuss how these findings contribute to our understanding of the nature of this process. Finally, we suggest that drug-induced alterations to signal transduction might lead to dysregulation of reconsolidation, causing enhancements of drug-related memory after retrieval, and significantly contribute to the compulsive drug seeking that is a core component of addiction.
