Fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15) is expressed in the developing mouse central nervous system and pharyngeal arches. Fgf15 mutant mice showed defects of the cardiac outflow tract probably because of aberrant behavior of the cardiac neural crest cells. In this study, we examined cis-elements of the Fgf15 gene by transient transgenic analysis using lacZ as a reporter. We identified two enhancers: one directed lacZ expression in the hindbrain/spinal cord and the other in the posterior midbrain (pmb), rhombomere1 (r1) and pharyngeal epithelia. Interestingly, human genomic regions which are highly homologous to these two mouse enhancers showed almost the same enhancer activities as those of mice in transgenic mouse embryos, indicating that the two enhancers are conserved between humans and mice. We also showed that the mouse and human pmb/r1 enhancer can regulate lacZ expression in chick embryos in almost the same way as in mouse embryos. We found that the lacZ expression domain with this enhancer was expanded by ectopic Fgf8b expression, suggesting that this enhancer is regulated by Fgf8 signaling. Moreover, over-expression of Fgf15 resulted in up-regulation of Fgf8 expression in the isthmus/r1. These findings suggest that a reciprocal positive regulation exists between Fgf15 and Fgf8 in the isthmus/r1. Together with cardiac outflow tract defects in Fgf15 mutants, the conservation of enhancers in the hindbrain/spinal cord and pharyngeal epithelia suggests that human FGF19 (ortholog of Fgf15) is involved in early development and the distribution of cardiac neural crest cells and is one of the candidate genes for congenital heart defects.
