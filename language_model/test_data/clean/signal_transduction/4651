Although cell death research has progressed rapidly over the two decades with emphasis on the study of apoptosis, non-apoptotic forms of cell death have recently attracted more attention. In the present short review, I will describe how this transition is occurring and emphasize the importance of investigating non-apoptotic forms of cell death as well as apoptosis to fully understand the spectrum of death in eukaryotic cells. The aim is not to list all published forms of cell death, but to indicate the necessity for a conceptual paradigm shift, so I will only introduce a limited number of cell death mechanisms.
