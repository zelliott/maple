High level expression of Fc epsilon RI gamma chain replaces the deficient TCR zeta-chain and contributes to altered TCR/CD3-mediated signaling abnormalities in T cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Increased responsiveness to Ag has been considered to lead to autoimmunity. To test this concept, we studied early signaling events and IL-2 production in fresh cells transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector encoding the Fc epsilon RI gamma gene. We found that the overexpressed Fc epsilon RI gamma chain colocalizes with the CD3 epsilon chain on the surface membrane of T cells and that cross-linking of the new TCR/CD3 complex leads to a dramatic increase of intracytoplasmic calcium concentration, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and IL-2 production. We observed that overexpression of Fc epsilon RI gamma is associated with increased phosphorylation of Syk kinase, while the endogenous TCR zeta-chain is down-regulated. We propose that altered composition of the CD3 complex leads to increased T cell responsiveness to TCR/CD3 stimulation and sets the biochemical grounds for the development of autoimmunity.
