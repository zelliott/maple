The present studies explore the role of polymicrobial infection in the reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and analyze signaling pathways activated upon this induction. We hypothesized that activation of the cellular stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 pathway would play a key role in the bacterium-mediated disruption of viral latency similar to that of previously reported results obtained with other inducers of gammaherpesvirus lytic replication. KSHV within infected BCBL-1 cells was induced to replicate following exposure to metabolic end products from gram-negative or -positive bacteria that were then simultaneously exposed to specific inhibitors of signal transduction pathways. We have determined that bacterium-mediated induction of lytic KSHV infection is significantly reduced by the inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway. In contrast, inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway did not impair induction of lytic replication or p38 phosphorylation. Protein kinase C, though activated, was not the major pathway used for bacterium-induced viral reactivation. Furthermore, hyperacetylation of histones 3 and 4 was detected. Collectively, our results show that metabolic end products from these pathogens induce lytic replication of KSHV in BCBL-1 cells primarily via the activation of a stress-activated MAPK pathway. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time a mechanism by which polymicrobial bacterial infections result in KSHV reactivation and pathogenesis.
