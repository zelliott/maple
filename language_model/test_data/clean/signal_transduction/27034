This study investigated the expression of HLA class I antigens on Huh6 and HB611 cells induced by interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 beta. All of these cytokines induced the antigens on both cells in a dose-dependent manner, with IFNs inducing much more expression than TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta. We have already reported that protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in the antigen expression induced by IFN-gamma on Huh6 cells. The antigen expression induced by IFN-alpha was also blocked by a PKC inhibitor, H-7. However, the antigen expression by TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta was not inhibited by H-7, by a protein kinase A inhibitor, HA1004, nor by a calmodulin antagonist, W-7. These results suggested that PKC, Ca(2+)-calmodulin, and cAMP are not involved in the induction of HLA class I antigens on both cells by TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. We concluded that TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta induced much less expression of HLA class I antigens on both cells than IFNs and that this might be because the signaling pathway by TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta differed from that by IFNs.
