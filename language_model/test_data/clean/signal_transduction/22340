A screening study using a luciferase assay to identify natural products which inhibit Wnt signaling was carried out. The bioassay-guided fractionation of aerial parts of a plant, Impatiens balsamina, led to the isolation of 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (1) as an active compound. Compound 1 inhibited the TCF/β-catenin (TOP) transcriptional activity (IC(50) 2.9 µM), while it decreased the transcriptional activity of FOP (mutated TCF-binding site)-transfected cells at >5 µM.
