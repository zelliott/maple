Aging research has advanced greatly in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans over the past 20 years, and we are now beginning to piece together distinct pathways that impinge on the aging process. The knowledge base that has been obtained through genetic analysis strongly suggests that endocrine signalling has a key role in most, if not all, of the pathways that alter the aging process of multicellular organisms such as the worm. In this review, we provide an overview of two well-studied aging pathways in C. elegans, the insulin/IGF-1 and germline signalling pathways, in which endocrine signalling is clearly important. We also incorporate recent data to create a model of how endocrine signalling in these pathways might occur.
