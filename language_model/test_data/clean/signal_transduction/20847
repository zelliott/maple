The study of the WT1 and EGR-1 transcription factors has provided a molecular paradigm for regulation of a coordinate set of target genes during cell growth and differentiation. The next critical questions that must be addressed are: what are the target genes which are normally regulated by WT1-EGR-1, and how does misregulation of these genes result in tumor formation?
