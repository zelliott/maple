Previous reports indicate that the NIX/BNIP3L gene acts as a pro-apoptotic factor by interacting with BCL2 and BCL-XL, playing an important role in hypoxia-dependent cell death and acting as a tumor suppressor. However, many studies also showed that NIX is linked to a protective role and cell survival in cancer cells. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) can attenuate apoptosis in human cancers in response to chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation. We observed an absence of i-κBα (NF-κB activation inhibitor) expression, but a greater expression of Nix and p-NF-κB proteins in the Nix-wt U251 cells, which was not observed in the Nix-kn cells under hypoxic conditions. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and luciferase detection, the activation of NF-κB was detected only in the Nix-wt U251 cells with hypoxia. These data imply that Nix protein might play a role in the positive regulation of the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, 46 cases of glioma also showed high levels of Nix protein expression, which was always accompanied by high p-NF-κB expression. Patients with Nix (+) showed less tissue apoptosis behavior in glioblastoma (GBM), unlike that observed in the Nix-negative patients (-). The same apoptotic tendency was also identified in anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) groups, but not in astrocytoma (AS). On analyzing the Kaplan-Meier curve, better tumor-free survival was observed only in cases of astrocytoma, and not in AA and GBM. Thus, our study indicates that Nix protein might have multiple functions in regulating glioma behaviors. In the low-grade gliomas (astrocytoma) with low expression of NF-κB, the cell death-inducing function that occurs through a Bax mechanism might predominate and act as a tumor suppressor. While in the malignant gliomas (AA and GBM), with higher expression of the NIX gene and with activity of the NF-κB pathway, the oncogene function of Nix was predominant.
