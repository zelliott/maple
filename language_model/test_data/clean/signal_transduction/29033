To explore the effect of ginsenoside Rb1 on JNK/p38 MAPK in the process of beta-amyloid peptide (25-35) -induced tau protein hyperphosphorylation, Western blotting and immunocytochemical stain were performed to observe the tau protein phosphorylation and the expression of JNK/p38 MAPK. The level of tau protein phosphorylation in the sites of Ser396 , Ser199/202 and Thr205 increased after rat cortical neurons exposed to 20 micromol x L(-1) Abeta25-35, meanwhile the level of JNK/p38 MAPK also increased after Abeta25-35 treatment for 12 h. Pretreatment with several doses of ginsenoside Rbl markedly attenuated tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the expression of JNK/p38 MAPK. Ginsenoside Rbl markedly attenuated tau protein hyperphosphorylation through JNK/p38 MAPK pathway.
