Complement receptors are expressed on cells of the innate and the adaptive immune system. They play important roles in pathogen and danger sensing as they translate the information gathered by complement fluid phase sensors into cellular responses. Further, they control complement activation on viable and apoptotic host cells, clearance of immune complexes and mediate opsonophagocytosis. More recently, evidence has accumulated that complement receptors form a complex network with other innate receptors systems such as the Toll-like receptors, the Notch signaling system, IgG Fc receptors and C-type lectin receptors contributing to the benefit and burden of innate and adaptive immune responses in autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as in cancer and transplantation. Here, we will discuss recent developments and emerging concepts of complement receptor activation and regulation with a particular focus on the differentiation, maintenance and contraction of effector and regulatory T cells.
