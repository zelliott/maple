Six monoclonal antibodies directed against different epitopes of bovine retinal arrestin recognized a single polypeptide in extracts of achlorophyllous Euglena gracilis cells. This polypeptide had an apparent molecular weight slightly lower: 45kDa vs. 48 kDa, and a more basic isoelectric point compared to that of bovine visual arrestin. It was located in an insoluble cytoplasmic fraction. Immunofluorescence assays show a cytoplasmic punctuated pattern suggesting a cluster distribution or a linkage to some cell structure. The presence of arrestine-like molecules in achlorophyllous Euglena gracilis cells suggests that these proteins might be involved in a peculiar step of chemical signal transduction processes.
