The probable involvement of phospholipase D (PLD)/phosphatidic acid (PA) signalling in the hyperosmotic stress response of Triticum turgidum root cells was investigated by examining the effects of butanol-1, butanol-2, phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBut), N-acylethanolamine (NAE) and PA on the hyperosmotic response, the organization of the tubulin cytoskeleton and the accumulation of a phosphorylated p38-like mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (phospho-p46) in plasmolysed root cells. The effects of all the treatments were assessed by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy of living cells, tubulin immunofluorescence, conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), tubulin immunogold localization, protoplast volume measurements and western blot analysis. Butanol-1 and NAE compromised the viability of plasmolysed cells, induced a marked reduction in the plasmolysed protoplast volume, and inhibited hyperosmotically induced tubulin macrotubule formation and the accumulation of phospho-p46. Exogenous PA reinforced the hyperosmotic response of T. turgidum root cells and positively affected tubulin macrotubule formation. Additionally, PA reduced the effects of butanol-1 in plasmolysed cells. Taken together, the data suggest that PLD-mediated PA synthesis occurs upstream of the accumulation of phospho-p46 to regulate hyperosmotically induced macrotubule formation in plasmolysed T. turgidum root cells.
