It is recognized that dopamine promotes natriuresis by inhibiting multiple transporting systems in the proximal tubule. In contrast, less is known about the molecular targets of dopamine actions on water-electrolyte transport in the cortical collecting duct (CCD). Epithelial cells in the CCD are exposed to dopamine, which is synthesized locally or secreted from sympathetic nerve endings. Basolateral K(+) channels in the distal renal tubule are critical for K(+) recycling and controlling basolateral membrane potential to establish the driving force for Na(+) reabsorption. Here, we demonstrate that Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 are highly expressed in the mouse kidney cortex and are localized to the basolateral membrane of the CCD. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology in freshly isolated CCDs, we detected highly abundant 40-pS and scarce 20-pS single channel conductances, most likely representing Kir4.1/5.1 and Kir4.1 channels, respectively. Dopamine reversibly decreased the open probability of both channels, with a relatively greater action on the Kir4.1/5.1 heterodimer. This effect was mediated by D2-like but not D1-like dopamine receptors. PKC blockade abolished the inhibition of basolateral K(+) channels by dopamine. Importantly, dopamine significantly decreased the amplitude of Kir4.1/5.1 and Kir4.1 unitary currents. Consistently, dopamine induced an acute depolarization of basolateral membrane potential, as directly monitored using current-clamp mode in isolated CCDs. Therefore, we demonstrate that dopamine inhibits basolateral Kir4.1/5.1 and Kir4.1 channels in CCD cells via stimulation of D2-like receptors and subsequently PKC. This leads to depolarization of the basolateral membrane and a decreased driving force for Na(+) reabsorption in the distal renal tubule.
