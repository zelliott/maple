Little is known about the ability of peptide-coated surfaces to influence cell responses in vivo. Many studies have demonstrated that peptide-modified surfaces influence cell responses in vitro. Integrins, which bind specifically short peptide sequences, are responsible for these cell responses. In this way, information can be transmitted to the nucleus through several cytoplasmic signaling pathways. The peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD peptide) plays an important role in osteoblast adhesion. The present study was designed to investigate new bone formation in a porous titanium (Ti) fiber mesh implant, which was coated with cyclic RGD peptide. The RGD-Ti implants were inserted into the cranium of a rabbit and were compared with porous titanium fiber mesh disks without RGD sequence (Ti) and with an open control defect. Histologic and histomorphometric examinations were performed 2, 4, and 8 weeks postoperatively. A significant increase in bone formation, or bone ingrowth, was seen in the RGD-Ti group compared with the Ti group after 4 and 8 weeks. All control defects stayed open in all three periods. It was concluded that the use of cyclic RGD peptide in combination with titanium fiber mesh has a positive effect on bone formation in vivo in a rabbit animal model.
