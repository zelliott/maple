To decipher the pathway of apoptosis induction downstream to caspase-8 activation by exogenous expression of Hippi, an interactor of huntingtin-interacting protein Hip1, we studied apoptosis in HeLa and Neuro2A cells expressing GFP-tagged Hippi. Nuclear fragmentation, caspase-1, caspase-8, caspase-9/caspase-6 and caspase-3 activation were increased significantly in Hippi expressing cells. Cleavage of Bid, release of cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria were also increased in GFP-Hippi expressing cells. It was observed that caspase-1 and caspase-8 activation was earlier than caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation. Expression of caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-7 was increased while anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and mitochondrial genes ND1 and ND4 were reduced in Hippi expressing cells. Besides, the expression SDHA and SDHB, nuclear genes, subunits of mitochondrial complex II were decreased in GFP-Hippi expressing cells. Taken together, we concluded that Hippi expression induced apoptosis by releasing AIF and cytochrome c from mitochondria, activation of caspase-1 and caspase-3, and altering the expression of apoptotic genes and genes involved in mitochondrial complex I and II.
