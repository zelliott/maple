The c-ret proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase which plays an important role in kidney and enteric nervous system development. Germline mutations in c-ret are responsible for the dominantly inherited cancer syndromes, multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma as well as the developmental disorder Hirschsprung's disease. Using SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells stably transfected with an EGFR/Ret chimeric receptor, we have studied cellular consequences and signalling events following activation of exogenous EGFR/Ret and endogenous FGF and PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases in cells of neuroectodermal origin. Here we report that Ret activation led to cell scattering, growth inhibition and loss of anchorage-independent growth. Basic FGF, but not PDGF, evoked similar responses in those cells. Nevertheless, activation of all three receptor tyrosine kinases led to ERK2 activation. Analysis of the kinetics of ERK2 activation and downstream events revealed that Ret and FGF receptor activation led to sustained ERK2 activation and SRE transactivation, while PDGF treatment led to transient ERK2 activation and failed to induce SRE transactivation. Our results suggest that sustained, but not transient ERK2 activation may be involved in cell scattering.
