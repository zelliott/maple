In own previous work CD1 mice were tested in the Multiple T-maze (MTM), a robust land maze allowing determination of latency to reach the goal box with food reward and to evaluate correct decisions made on the way to the goal box. Herein, hippocampi of these animals were used for the current study with the aim to investigate differences in protein levels between trained and yoked mice and, moreover, to determine differences in protein levels between trained and yoked mice with and without memory formation in the MTM. Three training sessions were carried out for four training days each, followed by probe trials on Days 5 and 12. Good and no-performers in the MTM were separated based on means and median of latency to reach the goal box on probe trial Day 12. Six hours following the probe trial on Day 12, animals were sacrificed and hippocampi were taken. Proteins were extracted and run on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, spots were quantified and differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry using an ion trap. Levels of 17 proteins were significantly different in trained vs. yoked mice. Seven proteins were differentially expressed comparing trained vs. yoked mice from good and no-performers. A series of proteins were significantly correlated with latency and may link these proteins to spatial memory formation. Differential protein expression in trained vs. yoked mice and in good and no-performers may allow insight into spatial memory formation as well as represent tentative pharmacological targets.
