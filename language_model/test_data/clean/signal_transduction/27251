Recent insights into the action of TP53 have uncovered signal transduction pathways that maintain genomic integrity. TP53 was the first gene demonstrated to be involved in these pathways, but mutation of several other genes can have a similar terminal effect. The characterization of these signal transduction pathways should provide further targets for the improvement of neoplastic diagnosis as well as therapeutic efficacy.
