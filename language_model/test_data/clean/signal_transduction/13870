Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) was recently identified as a new target in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, its mechanistic role in this disease is poorly understood. Based on the known interaction between SYK and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in lymphoma, we hypothesized that SYK may regulate mTOR signaling in AML. Both small-molecule inhibition of SYK and SYK-directed shRNA suppressed mTOR and its downstream signaling effectors, as well as its upstream activator, AKT. Moreover, the inhibition of multiple nodes of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway enhanced the effects of SYK suppression on AML cell viability and differentiation. Evaluation of the collateral mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway revealed a heterogeneous response to SYK inhibition in AML with downregulation of MEK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in some AML cell lines but a paradoxical increase in MEK/ERK phosphorylation in RAS-mutated AML. These studies reveal SYK as a regulator of mTOR and MAPK signaling in AML and demonstrate that inhibition of PI3K pathway activity enhances the effects of SYK inhibition on AML cell viability and differentiation.
