Proteins can be localized either by inclusion or exclusion, and the Par polarity proteins illustrate both mechanisms. Cdc42 recruits Par-6 to a limited region of the plasma membrane. Par-6 recruits Par-3, which is actively removed from other regions by Par-1 and Par-5. Inclusion and exclusion together ensure efficient segregation of the polarity proteins.
