In an ex situ organ perfusion system, that of the isolated nonrecirculating joint perfusion of rat small intestine and liver, insulin infused into the portal vein increased intestinal glucose absorption. This insulin action against the bloodstream can be blocked by TTX, indicating a propagation of the insulin signal via hepatoenteral nerves, which conforms with previous studies with atropine and carbachol. Insulin action could also be mimicked by dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP) acting directly on the absorptive enterocytes. Because autonomic neuropathy is a common late complication of diabetes mellitus, the possible impairment of these nerves in the diabetic state was studied in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. In the isolated joint intestine-liver perfusion, glucose was applied as a bolus into the lumen; its absorption was measured in the portal vein. In 5-day diabetic as well as in control rats, portal insulin, arterial carbachol, and arterial DBcAMP increased intestinal glucose absorption. In 3-mo diabetic rats portal insulin and arterial carbachol failed to stimulate glucose absorption, whereas arterial DBcAMP still did so, indicating an undisturbed function of the absorptive enterocytes. The lack of an effect of portal insulin and arterial carbachol and the unchanged action of DBcAMP in the chronically diabetic rats indicated that the signaling chain via the hepatoenteral nerves was impaired, which is in line with a diabetic neuropathy.
