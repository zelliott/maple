Ca2+ is the central second messenger in the regulation of insulin release from the pancreatic beta-cell; and intracellular Ca2+ -binding proteins, classified into two groups, the EF hand proteins and the Ca2+/phospholipid binding proteins, are considered to mediate Ca2+ signaling. A number of Ca binding proteins have been suggested to participate in the secretory machinery in the beta-cell. Calmodulin, the ubiquitous EF hand protein, is the predominant intracellular Ca2+ receptor that modulates insulin release via the multiplicity of its binding to target proteins including protein kinases. Other Ca binding proteins such as calcyclin and the Ca2+/phospholipid binding proteins may also be suggested to be involved. Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space appears to be responsible for exocytosis of insulin via Ca2+ -dependent protein/protein interactions. On the other hand, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization resulting in secretory granule movement may be controlled by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphorylation. Thus, Ca2+ exerts versatile effects on the secretory cascade via binding to specific binding proteins in the pancreactic beta-cells.
