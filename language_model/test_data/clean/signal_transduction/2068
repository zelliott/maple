Although the basic principles of neocortical development have been known for quite some time, it is only recently that our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that are involved has improved. Such understanding has been facilitated by genetic approaches that have identified key proteins involved in neocortical development, which have been placed into signalling pathways by molecular and cell-biological studies. The challenge of current research is to understand the manner in which these various signalling pathways are interconnected to gain a more comprehensive picture of the molecular intricacies that govern neocortical development.
