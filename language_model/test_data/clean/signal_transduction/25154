The steroid hormone 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1, 25-(OH)(2)D(3)) rapidly modulates Ca(2+) homeostasis in avian skeletal muscle cells by driving a complex signal transduction mechanism, which promotes Ca(2+) release from inner stores and cation influx from the outside through both L-type and store-operated Ca(2+) (SOC) channels. In the present work, we evaluated the involvement of calmodulin (CAM) in 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) regulation of SOC influx in chick skeletal muscle cells. Treatment with 10(-9) m 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) in Ca(2+)-free medium resulted in a rapid but transient Ca(2+) rise correlated with the sterol-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) production. The SOC influx stimulated by the hormone was insensitive to both CAM antagonists (fluphenazine, trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, compound 48/80) and the CAM-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) inhibitor KN-62 when added after the sterol-dependent Ca(2+) transient, but it was completely abolished when added prior to the IP(3)-induced mobilization of Ca(2+) from endogenous stores. Moreover, in cells microinjected with antisense oligonucleotides directed against the CAM mRNA the sterol-stimulated SOC influx was reduced up to 60% respect to uninjected cells. The present results suggest that the 1, 25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced (IP(3)-mediated) cytosolic Ca(2+) transient is required for CAM, activation which in turn activates SOC influx in a mechanism that seems to include CAMKII.
