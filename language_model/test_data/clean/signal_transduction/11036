Release of neurotransmitters and hormones occurs by calcium-regulated exocytosis, a process that shares many similarities in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. Exocytosis is confined to specific regions in the plasma membrane, where actin remodelling, lipid modifications and protein-protein interactions take place to mediate vesicle/granule docking, priming and fusion. The spatial and temporal coordination of the various players to form a "fast and furious" machinery for secretion remain poorly understood. ARF and Rho GTPases play a central role in coupling actin dynamics to membrane trafficking events in eukaryotic cells. Here, we review the role of Rho and ARF GTPases in supplying actin and lipid structures required for synaptic vesicle and secretory granule exocytosis. Their possible functional interplay may provide the molecular cues for efficient and localized exocytotic fusion.
