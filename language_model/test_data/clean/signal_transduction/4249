Extracellular cellulase activity is readily induced when the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica is grown on cellulose substrate as the sole carbon source. However, an isogenic C. parasitica strain rendered hypovirulent due to hypovirus infection failed to secrete detectable cellulase activity when grown under parallel conditions. Efforts to identify C. parasitica cellulase-encoding genes resulted in the cloning of a cellobiohydrolase (exoglucanase, EC 3.2.1.91) gene designated chb-1. Northern blot analysis revealed an increase in cbh-1 transcript accumulation in a virus-free virulent C. parasitica strain concomitant with the induction of extracellular cellulase activity. In contrast, induction of cbh-1 transcript accumulation was suppressed in an isogenic hypovirus-infected strain. Significantly, virus-free C. parasitica strains rendered hypovirulent by transgenic cosuppression of a GTP-binding protein alpha subunit were also found to be deficient in the induction of cbh-1 transcript accumulation.
