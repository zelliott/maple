The firing behavior of 47 ventro-posterior thalamus neurons was studied in two alert squirrel monkeys during rotations of whole body, head and trunk. A total of 27 of these neurons (57%) were sensitive to spatial motion of the head irrespective of the mode of motion. These neurons responded similarly when the head moved simultaneously with the trunk, and when the head voluntarily or involuntarily moved on the stationary trunk. These neurons did not respond to rotation of the trunk when the spatial position of the head was fixed. Five neurons (11%) responded only to involuntary movement of the head produced by external force, but were insensitive to voluntary spatial head movement. They also did not respond to spatial motion of the trunk. Totally 15 neurons (32%) were sensitive to spatial motion, which included rotation of the trunk. These neurons responded when the trunk moved alone, and when the trunk moved simultaneously with the head, but were not responsive to spatial movement of the head while the trunk was stationary. We suggest that the vestibulo-thalamo-cortical pathway comprises two distinct functional channels. In one of these channels, cephalokinetic, spatial motion of the head is coded. In the other channel, somatokinetic, motion of the body in space is coded. Each of these channels further consists of two divisions. In the principal division the motion signal is conveyed continuously, irrespective of the behavioral context of motion. In the other auxiliary division the signal only codes movement caused by externally applied force.
