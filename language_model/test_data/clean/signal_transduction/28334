Despite the presence of more than 400 genes that encode receptor-like kinases (RLKs) in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, very little is known about the range of biological processes that they control, or the mechanisms by which they function. This review focuses on the most recent findings from studies of several leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) class RLKs in A. thaliana, and their implications for our understanding of plant receptor function and signaling. We compare the biological functions of plant and animal LRR-containing receptors, and the potential commonalities in the signaling mechanisms employed.
