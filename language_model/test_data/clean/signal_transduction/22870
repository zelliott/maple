By using purified preparations we show that nanomolar concentrations of Gbetagamma significantly stimulated lipid kinase activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) beta and PI3Kgamma in the presence as well as in the absence of non-catalytic subunits such as p85alpha or p101. Concomitantly, Gbetagamma stimulated autophosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of PI3Kgamma (EC(50), 30 nM; stoichiometry >/=0.6 mol of P(i)/mol of p110gamma), which also occurred in the absence of p101. Surprisingly, we found that p101 affected the lipid substrate preference of PI3Kgamma in its Gbetagamma-stimulated state. With phosphatidylinositol as substrate, p110gamma but not p101/p110gamma was significantly stimulated by Gbetagamma to form PI-3-phosphate (EC(50), 20 nM). The opposite situation was found when PI-4,5-bisphosphate served as substrate. Gbetagamma efficiently and potently (EC(50), 5 nM) activated the p101/p110gamma heterodimer but negligibly stimulated the p110gamma monomer to form PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate. However, this weak stimulatory effect on p110gamma was overcome by excess concentrations of Gbetagamma (EC(50), 100 nM). This finding is in accordance with the in vivo situation, where activated PI3K catalyzes the formation of PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate but not PI-3-phosphate. We conclude that p101 is responsible for PI-4, 5-bisphosphate substrate selectivity of PI3Kgamma by sensitizing p110gamma toward Gbetagamma in the presence of PI-4,5-P(2).
