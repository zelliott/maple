Bacteria rely on numerous basic cellular functions of their target cells to reach successful infection. The recent discovery that the plasma membrane contains specialized microdomains, called lipid rafts, with many specific functions but in particular with the ability to concentrate signaling molecules, has therefore attracted the attention of cellular microbiologists. Since then an increasing number of bacteria and their products have been shown to interact with lipid rafts to promote infection or intoxication. Here we review why certain bacteria and/or their products are attracted toward these lipid microdomains.
