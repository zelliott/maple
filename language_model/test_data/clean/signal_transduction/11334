Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signalling molecule that plays a relevant role in different cell systems, among them the adult heart. The effects of NO are primarily mediated through modulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis, myofibrillar contractility, and metabolic regulation in cardiomyocytes. Recent evidence also suggests an important role of NO for cardiomyogenesis by modulating proliferation and differentiation and regulating cardiac function. In the embryonic, but also the healthy and diseased, adult mammalian heart, the inducible (iNOS) and the endothelial (eNOS) nitric oxide synthases (NOS) are detected. However, the expression pattern of NO and its function differ during development. Furthermore, under pathophysiological conditions NOS expression can also change and cause impairment of cardiac performance and cytotoxic effects. The present review focuses on the role and function of NO during cardiomyogenesis, the mechanisms responsible for eNOS availability, and the paracrine effects of NO generated by cardiomyocytes.
