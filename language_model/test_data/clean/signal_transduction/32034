Diacylglycerol (DAG) is an important signaling phospholipid in animals, specifically binding to the C1 domain of proteins such as protein kinase C. In most plant species, however, DAG is present at low abundance, and no interacting proteins have yet been identified. As a result, it has been proposed that the signaling function of DAG has been discarded by plants during their evolution. In this mini-review, we summarize the accumulating experimental evidence which supports that notion that changes in DAG content in response to particular cues are a feature of plant cells. This behavior suggests that DAG does indeed act as a signaling molecule during plant development and in response to certain environmental stimuli.
