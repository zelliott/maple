Two mechanisms are proposed to account for the inhibition of myosin phosphatase (MP) involved in Ca2+ sensitization of vascular muscle, ie, phosphorylation of either MYPT1, a target subunit of MP or CPI-17, an inhibitory phosphoprotein. In cultured vascular aorta smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), stimulation with angiotensin II activated RhoA, and this was blocked by pretreatment with 8-bromo-cGMP. VSMCs stimulated by angiotensin II, endothelin-1, or U-46619 significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of both MYPT1 (at Thr696) and CPI-17 (at Thr38). The angiotensin II-induced phosphorylation of MYPT1 was completely blocked by 8-bromo-cGMP or Y-27632 (a Rho-kinase inhibitor), but not by GF109203X (a PKC inhibitor). In contrast, phosphorylation of CPI-17 was inhibited only by GF109203X. Y-27632 dramatically corrected the hypertension in N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-treated rats, and this hypertension also was sensitive to isosorbide mononitrate. The level of the active form of RhoA was significantly higher in aortas from L-NAME-treated rats. Expression of RhoA, Rho-kinase, MYPT1, CPI-17, and myosin light chain kinase were not significantly different in aortas from L-NAME-treated and control rats. Activation of RhoA without changes in levels of other signaling molecules were observed in three other rat models of hypertension, ie, stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, renal hypertensive rats, and DOCA-salt rats. These results suggest that independent of the cause of hypertension, a common point in downstream signaling and a critical component of hypertension is activation of RhoA and subsequent activation of Rho-kinase.
