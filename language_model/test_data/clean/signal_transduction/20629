Neuronal networks established on micro-electrode arrays provide useful models for synaptic plasticity. Whether or not this represents a facet of learning is debated since ex vivo networks are deprived of organismal interaction with the environment. We compared developmental signaling of such networks with and without stimulation with a prerecorded synaptic signal from another mature culture as a model of sensory input. Unstimulated networks displayed a developmental increase in individual signals that eventually declined, yielding a pattern containing organized bursts of signaling. Minimal stimulation, to model the onset of sensory input hastened the onset of developmental signaling. However, the overall developmental pattern of stimulated networks, including the total number and type of signals as well as the length of this developmental period, was identical to that of unstimulated networks. One interpretation of these findings is that ongoing plasticity may be essential to establish an appropriate platform for learning once sensory input ensues.
