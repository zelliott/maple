Chemokines are a vertebrate-specific group of small molecules that regulate cell migration and behaviour in diverse contexts. So far, around 50 chemokines have been identified in humans, which bind to 18 different chemokine receptors. These are members of the seven-transmembrane receptor family. Initially, chemokines were identified as modulators of the immune response. Subsequently, they were also shown to regulate cell migration during embryonic development. Here, we discuss the influence of chemokines and their receptors on angiogenesis, or the formation of new blood vessels. We highlight recent advances in our understanding of how chemokine signalling might directly influence endothelial cell migration. We furthermore examine the contributions of chemokine signalling in immune cells during this process. Finally, we explore possible implications for disease settings, such as chronic inflammation and tumour progression.
