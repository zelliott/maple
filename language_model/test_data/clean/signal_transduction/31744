The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential roles of the             SH3-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SGEF) in human prostate cancer.             Experimental data showed that SGEF was overexpressed in human prostate cancer             cells and specimens. The reduction of SGEF expression through an SGEF-targeting             siRNA in androgen-independent C4-2 and C4-2B cells suppressed both anchorage-dependent             and anchorage-independent growth. In addition, the androgen receptor (AR) antagonist             bicalutamide further strengthened this inhibitory effect due to the suppression             of the elevated AR transactivation after knockdown of SGEF. Collectively, our             results provide the first demonstration that SGEF is a novel promoter of human             prostate cancer progression and development.
