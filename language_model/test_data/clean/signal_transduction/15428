Myofibroblasts are the principal mesenchymal cells responsible for tissue remodeling, collagen deposition, and the restrictive nature of lung parenchyma associated with pulmonary fibrosis. We previously reported that thrombin activates protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) and induces a myofibroblast phenotype in normal lung fibroblasts resembling the phenotype of scleroderma lung myofibroblasts. We undertook this study to investigate whether a selective direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, interferes with signal transduction in human lung fibroblasts induced by thrombin and mediated via PAR-1.

Lung fibroblast proliferation was analyzed using the Quick Cell Proliferation Assay. Expression and organization of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) was studied by immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting. Contractile activity of lung fibroblasts was measured by a collagen gel contraction assay. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and type I collagen expression was analyzed on Western blots.

Dabigatran, at concentrations of 50-1,000 ng/ml, inhibited thrombin-induced cell proliferation, alpha-SMA expression and organization, and the production of collagen and CTGF in normal lung fibroblasts. Moreover, when treated with dabigatran (1 microg/ml), scleroderma lung myofibroblasts produced 6-fold less alpha-SMA, 3-fold less CTGF, and 2-fold less type I collagen compared with untreated cells.

Dabigatran restrains important profibrotic events in lung fibroblasts and warrants study as a potential antifibrotic drug for the treatment of fibrosing lung diseases such as scleroderma lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
