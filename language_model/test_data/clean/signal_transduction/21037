The vav proto-oncogene product (Vav), which is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells, contains multiple structural motifs commonly used by intracellular signaling molecules. Although a variety of stimuli including erythropoietin (Epo) have been shown to tyrosine phosphorylate Vav, little is known about the Vav signal transduction pathway. Here, we have investigated the role of Vav in the Epo signaling pathway by characterizing its interaction with other proteins, using the human Epo-responsive cell line, F-36P. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses have demonstrated that Vav was associated with the Epo receptor (EpoR) in an Epo-independent manner and was tyrosine-phosphorylated after Epo stimulation. Furthermore, two phosphotyrosine proteins (pp70 and pp100) co-immunoprecipitated with the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) (p85) were identified as EpoR and Vav, respectively. The interaction between Vav and p85 was shown to be mediated through the SH2 domains of p85 by an in vitro binding assay and confirmed by the presence of in vitro PI3-kinase activity associated with Vav. Treatment of the cells with antisense-vav and -p85 abrogated Epo-induced cell proliferation and PI3-kinase activity. Finally, we found that JAK2 was associated with Vav in vivo and that Vav could be tyrosine-phosphorylated by activated JAK2 in vitro. These results suggest the possible role of JAK2 for tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and involvement of Vav and PI3-kinase in Epo-induced proliferative signals.
