Purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) are a family of metallo-phosphoesterases involved in a variety of physiological functions, especially phosphate deficiency adaptations in plants. We identified 26 putative PAP genes by a genome-wide analysis of rice (Oryza sativa), 24 of which have isolated EST sequences in the dbEST database. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that 25 of these genes possess sets of metal-ligating residues typical of known PAPs. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 26 rice and 29 Arabidopsis PAPs into three main groups and seven subgroups. We detected transcripts of 21 PAP genes in roots or leaves of rice seedlings. The expression levels of ten PAP genes were up-regulated by both phosphate deprivation and over-expression of the transcription factor OsPHR2. These PAP genes all contained one or two OsPHR2 binding elements in their promoter regions, implying that they are directly regulated by OsPHR2. Both acid phosphatase (AP) and surface secretory acid phosphatase (SAP) activity assays showed that the up-regulation of PAPs by Pi starvation, OsPHR2 over-expression, PHO2 knockout or OsSPX1 RNA interference led to an increase in AP and SAP activity in rice roots. This study reveals the potential for developing technologies for crop improvement in phosphorus use efficiency.
