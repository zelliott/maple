We have previously shown that addition of apotransferrin (aTf) accelerates maturation of oligodendroglial cells (OLGcs) in primary cultures. In this work, we examined the effect of aTf on two conditionally immortalized cell lines: N19 and N20.1. These cells proliferate at 34 degrees C and differentiate into mature OLGcs at 39 degrees C. In vitro addition of aTf to both cell lines at the differentiation temperature for 7 days showed increased expression of galactocerebroside, O4, and myelin basic protein (MBP) and a drop in the percentage of BrdU+ cells. The effect on MBP expression was particularly interesting in the less mature N19 cells. These cells do not express either MBP mRNAs or proteins, so aTf induced, rather than modulated, MBP expression in this cell line. In addition, even though MBP mRNAs for all four isoforms were induced, only the 17 and 21.5 kDa appeared to be translated. OLGc differentiation has been shown to be stimulated by the cAMP-CREB pathway. In N19 cells, following a pulse of aTf, there was a 10-fold increase in cAMP levels accompanied by elevated levels of pCREB. In the more mature N20.1 cells, there were no changes in cAMP levels. We conclude that addition of aTf to immature OLGc lines can enhance their expression of differentiated markers, such as MBP. The action of aTf on MBP gene expression in the least mature line is likely to be mediated by the cAMP pathway. In the N20.1 cells, it appears that different signals and/or mechanisms are involved in modulating myelin lipid and MBP expression. The results suggest that aTf can influence OLGc gene expression and differentiation through multiple mechanisms depending on the maturation of the cell.
