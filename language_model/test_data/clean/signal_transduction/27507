Understanding the mechanism which underlies the induction of immunologic tolerance is crucial to the development of strategies for treatment of autoimmune diseases and allograft rejection. Although the concept that T suppressor cells (Ts) downregulate the immune response has long been accepted, the existence of a distinct population of lymphocytes that mediates suppression has not been convincingly demonstrated. In previous studies, we have utilized human T cell lines (TCLs) to analyze the suppressive effects of CD8+CD28 T cells in allogeneic, peptide specific and xeno-specific responses. In each case, CD8+CD28- T cells inhibit proliferation of CD4+ T helper lymphocytes (Th) with cognate antigen specificity. These CD8+CD28- T cells display the critical functional characteristics of T suppressor cells. Similar to the induction of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (Tc) by Th, this process depends on antigen presenting cells (APC) acting as a "bridge" between MHC-class I specific CD8+ and class II specific CD4+ T cells. A possible explanation of Ts-mediated suppression is their ability to modulate the function of APCs. The present studies show that CD8+CD28- Ts directly inhibit the CD40 signaling pathway of APC by a contact-dependent mechanism that renders bridging APCs incapable of inducing CD4+ Th activation. The effects of Ts on the functional state of APC supports the concept that the order in which Ts and Th cells interact with cognate APCs determines the functional outcome of immune responses.
