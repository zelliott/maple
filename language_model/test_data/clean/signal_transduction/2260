The bone marrow microenvironment influences whether a given B cell proliferates, differentiates, or undergoes apoptosis. In this report, we demonstrate that apoptosis of primary murine B lymphocyte precursors can be regulated either positively or negatively by stroma. Several stromal lines that support lymphocyte outgrowth suppressed the spontaneous apoptosis of pre-B cells by as much as 90%. Direct contact with stromal cells more effectively protected lymphocytes than did stromal cell-CM or a collection of recombinant cytokines. In contrast, one unique stromal cell clone actually induced lymphocyte apoptosis, and a second line appeared inert. A survey of adherent cell lines suggested that expression of life-sparing molecules is widespread but not ubiquitous. Experiments with neutralizing Abs to CD44, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), CD9, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), or ICAM-2 suggested that these interaction molecules do not deliver short-term survival signals to B cell precursors. Of particular interest, direct interaction with lymphocyte-supportive stromal cells minimized the negative regulatory effects of IL-1alpha, and a glucocorticoid, but not IFN-beta or PGE2. These results demonstrate that the effect of negative regulators depends upon the context in which these signals are presented. As molecules that influence B lymphopoiesis are better defined, it will be important to consider the role of each in combination with other stimuli.
