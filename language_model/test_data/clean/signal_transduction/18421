The apoptosis-triggering properties of vitamin E succinate (VES, RRR-alpha-tocopheryl succinate) for human LNCaP and PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells and normal PrEC human prostate epithelial cells were investigated. LNCaP and PC-3 cells were sensitive to VES-induced apoptosis, with 100% and 60% of cells undergoing apoptosis after three days of treatment with 10 micrograms of VES/ml, respectively. PrEC cells were resistant to VES-induced apoptosis. Treatment of prostate cells with agonistic anti-Fas antibody triggered apoptosis in approximately 50% of PC-3 cells within 48 hours, whereas LNCaP and PrEC cells were resistant. Prostate cells simultaneously treated with VES and agonistic anti-Fas antibodies revealed 1) no effect on PrEC cells, 2) an additive effect on Fas-sensitive PC-3 cells, and 3) a synergistic effect on LNCaP cells. VES treatment of LNCaP cells caused depletion of cytosolic 43-kDa Fas, enhanced membrane levels of 43-kDa Fas, and induced Fas sensitivity. PC-3 cells expressed high levels of membrane 43-kDa Fas that were enhanced by VES treatments. Fas ligand expression by LNCaP cells was enhanced by VES treatments. In summary, VES triggers apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma cells but not normal prostate cells in vitro, and VES modulates Fas signaling.
