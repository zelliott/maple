BDNF, which acts through tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptors during mammalian development, also enhances long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) in adult Aplysia. Because LTF is a substrate for long-term memory (LTM) in Aplysia, we examined the requirement of a secreted TrkB ligand in LTM formation at molecular, synaptic, and behavioral levels. Using an extracellular fusion protein that sequesters secreted TrkB ligands, we show that TrkB function is required for serotonin-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, tail nerve shock-induced LTF in the CNS, and tail shock-induced LTM but is not necessary for short-term synaptic facilitation or short-term memory. These results show that a secreted growth factor, acting through a TrkB signaling cascade, is critical for the induction of long-lasting plasticity and memory formation in Aplysia.
