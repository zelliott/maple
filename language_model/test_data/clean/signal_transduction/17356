The regulatory effects of the immune system on the skeleton during homeostasis and activation have been appreciated for years. In the past decade it has become evident that bone tissue can also regulate immune cell development. In the bone marrow, the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors requires specific microenvironments, called "niches," provided by various subsets of stromal cells, many of which are of mesenchymal origin. Among these stromal cell populations, cells of the osteoblast lineage serve a supportive function in the maintenance of normal hematopoiesis, and B lymphopoiesis in particular. Within the osteoblast lineage, distinct differentiation stages exert differential regulatory effects on hematopoietic development. In this review we will highlight the critical role of osteoblast progenitors in the perivascular B lymphocyte niche.
