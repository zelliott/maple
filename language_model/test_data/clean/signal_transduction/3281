Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have shown great promise for ischemic tissue repair. However, poor viability of transplanted BMSCs within ischemic tissues has limited their therapeutic potential. Apelin, an endogenous peptide, whose level is elevated following ischemia, has been shown to enhance survival of cardiomyocytes and neuronal cells during ischemia. We hypothesized that apelin-13 protects BMSCs from apoptotic death. In this paper we determined the potential mechanism of apelin-13 effects using cultured BMSCs from adult rats. Apoptosis was induced by the specific apoptotic insult serum deprivation (SD) for up to 36 h. Apoptotic cell death was measured using immunostaining and Western blotting in the presence and absence of apelin-13 (0.1 to 5.0 nM) co-applied during SD exposure. SD-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced by apelin-13 in a concentration-dependent manner. SD-induced mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation were largely prevented by apelin-13. The apelin-13 anti-apoptotic effects were blocked by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Taken together, our findings indicate that apelin-13 is a survival factor for BMSCs and its anti-apoptotic property may prove to be of therapeutic significance in terms of exploiting BMSC-based transplantation therapy.
