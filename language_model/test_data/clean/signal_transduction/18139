Cells of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila die when transferred at low density to a lipid-free nutritionally complete medium. This death is prevented and they will start to proliferate if protein kinase C is activated and this activation is sustained. We propose that this takes place in two stages. Firstly, the phospholipase C pathway beginning with and specific for phosphatidylinositol leads to the formation of diacylglycerol and inositol tris -phosphate. Diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C, and inositol tris -phosphate via Ca(2+)phospholipase D (PLD). Secondly, the protein kinase C response can now be sustained by diacylglycerol produced by phospholipase D, using phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine as substrates. Should this switching from PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC) to phospholipase D fail, then the cell will die in the course of milliseconds during the minutes following inoculation.
