Although estrogen replacement therapy may improve dampened endothelial function in postmenopausal women, the associated risk of breast and ovarian cancer has limited its long-term use. Identifying effective alternative remedy with less carcinogenicity is in serious demand. This study was designed to examine the effect of the phytoestrogen alpha-zearalanol (alpha-ZAL) on homocysteine-induced endothelin-1 (ET-1) induction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and transcription pathways in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). ROS was measured by DCF fluorescent microscopy. Homocysteine-induced expression of ET-1 mRNA, ERK, pERK and c-jun/AP-1 protein was measured using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. ET-1 secretion was determined by the enzymatic immunoassay. Transcriptional factor AP-1 expression in response to alpha-ZAL, homocysteine or both was evaluated by transient transfection assay. Our data revealed that alpha-ZAL ablated homocysteine-elicited ET-1 secretion, upregulated ET-1 mRNA and homocysteine-induced ROS accumulation without any effects by itself. alpha-ZAL also nullified homocysteine-induced increase in c-Jun/AP-1 expression/activity without eliciting any effect by itself. Collectively, our data indicated that alpha-ZAL may antagonize homocysteine-induced ET-1 gene induction, ROS accumulation, activation of ERK signaling pathway and AP-1 transcriptional factor, all of which may contribute to alpha-ZAL-induced beneficial effect on endothelial function.
