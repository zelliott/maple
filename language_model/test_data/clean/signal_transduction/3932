We used anti-phosphopeptide-immunodetecting antibodies as immunohistochemical reagents to define the location and activity state of p185(erbB2) during Wallerian degeneration. Nerve damage induces a phosphorylation event at Y1248, a site that couples p185(erbB2) to the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Phosphorylation of p185(erbB2) occurs within Schwann cells and coincides in time and space with Schwann cell mitotic activity, as measured by bromodeoxyuridine uptake. These visual images of receptor autophosphorylation link activation of p185(erbB2) to the Schwann cell proliferation that accompanies nerve regeneration.
