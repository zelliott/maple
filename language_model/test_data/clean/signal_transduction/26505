We have shown that adoptive transfer of CD4(+) T cells from placental ischemia (reduction in uteroplacental perfusion, RUPP) rats causes hypertension and elevated inflammatory cytokines during pregnancy. In this study we tested the hypothesis that adoptive transfer of RUPP CD4(+) T cells was associated with endothelin-1 activation as a mechanism to increase blood pressure during pregnancy. CD4(+) T cells from RUPP or normal pregnant (NP) rats were adoptively transferred into NP rats on gestational day 13. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was analyzed on gestational day 19, and tissues were collected for endothelin-1 analysis. MAP increased in placental ischemic RUPP rats versus NP rats (124.1 ± 3 vs. 96.2 ± 3 mmHg; P = 0.0001) and increased in NP recipients of RUPP CD4(+) T cells (117.8 ± 2 mmHg; P = 0.001 compared with NP). Adoptive transfer of RUPP CD4(+) T cells increased placental preproendothelin-1 mRNA 2.1-fold compared with NP CD4(+) T cell rats and 1.7-fold compared with NP. Endothelin-1 secretion from endothelial cells exposed to NP rat serum was 52.2 ± 1.9 pg·mg(-1)·ml(-1), 77.5 ± 4.3 pg·mg(-1)·ml(-1) with RUPP rat serum (P = 0.0003); 47.2 ± .16 pg·mg(-1)·ml(-1) with NP+NP CD4(+) T cell serum, and 62.2 ± 2.1 pg·mg(-1)·ml(-1) with NP+RUPP CD4(+) T cell serum (P = 0.002). To test the role of endothelin-1 in RUPP CD4(+) T cell-induced hypertension, pregnant rats were treated with an endothelin A (ET(A)) receptor antagonist (ABT-627, 5 mg/kg) via drinking water. MAP was 92 ± 2 mmHg in NP+ET(A) blockade and 108 ± 3 mmHg in RUPP+ET(A) blockade; 95 ± 5 mmHg in NP+NP CD4(+) T cells+ET(A) blockade and 102 ± 2 mmHg in NP+RUPP CD4(+) T cells+ET(A) blockade. These data indicate the importance of endothelin-1 activation to cause hypertension via chronic exposure to activated CD4(+) T cells in response to placental ischemia.
