From a growing body of evidence on the role of Reactive Oxygen Species as intracellular signaling molecules, the concept starts to emerge that cell responses to redox changes are function of the intracellular site where oxidants are produced and/or meet their molecular targets. In particular, a major distinction between oxidative events in the cytosolic versus the mitochondrial compartment appears to exist in terms of physiological stimuli, signaling mechanisms and functional consequences. Experimental data supporting this view are reviewed here, and the potential implications of this new perspective in redox signaling are discussed.
