Conceptus (embryo and associated extraembryonic membranes) implantation and development require a reciprocal biochemical and physical interactions between the extraembryonic membranes and the endometrium. However, the enzymatic antioxidative pathways controlling reactive oxygen species production at the endometrial-extraembryonic membrane interface early in pregnancy are not known. We aimed therefore to determine the content of malondialdehyde, as biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, and the activities of the major antioxidant enzymes, copper-zinc containing and manganese containing superoxide dismutases, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, in sheep extraembryonic membranes, caruncular and intercaruncular endometrium zones sampled at specific stages of pregnancy corresponding to the conceptus implantation (day 16) and the early post-implantation period (day 21). Malondialdehyde content in caruncular, intercaruncular and extraembryonic tissues was not different between stages of the pregnancy. Extraembryonic membranes demonstrated increased manganese containing superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, whereas catalase activity in these tissues decreased from day 16 to day 21. Caruncular tissues demonstrated increased manganese containing superoxide dismutase activity from day 16 to day 21. Intercaruncular tissues demonstrated increased copper-zinc containing superoxide dismutase, manganese containing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities from day 16 to day 21. The ovine extraembryonic membranes exhibit dynamic changes in enzymatic antioxidative pathways different from those of endometrial tissues during the transition from implantation to post-implantation period. This biochemical data provides novel insights into the developmental changes in antioxidative pathways of extraembryonic membranes and endometrium during early conceptus development.
