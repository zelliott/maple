Exposure of isolated rat glomeruli to carbachol (Carb) 1 mM induces glomerular (mesangial cell) contraction which is inhibited by pirenzepine. To identify the cellular signalling mechanism, we analyzed Carb-activated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in myo-[2-3H] inositol preloaded cells of isolated rat glomeruli. Carb evoked a rapid (5 s, 30.4 +/- 8.3% of basal) and sustained (60 s, 157.2 +/- 1.2% of basal) inositol trisphosphate (IP3) response. Acetylcholine 100 microM (Ach) in the presence of eserine also evoked IP3 formation. Mobilization of Ca2+ was monitored by preloading glomerular cells with 45Ca2+ (200 microCi/ml) and analyzing the cellular efflux using a constant perifusion system. Both Carb and Ach induced transient 45Ca2+ efflux, with peak values above baseline of 69.0 +/- 19.9 and 71.5 +/- 7.9%, respectively. Incubation with pirenzepine or prior release of Ca2+ from an IP3-sensitive intracellular pool by Thapsigargin (2 microM) prevented Carb-evoked Ca2+ release (100 and 60%, respectively). Therefore, glomerular cells possess functional cholinergic receptors which stimulate contraction via IP3-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release.
