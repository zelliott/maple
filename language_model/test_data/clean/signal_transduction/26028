Inflammatory disorders are characterized by the influx of immune cells into the vascular wall of veins and/or arteries in response to stimuli such as oxidized-LDL and various pathogens. These factors stimulate the local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages and other cells that promote various inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, Crohn's, Alzheimer's and diabetes. Numerous cytokines play a significant role in this process, though tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and various interleukins are thought to be among the most important regulators. These proinflammatory cytokines promote the above-described diseases by inducing endothelial cell dysfunction. In this brief commentary we will discuss some of the latest advances and discoveries in the treatment of these inflammatory diseases, making use of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR) agonists.
