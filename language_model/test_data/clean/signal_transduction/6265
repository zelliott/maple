A mini-Tn5Cm insertion has been identified that significantly reduced the amount of an extracellular activating signal for a lacZ fusion (cma37::lacZ) in Providencia stuartii. The transposon insertion was located immediately upstream of an open reading frame encoding a putative CysE ortholog. The CysE enzyme, serine acetyltransferase, catalyzes the conversion of serine to O-acetyl-L-serine (OAS). This activating signal was also produced by Escherichia coli, and production was abolished in a strain containing a null allele of cysE. Products of the CysE enzyme (OAS, N-acetyl-L-serine [NAS], O-acetyl-L-threonine, and N-acetyl-L-threonine) were individually tested for the ability to activate cma37::lacZ. Only OAS was capable of activating the cma37::lacZ fusion. The ability of OAS to activate the cma37::lacZ fusion was abolished by pretreatment at pH 8.5, which converts OAS to NAS. However, the activity of the native signal in conditioned medium was not decreased by treatment at pH 8.5. In contrast, conditioned medium prepared from cells grown at pH 8.5 exhibited a 4- to 10-fold-higher activity, relative to pH 6.0. Additional genes regulated by the CysE-dependent signal and OAS were identified in P. stuartii and E. coli. The response to the extracellular signal in E. coli was dependent on CysB, a positive activator that requires NAS as a coactivator. In E. coli, a cysE mutant formed biofilms at an accelerated rate compared to the wild type, suggesting a physiological role for this extracellular signal.
