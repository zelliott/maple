Although de la Cruz and colleagues showed as early as 1977 that the outflow tract was added after the heart tube formed, the source of these secondarily added cells was not identified for nearly 25 years. In 2001, three pivotal publications described a secondary or anterior heart field that contributed to the developing outflow tract. This review details the history of the heart field, the discovery and continuing elucidation of the secondarily adding myocardial cells, and how the different populations identified in 2001 are related to the more recent lineage tracing studies that defined the first and second myocardial heart fields/lineages. Much recent work has focused on secondary heart field progenitors that give rise to the myocardium and smooth muscle at the definitive arterial pole. These progenitors are the last to be added to the arterial pole and are particularly susceptible to abnormal development, leading to conotruncal malformations in children. The major signaling pathways (Wnt, BMP, FGF8, Notch, and Shh) that control various aspects of secondary heart field progenitor behavior are discussed.
