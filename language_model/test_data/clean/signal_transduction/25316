We have identified an interferon-like cytokine, limitin, on the basis of its ability to arrest the growth of or kill lympho-hematopoietic cells. Limitin strongly inhibited B lymphopoiesis in vitro and in vivo but had little influence on either myelopoiesis or erythropoiesis. Because limitin uses the interferon alpha/beta receptors and induces interferon regulatory factor-1, it may represent a previously unknown type I interferon prototype. However, preferential B-lineage growth inhibition and activation of Janus kinase 2 in a myelomonocytic leukemia line have not been described for previously known interferons.
