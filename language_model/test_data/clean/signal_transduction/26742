CD40 ligation has been shown to induce antitumor effects in mice and cancer patients. Most of the studies have focused on the ability of an agonistic anti-CD40 mAb to either directly kill CD40-positive tumor cells or activate T-cell immune responses. In this review the authors focus on the ability of CD40 ligation to activate antitumor effector mechanisms of the cells of innate immunity such as macrophages and NK cells.
