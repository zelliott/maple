pp125FAK is a tyrosine kinase that appears to regulate the assembly of focal adhesions and thereby promotes cell spreading on the extracellular matrix. In some cells, the C terminus of pp125FAK is expressed as a separate protein, pp41/43FRNK. We have previously shown that overexpression of pp41/43FRNK inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK and paxillin and, in addition, delays cell spreading and focal adhesion assembly. Thus, pp41/43FRNK functions as a negative inhibitor of adhesion signaling and provides a tool to dissect the mechanism by which pp125FAK promotes cell spreading. We report here that the inhibitory effects of pp41/43FRNK expression can be rescued by the co-overexpression of wild-type pp125FAK and partially rescued by catalytically inactive variants of pp125FAK. However, coexpression of an autophosphorylation site mutant of pp125FAK, which fails to bind the SH2 domain of pp60c-Src, or a mutant that fails to bind paxillin did not promote cell spreading. In contrast, expression of pp41/43FRNK and pp60c-Src reconstituted cell spreading and tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin but did so without inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK. These data provide additional support for a model whereby pp125FAK acts as a "switchable adaptor" that recruits pp60c-Src to phosphorylate paxillin, promoting cell spreading. In addition, these data point to tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin as being a critical step in focal adhesion assembly.
