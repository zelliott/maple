The emergence of research analyzing the TGF-beta signaling pathway and its role in stem cell plasticity and differentiation has been a source of new insights into multiple cancers. TGF-beta signaling mediator Smads are tightly dependent on modulation by adaptor proteins, such as ELF, SARA, filamin, and crkl as well as ubiquitinators, such as PRAJA and SMURFs. Despite widespread inactivation of the TGF-beta pathway in gastrointestinal tumors, only a fraction of sporadic tumors exhibit inactivating mutations in early tumor formation, which suggests a role for the modulation of TGF-beta signals by stem/progenitor cell proteins, such as ELF and PRAJA. Delineating these key interactions of the TGF-beta signaling pathway could yield powerful new therapeutics aimed at treating hitherto difficult to treat cancers.
