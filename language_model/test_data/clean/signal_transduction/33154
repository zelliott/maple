Six cytokines of the interleukin (IL)-6 family involved in various inflammatory or tumoral diseases share the same gp130 signal transducer chain. We made a panel of anti-gp130 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to study the structure and function of the gp130 molecule. These mAb recognized different epitopes of the gp130 that we called A to J. Most of the mAb were found to be inhibitors and we studied whether some of them could also induce gp130 activation. When used alone, none of them was able to initiate the proliferation of IL-6-dependent cell lines. However, some particular associations of the mAb were able to induce a proliferative response. mAb B1 could activate the lines in association with F1 or with I2 but not with I1, which in ELISA was similar to I2. In contrast mAb B2, which in ELISA appeared to be very similar to B1, was able to activate the cells in association with I1 but not with F1 or I2. Two other mAb belonging to specificities A and C were found to be activators either in association with I1 only, or with I1 or B2, respectively. These associations of mAb appeared to be nearly as potent activators as IL-6 itself. Although we still have no precise idea of the mechanisms involved, they are interesting tools to study the molecular interactions leading to gp130 activation and, from a practical point of view, valuable growth factors of hematopoietic stem cells.
