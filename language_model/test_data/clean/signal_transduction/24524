MAP kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) is a member of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) signaling cascade and is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes. We have recently demonstrated a functional role for MKK4 in the suppression of metastases. In this review, we discuss the established cellular and biochemical functions of MKK4, as well as a new function for MKK4 as a metastasis suppressor gene. Because of the importance of signaling studies to this translational work, a detailed example of the strategy and tools that can be employed to define the biochemical mechanism of MKK4-mediated metastasis suppression is presented. Finally, the potential therapeutic utility of these findings is discussed.
