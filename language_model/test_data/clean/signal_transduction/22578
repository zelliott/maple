The role of increased glucose transport in the hormonal regulation of glycogen synthase by insulin was investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin treatment stimulated glycogen synthase activity 4-5-fold in these cells. Cytosolic glycogen synthase levels decreased by 75% in response to insulin, whereas, conversely, the glycogenolytic agent isoproterenol increased cytosolic enzyme levels by 200%. Removal of extracellular glucose reduced glycogen synthase activation by 40% and completely blocked enzymatic translocation. Addition of 5 mM 2-deoxyglucose did not restore glycogen synthase translocation but did augment dephosphorylation of the protein by insulin. The translocation event could be reconstituted in vitro only by the addition of UDP-glucose to basal cell lysates. Amylase pretreatment of the extracts suppressed glycogen synthase translocation, indicating that the enzyme was binding to glycogen. Incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 10 mM glucosamine induced a state of insulin resistance, blocked the translocation of glycogen synthase, and inhibited insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis by 50%. Surprisingly, glycogen synthase activation by insulin was enhanced 4-fold, in part due to allosteric activation by a glucosamine metabolite. In vitro, glucosamine 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate stimulated glycogen synthase activity with similar concentration curves. These results indicate that glucose metabolites have an impact on the regulation of glycogen synthase activation and localization by insulin.
