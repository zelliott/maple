Adrenoceptors were among the first neurotransmitter receptors identified in glial cells, but it is not known whether these receptors meditate glial responses during neuronal activity. We show that repetitive nerve activity evoked a rise of intracellular calcium in Bergmann glia and neighboring Purkinje neurons of cerebellar slices of mice. The glial but not the neuronal calcium transient persisted during block of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. In contrast, the glial calcium response was abolished by cyclopiazonic acid and prazosin; however, prazosin affected neither the inward current nor the resulting depolarization that accompanied the stimulus-induced glial calcium transients. The glial depolarization was attenuated by 38% by the mixture of glutamate receptor blockers, which abolished the evoked neuronal depolarization and afterhyperpolarization. Ba(2+) reduced the glial currents by 66% without affecting the concomitant calcium transients. In the presence of Ba(2+), the mixture of glutamate receptor blockers exerted no effect on the glial inward current or calcium rise. Furthermore, Ba(2+) greatly potentiated both the activity-related Purkinje cell inward current and the accompanying neuronal calcium rises. The results indicate that release of noradrenaline from afferent fibers activates a glial alpha(1) adrenoceptor that promotes calcium release from intracellular stores. Glial calcium rises are known to stimulate a diversity of processes such as transmitter release, energy metabolism, or proliferation. Thus the adrenoceptor-mediated mechanism described here is well suited for feedback modulation of neuronal function that is independent of glutamate.
