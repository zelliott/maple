Mechanism(s) responsible for VPA-induced effects on reproductive axis activity are not fully recognized. Previously we reported that VPA suppressed only GnRH-stimulated but not the basal LH release from rat anterior pituitary (AP) cells in vitro. Since the inhibitory effect of VPA was exerted only in GnRH-activated cells, potential VPA impact on GnRH-R-coupled IP3/PKC signaling could not be excluded. In this study the effect of VPA on IPs synthesis in non-stimulated and GnRH-treated rat AP cells was examined.

In the first experiment 5 × 105 cells/ml were incubated for 3h with VPA (10 nM-10 μM), PMA (100 nM), GnRH (100 nM), PMA (100 nM) + VPA (10 nM-10 μM), GnRH (100 nM) + VPA (10 nM-10 μM). In the second experiment cells were preincubated for 24h with 1μCi myo-[23 H]-inositol, then for 30 min with 10 mM LiCl and finally for 3hr with GnRH (100 nM) VPA (1 μM, 10 μM), GnRH (100 nM) + VPA (1 μM, 10 μM). LH concentration was measured by RIA and intracellular IPs accumulation by ion-exchange chromatography analysis.

VPA diminished GnRH-stimulated LH release without affecting PMA-induced LH release at any dose tested. Moreover, VPA-induced increase of IPs accumulation occurred in both non-stimulated and GnRH-treated cells and intensity of cellular response was similar in both groups.

VPA affects IP3/PKC pathway activity through its up-regulatory effect on IPs synthesis in AP cells. VPA-induced inhibition of GnRH-stimulated LH release from gonadotrope cells appears to be the result of still unrecognized cellular mechanism.
