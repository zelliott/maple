The purpose of this computational study was to investigate the possible role of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations of astrocytes. By incorporating different types of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels and a previous model, this study reproduced typical Ca(2+) oscillations in silico. Our model could mimic the oscillatory phenomenon under a wide range of experimental conditions, including resting membrane potential (-75 to -60 mV), extracellular Ca(2+) concentration (0.1 to 1500 muM), temperature (20 to 37 degrees C), and blocking specific Ca(2+) channels. By varying the experimental conditions, the amplitude and duration of Ca(2+) oscillations changed slightly (both <25%), while the frequency changed significantly ( approximately 400%). This indicates that spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in astrocytes might be an all-or-none process, which might be frequency-encoded in signaling. Moreover, the properties of Ca(2+) oscillations were found to be related to the dynamics of Ca(2+) influx, and not only to a constant influx. Therefore, calcium channels dynamics should be used in studying Ca(2+) oscillations. This work provides a platform to explore the still unclear mechanism of spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in astrocytes.
