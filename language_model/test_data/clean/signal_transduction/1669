The Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signal transduction cascade is a vital mediator of a number of cellular fates including growth, proliferation and survival, among others. The focus of this review centers on the MAPK signal transduction pathway, its mechanisms of activation, downstream mediators of signaling, and the transcription factors that ultimately alter gene expression. Furthermore, negative regulators of this cascade, including phosphatases, are discussed with an emphasis placed upon chemotherapeutic intervention at various points along the pathway. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that the PI3K/Akt pathway may play a role in the effects elicited via MAPK signaling; as such, potential interactions and their possible cellular ramifications are discussed.
