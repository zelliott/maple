Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a member of the mixed lineage kinase subfamily. Mixed lineage kinases are upstream MAP3Ks that activate the JNK pathway. DLK is primarily responsible for activating JNK and mediating the apoptotic stress response in various cell types, specifically neurons. Inhibition and knockdown of DLK has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects in cellular and animal models of Alzheimer's disease, glaucoma, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Several series of ATP-binding site inhibitors have been identified through profiling efforts providing launch points for future medicinal chemistry programs.
