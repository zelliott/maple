Interleukin-3 (IL-3) acts as both a growth and survival factor for many hemopoietic cells. IL-3 treatment of responsive cells leads to the rapid and transient activation of Class IA phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3Ks) and the serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) and phosphorylation of BAD. Each of these molecules has been implicated in anti-apoptotic signaling in a wide range of cells. Using regulated expression of dominant-negative p85 (Deltap85) in stably transfected IL-3-dependent BaF/3 cells, we have specifically investigated the role of class IA PI3K in IL-3 signaling. The major functional consequence of Deltap85 expression in these cells is a highly reproducible, dramatic reduction in IL-3-induced proliferation. Expression of Deltap85 reduces IL-3-induced PKB phosphorylation and activation and phosphorylation of BAD dramatically, to levels seen in unstimulated cells. Despite these reductions, the levels of apoptosis observed in the same cells are very low and do not account for the reduction in IL-3-dependent proliferation we observe. These results show that Deltap85 inhibits both PKB activity and BAD phosphorylation without significantly affecting levels of apoptosis, suggesting that there are targets other than PKB and BAD that can transmit survival signals in these cells. Our data indicate that the prime target for PI3K action in IL-3 signaling is at the level of regulation of proliferation.
