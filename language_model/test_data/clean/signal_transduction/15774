Effector memory T cells (T(EM)) have an important role in immunity against infection. However, little is known about the factors regulating T(EM) maintenance and proliferation. In this study, we investigated the role of direct interactions between CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (TC) for human T(EM) expansion. Proliferation of separated or mixed CD4(+) and CD8(+)T(EM) populations was analyzed after polyclonal stimulation in vitro. Compared to each isolated subset mixed T(EM) populations showed increased proliferation and expansion of both CD4(+) and CD8(+)T(EM) subpopulations. Combined activation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) memory T cells (Tmem) induced an increased expression of CD40L and CD40 on both populations. Subsequently, CD40/CD40L caused a bi-directional stimulation of CD40(+)CD4(+)T(EM) by CD40L(+)CD8(+)T(EM) and of CD40(+)CD8(+)T(EM) by CD40L(+)CD4(+)T(EM). Blocking of CD40L on activated CD8(+)T(EM) selectively inhibited proliferation of CD4(+)T(EM), while blocking of CD40L on CD4(+)T(EM) abrogated proliferation of CD8(+)T(EM). Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that the expression of CD40L is exploited on the one hand by CD8(+)T(EM) to increase the proliferation of activated CD4(+)T(EM) and on the other hand by CD4(+)T(EM) to support the expansion of activated CD8(+)T(EM). Thus, efficient T(EM) expansion requires bi-directional interactions between CD4(+) and CD8(+)T(EM) cells.
