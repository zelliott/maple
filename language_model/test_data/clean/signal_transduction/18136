Midkine (MK) is a heparin-binding growth factor with migration-promoting and survival-promoting activities. To identify signaling receptor(s) of MK, membrane glycoproteins with MK-binding activity were isolated from day 13 mouse embryos by lectin- and MK-affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE followed by protein sequence analysis revealed the presence of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) and NCAM in the fraction. The dissociation constant of binding between LRP and MK was 3.5 nM. Receptor-associated protein (RAP), which interfered with the binding, inhibited MK-dependent survival of embryonic neurons. Brushin/megalin, which is also a high molecular weight protein belonging to the LDL receptor family, bound to MK less strongly than LRP. These findings suggest that LRP is a component of the receptor complex for MK.
