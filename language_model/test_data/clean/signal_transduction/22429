Our previous study found that blocking nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling could protect human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from apoptosis and proliferation inhibition due to high glucose (HG). Intermittent HG makes glucose toxicity more significant. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of NF-κB pathway on HUVECs induced by intermittent HG (a daily alternating 5.5 or 30.5 mmol/l glucose). A recombinant adenovirus containing a RNAi cassette targeting the NF-κB/p65 gene was produced, and its silencing effect on p65 gene was detected by Western blot analysis in HUVECs cultured with intermittent HG. The subsequent effect on proliferation of HUVECs in the indicated conditions was measured by the AlamarBlue assay. The Bcl-2 expression was also detected by Western blot. The results showed that the expression of p65 protein could be inhibited efficiently by the RNAi adenovirus. Intermittent HG also induced the translocation of NF-κB in HUVECs. Inhibition of NF-κB with the RNAi adenovirus could prevent the effects. At the 6th day after HUVECs were exposed to intermittent HG, the proliferation of HUVECs with Ad-1566 was significantly higher than that of HUVECs with Ad-DEST (P < 0.01). Knockdown of NF-κB/p65 up-regulated the Bcl-2 expression of HUVECs under intermittent HG conditions (P < 0.01). These findings concluded that the NF-κB/p65-targeting RNAi adenovirus is an important tool, which can efficiently inhibit the expression of p65 gene in HUVECs. Intermittent HG reduces HUVECs proliferation with a concomitant increase in apoptosis. Knockdown of NF-κB/p65 partly protected HUVECs from proliferation inhibition and may reduce apoptosis.
