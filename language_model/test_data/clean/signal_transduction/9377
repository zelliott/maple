AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) has long been proposed as an auxin receptor to regulate cell expansion. The embryo lethality of ABP1-null mutants demonstrates its fundamental role in plant development, but also hinders investigation of its involvement in post-embryonic processes and its mode of action. By taking advantage of weak alleles and inducible systems, several recent studies have revealed a role for ABP1 in organ development, cell polarization, and shape formation. In addition to its role in the regulation of auxin-induced gene expression, ABP1 has now been shown to modulate non-transcriptional auxin responses. ABP1 is required for activating two antagonizing ROP GTPase signaling pathways involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell shape formation, and participates in the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis to subsequently affect PIN protein distribution. These exciting discoveries provide indisputable evidence for the auxin-induced signaling pathways that are downstream of ABP1 function, and suggest intriguing mechanisms for ABP1-mediated polar cell expansion and spatial coordination in response to auxin.
