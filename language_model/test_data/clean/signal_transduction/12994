We have investigated the mechanisms by which prior exposure of mouse macrophages to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induces a state of low responsiveness to subsequent exposure to IFN-gamma. We demonstrate that induction of this state requires both de novo gene expression and the suppression of phosphorylation events that lead to activation of transcription factor Stat1 alpha. These observations are mechanistically consistent with the known induction of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and SOCS-3 proteins by LPS. In this regard, we demonstrate that overexpression of either SOCS protein suppresses induction of the mouse inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene promoter: apparently by suppressing interactions between Stat1 alpha and IFN-gamma activated sites present in both the iNOS, and interferon regulatory factor-1, gene promoters. The induction of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 by LPS or IFN-beta (an autocrine/paracrine mediator of LPS-induced SOCS-1 mRNA synthesis)occurs by way of multiple protein kinase pathways that include protein tyrosine kinases, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. These results provide insight that may allow discrimination between LPS-induced inhibition of macrophage functions that are detrimental to the host (e.g. continued exposure to LPS) versus those that might potentially be beneficial (e.g. exposure to subsequent agonists that induce more specific macrophage functions).
