Obesity is associated with adipose tissue remodeling, characterized by macrophage accumulation, adipocyte hypertrophy, and apoptosis. We previously reported that macrophage-conditioned medium (MacCM) protects preadipocytes from apoptosis, due to serum withdrawal, in a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent manner. We have now investigated the role of intracellular signaling pathways, activated in response to MacCM versus PDGF, in promoting preadipocyte survival. Exposure of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to J774A.1-MacCM or PDGF strongly stimulated Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation from initially undetectable levels. Inhibition of the upstream regulators of Akt or ERK1/2, i.e. phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K; using wortmannin or LY294002) or MEK1/2 (using UO126 or PD98509), abrogated the respective phosphorylation responses, and significantly impaired pro-survival activity. J774A.1-MacCM increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by 3.4-fold, and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) significantly inhibited pro-survival signaling and preadipocyte survival in response to J774A.1-MacCM. Serum withdrawal itself also increased ROS levels (2.1-fold), and the associated cell death was attenuated by DPI or NAC. In summary, J774A.1-MacCM-dependent 3T3-L1 preadipocyte survival requires the Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Furthermore, ROS generation by J774A.1-MacCM is required for Akt and ERK1/2 signaling to promote 3T3-L1 preadipocyte survival. These data suggest potential mechanisms by which macrophages may alter preadipocyte fate.
