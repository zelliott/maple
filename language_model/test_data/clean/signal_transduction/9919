Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have been shown to control formation and differentiation of multiple organ systems in the developing vertebrate embryo. The analysis of differential gene expression during embryogenesis is, therefore, a potent tool to identify novel target genes regulated by FGF signalling. Here, we have applied microarray analysis to identify differentially regulated genes in FGF mutant mouse embryos. Surprisingly, transcripts corresponding to vomeronasal receptors (VRs), which so far have been only detected in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), were found to be downregulated in FGF mutant embryos. VR expression was detected in the developing olfactory pit and the anlage of the VNO. Interestingly, several FGFs can be detected in the developing olfactory pit during mouse embryogenesis [Bachler, M., Neubuser, A. 2001. Expression of members of the Fgf family and their receptors during midfacial development. Mech. Dev. 100, 313-316]. FGF signalling may thus control expression of VRs in the olfactory pit and formation of the VNO. Moreover, VR expression was detected in unexpected locations within the developing embryo including retina, dorsal root ganglia and neural tube. The relevance of VR expression in these structures and for formation of the VNO is discussed.
