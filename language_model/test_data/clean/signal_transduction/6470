Oncogene activity ranges from transduction signals to transcription factors. Altered expression of oncogenes, either by chromosomal translocation, proviral insertion or point mutations, can lead to tumor formation. More specifically, data accumulated through the last two decades have shown that disregulation of oncogenic transcription factors can interfere with regulatory cascades that control the growth, differentiation, and survival of normal cells. There is also evidence that alterations of oncogene activity are associated with pre-mRNA splicing defects. The insights gained from the pivotal role of RNA polymerase II in coupling transcription and splicing have instigated a new line of research regarding the possible role of oncogenic transcription factors in pre-mRNA splicing regulation. This review focuses on recent advances addressing this question. Understanding the impact of alterations in the expression and/or function of oncogenes have important prognostic implications that can guide the design of new therapeutic drugs to promote differentiation and/or apoptosis over cell proliferation.
