Although the plant growth hormone auxin has long been recognized as a regulator of plant defense, the molecular mechanisms involved are still largely unknown. Recent studies reviewed here reveal new insights into the role of auxin in plant defense. Similar to the signaling pathways of the defense-associated plant hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), auxin signaling differentially affects resistance to separate pathogen groups. Recent evidence suggests that the auxin and SA pathways act in a mutually antagonistic manner during plant defense, whereas auxin and JA signaling share many commonalities. Auxin also affects disease outcomes indirectly through effects on development. Here, we discuss the multiple ways in which auxin regulation of plant growth and development might be intimately linked to plant defense.
