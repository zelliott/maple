In this study we investigated antinociceptive effects of oxymatrine through regulation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptor-ERK/CREB signaling in a chronic neuropathic pain model induced by chronic constrictive injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve.

The von Frey and plantar tests were performed to assess the degree of mechanical and thermal changes respectively. Immunohistochemistry assay was used to evaluate the expressions of NR2B. Western blotting assay were used to evaluate the expressions of NR2B, tERK, p-ERK, tCREB and p-CREB.

The intraperitoneal administration of OMT (160, 80 mg/kg) could prevent the development of mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia induced by CCI. Intraperitoneal administration of OMT decreased the mean IOD of NR2B in the dorsal horn and expression of NR2B, p-ERK and p-CREB protein.

Regulation of NMDA NR2B receptor-ERK/CREB signaling maybe the targets for the antinociceptive effects of OMT on a chronic neuropathic pain model induced by chronic constrictive injury of the sciatic nerve.
