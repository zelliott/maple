Expression of the RIalpha subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I is increased in human cancers in which an autocrine pathway for epidermal growth factor-related growth factors is activated. We have investigated the effect of sequence-specific inhibition of RIalpha gene expression on ovarian cancer cell growth. We report that RIalpha antisense treatment results in a reduction in RIalpha expression and protein kinase A type I, and inhibition of cell growth. The growth inhibition was accompanied by changes in cell morphology and appearance of apoptotic nuclei. In addition, EGF receptor, c-erbB-2 and c-erbB-3 levels were reduced, and the basal and EGF-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activities were reduced. Protein kinase A type I and EGF receptor levels were also reduced in cells overexpressing EGF receptor antisense cDNA. These results suggest that the antisense depletion of RIalpha leads to blockade of both the serine-threonine kinase and the tyrosine kinase signaling pathways resulting in arrest of ovarian cancer cell growth.
