Statins are inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) and they are the most effective agents for lowering cholesterol in clinical practice for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, it has become clear that statins also have pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in addition to their lipid-lowering properties. As a result, much attention has been focused on their potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammatory autoimmune diseases. In this review the effect of statins on the expression and function of a variety of immune-relevant molecules will be discussed alongside the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the immunomodulatory effects of statins.
