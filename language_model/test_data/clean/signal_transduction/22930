Intracellular signals are received and generated by the alpha(IIb)beta(3) integrin on platelets. Recent advances have been made in the areas of agonist receptors that initiate platelet activation, downstream signaling molecules (e.g. small G-proteins and kinases) and changes in ligand-occupied alpha(IIb)beta(3) that cause further signaling and clot retraction.
