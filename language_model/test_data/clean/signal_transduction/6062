Fluid shear stress (FSS) induces many forms of responses, including phosphorylation of ERK in endothelial cells (ECs). We have earlier reported that FSS and hyper-osmotic shock rapidly induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 (CD31). The phosphorylated PECAM-1 acts as a plasma membrane anchoring site for SHP2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in the signal transmission from receptor tyrosine kinases to ERK. Osmotic shock also induces transient ERK activation in ECs. The osmotic-shock-induced ERK activation but not p38 MAP kinase activation was dependent on the PECAM-1 engagement and was blocked by its downregulation. When magnetic beads coated with antibodies against the extracellular domain of PECAM-1 were attached to ECs and tugged by magnetic force, PECAM-1 associated with the beads was tyrosine phosphorylated. ERK was also phosphorylated in these cells. Binding of the beads by itself or pulling on the cell surface using poly-L-lysine coated beads did not induce phosphorylation of PECAM-1 and ERK. These results suggest that PECAM-1 is a mechanotransduction molecule.
