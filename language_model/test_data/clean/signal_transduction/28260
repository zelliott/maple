The influence of hormones on plant growth and development has been clearly documented over the past 50 years. Now, with molecular genetics, the genes that convert changes in hormone levels into a cellular response are beginning to be identified. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the developmental context in which the hormones act plays a large influence on their synthesis and action. In this review, examples are given where known hormone response genes have been shown to have broader developmental roles as well as examples where genes that regulate developmental decisions, such as differentiation and fate, also influence hormone metabolism. The early conclusion of these studies is that an understanding of hormone signal transduction cannot be achieved in the absence of a developmental framework.
