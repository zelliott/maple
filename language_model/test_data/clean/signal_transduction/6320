Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the neurotrophic factors acting in the central nervous system (CNS), prevents ordinary types of neuronal cell death induced by various stimulants. On the other hand, an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to ER stress and then induces ER stress-mediated cell death. The ER stress-mediated cell death is distinctive because the caspase-12 activity plays a crucial role in the progression of cell death. We previously showed that nerve growth factor (NGF) attenuated ER stress-mediated cell death in non-neuronal PC12 cells. Here, we report that BDNF suppressed the ER stress-mediated cell death in tunicamycin (Tm)-treated cerebral cortical neurons. An analysis using a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), LY294002, revealed that BDNF prevented this cell death via the PI3-K signaling pathway. We found that the number of NeuN/TUNEL-double positive cells and the activity of caspase-3 suppressed by BDNF were increased by LY294002. We also discovered that LY294002 diminished the effect of BDNF on the activation of caspase-12, indicating that BDNF prevents ER stress-mediated cell death via a PI3-K-dependent mechanism by suppressing the activation of caspase-12 in cultured CNS neurons.
