The CCAAT motif-binding factor, nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) consists of three different subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC. Knockdown of Drosophila NF-YA (dNF-YA) in the notum compartment of wing discs by a pannir-GAL4 and UAS-dNF-YAIR mainly resulted in a thorax disclosed phenotype. Reduction of the Drosophila c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) basket (bsk) gene dose enhanced the knockdown of dNF-YA-induced phenotype. Monitoring of JNK activity in the wing disc by LacZ expression in a puckered (puc)-LacZ enhancer trap line revealed reduction in the level of the JNK reporter, puc-LacZ signals, in dNF-YA RNAi clones. In addition, expression of wild-type Bsk effectively suppressed the phenotype induced by knockdown of dNF-YA. The bsk gene promoter contains a CCAAT motif and this motif plays a positive role in the promoter activity. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in S2 cells with anti-dNF-YA IgG and quantitative real-time PCR. The bsk gene promoter region containing the CCAAT boxes was effectively amplified in the immunoprecipitates by PCR. However, this region was not amplified in the immunoprecipitates from dNF-YA knockdown cells. Furthermore, the level of endogenous bsk mRNA is reduced in the dNF-YA knockdown larvae. These results suggest that dNF-Y is necessary for proper bsk expression and activity of JNK pathway during thorax development.
