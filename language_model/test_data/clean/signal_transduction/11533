Adrenomedullin (AM), a potent vasodilatory and hypotensive peptide produces several biological outcomes in glomerular mesangial cells. Mesangial cells are important in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis, and therefore the actions of AM on mesangial cells have important clinical and therapeutic implications. This minireview describes the various actions of AM on mesangial cell function and the signal transduction mechanisms involved. As in other systems, most actions of AM can be explained by increase in cAMP levels in the cell, although a few exceptions remain. The fact that most data obtained to date has been in culture, the physiological significance of the actions of AM in mesangial cells is discussed.
