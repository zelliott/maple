We previously reported that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) sensitized mechanical stress-induced intracellular free Ca2+ concentration response (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 208, 19-25, 1995). In the present study, the signal transduction pathway of the sensitizing effect of LPA was investigated in cultured longitudinal muscle cells from guinea pig ileum. Suramin, a putative LPA receptor antagonist, did not affect the response in the presence of 30 nM LPA, suggesting that the response is induced via activation of suramin-insensitive LPA receptor. Neither pertussis toxin nor wortmannin inhibited the LPA-sensitized response, indicating that G(i/o)- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)-mediated pathways are not involved in the sensitizing effect. C3 ADP ribosyltransferase had no effect on the response, whereas formation of actin-stress fiber in the presence of LPA was completely inhibited, suggesting rho-related cytoskeletal change is not involved in the response. In contrast, a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, U73122, completely inhibited the response, but broad spectrum kinase inhibitors, staurosporine and H7, had no effect on the response. In addition, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, but not tyrphostin partially inhibited the response. These results suggest that LPA sensitizes the mechanical stress-induced response via activation of PLC, but not protein kinase C. Additionally, tyrphostin-insensitive tyrosine kinase, which is related to other pathway than G(i/o)- and rho-mediated pathways, may be involved in the response.
