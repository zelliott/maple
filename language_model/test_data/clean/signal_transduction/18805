Phosphoinositide signaling molecules control cellular growth, proliferation and differentiation, intracellular vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeletal rearrangement. The inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase family remove the D-5 position phosphate from PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,5)P2 forming PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(3)P respectively. This enzyme family, comprising ten mammalian members, exhibit seemingly non-redundant functions including the regulation of synaptic vesicle recycling, hematopoietic cell function and insulin signaling. Here we highlight recently established insights into the functions of two well characterized 5-phosphatases OCRL and SHIP2, which have been the subject of extensive functional studies, and the characterization of recently identified members, SKIP and PIPP, in order to highlight the diverse and complex functions of this enzyme family.
