The Rendu-Osler disease, also called Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) affects 1 in -5-8000 people. A french epidemiological study pointed out that it was particularly high in the Haut-Jura mountains in France. This pathology is characterized by frequent nosebleeds, mucocutaneous and visceral telangiectasia and hereditary autosomal-dominant trait. The mucocutaneous telangiectasia are hemorrhagic while the visceral telangiectasia, less frequent, lead to arteriovenous fistula in the lungs, the liver and the brain. HHT disease-causing genes (ENG, ACVRL1 and MADH4) encode proteins that modulate TGFÎ² superfamilly signaling in vascular endothelial cells. The recent discovery that BMP9 acts as the specific ligand of the receptor ALK1 and endoglin as its co-receptor shows that this signaling pathway is involved in the maturation phase of angiogenesis. Mice heterozygous for endoglin or ALK1 defects reproduce the HHT phenotype and further support the involvement of endothelial hyper proliferation in the pathogenesis of the disease. The medical management of patients remains mainly symptomatic, however the angiogenic trait of this disease should allow us to consider in the future new -therapeutic approaches using anti-angiogenic drugs.
