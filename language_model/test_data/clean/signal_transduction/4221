T lymphocytes require two signals for activation. Recognition of antigen/MHC complexes by the T cell receptor delivers the first signal, while a second signal, delivered by the cell surface receptors CD80 and/or CD86 binding to the T cell surface molecule CD28, has been shown to be effective for the initiation of effective T cell responses. While some of the cytoplasmic effector molecules involved in T cell receptor signaling is known, little is known regarding those involved in the co-stimulation of T cells by CD28. Using the T cell leukemic cell line Jurkat as a model for T cell activation, we demonstrate that cross-linking CD28 using monoclonal antibodies causes tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase/ERK. This activation was rapid, peaking at approximately 5 minutes post CD28 cross-linking, and transient. Activation of MAP kinase/ERK occurred 3 fold less efficiently in a Jurkat line lacking functional p56lck (JCAM.1), and was almost undetectable in a line lacking CD45 (J45.01). These results suggest that CD28 cross-linking can activate intracellular signaling pathways via several different tyrosine kinases. Thus CD28 signaling can activate src family kinases lck and fyn, as well as the Tec family kinase emt/itk. Activation of any one or a combination of these tyrosine kinases may be sufficient for the activation of MAPK following CD28 cross-linking. Activation of MAPK has been shown to cause activation of AP-1 and other transcription factors via serine and/or threonine phosphorylation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
