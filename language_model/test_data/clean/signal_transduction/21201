Towards the elucidation of the cellular function(s) of GP alpha1, we have characterized its subcellular localization using immunofluorescence and cell fractionation. GP alpha1 is not present in nuclei or chloroplasts. It is a membrane-bound protein, and analysis of isolated endoplasmic and plasma membranes indicates a good correlation between GP alpha1 in both the plasma membrane and the ER compartment. Interestingly, these results may suggest more different functions for GP alpha1: it might be involved in transmission of extracellular signals across the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm, and/or it may also be involved in regulating some aspects of the ER functions or membrane trafficking between both membranes.
