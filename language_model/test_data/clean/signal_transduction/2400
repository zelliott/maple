Previous blood flow studies demonstrated that arginine vasopressin (AVP) produces exaggerated renal vasoconstriction in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared with Wistar-Kyoto control rats (WKY). The purpose of the present study was to determine the role of postreceptor calcium signaling pathways in AVP-induced renal vasoconstriction in vivo. Renal blood flow (RBF) was measured by electromagnetic flowmetry in anesthetized, water-loaded, 8-week-old WKY and SHR pretreated with indomethacin to avoid interactions with prostaglandins. AVP was injected into the renal artery to produce a transient 25% to 30% decrease in RBF without affecting arterial pressure. To achieve similar control levels of vasoconstriction, SHR received a lower dose (2 versus 5 ng). Coadministration of nifedipine with AVP produced dose-dependent inhibition of the AVP-induced renal vasoconstriction. Nifedipine exerted maximum inhibition by blocking 30% to 35% of the peak AVP response, indicating the involvement of dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent calcium channels. To evaluate intracellular calcium mobilization, 8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8) or heparin was coadministered with AVP. Each agent produced a dose-dependent inhibition of up to 65% of the maximum blood flow change produced by AVP. The degrees of inhibition produced by maximum effective doses of nifedipine and TMB-8 were additive; the combination blocked up to 85% of the response to AVP. These observations indicate that about one third of the AVP-induced constriction of renal resistance vessels is mediated by voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels responsive to the dihydropyridine nifedipine. Approximately two thirds of the change in vascular tone is due to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated calcium mobilization from intracellular sources sensitive to TMB-8 and heparin. The results suggest that the exaggerated renal vascular reactivity to AVP challenge in SHR is probably not due to a strain difference in postreceptor calcium signal transduction. After AVP receptor stimulation, calcium mobilization and calcium entry signaling pathways participate to similar degrees in WKY and SHR.
