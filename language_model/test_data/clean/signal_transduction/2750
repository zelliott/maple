The magnetic component of certain time-varying inductive electromagnetic fields may be a large contributor to the accelerated osteogenic rate in nonunion fracture repair. Evidence is also accumulating to demonstrate that certain static magnetic fields may stimulate osteogenesis in in vitro and in vivo research, as well as orthopedic clinical application. We, therefore, hypothesize that static magnetic fields in orthodontics generate simultaneous force fields and bioeffects that may account for the observed benefits.
