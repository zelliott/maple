Despite the dismal outcome seen in the majority of epithelial ovarian cancer patients, there is ongoing progress in understanding the disease at a molecular level. Elucidation of pathways underlying disease progression and metastasis of ovarian cancer is key to development of targeted therapeutics. It is only in this way that therapeutic potential can be translated to reality. Here, we describe the evidence to date for the role of CSF-1/c-fms signaling in ovarian cancer invasiveness and metastasis, including the recent understanding of how CSF-1/c-fms expression is regulated with identification of significant post-transcriptional regulators.
