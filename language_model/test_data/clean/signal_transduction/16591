Diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) is an emerging field involving the synthesis of combinatorial libraries of diverse small molecules for biological screening. Rather than being directed toward a single biological target, DOS libraries can be used to identify new ligands for a variety of targets. Several different strategies for library design have been developed to target the biologically relevant regions of chemical structure space. DOS has provided powerful probes to investigate biological mechanisms and also served as a new driving force for advancing synthetic organic chemistry.
