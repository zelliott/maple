The anterior pituitary contains insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) and expresses abundant IGF-II-binding sites, but the IGF-II signaling pathway in the pituitary has not been defined. We, therefore, tested the effects of recombinant human IGF-II on pituitary function by assessing the GH responsiveness of the primary rat somatotroph to IGF-II. IGF-II (3.3 nM) suppressed GH secretion by 50%, similar to the effect elicited by equimolar doses of IGF-I. In contrast, a low concentration of IGF-II (0.2 nM) did not attenuate GH secretion, while a similar IGF-I dose was sufficient to produce 50% inhibition of basal GH secretion. Fifty percent competition for [125I]IGF-I binding by IGF-I and IGF-II in GC rat pituitary cells demonstrated a 14-fold lesser affinity of the IGF-II ligand for the IGF-I receptor compared to IGF-I; therefore, the binding affinity of IGF-II for the IGF-I receptor correlates with the concentration of IGF-II required for 50% GH inhibition. Transfected GH-secreting cell lines derived from GC cells overexpressing intact human IGF-I receptors exhibited enhanced responsiveness to IGF-II. In contrast, cells transfected with a truncated IGF-I receptor cDNA lacking the cytoplasmic receptor beta-subunit (952STOP) failed to transduce the IGF-II signal, indicating that functional IGF-I receptors are required for IGF-II signaling. In addition, a mutant IGF ligand, [Leu27]IGF-II, which selectively exhibits high affinity for the type II receptor, but only minimal binding to the IGF-I receptor, did not attenuate GH secretion. However, the analog [Arg54,Arg55]IGF-II, which exhibits high affinity to the IGF-I receptor, but no binding to the type II receptor, appropriately suppressed GH secretion. This unique model of somatotroph signaling provides evidence for IGF-II regulation of polypeptide hormone secretion mediated by the IGF-I receptor.
