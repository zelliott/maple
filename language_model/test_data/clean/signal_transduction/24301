We investigated the mode of signalling between mitochondria during apoptosis by monitoring the behaviour of non-irradiated mitochondria following microscopic photosensitisation of half the mitochondria in single human osteosarcoma cells loaded with CMXRos. Following partial irradiation of cells, non-irradiated mitochondria underwent a rapid depolarisation (within 10 minutes). The depolarisation was not inhibited by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk but was suppressed by the intracellular Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA and overexpression of Bcl-2. Significantly, such depolarisation occurred even after prior conversion of extended filamentous mitochondria into individual punctate structures, indicating that lumenal continuity is not required for communication between the irradiated and non-irradiated mitochondria. Partial irradiation of cells expressing cytochrome c-GFP revealed cytochrome c-GFP release from non-irradiated mitochondria at a delayed but unpredictable time interval (between 30 minutes and more than 2.5 hours) following irradiation, which was unaffected by zVAD-fmk. Once activated, cytochrome c-GFP release occurred within a 10 minute period. Immunocytochemistry failed to reveal the recruitment of Bax to non-irradiated mitochondria, which suggests that Bax does not mediate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. We conclude that signals (mediated by Ca(2+)) emanating from irradiated mitochondria are processed by their non-irradiated counterparts and comprise two temporally distinct phases, both independent of caspase-mediated amplification, which generate an initial rapid depolarisation and subsequent delayed release of cytochrome c.
