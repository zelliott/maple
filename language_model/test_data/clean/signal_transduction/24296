We report a transgenic mouse line in which Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway can be activated in an inducible manner in defined cell types. In this transgenic mouse line, Cre expression allows the expression of a tamoxifen-activatable form of Akt/PKB in a defined cell type. Subsequent injection of tamoxifen triggers the transient activation of Akt/PKB in mice. Thus, this transgenic line allows the transient activation of Akt/PKB pathway in a predefined cell type. We expect that this transgenic system will provide a unique tool to study the roles of Akt/PKB pathway in mice.
