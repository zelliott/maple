Knowledge of tumour mutation status has become increasingly important for the prioritization of targeted therapies for cancer. We review here the major known 'driver' mutations with therapeutic relevance in non-small cell lung cancer. We also discuss a variety of methods now being employed in molecular diagnostic laboratories to detect genetic alterations in lung tumours. A genetically-informed approach to lung cancer medicine is rapidly becoming the standard of care worldwide and should lead to improved outcomes for patients.
