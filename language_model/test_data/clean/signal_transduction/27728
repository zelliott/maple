In a series of publications, the author used the correlation hypothesis to explain the main mechanisms of functioning of bat and dolphin echo locators. A good fit of calculated parameters to experimental data was shown. In this work, by the example of generalization of the recognition problem, the use by the brain of correlation methods for solving more general problems independently on the modality of sensor signals was analyzed. In favor of the hypothesis that correlation methods are widely used in brain functioning are the data presented in the paper, which prove that an associative neuron is a suitable analog computer. It is suited for rapid "computation" of the intercorrelation function of discrete input and reference signals. The set of weighting coefficients of neuron synaptic inputs serve as such signals. The pool of associative neurons determines the values on the correlation function in the required range by changing the "numbers" of inputs from neuron to neuron at which discrete signals arrive.
