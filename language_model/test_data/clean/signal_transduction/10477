AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is a highly conserved heterotrimeric kinase that functions as a metabolic regulator of cellular enzymes involved in carbohydrate and fat metabolism, which regulate ATP conservation and synthesis. Here, we investigated whether AMPK signaling has a role in the regulation of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced proliferation in rat cardiac fibroblasts. Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-ribofuranoside (AICAR) activated AMPK in rat cardiac fibroblasts and increased Ang II-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and activity. AICAR also increased Ang II-induced c-fos mRNA expression in the cells. [3H]-thymidine and [3H]-proline incorporation by cardiac fibroblasts treated with Ang II was enhanced when the cells were pretreated with AICAR. Inhibition of AMPK by small interfering RNA for AMPKalpha1 suppressed Ang II-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity, c-fos mRNA expression, and cell proliferation. Treatment of rats with AICAR (1 mg/g body weight per day) for 1 week significantly enhanced Ang II-induced hypertrophy of the myocardium. Our findings indicate that AMPK works as a stimulator of the Ang II-induced proliferative pathway in cardiac fibroblasts. Inhibition of AMPK signaling might serve as a new therapeutic target of remodeling of the hypertrophic myocardium.
