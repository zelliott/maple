The calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium chloride inhibited the activity of soluble and particulate Ins(1,4,5)P3-5-phosphatase from GH3 cells, with an IC50 value of approximately 100 microM following a 10-min preincubation with the enzyme. The inhibition was time-dependent and could not be reversed by washing of the particulate fraction. It is concluded that although the inhibitory effect of calmidazolium chloride cannot be related per se to inhibition of calmodulin function, effects of this compound unrelated to actions upon calmodulin function may be found when concentrations that are only moderately supramaximal are used.
