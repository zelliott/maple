Most cellular functions, including signaling by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are mediated by protein-protein interactions, making the identification and localization of protein complexes key to the understanding of cellular processes. In complement to traditional biochemical techniques, noninvasive resonance energy transfer (RET) and protein-fragment complementation assays (PCAs) now allow protein interactions to be detected in the context of living cells. In this review, fluorescent and bioluminescent PCAs are discussed and their application illustrated with studies on GPCR signaling. Newly developed techniques combining PCA and RET assays for the detection of ternary and quaternary protein complexes are also presented.
