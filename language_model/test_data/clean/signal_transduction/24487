The biology of renal development has become increasingly complex because technical advances in genetics and cell biology have been used to study this aspect of embryogenesis. The molecular biology and genetics of renal development may seem inconsequential and frustrating to the practicing clinician, but insight into fundamental mechanisms of renal development are necessary to understand clinical breakthroughs that will occur in the future. As a basis for appreciating these concepts, specific paradigms of renal development are illustrated and the investigative strategies used to develop them are summarized in this article.
