Previous studies have suggested that maintenance of IgE-mediated signaling results from regulation of the activity of signaling complexes by actin polymerization. This process is also hypothesized to be related to desensitization of basophils and mast cells. Recent studies demonstrated that any signaling process dependent on syk or PI-3K activity cannot be a mechanism of desensitization, and in this context, syk and PI-3K inhibitors were found to inhibit actin polymerization. Inhibitors of actin polymerization were tested for their effect on desensitization of human peripheral blood basophils. Latrunculin A, in particular, removed all resting and stimulated f-actin but did not inhibit desensitization. Cytochalasin D and latrunculin A also did not reverse the loss of syk phosphorylation that accompanies desensitization. These results demonstrate that desensitization mechanisms are not dependent on actin polymerization. In this context, it was also shown that progressive immobilization of Fc epsilon RI during aggregation was sensitive to syk or actin polymerization inhibition. Therefore, desensitization is also not dependent on receptor immobilization. These studies demonstrate that desensitization is not the result of two signaling pathways once considered relevant to down-regulation of IgE-mediated signaling.
