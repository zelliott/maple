Ras regulates a variety of different signal transduction pathways acting as molecular switch. It was shown by liquid and solid-state (31)P NMR spectroscopy that Ras exists in the guanosine-5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate bound form in at least two conformational states interconverting in millisecond time scale. The relative population between the two conformational states affects drastically the affinity of Ras to its effectors. (31)P NMR spectroscopy shows that the conformational equilibrium can be shifted specifically by point mutations, including mutations with oncogenic potential, thus modifying the effector interactions and their coupling to dynamic properties of the protein.
