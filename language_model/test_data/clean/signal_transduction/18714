The proopiomelanocortin (POMC) system is the central coordinator of the systemic endocrine responses to sustained stress. It has been recently discovered that mast cells also display regulated production of POMC peptides. Since at the tissue level mast cells integrate stress responses into the neuroimmune regulatory network, it is likely that the POMC system is involved in mast cells' functions in tissue homeostasis.
