Proteolytic enzymes belonging to the A Disintegin And Metalloproteinase (ADAM) family are able to cleave transmembrane proteins close to the cell surface, in a process referred to as ectodomain shedding. Substrates for ADAMs include growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules, and, as such, many ADAM proteins play crucial roles in cell-cell adhesion, extracellular and intracellular signaling, cell differentiation and cell proliferation. In this Review, we summarize the fascinating roles of ADAMs in embryonic and adult tissue development in both vertebrates and invertebrates.
