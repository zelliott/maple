Asthma bronchiale represents a major health issue in industrialized countries and will likely remain so for decades. The drug treatment of asthma demonstrates certain peculiarities: revolutionary new drug introductions happen almost each quarter century. With improved understanding of asthma pathogenesis and drug metabolism, the potential for specific targeted and constructed therapies has become evident. Monoclonal antibodies to IgE and certain cytokines such IL-4 and IL-5 are being investigated as possible treatments for asthma. Similarly, preliminary studies of selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors in asthmatic patients have been encouraging. Other potential therapies include for example inhibitors of cytokine synthesis, promoters of Th2-Th1 switch, adenosine receptor agonists or antagonists, etc.. A new way is represented by a modified retrometabolic drug design resulting in so-called soft drugs. The first representative of this new drug class is loteprednol etabote (LE), a non-fluorinated glucocorticoid approved for the allergic ophthalmological indications and now in clinical trial for the treatment of allergic airway diseases. Today's intensive search for new treatments should ensure a greater diversity of therapeutic possibilities for the management of asthma in the new millennium.
