Cortical dysplasia, a malformation of the cerebral cortex of developmental origin, accounts for most cases of drug-resistant childhood epilepsy. Despite its prevalence, the genetic and molecular bases for the disease are not known for most cases. With the exception of tuberous sclerosis complex, a type of cortical malformation with known genetic etiology, no mutated genes have been identified that can lead to the neuroanatomic abnormalities observed in the patients. Furthermore, there are currently no animal models that completely recapitulate the features of the disease, hindering progress in developing new treatments for this devastating condition. In this article, I review some of the approaches that researchers in the field are undertaking to utilize the biopsy tissue obtained from patients with cortical dysplasia who are undergoing epilepsy surgery. These multifaceted approaches are providing a plethora of new information that is then utilized to generate and evaluate animal models and to further our understanding of the disease. These studies will enable the development of novel antiepileptic treatments for patients with cortical dysplasia and similar disorders.
