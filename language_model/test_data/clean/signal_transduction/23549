Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a natural product of Brassica vegetables such as broccoli and cabbage, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in various cancer cells. I3C has recently received attention as a possible anti-obesity agent. However, how I3C interacts with specific targets in the pathways involved in obesity and metabolic disorders is unknown. Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), a NADÃ¾-dependent deacetylase sirtuin, has recently emerged as a novel therapeutic target for metabolic diseases. Herein, we report that I3C is a potent, specific SIRT1 activator efficacious in cultured 3T3-L1 cell lines. A pull-down assay showed that I3C binds to SIRT1. To assess the significance of this binding, we determined whether I3C could activate SIRT1 deacetylase activity in a cell-free system. We found that I3C binds to SIRT1 and activates SIRT1 deacetylase activity in 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, I3C did not inhibit adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells in which SIRT1 was knockdowned. Further, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that I3C treatment reduced mRNA levels of adipogenic genes that encode for C/EBPa, PPARg2, FAS, and aP2 in 3T3-L1 cells but not in SIRT1 knockdown cells. Overall, these results suggested that I3C ameliorates adipogenesis by activating SIRT1 in 3T3-L1 cells.
