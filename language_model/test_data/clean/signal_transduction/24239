The Ark/Prk serine/threonine kinases initiate phosphorylation cycles that control the endocytic machinery in mammalian cells and in yeast, and the actin cytoskeleton in yeast. The members of this protein family are unified by homologies in their kinase domain, but are generally diverse in their other domains. The evolution of Ark/Prk family members in different organisms may have allowed the conserved role of the kinase domain, which is required for the phosphorylation of both endocytic and cytoskeletal components, to be coupled to other functional domains.
