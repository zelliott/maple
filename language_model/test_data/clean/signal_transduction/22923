Histamine is present in the epidermis in intracellular and extracellular area and is released from mast cells and keratinocytes in the early stage of inflammation of the skin. Such release may contribute to common itching or intensify the inflammatory responses. Histamine binds to its receptors and participate in regulation of the inflammatory responses by acting on endothelial cells, nerve endings, lymphocytes, monocytes, and leukocytes. Histamine has direct effects on keratinocytes as well. Histamine modulates the proliferation of keratinocytes. The binding of histamine to the receptor on keratinocyte membrane induces activation of adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C through GTP binding protein. We previously reported that histamine induces transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ in cultured normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and normal epidermis. H1 and H2 histamine receptors are widely distributed in many tissues and cells. In this study, we investigated which types of histamine receptors are related to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ by histamine stimulation in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes. NHEK were cultured in serum-free KGM medium. With H1 antihistamines, mepyramine and diphenhydramine, histamine responses were moderately but not statistically significantly inhibited. With H2 antihistamine, cimetidine, histamine response was significantly inhibited. Epinephrine response was not affected by these antihistamines. Thus, it is considered that H2 antihistamines specifically block histamine-mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ of cultured normal human keratinocytes.
