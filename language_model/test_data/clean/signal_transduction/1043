Although NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) was found to be a transcriptional regulator that controls an expression of the beta-globin gene, the notion is now widely accepted that this transfactor serves as a master regulator for the gene expression of a battery of proteins acting on anti-oxidative stress and detoxification of electrophiles. The function of Nrf2 that bears transcriptional activation depends solely on its nuclear localization, which is regulated by interaction with the cytosolic anchor protein Keap1 and its own turnover rate. In the present mini-review, we focus on the regulation of Nrf2 function and discuss the physiological and toxicological aspects of this transcriptional factor.
