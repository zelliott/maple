When alpha factor binds to the yeast alpha factor receptor a signal is transmitted via a tripartite G protein that prepares the cell for conjugation. As a result of alpha factor binding the receptor also undergoes a regulated internalization and hyperphosphorylation. Using cells that lack activity of this tripartite G protein, we show that G protein-mediated pheromone signal transduction is not necessary for regulation of receptor internalization or hyperphosphorylation. Therefore, the processes of signal transduction and down regulation can be uncoupled. We propose that binding of alpha factor to its receptor results in a receptor conformation change that permits receptor hyperphosphorylation and interaction with the endocytic machinery.
