Although budding yeast cell biology and genetics provided a powerful system to isolate S-phase checkpoint mutants, initial studies relied on a defect not likely to be relevant in higher eukaryotes. The first mutants were isolated for their inability to restrain mitotic spindle elongation in S-phase. Since most eukaryotes do not assemble spindles until prometaphase the validity of this approach might have been questioned. However, these early studies were designed with a highly valid assumption in mind; that checkpoints have a variety of targets, but comprise conserved kinase cascades that make up these signaling pathways. The task that lies ahead is to determine targets of the S-phase checkpoint relevant to mammals. One step forward might be the realization that the budding yeast S-phase checkpoint prevents loss of sister chromatid cohesion while DNA replication is ongoing. If this mechanism is conserved in mammals, it could prove vital for chromosome segregation fidelity.
