Stroke represents a major health problem in the ever-ageing population of industrialized nations. Each year, over three million people in the USA alone suffer from this affliction. Stroke, which results from the obstruction of an intra- or extra-cerebral artery, induces irreversible neuronal damage. The clot-busting drug tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDA-approved therapy for acute stroke. Although tPA has been successfully used to treat myocardial infarction due to clot formation, its use in the treatment of occlusive cerebrovascular diseases remains controversial. Indeed, tPA is clearly beneficial as a thrombolytic agent. However, increasing evidence suggests that tPA could have direct and deleterious effects on neurons and glial cells.
