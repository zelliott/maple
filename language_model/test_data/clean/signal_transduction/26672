MicroRNA (miRNA)-126 is angiogenic and has two validated targets: Sprouty-related protein 1 (Spred-1) and phosphoinositol-3 kinase regulatory subunit 2 (PI3KR2), negative regulators of angiogenesis by VEGF pathway inhibition. We investigated the role of swimming training on cardiac miRNA-126 expression related to angiogenesis.

Female Wistar rats were assigned to three groups: sedentary (S), training 1 (T1, moderate volume), and training 2 (T2, high volume). T1 consisted of 60 minÂ·d of swimming, five times per week for 10 wk with 5% body overload. T2 consisted of the same protocol of T1 until the eighth week; in the ninth week, rats trained for two times a day, and in the 10th week, rats trained for three times a day. MiRNA and PI3KR2 gene expression analysis was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in heart muscle. We assessed markers of training, the cardiac capillary-fiber ratio, cardiac protein expression of VEGF, Spred-1, Raf-1/ERK 1/2, and PI3K/Akt/eNOS.

The cardiac capillary-fiber ratio increased in T1 (58%) and T2 (101%) compared with S. VEGF protein expression was increased 42% in T1 and 108% in T2. Cardiac miRNA-126 expression increased 26% (T1) and 42% (T2) compared with S, correlated with angiogenesis. The miRNA-126 target Spred-1 protein level decreased 41% (T1) and 39% (T2), which consequently favored an increase in angiogenic signaling pathway Raf-1/ERK 1/2. On the other hand, the gene expression of PI3KR2, the other miRNA-126 target, was reduced 39% (T1) and 78% (T2), and there was an increase in protein expression of components of the PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway in the trained groups.

This study showed that aerobic training promotes an increase in the expression of miRNA-126 and that this may be related to exercise-induced cardiac angiogenesis, by indirect regulation of the VEGF pathway and direct regulation of its targets that converged in an increase in angiogenic pathways, such as MAPK and PI3K/Akt/eNOS.
