To study the interaction between MAVS and p21 regulates MAVS-mediated pathway.

Firstly, we cloned full-length p21 gene by PCR. And then the interaction between MAVS and p21 was further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. The regulation of MAVS-mediated pathway by p21 was analyzed by luciferase reporter assays.

There are interaction between p21 and MAVS in 293T cells. p21 downregulates activity of MAVS.

It is shown that p21 inhibits MAVS-mediated activation of NF-κB and IFN-β by Luciferase reporter assays. Overall, these results laid the foundation for further investigating the function of p21 in MAVS-mediated pathway.
