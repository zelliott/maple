Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is an important tumour suppressor in the human colon, and is conserved in various organisms. Its best understood function is the destabilization of beta-catenin, a key effector of the Wnt signalling pathway. APC proteins are highly motile, and shuttle between several subcellular destinations. These destinations have prompted the discovery of new functions for the APC proteins, and this multitasking of APC might explain why its loss often leads to cancer.
