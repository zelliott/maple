[1-14C]-2-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) uptake and signal transduction pattern after epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation were examined in freshly isolated hepatocytes from 20-day-old fetuses and 3-month-old rats. EGF induced a transient increase of AIB transport after 10 min only in adult animals; the observed unresponsiveness of fetal liver is not dependent on a lack of EGF receptors which are present though to a lesser extent on the plasma membrane in this period. As far as the production of the second messengers, inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and calcium, is concerned, substantial differences were found: EGF increased IP3 production in adult hepatocytes, whereas it had no effect in fetal ones. Moreover, the addition of EGF induced a calcium transient in hepatocytes from adult animals, while there was no increase in fetal cells. The lack of EGF effect on amino acid transport in fetal cells could be due to its inability to produce both IP3 and calcium transients, suggesting that this transduction pathway is not activated during fetal life.
