Emerging data on the consequences of the interactions between invasive oral bacteria and host cells have provided new insights into the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. Indeed, modulation of the mucosal epithelial barrier by pathogenic bacteria appears to be a critical step in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease. Periodontopathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis have developed different strategies to perturb the structural and functional integrity of the gingival epithelium. P. gingivalis adheres to, invades, and replicates within human epithelial cells. Adhesion of P. gingivalis to host cells is multimodal and involves the interaction of bacterial cell-surface adhesins with receptors expressed on the surfaces of epithelial cells. Internalization of P. gingivalis within host cells is rapid and requires both bacterial contact-dependent components and host-induced signaling pathways. P. gingivalis also subverts host responses to bacterial challenges by inactivating immune cells and molecules and by activating host processes leading to tissue destruction. The adaptive ability of these pathogens that allows them to survive within host cells and degrade periodontal tissue constituents may contribute to the initiation and progression of periodontitis. In this paper, we review current knowledge on the molecular cross-talk between P. gingivalis and gingival epithelial cells in the development of periodontitis.
