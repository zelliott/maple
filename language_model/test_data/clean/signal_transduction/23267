This study is designed to screen the CD40 related signal transduction pathway in AGS cells and construction of gene silencing vector. Analysis results showed 414 differential genes expression, including upregulation of 209 genes and downregulation of 205 genes. Basing on the ratio of signal in experimental group to signal in control group, 45 genes (38 genes upregulation and seven genes downregulation) with significant (P<0.01) change in expression levels were screened according to the screening standard (signal log ratio≥1 or ≤-1). These genes involved into metabolism, cell cycle and apoptosis, signal transduction and stress response. Furthermore, PI3K mRNA expression level in PI3K siRNA transfected AGS cells was 0.2335±0.0116 72 h after transfection. This value was significantly (P<0.05) lower than that in blank and negative control groups. PI3K protein expression in PI3K siRNA transfected AGS cells was significantly (P<0.05) lower than that in blank and PI3K siRNA/N transfected groups. Therefore, PI3K siRNA gene silencing vector can significantly inhibit PI3K mRNA and protein expression in AGS cells.
