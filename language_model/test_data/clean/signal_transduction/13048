Neutral matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in bone matrix degradation accompanied by bone remodeling. We herein show for the first time that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) up-regulates MMP-13 (collagenase-3) mRNA of rat calvaria-derived osteoblasts. The mRNA up-regulation was seen at 3 h in response to MIF (10 microg/ml), reached the maximum level at 6-12 h, and returned to the basal level at 36 h. MMP-13 mRNA up-regulation was preceded by up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos mRNA. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and MMP-9 (92-kDa type IV collagenase) were also up-regulated, but to a lesser extent. The MMP-13 mRNA up-regulation was significantly suppressed by genistein, herbimycin A and 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine. Similarly, a selective mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK)1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) and c-jun/activator protein (AP)-1 inhibitor (curcumin) suppressed MMP-13 mRNA up-regulation induced by MIF. The mRNA levels of c-jun and c-fos in response to MIF were also inhibited by PD98059. Consistent with these results, MIF stimulated phosphorylation of tyrosine, autophosphorylation of Src, activation of Ras, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2, a MAPK, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase or p38, and phosphorylation of c-Jun. Osteoblasts obtained from calvariae of newborn JunAA mice, defective in phosphorylation of c-Jun, or newborn c-Fos knockout (Fos -/- ) mice, showed much less induction of MMP-13 with the addition of MIF than osteoblasts obtained from wild-type or littermate control mice. Taken together, these results suggest that MIF increases the MMP-13 mRNA level of rat osteoblasts via the Src-related tyrosine kinase-, Ras-, ERK1/2-, and AP-1-dependent pathway.
