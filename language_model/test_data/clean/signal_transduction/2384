Homeostasis of human B cell development is maintained by a complex network of cytoplasmic and surface expressed molecules. Abnormalities in this process may result in the expansion of malignant B cell precursors in B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). ALL cells share surface antigens with normal early precursor B cells. We have studied here the role of Fas/APO-1 (CD95) antigen on leukaemic precursor B cell line growth and survival, and the modulation of its effects by signals involved in normal early B cell development. Four ALL cell lines representative of the early steps of B cell differentiation are shown to express surface Fas/APO-1 (CD95) antigen and to undergo apoptosis in the presence of anti-Fas cross-linking antibodies. This effect is strongly enhanced when pre-B, but not pro-B cells, are pretreated with IL-7 but not with IL-2, IL-3, IL-4 or IL-10. Furthermore, pre-B cell death induced by anti-Fas antibodies in combination with IL-7 is increased upon pre-B receptor but not CD19 cross-linking. Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression is not influenced by IL-7 or pre-BR stimulation in either pro-B or pre-B cell lines. These results indicate that signals involved in normal early B cell development can modulate the Fas (CD95)-mediated apoptosis of leukaemic precursor B cells.
