IL-12, produced by APCs during the initial stages of an immune response, plays a pivotal role in the induction of IFN-gamma by NK and gammadeltaT cells and in driving the differentiation of Th1 cells, thus providing a critical link between innate and acquired immunity. Due to the unique position occupied by IL-12 in the regulation of immunity, many mechanisms have evolved to modulate IL-12 production. We have shown previously that macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), the ligand for the stem cell-derived tyrosine kinase/recepteur d'origine nantais (RON) receptor, inhibits NO production by macrophages in response to IFN-gamma and enhances the expression of arginase. Mice lacking RON exhibit increased inflammation in a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and increased susceptibility to endotoxic shock. In this study we demonstrate that pretreatment of macrophages with MSP before IFN-gamma and LPS results in the complete inhibition of IL-12 production due to suppression of p40 expression. This response is mediated by the RON receptor, and splenocytes from RON(-/-) animals produce increased levels of IFN-gamma. MSP pretreatment of macrophages resulted in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat-1 and decreased expression of IFN consensus sequence binding protein in response to inflammatory cytokines. In addition to IL-12, the expression of IL-15 and IL-18, cytokines that are also dependent on IFN consensus sequence binding protein activation, is inhibited by pretreatment with MSP before IFN-gamma and LPS. We also show that the ability of MSP to inhibit IL-12 production is independent of IL-10. Taken together, these results suggest that MSP may actively suppress cell-mediated immune responses through its ability to down-regulate IL-12 production and thus inhibit classical activation of macrophages.
