The aim was to investigate the possible interactions of the two peripheral hormones, leptin and ghrelin, that regulate the energy balance in opposite directions.

Leptin-receptor mutated Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) and lean control rats were treated with the ghrelin-receptor ligand, tabimorelin (50 mg/kg p.o.) for 18 days, and the effects on body weight, food intake and body composition were investigated. The level of expression of anabolic and catabolic neuropeptides and their receptors in the hypothalamic area were analysed by in situ hybridization.

Tabimorelin treatment induced hyperphagia and adiposity (increased total fat mass and gain in body weight) in lean control rats, while these parameters were not increased in ZDF rats. Treatment with tabimorelin of lean control rats increased hypothalamic mRNA expression of the anabolic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA and decreased hypothalamic expression of the catabolic peptide pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA. In ZDF rats, the expression of POMC mRNA was not affected by treatment with tabimorelin, whereas NPY mRNA expression was increased in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus.

This shows that tabimorelin-induced adiposity and hyperphagia in lean control rats are correlated with increased hypothalamic NPY mRNA and decreased POMC mRNA expression. The elimination of tabimorelin-induced adiposity and hyperphagia in ZDF rats may be due to lack of POMC mRNA downregulation. In conclusion, we suggest that ghrelin-receptor ligands exert their adipogenic and orexigenic effects via hypothalamic mechanisms that are dependent on intact leptin-receptor signalling.
