Naringin has been reported to act as an effective anti-inflammatory compound.             In a previous study, we demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effect of naringin             on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury in mice correlated with             the inhibition of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. However, the effects             and mechanism of action of naringin on LPS-induced chemokine expression are not             yet fully understood. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of naringin on chemokine             expression in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages and to provide insights into the             possible underlying mechanisms. We found that the in vitro pre-treatment with             naringin led to a significant attenuation in the LPS-induced secretion of interleukin-8             (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory             protein-1α (MIP-1α). RT-qPCR demonstrated that naringin significantly reduced             the LPS-induced upregulation of IL-8, MCP-1 and MIP-1α mRNA expression in a dose-dependent             manner. Additionally, western blot analysis revealed that naringin effectively             suppressed NF-κB activation by inhibiting the degradation of IκB-α and the translocation             of p65. Naringin also attenuated MAPK activation by inhibiting the phosphorylation             of ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK. Taken together, these demonstrate that naringin reduces             IL-8, MCP-1 and MIP-1α secretion and mRNA expression, possibly by blocking the             activation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages.
