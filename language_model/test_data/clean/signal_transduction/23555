Stem cell therapy has been proposed as a potential treatment strategy for ischemic cardiomyopathy in recent years. A variety of stem cells or stem cell-derived cells can potentially be used for transplantation. Despite improved cardiac function after treatment, one of the major problems is the poor integration between host and donor cells which can lead to post-transplantation arrhythmia and poor long-term outcome.

In the present study, we cocultured murine embryonic stem cells (mES) with murine embryonic ventricular myocytes (mEVs) in hanging drops to assess the cellular interaction and function of mES-derived cardiomyocytes under these conditions.

We found that when mEVs are added to a culture system of embryonic stem cells, the number of spontaneously beating areas in embryoid bodies (EBs) increases, intercellular gap junction communication is enhanced by upregulation of Cx43 expression at the mid-developmental stage and Cx43 is distributed more orderly between cardiomyocytes.

Our findings suggest mES-derived cardiomyocytes are able to form effective signaling pathways through coculture with mEVs which is important for providing more functional grafts for cardiac cell therapy by improving the integration between transplanted and host cells.
