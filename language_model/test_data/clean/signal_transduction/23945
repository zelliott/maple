Experiments on isolated frog olfactory epithelium, using vital luminescent microscopy showed that the olfactory transduction of amyl alcohol is mediated by the intracellular cAMP signaling system. Increases in intracellular cAMP levels resulted from activation of adenylate cyclase type III via odorant-induced stimulation of G protein linked to it.
