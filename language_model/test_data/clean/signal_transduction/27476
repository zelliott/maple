Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects human primary B lymphocytes and induces and maintains proliferation of these cells efficiently in vitro. Mutants of Epstein-Barr virus which express EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) in a conditional fashion allow dissection of individual contributions of viral genes to B cell immortalization. EBNA2 is a transcriptional activator of cellular and viral genes, including the viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), which is essential for B cell immortalization and has oncogenic effects in non-lymphoid cells. To analyze the role of this gene in B cell immortalization, LMP1 was constitutively expressed in B cells infected with EBV carrying a conditional EBNA2 allele. In the absence of functional EBNA2, LMP1 was incapable of sustaining B cell proliferation in two independent assays but induced a phenotype consistent with prolonged cell viability. Activation of CD40 displayed a comparable phenotype. These data indicate that both CD40 activation and LMP1 expression may use a common pathway for B cell activation. Proliferation of human B cells, however, requires one or more additional signals triggered by EBNA2.
