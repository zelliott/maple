4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE) has been demonstrated to exert its antiproliferative effect by up-regulating the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (MAPKs). Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is the major negative regulatory factor in controlling cell proliferation, and Smads are its intracellular transducers. Recent data on human colon adenocarcinoma has shown a low HNE content paralleled by a marked alteration of TGF-beta1 levels within the tumor mass. The two events appear related because of the demonstrated marked ability of HNE to up-regulate expression and synthesis of TGF-beta1; the combined decreases of HNE and TGF-beta1 found in cancer cells provide a favorable condition for neoplastic progression. Furthermore, HNE is likely able to interact with the cytokine to enhance apoptosis and increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in the CaCo-2 colon carcinoma cell line. The probable mechanism whereby HNE and TGF-beta1 interact to induce apoptosis is through cross-talk between the main signaling pathways of the two molecules (JNK and Smads), and the observed ROS production might only contribute to amplifying the apoptotic pathways. The network between the two signaling pathways here involved is now under investigation.
