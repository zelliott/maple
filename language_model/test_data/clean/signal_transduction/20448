The main pathological consequence of free radical exposure is DNA damage, which is known to induce cell transformation and to facilitate important mutations in cancer progression. It is a matter of intense discussion whether the drug-induced production of free radicals limits the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapeutics and enhances their toxicity or whether they may be enhanced to provoke cancer cell apoptosis. This paper reviews essential molecular processes to better understand the controversial role of free radicals in cancer development and progression, and discusses some novel therapeutic strategies based on oxidative stress induction and prevention.
