Medicago truncatula is a model species for the study of the unique secondary metabolism in legumes. LC/MS/MS analysis was used to identify and profile flavonoid glycoconjugates and free aglycones in leaves of M. truncatula (ecotype R108-1) infected with the fungal pathogen Phoma medicaginis. Use of a high resolution analyzer with a collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometer (CID MS/MS) permitted structural elucidation of target secondary metabolites and four new acylated flavone glycosides have been identified. Changes in the phytoalexin medicarpin and its isoflavone precursors were quantitatively monitored at various time points after fungal spore application. Application of spores induced disease symptoms in the leaves of infected plants and resulted in an increase in the medicarpin precursors formononetin 7-O-glucoside and malonylated formononetin 7-O-glucoside between one and three days post-infection. Relative concentrations of medicarpin were highest five days post-infection. The rapid increase of these molecules was clearly positively correlated to the infection process as certain of them were absent in uninfected leaves, suggesting that the relative rate of their synthesis is tightly related with the infection process.
