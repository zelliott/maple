The treatment of neoplastic diseases has become increasingly dependent on tumor biology and is focused on targeted therapy. Understanding complex networks of intracellular signaling pathways, blockades of specific targets and a myriad of other approaches has brought new fuel to the battle against many types of cancer. Unfortunately, the degree of benefit achieved in this new era of cancer treatment has not been distributed homogeneously among the different disease types. Neoplasms with lower incidence rates, but that are also highly challenging, are not consistently given due attention by research leaders. This article aims to evaluate new insights and potential gains obtained with new therapies in a particular group of tumors: those rarely debated in clinical practice, but which still pose a considerable challenge to clinical oncology.
