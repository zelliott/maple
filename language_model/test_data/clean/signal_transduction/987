1. Phenylarsine oxide (PAO) is commonly used to inhibit tyrosine phosphatase activity. However, PAO can affect a variety of different processes because of its ability to promote sulfhydryl oxidation. In the present study, we investigated the effects that PAO has on basal and beta-adrenergically stimulated L-type Ca(2+) channel activity in isolated cardiac myocytes. 2. Extracellular application of PAO transiently stimulated the basal L-type Ca(2+) channel activity, whereas it irreversibly inhibited protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent regulation of channel activity by isoproterenol, forskolin and 8-CPT-cAMP (8-p-chlorophenylthioadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate). PAO also inhibited channel activity irreversibly stimulated in the presence of adenosine 5'-(3-thiotriphosphate) tetralithium salt. 3. Neither the stimulatory nor the inhibitory effects of PAO were affected by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is not involved. 4. Extracellular application of the sulfhydryl-reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) antagonized both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of PAO. Yet, following intracellular dialysis with DTT, only the inhibitory effect of PAO was antagonized. 5. The inhibitory effect of PAO was mimicked by intracellular, but not extracellular application of the membrane impermeant thiol oxidant 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). 6. These results suggest that the stimulatory effect of PAO results from oxidation of sulfhydryl residues at an extracellular site and the inhibitory effect is due to redox regulation of an intracellular site that affects the response of the channel to PKA-dependent phosphorylation. It is concluded that the redox state of the cell may play a critical role in modulating beta-adrenergic responsiveness of the L-type Ca(2+) channel in cardiac myocytes.
