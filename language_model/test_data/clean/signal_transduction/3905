The recent emergence of an autofluorescent protein, the green fluorescent protein (GFP), has opened the door for the convenient use of intact living cells and organisms as experimental systems in fields ranging from cell biology to biomedicine. We present an overview of some of the major applications of GFP, namely its use in protein tagging and in monitoring gene expression as well as its potential in a variety of biological screens.
