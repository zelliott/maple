Endostatin was suggested to be an antiangiogenic agent with the potential for clinical use in cancer therapy. Unfortunately, up to now no antiangiogenic effect was seen in clinical trials using this substance. The lack of response might be caused by an incomplete understanding of endostatin signaling. Endostatin is known to influence the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. It has been reported to bind to the VEGF receptor KDR directly and to decrease the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) at Ser1177 via the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). But so far no details of endostatin signaling with regard to NO downstream effectors have been revealed. In the present work the authors demonstrate that endostatin down-regulates the protein level of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in endothelial cells of newly formed blood vessels in 5 day-old wounds (control: 62.5 +/- 33 vessels/mm2, endostatin: 9.2 +/- 3.2 vessels/mm2). This was confirmed in experiments with endothelial tubes of embryoid bodies and endothelial cells derived from embryonic stem cells (eESCs; control: 126 +/- 20, endostatin: 58 +/- 10). The decrease of sGC protein levels in response to endostatin was abolished after preincubation with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid. No alterations of sGC mRNA levels could be found under endostatin treatment in eESC. The authors conclude that endostatin affects VEGF signaling in endothelial cells by a post-transcriptional PP2A-dependent down-regulation of sGC protein levels.
