Apart from optimization of the radiation technology, future new strategies in radiation oncology will focus on the biological optimisation leading to improved adaptation of the tumor therapy on each tumor entity. In this regard, different areas of biological research may be distinguished: prediction, development of new cytotoxic agents, improvement of the tolerance of normal tissue and the optimisation of radiochemotherapy.

For the development of new strategies the knowledge of molecular mechanisms of radiation induced cell death is essential. In the present article a novel biological strategy for optimisation of radiotherapy is introduced.

Distinct pathways mediate apoptosis in response to death receptor stimulation and ionizing radiation although an overlapping set of molecules is involved. TRAIL (TNF alpha-related apoptosis inducing ligand) is a type-II membrane protein belonging to the TNF family, which preferentially induces apoptotic cell death in a wide variety of tumor cells but not in normal cells. Based on the assumption of distinct signalling pathways, combination of TRAIL and ionizing radiation seems ideal to increase the therapeutic efficacy. Our study presents the rationale, own data, data of other groups as well as the current status of the latest findings regarding the function and physiological role of the TRAIL death ligand.

Apoptosis resistance towards ionising radiation is not associated with a general apoptosis resistance. Death ligands, for example TRAIL trigger apoptosis even in cells not undergoing apoptosis in response to radiation. A combination of both modalities induces additive or synergistic effects in regard to apoptosis induction and eradication of clonogenic tumor cells. Thus, the combination of TRAIL with radiation proofs that novel treatment strategies may be developed on the basis of molecular or cell biological research.
