B cell development is a complex process involving interactions between B cell precursors, stroma, and known and unknown ligands and cytokines. In order to more fully understand the requirements for Ig in that development we have created transgenic mice that carry a gamma 2b transgene and express it early in B cell development. Previously it was believed that these B cells arrested in their development prior to the pro- to pre-B cell transition. We show here that in conventional gamma 2b mice, B cell development actually arrests later, at the pre-B cell stage. This shows for the first time that a constant region different from mu can allow signaling through the pre-B cell receptor, but cannot promote complete development. The pro- and pre-B cells in the conventional gamma 2b transgenics are not fully functional since they cannot grow in IL-7 without stromal cells. This is a novel phenotype, separating development from stroma independence. The few, mature B cells that do develop in these mice express both mu and gamma 2b simultaneously, and are CD5+. Expression of a Bcl-2 transgene allows survival of gamma 2b transgenic immature B cells, but does not promote full maturation, indicating that normally mu provides both an anti-apoptotic signal and a differentiation signal. One line of gamma 2b mice, the C line, does not have this phenotype. B cell development is accelerated in this unconventional line, and the developing B cells have a very different phenotype from both normal mice and conventional gamma 2b mouse lines, but are very similar to mu transgenics. Mature B cells are largely CD5-, gamma 2b-only expressing. This unique phenotype is apparently due to the activation in B cell precursors of a gene at the insertion site of the transgene, circumventing the need for mu. Comparison of conventional gamma 2b transgenics with the C line and mu transgenics reveals the multiple signals required throughout B cell development.
