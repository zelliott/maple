Rodent incisors maintain the ability to grow continuously and their labial dentin is covered with enamel. Bcl11b zinc-finger transcription factor is expressed in ameloblast progenitors in mouse incisors and its absence in Bcl11b(KO/KO) mice results in a defect in embryonic tooth development. However, the role of Bcl11b in incisor maintenance in adult tissue was not studied because of death at birth in Bcl11b(KO/KO) mice. Here, we examined compound heterozygous Bcl11b(S826G/KO) mice, one allele of which has an amino acid substitution of serine at position 826 for glycine, that exhibited hypoplastic maxillary incisors with lower concentrations of minerals at the enamel and the dentin, accompanying the maxillary bone hypoplasia. Histological examinations revealed hypoplasia of the labial cervical loop in incisors, shortening of the ameloblast progenitor region, and impairment in differentiation and proliferation of ameloblast-lineage cells. Interestingly, however, juvenile mice at 5days after birth did not show marked change in these phenotypes. These results suggest that attenuated Bcl11b activity impairs ameloblast progenitors and incisor maintenance. The number of BrdU label-retaining cells, putative stem cells, was lower in Bcl11b(S826G/KO) incisors, which suggests the incisor hypoplasia may be in part a result of the decreased number of stem cells. Interestingly, the level of Shh and FGF3 expressions, which are assumed to play key roles in the development and maintenance of ameloblasts and odontoblasts, was not decreased, though the expressed areas were more restricted in ameloblast progenitor and mesenchyme regions of Bcl11b(S826G/KO) incisors, respectively. Those data suggest that the incisor maintenance by Bcl11b is not directly related to the FGF epithelial-mesenchymal signaling loop including Shh but is intrinsic to ameloblast progenitors and possibly stem cells.
