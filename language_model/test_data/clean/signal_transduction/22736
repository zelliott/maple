Elastase anti-elastase imbalance theory is most important in the pathogenesis of COPD (pulmonary emphysema). Proteolytic activity of neutrophil elastase (NE) plays an important role because of the detachment of cells through proteolysis of extracellular matrix. In addition to proteolytic activity of NE, NE-induced activation of intracellular signaling (MAPK(Erk), Rho and MLCK) participates in NE-induced morphological changes in airway epithelial cells.
