Wound healing proceeds by the concerted action of a variety of signals that have been well identified. However, the mechanisms integrating them and coordinating their effects are poorly known. Herein, we reveal how PPARbeta/delta (PPAR: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) follows a balanced pattern of expression controlled by a crosstalk between inflammatory cytokines and TGF-beta1. Whereas conditions that mimic the initial inflammatory events stimulate PPARbeta/delta expression, TGF-beta1/Smad3 suppresses this inflammation-induced PPARbeta/delta transcription, as seen in the late re-epithelialization/remodeling events. This TGF-beta1/Smad3 action involves an inhibitory effect on AP-1 activity and DNA binding that results in an inhibition of the AP-1-driven induction of the PPARbeta/delta promoter. As expected from these observations, wound biopsies from Smad3-null mice showed sustained PPARbeta expression as compared to those of their wild-type littermates. Together, these findings suggest a mechanism for setting the necessary balance between inflammatory signals, which trigger PPARbeta/delta expression, and TGF-beta1/Smad3 that governs the timely decrease of this expression as wound healing proceeds to completion.
