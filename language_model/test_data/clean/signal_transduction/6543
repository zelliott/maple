To what extent are the pathways that regulate self-renewal conserved between stem cells at different stages of development and in different tissues? Some pathways play a strikingly conserved role in regulating the self-renewal of diverse stem cells, whereas other pathways are specific to stem cells in certain tissues or at certain stages of development. Recent studies have highlighted differences between the self-renewal of embryonic, fetal and adult stem cells. By understanding these similarities and differences we may come to a molecular understanding of how stem cells replicate themselves and why aspects of this process differ between stem cells.
