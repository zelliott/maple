To investigate the possible role of sex hormones in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the effect of β-estradiol (E2) on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, a key signaling pathway involved in PAH, was studied in human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAEC).

BMP signaling molecules, including BMP receptor, Smad1/5/8 and Id1, were studied in HPAEC under 1% O2 (hypoxia) and 21% O2 (normoxia) as well as the effect of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α expression in the presence of E2 on BMP signaling. The effects of an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist (ICI 182,780) and cycloheximide, and the interaction of ER with Smad or HIF-1α were also studied. In the presence of E2, BMP signaling was augmented under normoxia but suppressed under hypoxia. HIF-1α accumulation suppressed BMP signaling, whereas HIF-1α inhibition augmented signaling. These effects were cancelled by ICI 182,780. Moreover, binding between ER, HIF-1α and phosphorylated (p)-Smad1/5/8 proteins occurred only under hypoxia. On inhibition of de novo synthesis with cycloheximide, however, p-Smad1/5/8 expression was suppressed only under normoxia.

The effects of E2 on BMP signaling in HPAEC altered depending on O2 concentration and different mechanisms may be involved. BMP and sex hormones may play an important role in PAH development.
