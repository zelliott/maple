Endogenous opioids and opiate drugs inhibit nervous system maturation, in part, by affecting the growth of astrocytes. Opiates inhibit astrocyte proliferation and cause premature differentiation. The emerging importance of Ca2+ in astrocyte function prompted us to explore whether opiates might affect astrocyte development by altering Ca2+ homeostasis. Astrocyte-enriched cultures were derived from newborn ICR mouse cerebra. Quantitative fluorescent measurements of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) using Fura-2 as well as fluo-3 and computer-aided image analysis showed that 1 microM morphine significantly increased [Ca2+]i in flat, polyhedral, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactive astrocytes at 2 and 6 min, and at 72 h. Co-administration of 3 microM naloxone blocked morphine-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i. Treatment with 1 microM concentrations of the kappa-opioid receptor agonist, U69,593, but not equimolar amounts of mu ([D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly(ol)5]enkephalin)- or delta ([D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin)-opioid receptor agonists, significantly increased [Ca2+]i in astrocytes. To assess the role of Ca2+ in morphine-induced astrocyte differentiation, untreated and 1 microM morphine-treated astrocyte cultures were incubated for 5 days in < 0.01, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mM extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o), or incubated with 1.0 mM [Ca2+]o in the presence of 1 microM of the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187. The areas of single astrocytes were measured and there was a positive correlation between astrocyte area and [Ca2+]o. Morphine had an additive effect on area and form factor measures when [Ca2+]o was 1.0 mM. High [Ca2+]o (3.0 mM) alone mimicked the action of morphine. Morphine alone had no effect on astrocyte area in the presence of 3.0 mM Ca2+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
