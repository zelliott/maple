Rat C6 glioma cells have been used to characterize molecular events involved in the regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression stimulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). IFNs induce a signaling event which involves activation of Stat1 transcription factor. Previous studies have shown that IFNs also induce extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) activation. However, the mechanisms by which IFNs stimulate MAPK activation remain elusive. Here we show that in C6 glioma cells, transiently expressing the dominant-negative form of c-Ha-Ras (Asn-17) abrogated IFN-gamma-induced ERK1 and ERK2 activation. Furthermore, PD98059, a specific MEK1 inhibitor, also blocked this activation. These results indicate that p21ras and MEK1 are required for IFN-gamma-induced ERK1 and ERK2 activation. Recent studies have reported that MAPK is responsible for serine phosphorylation of Stat1 which is required for Stat1's DNA binding and maximal transcriptional activity. Thus, we examined the role of the Ras-MAPK pathway in Stat1 activation and subsequent iNOS induction in C6 glioma cells. Further experiments showed that neither Asn-17 Ras expression nor concentrations of PD98059, which completely abrogated IFN-gamma-induced ERK1 and ERK2 activation, affected Stat1 DNA binding activity or iNOS induction, indicating that the Ras-MAPK pathway does not appear to be involved in the activation of Stat1 and subsequent iNOS induction in C6 glioma cells.
