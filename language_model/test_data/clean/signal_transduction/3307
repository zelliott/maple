Protein kinase CK2 promotes multiple myeloma cell growth by regulating critical signaling pathways. CK2 also modulates proper HSP90-dependent client protein folding and maturation by phosphorylating its co-chaperone CDC37. Because the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR) is central in myeloma pathogenesis, we tested the hypothesis that the CK2/CDC37/HSP90 axis could be involved in UPR in myeloma cells.

We analyzed CK2 activity upon ER stress, the effects of its inactivation on the UPR pathways and on ER stress-induced apoptosis. The consequences of CK2 plus HSP90 inhibition on myeloma cell growth in vitro and in vivo and CK2 regulation of HSP90-triggered UPR were determined.

CK2 partly localized to the ER and ER stress triggered its kinase activity. CK2 inhibition reduced the levels of the ER stress sensors IRE1α and BIP/GRP78, increased phosphorylation of PERK and EIF2α, and enhanced ER stress-induced apoptosis. Simultaneous inactivation of CK2 and HSP90 resulted in a synergic anti-myeloma effect (combination index = 0.291) and in much stronger alterations of the UPR pathways as compared with the single inhibition of the two molecules. Cytotoxicity from HSP90 and CK2 targeting was present in a myeloma microenvironment model, on plasma cells from patients with myeloma and in an in vivo mouse xenograft model. Mechanistically, CK2 inhibition led to a reduction of IRE1α/HSP90/CDC37 complexes in multiple myeloma cells.

Our results place CK2 as a novel regulator of the ER stress/UPR cascades and HSP90 function in myeloma cells and offer the groundwork to design novel combination treatments for this disease.
