To examine whether AP-2alpha is a critical component of the genetic program that directs human trophoblast differentiation, we used DNA microarray analyses to characterize the effects of a dominant-negative form of the AP-2 protein upon in vitro differentiating cytotrophoblast cells. Human cytotrophoblast cells (>95% pure) were cultured for 3 days in the presence of control medium or medium containing an adenovirus that expresses a dominant-negative mutant of AP-2 (Ad2.AP-2D/N) or an adenovirus lacking the AP-2 mutant gene (Ad.WT). DNA microarray analyses using Affymetrix human U95Av2 GeneChips were performed on RNA extracted from the three groups of cells immediately prior to and after 3 days of cell culture. Cells infected with Ad2.AP-2D/N or Ad2.WT underwent morphological differentiation similar to that of uninfected cells, with greater than 90% of the cells in each group fusing to form multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast cells. However, Ad2.AP-2D/N markedly inhibited the induction or repression of many genes that were regulated in the noninfected and Ad2.WT-infected cells during differentiation. Eighteen of the 25 most induced genes and 17 of the 20 most repressed genes during differentiation were AP-2 dependent, with the majority of these related to extracellular organization, cellular communication, and signal transduction. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that AP-2 plays a critical role for both the induction and repression of genes that comprise postsyncytialization gene expression programs of trophoblast differentiation and maturation. AP-2, however, is not required for the fusion of cytotrophoblast cells to form a syncytium or the expression of syncytin.
