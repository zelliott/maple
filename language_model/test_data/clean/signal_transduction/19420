Notch signaling has emerged as a key player in skeletal muscle development and regeneration. Simply stated, Notch signaling inhibits differentiation. Accordingly, fine-tuning the pathway is essential for proper muscle homeostasis. This review will address various aspects of Notch signaling, including our current views of the core pathway, its effects in muscle, its interactions with other signaling pathways, and its relationship with ageing.
