Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play a major role in intracellular signal transduction activated by extracellular stimuli. Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) is a central player in the signal transduction pathways activated in response to growth factors or insulin and is thought to contribute to several cellular functions including nutrient metabolism, cell growth and apoptosis. Recently, several significant publications have described novel mechanisms used to regulate PKB. Since the alteration of PKB activity is associated with several human diseases, including cancer and diabetes, understanding PKB regulation is an important task if we are to develop successful therapeutics.
