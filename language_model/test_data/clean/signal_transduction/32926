For many years, genetically obese mouse strains have provided models for human obesity. The Avy/-agouti mouse, one of the oldest obese mouse models, is characterized by maturity-onset obesity and diabetes as a result of ectopic expression of the secreted protein hormone, agouti protein. Agouti protein is normally expressed in hair follicles to regulate pigmentation through antagonism of the melanocortin-1 receptor, but in-vitro studies have demonstrated that the hormone also has potent antagonist activity for the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R). Subsequent development of the MC4-R knockout mouse model demonstrated that MC4-R plays a role in weight homeostasis as these mice recapitulated the metabolic defects of the agouti mouse. Further evidence for this hypothesis was obtained from pharmacological studies utilizing peptides with MC4-R agonist activity, that inhibited food intake (when administered intracerebrally). Additional studies with peptide antagonists have now implicated the MC4-R in the leptin signalling pathway. Finally, evidence that the MC4-R may play a role in human obesity has been obtained from the identification of a dis-functional variant of the receptor in genetically obese subjects.
