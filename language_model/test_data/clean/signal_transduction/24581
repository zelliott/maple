The U937 human monocyte-macrophage cell line was used to examine the effect of thrombin, an ill-defined chemoattractant, on the polymerization of actin, a process essential for cell motility. In differentiated macrophage-like U937 cells, thrombin (0.5-50 units/ml) caused a rapid dose-dependent increase in the formation of filamentous (F-) actin, detected by the staining of F-actin with the fluorescent toxin, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-phallacidin. In contrast with other chemoattractants such as N-formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine or C5a, actin polymerization in response to thrombin occurred via a pertussis-toxin-insensitive G1-(inhibitory G-protein) independent signalling pathway. Further, this response was not affected by the Ca2+ chelator EGTA or by the specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor RO-31-8220. The response to thrombin was not mimicked by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin or by the direct PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The thrombin response was, however, inhibited by the non-specific protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. The present results suggest that in U937 cells thrombin stimulates the formation of F-actin via a signalling pathway independent of (i) the activation of PKC, (ii) the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and (iii) the activation of Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinases, but dependent on the activation of an undefined staurosporine-sensitive protein kinase.
