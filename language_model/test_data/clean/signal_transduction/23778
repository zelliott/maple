Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has been reported to play a central role in intestinal barrier dysfunction in many diseases; however, the precise role of the TNF-α receptors (TNFRs) has not been well defined using in vivo models. Our previous data showed that enteral nutrient deprivation or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) led to a loss of intestinal epithelial barrier function (EBF), with an associated upregulation of TNF-α and TNFR1. In this study, we hypothesized that TNF-α plays an important role in TPN-associated EBF dysfunction. Using a mouse TPN model, we explored the relative roles of TNFR1 vs. TNFR2 in mediating this barrier loss. C57/BL6 mice underwent intravenous cannulation and were given enteral nutrition or TPN for 7 days. Tumour necrosis factor-α receptor knockout (KO) mice, including TNFR1KO, TNFR2KO or TNFR1R2 double KO (DKO), were used. Outcomes included small intestine transepithelial resistance (TER) and tracer permeability, junctional protein zonula occludens-1, occludin, claudins and E-cadherin expression. In order to address the dependence of EBF on TNF-α further, exogenous TNF-α and pharmacological blockade of TNF-α (Etanercept) were also performed. Total parenteral nutrition led to a loss of EBF, and this was almost completely prevented in TNFR1R2DKO mice and partly prevented in TNFR1KO mice but not in TNFR2KO mice. The TPN-associated downregulation of junctional protein expression and junctional assembly was almost completely prevented in the TNFR1R2DKO group. Blockade of TNF-α also prevented dysfunction of the EBF and junctional protein losses in mice undergoing TPN. Administration of TPN upregulated the downstream nuclear factor-B and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) signalling, and these changes were almost completely prevented in TNFR1R2DKO mice, as well as with TNF-α blockade, but not in TNFR1KO or TNFR2KO TPN groups. Tumour necrosis factor-α is a critical factor for TPN-associated epithelial barrier dysfunction, and both TNFR1 and TNFR2 are involved in EBF loss. Nuclear factor-B and MLCK signalling appear to be important downstream mediators involved in this TNF-α signalling process.
