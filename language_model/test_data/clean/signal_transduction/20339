The compensatory angiogenesis that occurs after cerebral ischemia increases blood flow to the injured area and limits extension of the ischemic penumbra. In this way, it improves the local blood supply. Fostering compensatory angiogenesis is an effective treatment for ischemic cerebrovascular disease. However, angiogenesis in the adult organism is a complex, multi-step process, and the mechanisms underlying the regulation of angiogenesis are not well understood. Although Notch signaling reportedly regulates the vascularization process that occurs in ischemic tissues, little is known about the role of Notch signaling in the regulation of ischemia-induced angiogenesis after ischemic stroke. Recent research has indicated that miR-210, a hypoxia-induced microRNA, plays a crucial role in regulating the biological processes that occur in blood vessel endothelial cells under hypoxic conditions. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of miR-210 in regulating angiogenesis in response to brain ischemia injury and the role of the Notch pathway in the body's response. We found miR-210 to be significantly up-regulated in adult rat ischemic brain cortexes in which the expression of Notch1 signaling molecules was also increased. Hypoxic models of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE-12) were used to assess changes in miR-210 and Notch1 expression in endothelial cells. Results were consistent with in vivo findings. To determine the molecular mechanisms behind these phenomena, we transfected HUVE-12 cells with miR-210 recombinant lentiviral vectors. We found that miR-210 overexpression caused up-regulation of Notch1 signaling molecules and induced endothelial cells to migrate and form capillary-like structures on Matrigel. These data suggest that miR-210 is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis in response to ischemic injury to the brain. Up-regulation of miR-210 can activate the Notch signaling pathway, which may contribute to angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia.
