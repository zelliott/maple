Human leukemias are frequently associated with the aberrant expression of activated fusion tyrosine kinases or activated protein tyrosine kinases carrying insertional or point mutations. The activated kinase enzymes typically phosphorylate one or more signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) factors, which translocate to the cell nucleus and regulate the expression of genes associated with survival and proliferation. The phosphorylation and activation of STAT family members has been described in a wide range of human leukemias. Furthermore, animal models of leukemia have demonstrated the pivotal contribution of STAT activation to leukemic pathogenesis. This review discusses evidence for the functional importance of STAT activation in the biology of leukemia and current opportunities for modulating STAT proteins in the therapy of this group of diseases.
