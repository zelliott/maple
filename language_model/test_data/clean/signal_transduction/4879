The discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation ushered the field of Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) into the era of targeted therapy. Currently, there are several JAK2 inhibitors in clinical trials for patients with MPNs, particularly for patients  with myelofibrosis (MF). These drugs act by blocking the proliferation of neoplastic cells by disrupting the JAK2-STAT signaling and by abrogating inflammatory cytokine signaling which is dependent on JAK kinases. Therapy with JAK2 inhibitors can improve splenomegaly and debilitating  constitutional symptoms in great majority of MF patients, improving greatly their quality of life. Long-term follow-up will reveal whether these drugs can also prolong survival by better controlling signs and symptoms of the MF. There are other compounds in clinical trials for MPNs, including  the new immunomodulatory drug pomalidomide, and inhibitor of mammalian target of Rapamycin everolimus. In this article, we briefly review the latest therapeutic advances in the field of Philadelphia-negative MPNs.
