The present study is directed to study: (a) bax translocation and cytochrome c release as mediators of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis; (b) Fas-L (Fas-ligand) expression as an indicator of the possible involvement of the Fas/Fas-L signaling pathway; and (c) active caspase-3 expression as the main executioner of caspase-mediated apoptosis, in rats receiving an intraperitoneal injection of the glutamate analogue kainic acid (KA) at a dose of 9 mg/kg, which is sufficient to produce generalized seizures and excitotoxic cell death in the entorhinal cortex. Sub-fractionation studies of entorhinal cortex homogenates have shown cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase IV localized in the mitochondrial fraction, and Bax localized in the cytosolic fraction. No modifications in the sub-cellular distribution of cytochrome c and Bax have been observed at 6 h and 24 h in KA-treated rats. Morphological studies have shown cytoplasmic shrinkage and nuclear condensation consistent with necrosis in the entorhinal cortex. Many neurons (about 30% of dying cells) are stained with the method of in situ end-labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation. Yet only about 5% of dying cells have apoptotic morphology. A percentage of dying cells (5% at 6 h and 40% at 24 h) over-express Fas-L but only about 2% of dying cells at 24 h post-injection express cleaved caspase-3 (17 kD). The present data further support the concept that necrosis is the predominant form of cell death in the entorhinal cortex, although caspase-3-dependent apoptotic cell death may play a limited role, in the present paradigm of KA-induced excitotoxicity.
