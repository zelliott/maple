When groups of cells from the inner marginal zone (mesendoderm) of the early Xenopus gastrula are placed on a fibronectin-coated substratum, the explants of the dorsal region spread into monolayers whereas those from the ventral region, though they adhere to the substratum, do not show this spreading reaction. This different behaviour is not reflected in the in vitro behaviour of the respective cells kept in isolation. No difference between dorsal and ventral cells was observed, when they were tested for lamellipodia-driven spreading, movement over the substratum or properties of integrin- and cadherin-mediated adhesion. However, cell contacts between individual dorsal cells are significantly less stable than those between ventral cells. The higher flexibility of the cell-cell contacts seems to determine the spreading behaviour of the dorsal explants, which includes lamellipodia-driven outward movement of the peripheral cells, rearrangements of the cells, building up a horizontal tension within the aggregate and intercalation of cells from above into the bottom layer. Ventral explants lack these properties. Staining for F-actin revealed a decisive difference of the supracellular organisation of the cytoskeleton that underlies the morphology of the different types of explants. Evidence for a higher flexibility of cell-cell contacts in the dorsal mesendoderm was also obtained in SEM studies on gastrulating embryos. Dorsal mesendodermal cells show stronger protrusive activity as compared to ventral mesendodermal cells. The meaning of these observations for the mechanisms of morphogenetic movements during gastrulation is central to the discussion.
