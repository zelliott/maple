Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) rapidly and transiently induces the transcriptional activation of the early growth response gene-1 (egr-1) in the human factor-dependent myeloid leukemic cell line, TF-1. We previously demonstrated that the cAMP response element (CRE) is required for GM-CSF-induced egr-1 expression and that phosphorylation of CREB on serine 133 plays a critical role during GM-CSF signal transduction. To determine whether GM-CSF activates signaling pathways through a protein kinase A-dependent or -independent pathway, we measured cAMP levels following GM-CSF or forskolin treatment of TF-1 cells. Forskolin but not GM-CSF stimulation resulted in an increase in cAMP levels. Transient transfection assays with TF-1 cells were also performed with a -116-nucleotide egr-1 promoter construct and the protein kinase inhibitor, PKI. Although PKI inhibited forskolin induction of the -116-nucleotide construct, it did not affect GM-CSF stimulation of this construct. In the present study, we demonstrated that GM-CSF induces egr-1 expression through a protein kinase A-independent pathway.
