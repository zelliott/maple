Phospholipase D (PLD) activity is elevated in response to most mitogenic signals. Two mammalian PLD genes (PLD1 and PLD2) have been cloned and their gene products have been characterized. PLD1 is a downstream target of the Ras/RalA GTPase cascade implicated in mitogenic and oncogenic signaling. Consistent with a role in mitogenic signaling, elevated expression of PLD1 transforms cells overexpressing the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). However, PLD2 colocalizes with the EGFR in caveolin-enriched light membrane microdomains. We therefore investigated whether PLD2 could also contribute to the transformation of cells overexpressing a tyrosine kinase. We report here that elevated expression of PLD2 transforms rat fibroblasts overexpressing either the EGFR or c-Src. Since overexpression of a tyrosine kinase is a common genetic alteration in several human cancers, these data suggest that elevation of either PLD1 or PLD2 may contribute to the progression to a malignant phenotype in cells with elevated tyrosine kinase activity.
