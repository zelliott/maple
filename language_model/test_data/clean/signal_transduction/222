Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a naturally occurring phenolic acid in human diet. Data obtained from in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that CGA mostly presents anti-oxidant and anti-carcinogenic activities. Here we show that CGA also inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response[AU1] in RAW 264.7 cells. Our results indicated that CGA significantly decreased LPS-induced up-regulation of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) at protein and mRNA levels in RAW 264.7 cells and as a result it inhibited prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) release from LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells. In the further experiments, LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-c-Jun-activator protein (AP-1) pathway were suppressed significantly by CGA. In addition, CGA did not affect phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38. In conclusion, CGA suppresses LPS-induced COX-2 expression via attenuating the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways suggesting that CGA, the polyphenol compound in our food, could exert anti-inflammatory effects through inhibiting PGE(2) production.
