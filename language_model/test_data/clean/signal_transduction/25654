The receptor Notch interacts with the Abl tyrosine kinase signaling pathway to control axon growth and guidance in Drosophila motor neurons. In part, this is mediated by binding to Trio, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho GTPases. We show here that one of the two GEF domains of Trio, the Rac-specific GEF1, is essential for Trio-dependent motor axon guidance and for the genetic suppression of Notch function in motor axon patterning, but the Rho-specific GEF2 domain is not. Consistent with this, we show that Rac, and not Rho1 or Cdc42, interacts genetically with Notch in a manner indistinguishable from that of bona fide Abl signaling components. We infer, therefore, that Rac is a key component of Abl signaling in Drosophila motor axons, and specifically that it is the crucial Rho GTPase in "noncanonical" Notch/Abl signaling.
