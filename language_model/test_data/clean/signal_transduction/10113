The status and interrelationship of p53 family members are critical elements in tumor progression. An intriguing paper in this issue of Cancer Cell (Rocco et al., 2006) reveals a new twist in the interactions between p63 and p73 following DNA damage, underscoring a role for p73 in the proapoptotic regulation of Puma, Noxa, and Bcl-2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). These data define a pathway in which deltaNp63alpha promotes survival in squamous epithelial malignancy by repressing a p73-dependent proapoptotic transcriptional program, suggesting that p63 levels and p73 status may be key determinants of tumor response in patients with HNSCC.
