Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an intestinal gut hormone, is rapidly emerging as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. GLP-1, released from intestinal L-cells, is renowned for its potent stimulation of insulin biosynthesis and release from pancreatic b-cells. Exogenous administration of GLP-1 to subjects with type 2 diabetes results in the normalization of plasma glucose concentrations, in part, as a result of augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. However, it is now recognized that GLP-1 has several other anti-diabetic actions that collectively improve the type 2 diabetic phenotype, and may also prove beneficial in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. These effects include the deceleration of gastric emptying and promotion of satiety, thereby reducing the availability of nutrients for absorption and reducing the requirement for insulin secretion. GLP-1 also reduces plasma glucose levels by suppressing glucagon secretion from pancreatic a-cells and potentially by improving insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Further-more, GLP-1 upregulates expression of b-cell genes (GLUT2, glucokinase, insulin, and PDX-1) and promotes b-cell neogenesis and differentiation of ductal cells into insulin secreting cells. Although initial clinical trials indicate GLP-1 has excellent therapeutic potential, its relatively short-lived biological activity and delivery difficulties limit its appeal. Several approaches that are currently being explored to overcome these limitations include mobilizing endogenous GLP-1 release, preserving the biological activity of the native peptide, and developing GLP-1 analogues with extended durations of action.
