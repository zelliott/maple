Despite their prominent microbicidal roles, NADPH oxidases (NOXs) have been recently found to regulate a wide variety of physiological activities. Through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), NOXs actively participate in cellular activities, including NET formation, inflammasome activation and wound sensing. The microbicidal and cytoregulatory roles of NOXs are contrasted in this review.
