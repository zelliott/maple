Odontogenic tumors that produce abnormal tooth-like structures are repeatedly observed in mandibles of mice that carry both albumin-myc and albumin-ras transgenes. The earliest lesions appear among the periodontal ligament mesenchymal cells, but later lesions include an epithelial component. Subsequent tumor development recapitulates the process of normal tooth formation, which requires multiple sequential cell signals, and results in cell differentiation, matrix secretion, and mineralization. Tumor cells with epithelial morphology produce ras oncoprotein, consistent with an epithelial origin of these tumors. As albumin regulatory sequences direct oncogene expression in these mice, our findings also suggest that some of the albumin present in normal teeth may be locally produced and have a role in tooth mineral formation. The reproducibility of this phenotype makes these mice an excellent model for studies of both normal and neoplastic odontogenesis.
