Integrins link the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton by triggering the assembly of different types of adhesion complex. One of their major components is filamentous actin (F-actin), and they are important signaling hubs for actin cytoskeleton reorganization in response to chemical and mechanical signals. In an exciting publication, Butler et al. have demonstrated for the first time that purified adhesion complexes possess the entire machinery necessary to actively assemble F-actin as a function of integrin activity and clustering.
