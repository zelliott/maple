The amino terminus of nerve growth factor (NGF) is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. A comparison of the bioactivity of highly purified full-length recombinant human (1-118)rhNGF and NH2-terminal truncated (10-118)rhNGF revealed lower potency of (10-118)rhNGF with regard to early NGF responses in neuron-like PC12 cells. Approximately 50 times higher concentrations of (10-118)rhNGF than (1-118)rhNGF were required to elicit the same extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of key enzymes in different second messenger pathways, i.e. the NGF receptor tyrosine kinase p140trkA, phospholipase C gamma-1, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1. A similar reduced potency for induction of the transcription factor c-Fos was observed with (10-118)rhNGF compared to (1-118)rhNGF. The lower potency of (10-118)rhNGF in triggering early responses correlated with its 40-fold lower affinity for PC12 cells. Whereas (10-118)rhNGF had a more than 300-fold lower affinity for the high affinity receptor p140trkA than (1-118)rhNGF, amino-terminal truncation of NGF changed its affinity for the low affinity receptor p75NGFR only slightly (5-10-fold). These observations suggest that amino acids 1-9 of NGF are important for binding to the signal transducing receptor p140trkA. Proteolytic cleavage of the NGF amino terminus, therefore, reduces its potency in starting several second messenger pathways leading to neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells.
