Gap-junction plaques are often observed with tight-junction strands of vascular endothelial cells but the molecular interaction and functional relationships between these two junctions remain obscure. We herein show that gap-junction proteins connexin40 (Cx40) and Cx43 are colocalized and coprecipitated with tight-junction molecules occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1 in porcine blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells. Gap junction blockers 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (18beta-GA) and oleamide (OA) did not influence expression of Cx40, Cx43, occludin, claudin-5, junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-A, JAM-B, JAM-C, or ZO-1, or their subcellular localization in the porcine BBB endothelial cells. In contrast, these gap-junction blocking agents inhibited the barrier function of tight junctions in cells, determined by measurement of transendothelial electrical resistance and paracellular flux of mannitol and inulin. 18beta-GA also significantly reduced the barrier property in rat lung endothelial (RLE) cells expressing doxycycline-induced claudin-1, but did not change the interaction between Cx43 and either claudin-1 or ZO-1, nor their expression levels or subcellular distribution. These findings suggest that Cx40- and/or Cx43-based gap junctions might be required to maintain the endothelial barrier function without altering the expression and localization of the tight-junction components analyzed.
