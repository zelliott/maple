The assumption that signal-dependent noise during isometric force production controls the stabilization of voluntary isometric force is considered. To verify the assumption the trajectory of isometric force is decomposed into voluntary and involuntary components and the mathematical model describing the relationship between them is developed. It is shown that the integral of an involuntary component (signal-dependent noise) plays the role of the controlling parameter realizing the stabilization of a voluntary component. The stabilization is carried out both in the absence and in the presence of visual feedback. Changes of experimental conditions are accompanied by essential changes in the amplitude of the involuntary component oscillations.
