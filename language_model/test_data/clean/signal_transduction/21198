Various methods are now available to identify the molecular partners of the component of a signal transduction pathway. Some interactions, however, can be technically difficult to detect because they depend upon transient tyrosine phosphorylation. Here, we present a simple affinity chromatography approach based on synthetic phosphopeptides to purify potential partners of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. With this approach, we confirm the previously characterized interaction between Grb2 and the EGF receptor, and we identify novel partners of the IGF-1 receptor and of the JAK proteins. Methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS) was identified as a potential mediator of IGF-1R dependent transformation. P85alpha, the regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase, was identified as one of four proteins recruited by a phosphopeptide mimicking a motif conserved in all JAK family members.
