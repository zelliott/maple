Many cellular signaling pathways are involved in the development of cancer. Depending on the tumor entity, the nature as well as the mode of activation can differ. Some signaling pathways frequently show changes as all tumor cells have to fulfill some basic requirements such as independence from growth factors or insensitivity against apoptosis. In this review, the possibilities of a tumor to manipulate signaling pathways to reach these goals are exemplified based on an archetypical melanoma cell. In addition, new therapeutic options based on the knowledge of signaling pathways will be discussed.
