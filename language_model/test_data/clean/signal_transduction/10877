The CD150 receptor is expressed on activated T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and monocytes. A TxYxxV/I motif in the CD150 cytoplasmic tail can bind different SH2-containing molecules, including tyrosine and inositol phosphatases, Src family kinases, and adaptor molecules. To analyze CD150-initiated signal transduction pathways, we used DT40 B-cell sublines deficient in these molecules. CD150 ligation on DT40 transfectants induced the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, which required SH2-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP) but not SH2 domain protein 1A (SH2D1A). CD150-mediated Akt phosphorylation required Syk and SH2D1A, was negatively regulated by Lyn and Btk, but was SHIP independent. Lyn directly phosphorylated Y327 in CD150, but the Akt pathway did not depend on CD150 tyrosine phosphorylation and CD150-SHP-2 association. Analysis of CD150 and SH2D1A expression in non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas revealed stages of B-cell differentiation where these molecules are expressed alone or coexpressed. Signaling studies in Hodgkin disease cell lines showed that CD150 is linked to the ERK and Akt pathways in neoplastic B cells. Our data support the hypothesis that CD150 and SH2D1A are coexpressed during a narrow window of B-cell maturation and SH2D1A may be involved in regulation of B-cell differentiation via switching of CD150-mediated signaling pathways.
