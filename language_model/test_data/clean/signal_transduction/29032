Pin1 is a phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, which specifically catalyzes the amide bond isomerization of phosphoserine-proline or phosphothreonine-proline in mitotic phosphoproteins. Pin1 induces the conformational changes to control the function of phosphoproteins. Depletion of Pinl on various human cancer cell lines cause mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Pin1 is an attracting therapeutic target for anticancer and its inhibitors might be potential anticancer drug. In this review, Pin1 inhibitors and the catalytic mechanism, the biological function of Pin1 and its role in oncogenesis are summarized.
