Tissue factor (TF) is a transmembrane receptor which, in association with factors VII and VIIa, activates factor IX and X, thereby activating the coagulation protease cascades. In response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) monocytes transcribe, synthesize and express TF on their surface. We investigated whether LPS-induced TF in human monocytes is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) activation. The PKC agonists phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and phorbol 12, 13 dibutyrate (PdBu) were both potent inducers of TF in human monocytes, whereas 4 alpha-12, 13 didecanoate (4 alpha-Pdd) had no such effect. Both LPS- and PMA-induced TF activity were inhibited, in a concentration dependent manner, by three different PKC inhibitors: H7, staurosporine and calphostin C. TF antigen determination confirmed that LPS-induced cell-surface TF protein levels decreased in parallel to TF functional activity under staurosporine treatment. Moreover, Northern blot analysis of total RNA from LPS- or PMA-stimulated monocytes showed a concentration-dependent decrease in TF mRNA levels in response to H7 and staurosporine. The decay rate of LPS-induced TF mRNA evaluated after the arrest of transcription by actinomycin D was not affected by the addition of staurosporine, suggesting that its inhibitory effect occurred at a transcriptional level. We conclude that LPS-induced production of TF and its mRNA by human monocytes are dependent on PKC activation.
