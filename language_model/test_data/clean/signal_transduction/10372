Mercury (Hg2+) affects cell-mediated immunity, including thymulin production. Thymulin, a zinc-dependent thymic hormone synthesized by thymic epithelial cells (TECs), is involved in NK cell cytotoxicity and Th1 cytokine production (IL-2 and IFN-gamma), which in turn affect both NKT and classic NK spleen cell cytotoxicity. High doses of Hg2+ induce an inflammatory status, increased production of IL-6 and consequent Th1/Th2 imbalance as well as cell-mediated immune depression. The mechanisms by which Hg+ affects the cell-mediated immune response are still unclear. The nitric oxide (NO) pathway may be implicated. The aim of this work was to further explore its noxious role in innate and adaptive immunity and to study the possible role played by the NO pathway. Young Balb/c mice treated in vivo for 1 month with 1.0 mg HgCl2/kg b.w. showed low thymulin activity, depressed NO production (as measured by nitrite and nitrate plasma levels), impaired classic NK spleen cell cytotoxicity, decreased Th1 (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) cytokine profiles, and increased IL-6 production. In vitro, 10(-6) M of HgCl2 inhibited active thymulin kinetics, TEC proliferation, NKT cell cytotoxicity and Th1 cytokine production, whereas IL-6 increased. L-arginine restored thymulin activity, TEC proliferation, NKT cytotoxicity, cytokine profiles and nitrite and nitrate plasma levels both in vivo and in vitro. Since L-arginine is the substrate for NO production, it may compensate for the cell-mediated immune defect induced by HgCl2, via the arginine-NO-pathway. L-arginine is also able to reduce glomerular kidney IgG antibodies deposits induced by higher dose of HgCl2 administration.
