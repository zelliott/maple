To evaluate the potential roles of Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and c-Kit, the tyrosine kinase receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), in eosinophil responses in vivo, we examined eosinophil numbers in uninfected or nematode-infected wild-type mice, IL-3-/- mice, and IL-3-/- mice that also have a marked reduction in SCF/c-Kit signaling (ie, Kit(W)/Kit(W-v), IL-3-/- mice). We found no significant differences in the numbers of eosinophils in the blood, bone marrow or various tissues of IL-3-/- vs IL-3+/+ mice, either at baseline or after the induction of bone marrow, blood or tissue eosinophilia in response to infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis (S.v.) or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (N.b.). However, in mice with markedly impaired SCF/c-Kit signaling, IL-3 contributed significantly to the increased numbers of eosinophils that were observed in multiple tissues during S.v. infection, but not during infection with N.b.
