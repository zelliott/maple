The endocrine control of oocyte maturation in fish has proven to be a valuable model for investigating rapid, nongenomic steroid actions at the cell surface. Considerable progress has been made over the last decade in identifying and characterizing progestin membrane receptors mediating these actions in fish, in understanding the hormonal regulation and physiological roles of these receptors in oocyte maturation, in elucidating the signal transduction pathways they activate, and in determining their nature. Recent advances on these topics are briefly reviewed. New data demonstrating the involvement of pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory G-proteins in induction of oocyte maturation by the maturation-inducing steroid (MIS) in teleosts is also presented. In addition, the cloning strategy to isolate the MIS receptor gene from spotted seatrout ovaries and the characteristics of a novel gene and protein discovered by this approach are discussed. Current evidence suggests this G-protein-coupled receptor-like protein is the long sought after MIS receptor mediating meiotic maturation of teleost oocytes.
