In response to excessive nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (Nod2) stimulation caused by mucosal bacterial components, gut epithelia need to activate regulatory machinery to maintain epithelial homeostasis. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a representative regulator in the negative feedback loop that modulates TLR-associated inflammatory responses. In the current study, the regulatory effects of ribosomal stress-induced ATF3 on Nod2-stimulated proinflammatory signals were assessed. Ribosomal inactivation caused persistent ATF3 expression that in turn suppressed proinflammatory chemokine production facilitated by Nod2. Decreased chemokine production was due to attenuation of Nod2-activated NF-κB and early growth response protein 1 (EGR-1) signals by ATF3. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms involve two convergent regulatory pathways. Although ATF3 induced by ribosomal inactivation regulated Nod2-induced EGR-1 expression epigenetically through the recruitment of histone deacetylase 1, NF-κB regulation was associated with posttranscriptional regulation by ATF3 rather than epigenetic modification. ATF3 induced by ribosomal inactivation led to the destabilization of p65 mRNA caused by nuclear entrapment of transcript-stabilizing human Ag R protein via direct interaction with ATF3. These findings demonstrate that ribosomal stress-induced ATF3 is a critical regulator in the convergent pathways between EGR-1 and NF-κB, which contributes to the suppression of Nod2-activated proinflammatory gene expression.
