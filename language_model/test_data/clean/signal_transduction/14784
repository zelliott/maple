Regulation of lifespan by the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-like signalling (IIS) pathway has been conserved during evolution from the nematode worm to the mouse. In the insect Drosophila, regulation of lifespan by the IIS pathway was established by data showing that many mutations in single genes encoding IIS components result in an increase in lifespan. Recently, however, the focus has shifted from studying the effects of single gene mutations with ubiquitous effects to finding interventions that alter IIS in specific tissues and at specific stages in the life history of the fruitfly, in order to elucidate the signalling pathways at work and the mechanisms by which alterations in the IIS pathway can extend lifespan.
