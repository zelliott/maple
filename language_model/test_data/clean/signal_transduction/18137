Subepithelial tissue cell types in vivo are separated from air by the surface-covering epithelial layer of various organs, e.g., the skin, cornea, and respiratory and upper alimentary tracts. The epithelial defect caused by inflammatory, traumatic or surgical injury would be expected to expose the subepithelial tissue-localized fibroblasts to influx air. However, it is unclear what effects air stimulation elicits in fibroblast growth, which is critical for wound healing. To address this question, we examined the proliferation of 3T3 fibroblasts with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake, using fibroblast-embedded collagen gel culture with or without air exposure. The BrdU intake of air-exposed fibroblasts was about 6 times that of air-nonexposed cells. To further characterize this fibroblast growth, we examined the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which plays a key role in the growth-signaling pathway of various cell types. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting showed that air exposure increased MAPK cascade expression of the cells more strongly than air nonexposure. The data indicate that air exposure promotes MAPK cascade-associated fibroblast growth, suggesting in turn that in wound repair air stimulation itself may be involved in the basic mechanisms of subepithelial fibroblast proliferation and that it may be related to the pathogenesis of excessive fibroplasia through fibroblast overgrowth.
