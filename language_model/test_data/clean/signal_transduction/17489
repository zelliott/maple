Parafollicular (PF) cells of the thyroid gland are neural crest derivatives, which costore the neurotransmitter, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) with calcitonin. PF cells are located adjacent to follicular (F) cells within the basement membrane of thyroid follicles. It has been proposed that 5-HT serves an intercellular signalling function in the thyroid and that F cells are its target. This proposal was tested by using cell lines derived from PF (medullary thyroid carcinoma [MTC]) and F (FRTL-5) cells to study the mechanisms that mediate the secretion and action of 5-HT. Secretion of 5-HT by MTC cells was evoked by thyroid stimulating hormone, thyrotropin (TSH), elevated extracellular calcium (increases [Ca2+]e), or by agents that increase intracellular cAMP (increases [cAMP]i). When protein kinase C (PKC) was down-regulated by prolonged treatment of MTC cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or PKC was inhibited by staurosporin, the TSH- or PMA-evoked secretion of 5-HT was blocked; however, interference with PKC function did not affect 5-HT secretion evoked by increases [Ca2+]e or increases [cAMP]i. In the putative targets, FRTL-5 cells, 5-HT increased the turnover of phosphoinositides (PI), cytosolic calcium (increases [Ca2+]i), increases [cAMP]i, and biphasically modified the effect of TSH on cAMP. All of these 5-HT effects were inhibited by 5-HT2 receptor antagonists (spiperone and ketanserin) and by pertussis toxin (PTx), suggesting that the actions of 5-HT are mediated by 5-HT2 receptors, which are coupled to a G protein. This suggestion was supported by the following additional observations: FRTL-5 membranes bound the 5-HT2 agonist, [125I]2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenylisopropylamine ([125I]-DOI), and anti-idiotypic antibodies, which recognize 5-HT2 receptors. [125I]-DOI binding was inhibited by guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S) and the antibodies were displaced by spiperone. Data are consistent with the hypothesis that 5-HT serves as a PF to F cell messenger.
