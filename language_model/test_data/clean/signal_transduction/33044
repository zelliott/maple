Skeletal muscle within the vertebrate limb originates from the somite. Much work has focussed upon the role of secreted signalling molecules of the Hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and Wnt families plus their associated antagonists in establishing somitic cell types, yet there is no consensus on how these signals combine to influence muscle patterning. When somitic cells migrate into the limb bud, they become subject to a new set of guidance and patterning cues. Here we discuss the possible roles played by signalling proteins, particularly Hedgehogs, in guiding the cells of the limb musculature to their fate.
