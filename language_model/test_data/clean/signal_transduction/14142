The gene locus encoding protein-tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Expression of the PTPN2 gene product, T cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), in intestinal epithelial cells has been shown to play an important role in the protection of epithelial barrier function during periods of inflammation by acting as a negative regulator of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ. Therefore, agents that increase the activity of TCPTP are of general interest as modifiers of inflammatory signaling events. A previous study demonstrated that the small molecule spermidine is a selective activator of TCPTP in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate whether activation of TCPTP by spermidine was capable of alleviating IFN-γ-induced, proinflammatory signaling and barrier dysfunction in human intestinal epithelial cells. Studies revealed that treatment of T84 and HT29/cl.19A colonocytes with spermidine increased both TCPTP protein levels and enzymatic activity, correlating with a decrease in the phosphorylation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 3, downstream mediators of IFN-γ signaling, upon coadministration of spermidine to IFN-γ-treated cells. On a functional level, spermidine protected barrier function in the setting of inflammation, restricting the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in epithelial permeability induced by IFN-γ in coincubation experiments. These data implicate spermidine as a potential therapeutic agent to treat conditions associated with elevated IFN-γ signaling and a faulty mucosal barrier.
