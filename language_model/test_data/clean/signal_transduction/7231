Zipper interacting protein kinase (ZIPK), also known as death associated protein kinase 3, is a serine/threonine kinase that mediates variety of cell functions. The major biologic function of ZIPK is considered to be the regulation of apoptosis and smooth muscle contraction. Recently, several other functions of ZIPK have been gradually clarified. In this review article, we summarized the recent findings on ZIPK function and ZIPK-related cell signaling. We propose that ZIPK is a potential future target for the development of pharmaceutical therapy for cancer as well as cardiovascular diseases.
