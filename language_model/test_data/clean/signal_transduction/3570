Peritoneal dissemination is one of the main causes of death in gastric cancer             patients. We have previously reported that gastric cancer cells can induce peritoneal             apoptosis, lead to damage of peritoneum integrity, and therefore promote peritoneal             metastasis. However, the soluble factors secreted by cancer cells to trigger the             damaging cascade remain unclear. TGF-β1, a cytokine known for its capacity to             induce proliferative and transformative changes of cells is found in significantly             higher quantities correlated with peritoneal metastasis and TNM stages of gastric             cancer. High levels of TGF-β1 in the subperitoneal milieu may affect the morphology             and function of mesothelial cells, so that the resulting environment becomes favorable             for peritoneal metastases. We observed apoptosis induced by TGF-β1 in mesothelial             cells in peritoneal carcinomatosis. Knockdown of the smad2 gene by siRNA silencing             can partially inhibit these effects. TGF-β1 could upregulate the expressions of             Bax and suppress Bcl-2 in mesothelial cells. We conclude that TGF-β1 could induce             apoptosis of mesothelial cells, which involves the smad2 signaling pathway in             peritoneal carcinomatosis. Bcl-2 and Bax may contribute to this phenomenon.
