Control of energy metabolism by increases of mitochondrial matrix [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](m)) may represent a fundamental mechanism to meet the ATP demand imposed by heart contractions, but the machinery underlying propagation of [Ca(2+)] signals from ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channels (RyR) to the mitochondria remains elusive. Using permeabilized cardiac (H9c2) cells we investigated the cytosolic [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](c)) and [Ca(2+)](m) signals elicited by activation of RyR. Caffeine, Ca(2+), and ryanodine evoked [Ca(2+)](c) spikes that often appeared as frequency-modulated [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations in these permeabilized cells. Rapid increases in [Ca(2+)](m) and activation of the Ca(2+)-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases were synchronized to the rising phase of the [Ca(2+)](c) spikes. The RyR-mediated elevations of global [Ca(2+)](c) were in the submicromolar range, but the rate of [Ca(2+)](m) increases was as large as it was in the presence of 30 microm global [Ca(2+)](c). Furthermore, RyR-dependent increases of [Ca(2+)](m) were relatively insensitive to buffering of [Ca(2+)](c) by EGTA. Therefore, RyR-driven rises of [Ca(2+)](m) appear to result from large and rapid increases of perimitochondrial [Ca(2+)]. The falling phase of [Ca(2+)](c) spikes was followed by a rapid decay of [Ca(2+)](m). CGP37157 slowed down relaxation of [Ca(2+)](m) spikes, whereas cyclosporin A had no effect, suggesting that activation of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) exchangers accounts for rapid reversal of the [Ca(2+)](m) response with little contribution from the permeability transition pore. Thus, rapid activation of Ca(2+) uptake sites and Ca(2+) exchangers evoked by RyR-mediated local [Ca(2+)](c) signals allow mitochondria to respond rapidly to single [Ca(2+)](c) spikes in cardiac cells.
