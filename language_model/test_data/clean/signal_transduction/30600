During vaccination or infection, adaptive and innate immune receptors of B cells are engaged by microbial antigens/ligands. A better understanding of how innate and adaptive signaling pathways interact could enlighten B lymphocyte biology as well as aid immunotherapy strategies and vaccine design. To address this goal, we examined the effects of TLR stimulation on BCR and CD40-induced B cell activation. Synergistic production of IL-6 was observed in both human and mouse primary B cells stimulated through B cell antigen receptors, CD40 and TLR7, and these two receptors also cooperated independently of BCR signals. The enhanced IL-6 production was dependent upon the activity of c-Jun kinase (JNK) and cFos. Dual stimulation through CD40 and TLR7 markedly enhanced JNK activity. The increased level of active JNK in dual-stimulated cells was accompanied by an increase in the level of active AP-1 monomers cJun and cFos. The stimulation of B cells through both CD40 and TLR7 therefore enhanced the production of cytokines through increased JNK signaling and AP-1 activity. In addition, the dual stimulation increased cFos/AP-1 species in stimulated cells, effectively expanding the repertoire of AP-1 dimers as compared to singly stimulated B cells.
