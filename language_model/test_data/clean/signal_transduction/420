Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play diverse roles in several developmental processes. Mutations leading to deregulated FGF signaling can cause human skeletal dysplasias and cancer.(1,2) Here we report a missense mutation (Ser99Asp) in exon 2 of FGF9 in 12 patients with multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS) in a large Chinese family. In vitro studies demonstrate that FGF9(S99N) is expressed and secreted as efficiently as wild-type FGF9 in transfected cells. However, FGF9(S99N) induces compromised chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, which is accompanied by enhanced osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Biochemical analysis reveals that S99N mutation in FGF9 leads to significantly impaired FGF signaling, as evidenced by diminished activity of Erk1/2 pathway and decreased beta-catenin and c-Myc expression when compared with wild-type FGF9. Importantly, the binding of FGF9(S99N) to its receptor is severely impaired although the dimerization ability of mutant FGF9 itself or with wild-type FGF9 is not detectably affected, providing a basis for the defective FGFR signaling. Collectively, our data demonstrate a previously uncharacterized mutation in FGF9 as one of the causes of SYNS, implicating an important role of FGF9 in normal joint development.
