Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) signaling increases glucocorticoid production by promoting the interaction of transcription factors and coactivator proteins with the promoter of steroidogenic genes. The nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is essential for steroidogenic gene transcription. Sphingosine (SPH) is a ligand for SF-1. Moreover, suppression of expression of acid ceramidase (ASAH1), an enzyme that produces SPH, increases the transcription of multiple steroidogenic genes. Given that SF-1 is a nuclear protein, we sought to define the molecular mechanisms by which ASAH1 regulates SF-1 function. We show that ASAH1 is localized in the nuclei of H295R adrenocortical cells and that cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling promotes nuclear sphingolipid metabolism in an ASAH1-dependent manner. ASAH1 suppresses SF-1 activity by directly interacting with the receptor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that ASAH1 is recruited to the promoter of various SF-1 target genes and that ASAH1 and SF-1 colocalize on the same promoter region of the CYP17A1 and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) genes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ASAH1 is a novel coregulatory protein that represses SF-1 function by directly binding to the receptor on SF-1 target gene promoters and identify a key role for nuclear lipid metabolism in regulating gene transcription.
