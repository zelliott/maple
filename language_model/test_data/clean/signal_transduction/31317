Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular function. S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of an NO moiety to sulfhydryl residues of proteins, resulting in the formation of S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), is a prevalent posttranslational protein modification involved in redox-based cellular signaling. Under physiologic conditions, protein S-nitrosylation and SNOs provide protection preventing further cellular oxidative and nitrosative stress. However, oxidative stress and the resultant dysfunction of NO signaling have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases.
