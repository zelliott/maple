Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) family implicated in many developmental processes in metazoans such as embryo axes specification. Their wide variety of actions is in part controlled by inhibitors that impede the interaction of BMPs with their specific receptors. Here, we focused our attention on the Differential screening-selected gene Aberrative in Neuroblastoma (DAN) family of inhibitors. Although they are well-characterized in vertebrates, few data are available for this family in other metazoan species. In order to understand the evolution of potential developmental roles of these inhibitors in chordates, we identified the members of this family in the cephalochordate amphioxus, and characterized their expression patterns during embryonic development. Our data suggest that the function of Cerberus/Dand5 subfamily genes is conserved among chordates, whereas Gremlin1/2 and NBL1 subfamily genes seem to have acquired divergent expression patterns in each chordate lineage. On the other hand, the expression of Gremlin in the amphioxus neural plate border during early neurulation strengthens the hypothesis of a conserved neural plate border gene network in chordates.
