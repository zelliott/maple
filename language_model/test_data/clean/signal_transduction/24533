Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (SF), is a polypeptide which induces motility and/or mitogenesis in epithelial cells. The receptor for HGF/SF, p190MET, is a two-chain transmembrane tyrosine kinase encoded by the MET proto-oncogene. To identify the cytoplasmic effectors involved in signal transduction we have produced the human HGF/SF receptor in insect cells (Sf9) by means of a recombinant baculovirus. Two 170-kDa forms of the receptor were synthesized in Sf9 cells: the uncleaved single-chain precursor (which is by far the more abundant) and the proteolytically processed two-chain molecule. Both receptor species are phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo and are active kinases in vitro. The recombinant receptor binds and phosphorylates in vitro four known cytoplasmic transducers containing src homology region 2 (SH2) domains: the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pl 3-kinase), rasGAP, phospholipase-C gamma (PLC-gamma), and p59Fyn, a tyrosine kinase of the src family. In all cases the association is strictly dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor, indicating that it occurs via specific interaction with the SH2 domains. These results show that the HGF/SF receptor has the sequence requirements for binding a spectrum of cytoplasmic transducers whose different combinations in target cells may result in the observed pleiotropic biological response.
