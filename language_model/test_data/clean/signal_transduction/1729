Stimulation of membrane receptors linked to a phospholipase C and the subsequent production of the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) is a signaling pathway of fundamental importance in eukaryotic cells. Signaling downstream of these initial steps involves mobilization of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores and Ca(2+) influx through the plasma membrane. For this influx, several contrasting mechanisms may be responsible but particular relevance is attributed to the induction of Ca(2+) influx as consequence of depletion of intracellular calcium stores. This phenomenon (frequently named store-operated calcium entry, SOCE), in turn, may be brought about by various signals, including soluble cytosolic factors, interaction of proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum with ion channels in the plasma membrane, and a secretion-like coupling involving translocation of channels to the plasma membrane. Experimental approaches to analyze these mechanisms have been considerably advanced by the discovery of mammalian homologs of the Drosophila cation channel transient receptor potential (TRP). Some members of the TRP family can be expressed to Ca(2+)-permeable channels that enable SOCE; other members form channels activated independently of stores. TRP proteins may be an essential part of endogenous Ca(2+) entry channels but so far expression of most TRP cDNAs has not resulted in restitution of channels found in any mammalian cells, suggesting the requirement for further unknown subunits. A major exception is CaT1, a TRP channel demonstrated to provide Ca(2+)-selective, store-operated currents identical to those characterized in several cell types. Ongoing and future research on TRP channels will be crucial to understand the molecular basis of receptor-mediated Ca(2+) entry, with respect to the structure of the entry channels as well as to the mechanisms of its activation and regulation.
