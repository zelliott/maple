CD8 T lymphocytes from chronically infected HIV-positive patients degenerate into a preapoptotic state and exhibit impaired functionality. Particularly in viremic patients, this was associated with an increased proportion of interleukin-7 receptor-alpha low-expressing (IL-7Ralpha(low)) effector-like CD8 T cells. As cytokine signaling through signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) is essential for cellular function, we hypothesized that activation of this pathway may be impaired in these cells.

To evaluate cytokine-induced STAT activation in IL-7Ralpha(low) and IL-7Ralpha(high) CD8 T cells from chronically infected HIV-positive patients and investigate the potential molecular mechanism involved in the reduced IL-7Ralpha expression.

CD8 T cells from HIV-positive patients on and off antiretroviral therapy were assayed respectively for STAT activation, cytokine receptor, and transcription factor expression by flow cytometry and real-time PCR.

IL-7 stimulation failed to activate STAT5 in a substantial proportion of patient CD8 T cells. This correlated with reduced IL-7Ralpha mRNA and surface protein expression. Interestingly, IL-7Ralpha(low) cells appeared to be fully capable of recruiting the STAT pathway in response to IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-15. mRNA expression suggested a potential role for growth factor independent (Gfi)-1 as an IL-7Ralpha transcriptional repressor, but not that of other transcriptional regulators studied, including Gfi-1B and GA-binding protein alpha. Programmed death-1 inhibitory receptor, though upregulated in CD8 T cells from HIV-positive patients, appeared unrelated to IL-7Ralpha expression and STAT signaling capacity.
