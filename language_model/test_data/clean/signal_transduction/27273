Effects of thrombin on brain cells, including change of neurite outgrowth and astrocyte shape, are described, but the molecular mechanisms are unclear. We investigated the effects of human alpha-thrombin and a six amino acid thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP-6, SFLLRN) on [Ca2+]i, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and protein kinase C in rat glioma C6 cells. Stimulation of C6 cells with both alpha-thrombin and TRAP-6 resulted in [Ca2+]i mobilization, [3H]Inositol phosphate response, and enhanced immunoreactivity of the protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon. Results suggest that alpha-thrombin and TRAP-6 activate at least partially the same intracellular signaling pathways in rat glioma C6 cells, which is evidence for involvement of "tethered ligand" receptor in thrombin induced signaling in glioma C6 cells.
