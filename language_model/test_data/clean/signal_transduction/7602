The Notch pathway controls many aspects of development and is mutated in various human cancers. Remarkably, Notch function changes during the development of cellular hierarchies and can be either oncogenic or tumour-suppressive, depending on cellular context. Notch dysregulation is also important in cardiovascular disease and disorders of immunity. This mini-review outlines key features of the Notch signalling pathway and emerging data linking it to human diseases.
