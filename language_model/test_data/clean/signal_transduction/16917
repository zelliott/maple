We aimed to study key signalling proteins involved in angiogenesis and proliferation on the response to inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and mammalian target of rapamycin in first- and in second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

In a panel of human RCC tumours, in vitro and in nude mice, we evaluated the effect of sunitinib, sorafenib and everolimus, alone and in sequence, on tumour growth and expression of signalling proteins involved in proliferation and resistance to treatment.

We demonstrated that, as single agents, sunitinib, sorafenib and everolimus share similar activity in inhibiting cell proliferation, signal transduction and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in different RCC models, both in vitro and in tumour xenografts. Pre-treatment with sunitinib reduced the response to subsequent sunitinib and sorafenib but not to everolimus. Inability by sunitinib to persistently inhibit HIF-1, VEGF and pMAPK anticipated treatment resistance in xenografted tumours. After first-line sunitinib, second-line treatment with everolimus was more effective than either sorafenib or rechallenge with sunitinib in interfering with signalling proteins, VEGF and interleukin-8, translating into a significant advantage in tumour growth inhibition and mice survival.

We demonstrated that a panel of angiogenic and signalling proteins can correlate with the onset of resistance to sunitinib and the activity of everolimus in second line.
