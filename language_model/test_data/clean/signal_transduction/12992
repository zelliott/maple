Significant progress has recently been made in our understanding of how transcription factors such as PU.1, Notch1, E2A, EBF, Pax5, Bcl6, Blimp1 and XBP1 control different developmental decisions during the onset and terminal phase of B-lymphopoiesis. One emerging theme is that negative regulatory networks play an important role in suppressing alternative gene programs and their corresponding cell fates throughout B-cell development.
