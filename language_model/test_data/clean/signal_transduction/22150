Gestational exposure to nicotine affects brain development, leading to numerous behavioural and physiological deficits in the offspring during adolescence. To analyse the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, a pathway-focused oligonucleotide microarray was used to determine gene expression profiles in five brain regions (i.e. amygdala, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and caudate putamen CPu) of adolescent rats that received nicotine or saline during gestation. Following appropriate statistical and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses, 24 cell death/survival-related pathways were found to be significantly modulated by gestational nicotine. On the basis of their biological functions, these pathways can be classified into three categories: growth factor, death receptor, and kinase cascade. We employed a quantitative real-time PCR array to verify the findings by measuring the expression of 29 genes involved in cell death/survival-related pathways. Together, our findings indicate that gestational nicotine exposure has significant effects on gene expression in cell death/survival-related pathways in the brains of adolescent offspring. Such effects appear to be brain region-specific and are realized through regulation of the expression of growth factors and receptors, caspases, kinases, and transcription factors. On the basis of these findings, we offer a hypothetical model to explain how gestational nicotine exposure may affect cell death and survival in the brains of adolescent offspring by regulating the balance between growth-factor and death-receptor pathways.
