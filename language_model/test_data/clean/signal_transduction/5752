Cyclic AMP protects against hepatocyte apoptosis by a protein kinase A-independent cAMP-GEF/phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. However, the signaling pathway coupling cAMP-GEF with PI3K is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Src tyrosine kinases (Src-TYK) and PI3K-p110 isoforms in this pathway. Studies were done in rat hepatocytes using the hydrophobic bile acid glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDC) to induce apoptosis. cAMP-binding guanine nucleotide exchange factors (cAMP-GEFs) were selectively activated by using 4-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2'-O-methyladenosine-3'-5'-cyclic monophosphate (CPT-2-Me-cAMP), which sequentially phosphorylated Src-TYK (within 1 min) followed by Akt (within 5 min). The Src inhibitors PP2 and SU6656 inhibited basal and CPT-2-Me-cAMP-mediated Src and Akt phosphorylation. These inhibitors had no effect on CPT-2-Me-cAMP-mediated activation of Rap GTPases. CPT-2-Me-cAMP induced transient Src dependent autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Inhibition of the EGFR with AG 1478 partially inhibited the ability of CPT-2-Me to phosphorylate Akt. Whereas PP2 completely abolished the protective effect of CPT-2-Me-cAMP in GCDC induced apoptosis, AG 1478 partially inhibited the cytoprotective effect. CPT-2-Me-cAMP treatment resulted in Src-dependent activation of the p110 beta and alpha subunits of PI3K, but only the latter was sensitive to inhibition with AG 1478. In conclusion, activation of cAMP-GEFs results in phosphorylation of Src-TYK and Akt and activation of the p110 beta/alpha subunits of PI3K. Maximal cAMP-GEF-mediated Akt phosphorylation as well as protection from bile acid-induced apoptosis requires activation of Src-TYK and the EGFR. These studies support the existence of two pathways: cAMP-GEF/Rap/Src/PI3Kbeta/Akt and cAMP-GEF/Rap/Src/EGFR/PI3Kalpha/Akt, both of which are necessary for maximal cytoprotective effect of cAMP-GEFs in hepatocytes.
