We have investigated the involvement of MAP kinase cascades in the response of the liver to post-ischemic reperfusion. Both JNKs and ERKs are activated but the duration and magnitude of the increase in their activities appear to be different. JNK activation is more marked but shorter than that of ERKs. The increase observed in the phosphotyrosine content of the 52 kDa Shc protein, accompanied by an increased amount of co-immunoprecipitated Grb2, and the activation of Raf-1 kinase provide evidence of the involvement of a Ras-Raf-dependent pathway, with a time course that is similar to that of ERK activation. The treatment of rats with IL-1 receptor antagonist modified all of the described effects, suggesting that IL-1 plays a role in the response of the liver to reperfusion.
