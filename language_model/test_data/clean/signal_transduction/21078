Glycosyltransferase gene transfection into cell lines has been an approach used successfully to elucidate the functional role of cell surface glycoconjugates. We have transfected the rat CMP-NeuAc:Galbeta1,4GlcNAc alpha2,6-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.1) gene into a human, tumorigenic, glioma cell line, U373 MG. This transfection led to a marked inhibition of invasivity, alterations in adhesivity to fibronectin and collagen matrices, and inappropriately sialylated alpha3beta1 integrin. Adhesion-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced in the transfectants despite increased expression of focal adhesion kinase, p125fak. Furthermore, the transfectants showed a distinct cell morphology, an increased number of focal adhesion sites, and different sensitivity to cytochalasin D treatment than control U373 MG cells. These results suggest that inappropriate sialylation of cell surface glycoconjugates, such as integrins, can change focal adhesion as well as adhesion-mediated signal transduction and block glioma cell invasivity in vitro.
