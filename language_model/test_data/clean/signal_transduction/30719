Excessive release of nitric oxide (NO) by mesangial cells contributes to the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis. Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) produced at inflammatory sites regulates the release of NO through its downstream signaling. In glomerular mesangial cells (MES-13 cells), PGE(2) modulated NO production mainly through EP4 receptor in a cAMP-dependent manner. Lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma (LPS+IFNgamma)-induced NO production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene and protein expression were greatly inhibited by AH23848, an EP4 antagonist. Further investigation indicated that AH23848 attenuated endogenous cAMP accumulation in MES-13 cells and modulated NO production through declination of iNOS gene expression and acceleration of iNOS protein degradation. AH23848 downregulated the iNOS protein in MES-13 cells through protein kinase A (PKA) since KT5720, a PKA-specific inhibitor, reduced iNOS protein stability. A short exposure of activated MES-13 cells to okadaic acid augmented iNOS activity. AH23848 and KT5720 attenuated serine/threonine phosphorylation of iNOS protein in LPS + IFNgamma-stimulated MES-13 cells. The results of this study led us to speculate that cAMP might regulate iNOS-stimulated NO synthesis through posttranslational mechanisms. Attenuation of cAMP signaling and the phosphorylation status of the iNOS protein may account for the effect of AH23848 in accelerating iNOS protein degradation in MES-13 cells.
