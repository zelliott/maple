Human peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes were activated with concanavalin A with or without exogenous recombinant interleukin 1 (IL-1) alone or IL-1 + interleukin 2 (IL-2) under microgravity conditions to test the hypothesis that lack of production of IL-1 by monocytes is the cause of the near total loss of activation observed earlier on several Spacelab flights. The 60 min failure of the on-board 1 x g reference centrifuge at the time of the addition of the activator renders the in-flight data at 1 x g unreliable. However, the data from a previous experiment on SLS-1 show that there is no difference between the results from the in-flight 1 x g centrifuge and 1 x g on ground. The comparison between the data of the cultures at 0 x g in space and of the synchronous control at 1 x g on ground show that exogenous IL-1 and IL-2 do not prevent the loss of activity (measured as the mitotic index) at 0 x g; production of interferon-gamma, however, is partially restored. In contrast to a previous experiment in space, the production of IL-1 is not inhibited.
