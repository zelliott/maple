The nervous system can generate outflow capable of signaling cells of the immune system via two routes: (1) hormonal influences via hypothalamopituitary-target organ activation, and (2) neurotransmitter influences via direct innervation of the parenchyma of both primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Both noradrenergic and neuropeptidergic nerve fibers are found directly adjacent to cells of the immune system in bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and other sites. These neurotransmitters can modulate immune responsiveness at several levels, including individual cellular functions, collective cellular interactions and immune responses, and overall host immunological response to a challenge by bacteria, viruses, tumor cells, or other sources. The ability of neural signals to modulate immune responsiveness is influenced by such factors as co-localization with other neurotransmitters, synergistic or dual signaling by neurotransmitters and cytokines, hormonal influences on ligand availability or receptor responsiveness, extent of catabolism and inactivation of the neural signal, and unique chemical and morphological aspects of the specific compartmentation of the lymphoid organ in which signaling is taking place. Thus, neural-immune signaling is a complex and dynamic process, with bidirectional interactions in a complex microenvironment.
