It has been known that glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) can reduce lipid hydroperoxides through their Se-independent glutathione peroxidase activity and that these enzymes can also detoxify lipid peroxidation end products such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). In this article, recent studies suggesting that the Alpha class GSTs provide a formidable defense against oxidative stress are critically evaluated and the role of these enzymes in the regulation of oxidative stress-mediated signaling is reviewed. Available evidence from earlier studies together with results of recent studies in our laboratories strongly suggests that lipid peroxidation products, particularly hydroperoxides and 4-HNE, are involved in the mechanisms of stress-mediated signaling and that it can be modulated by the Alpha class GSTs through the regulation of the intracellular concentrations of 4-HNE.
