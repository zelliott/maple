To study the protective mechanism of Dusuqing Granule, a compound Chinese herbal medicine, on the senile multiple organ injury caused by bacterial pneumonia by observing the expression changes of molecules related to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling.

A total of 55 male Sprague-Dawley aged rats were divided into control group, untreated group, Dusuqing group and lomefloxacin group. There were 25 rats in the untreated group and 10 rats in each of the other three groups. Multiple organ injury in a rat model of pneumonia was induced by injection of Klebsiella pneumoniae through tracheal intubation. By means of immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), examinations were made on mRNA expressions of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), CD14, TLR4 and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) in the tissues of the lung, heart and small intestine, and also on the protein expressions of TLR4, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB).

Expressions of LBP, CD14, TLR4 and IRAK-1 mRNAs in the tissues of the lung, heart and small intestine in the untreated group were stronger than those in the control group (P<0.01 or Plt;0.05). The protein expressions of TLR4, TRAF6 and NF-κB were increased dramatically in the untreated group as compared with the control group (Plt;0.01 or Plt;0.05). Compared with the untreated group, the expressions of LBP, CD14, TLR4 and IRAK-1 mRNAs in the tissues of the lung, heart and small intestine in the Dusuqing group were weakened significantly (Plt;0.01 or Plt;0.05). Meanwhile, the protein expressions of TLR4, TRAF6 and NF-κB were decreased markedly in the Dusuqing group (Plt;0.01 or Plt;0.05).

Dusuqing Granule is effective in suppressing toll-like receptor signal transduction activation and reducing the secretion of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, which can further reduce the organ tissue injury. Dusuqing Granule can decrease the levels of TLR signal transduction activation including the targets LBP, CD-14, TLR4, IRAK-1, TRAF6 and NF-κB, which is different from the special inhibitor that acts only on some segments.
