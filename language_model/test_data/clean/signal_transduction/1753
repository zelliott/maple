Mice deficient for the transcription factor interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) are immunodeficient and develop granulocytic leukemia. Further analyses indicated that ICSBP is a molecular switch factor directing the differentiation of bipotential myeloid precursors to the monocytic lineage. To reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for the deregulation of myelopoiesis, we examined the signaling of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from ICSBP(-/-) mice. We found that in the absence of ICSBP, CSF-1R signaling is attenuated as seen from an accelerated termination of Erk phosphorylation and reduced cell growth. This finding coincides with an increased CSF-1R ubiquitination and an enhanced accumulation of c-Cbl. c-Cbl is an ubiquitin-ligase known to down-regulate activated CSF-1R by targeting it to the endocytic pathway. Our results indicate that upon CSF-1R activation, c-Cbl itself is partly proteolytically degraded in ICSBP(+/+) but not in ICSBP(-/-) BMMs. Congruently, the expression of a major endosomal/lysosomal protease, cathepsin B, is strongly reduced in ICSBP(-/-) BMMs.
