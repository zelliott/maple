To characterize the "portal signal" in a nonsteady hyperglycemic state, the kinetic relationship between net hepatic glucose balance (NHGB) and either hepatic glucose load (HGL) or plasma insulin level was determined during glucose infusion using a catheter technique in 36 conscious dogs. Glucose was infused intraportally (Po group) and peripherally (Pe group) at 39, 56, and 83 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) over 2 h. There was a linear relationship between mean NHGB and either mean HGL or plasma insulin levels at each rate in either delivery (HGL: Po r = 0.99, Pe r = 0.95; insulin: Po r = 99, Pe r = 0.79). The threshold levels for net hepatic glucose uptake were 3.8 and 11.7 mmol/l for plasma glucose and 65 and 392 pmol/l for plasma insulin, respectively. The slope of the regression line against the abscissa was four times larger in portal than in peripheral delivery (HGL: Po 0.20 vs. Pe 0.05, P < 0.05; insulin: Po 0.19 vs. Pe 0.04, P < 0.05). These results suggest that the portal signal overrules the threshold of glucose for hepatic uptake by increasing hepatic extraction rate in a nonsteady hyperglycemic state.
