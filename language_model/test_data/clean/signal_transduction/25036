Gingival fibroblasts produce proinflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from periodontopathic bacteria. Recently it has become evident that the human homologue of Drosophila Toll can transduce intracellular signaling by LPS stimulation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been identified in myeloid cells; however, their role in nonmyeloid cells such as gingival fibroblasts has not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that human gingival fibroblasts constitutively express TLR2 and TLR4 and that their levels of expression are increased by stimulation with LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis. Upregulated expression of interleukin-6 gene and protein in fibroblasts stimulated with LPS is inhibited by anti-TLR4 antibody. These findings suggest that TLRs may confer responsiveness to LPS in gingival fibroblasts.
