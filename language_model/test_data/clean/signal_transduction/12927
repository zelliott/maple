Reactive oxygen species play a critical role in inducing apoptosis. The small GTPase p21 Ras and the ERK1/2 MAPK have been proposed as key regulators of the signaling cascade triggered by oxidative stress (H2O2). Harvey-Ras (Ha-Ras) and Kirsten-Ras (Ki-Ras) isoforms are so far functionally indistinguishable, because they activate the same downstream effectors, including ERK1/2. Moreover, ERK1/2 signaling has been involved in both protection and induction of apoptosis.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to H2O2, and apoptosis was detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, fluorescence microscopy, and caspase-3 activation. Transfection of Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras genes in HUVECs was performed to evaluate the response to H2O2. We have found that, whereas Ha-Ras decreases tolerance to oxidative stress, Ki-Ras has a potent antiapoptotic activity. Both effects are mediated by ERK1/2. Tolerance to H2O2 is encoded by a unique stretch of lysines at the COOH terminus of the Ki-Ras, lacking in Ha-Ras, and it is relatively independent of the farnesylated anchor. Inhibition of p21 Ras signaling by farnesylation inhibitors increased the resistance to apoptosis in Ha-Ras-expressing cells.

These findings explain the opposite effects of ERK1/2 stimulation on apoptosis found in different cell types and suggest that local activation of ERK1/2 signaling may account for the opposing response to oxidative stress by Ha-Ras or Ki-Ras-expressing cells. Modulation of cell reactivity to oxidative stress by p21 Ras points to the specific and predictive effects of Ras inhibitors in vivo as potential therapeutic drugs in disorders produced by increase of reactive oxygen species inside the cells.
