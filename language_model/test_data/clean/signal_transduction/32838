The signalling pathways by which insulin triggers protein synthesis were studied using an antisense strategy to deplete ERK1/ERK2 and rapamycin to inhibit the p70S6K pathway. The results indicated that ERK1/ERK2 principally regulated the amount of the protein synthesis machinery available in the cell while the p70S6K pathway contributed to modulating its activation in response to insulin. ERK1/ERK2 also mediated in a small proportion of insulin-stimulated protein synthesis which included the induction of c-fos protein. When c-fos induction was blocked the majority of insulin-stimulated protein synthesis still occurred and thus did not require transcriptional regulation of c-fos or its targets.
