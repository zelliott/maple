To explore the role of neuregulin (neural regulation of protein, NRG) in the process of mouse spermatogonia proliferation.

Mouse testis fragments were cultured in the medium DMEM containing purified NRG1beta or NRG3 at the concentration of 50, 100 and 200 ng/ml, respectively, followed by BrdU immunohistochemical staining and determination of the proliferation rate of spermatogonia.

Compared with the control group, neuregulin significantly promoted the proliferation of spermatogonia (P < 0.05). The proliferation rates of spermatogonia cultured in the medium with 50, 100 and 200 ng/ml of NRG13 were 1.69, 1.55 and 1.86 times, and those with 50, 100 and 200 ng/ml of NRG3 were 1.35, 1.54 and 2.11 times that of the control.

NRG1beta and NRG3 can promote the proliferation of mouse spermatogonia, and NRG is expected to be applied in the treatment of male infertility.
