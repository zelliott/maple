WNT signals play key roles in carcinogenesis and embryogenesis through the specification of cell fate and polarity. Dishevelled proteins are implicated in the WNT - beta-catenin pathway and the WNT-PCP pathway. DAAM1/KIAA0666 is a Dishevelled-binding protein transducing WNT signals to the PCP pathway. Here, we identified and characterized DAAM2 gene by using bioinformatics. Uncharacterized FLJ34430 and KIAA0381 cDNAs were homologous to DAAM1. FLJ34430 was recombined with URB (XM_087331) in the 3'-region, and KIAA0381 was truncated in the 5'-region. Nucleotide sequence of DAAM2 cDNA was determined in silico by adding nucleotide position 1-793 of FLJ34430 onto the 5'-end of KIAA0381. DAAM2 gene consists of 27 exons, and gives rise to four splicing variants due to alternative splicing of alternative promoter type as well as of cassette exon type. DAAM2 gene was linked to the MOCS1 gene on human chromosome 6p21.3 with an interval less than 1 kb. DAAM2 mRNA was expressed in fetal heart, adult hypothalamus, eye, spinal cord, lung, prostate, kidney, and also in glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, melanoma, mammary adenocarcinoma and chondrosarcoma. DAAM2 was a 1077-amino-acid protein with Formin-homology FH1 and FH2 domains, which showed 68.9% total-amino-acid identity with DAAM1. Among Formin-homology proteins, FDD (Formin-like, Diaphanous, Daam) domain was conserved in FMNL1/FMNL/KW-13, FMNL2/KIAA1902/FHOD2, DIAPH1, DIAPH2, DAAM1 and DAAM2, but not in Fmn1, Fmn2, FHOD1 and Grid2ip. Therefore, it was concluded that FMNL1, FMNL2, DIAPH1, DIAPH2, DAAM1 and DAAM2 proteins constitute the Formin-homology FDD subfamily.
