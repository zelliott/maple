Human endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity is important for maintaining blood pressure homeostasis and vascular integrity through nitric oxide (NO).The in vitro study aimed at investigating a role of p38α signaling in modulating NO production in human umbilical vein endothelial cell-12 (HUVEC-12). Consistent with the stimulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, the over-expression of p38α markedly down-regulated the eNOS promoter activity in HUVEC-12, which could be reversed by its negative mutant p38α (AF) or p38-specific inhibitor SB203580. Compared to the stimulation of LPS or TNF-α, p38α-targeting siRNA decreased the expressions of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated p38α, and increased the promoter activity, an eNOS mRNA level and a phosphorylated eNOS protein expression with the enhancement of NO, which could be abrogated by the scrambled siRNA. The in situ eNOS protein expression in the cells treated by p38α-targeting siRNA was also higher than that of the control, following the corresponding attenuation of a p38 level, and mainly localized in the inner membrane and cytoplasm. These results indicate that the p38α subtype may be a potential target to down-regulate the eNOS activity and NO production in human endothelial cells.
