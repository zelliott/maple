Dopamine (DA) increases Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in lung alveolar epithelial cells. This effect is associated with an increase in Na(+),K(+)-ATPase molecules within the plasma membrane (). Analysis of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase motion was performed in real-time in alveolar cells stably expressing Na(+),K(+)-ATPase molecules carrying a fluorescent tag (green fluorescent protein) in the alpha-subunit. The data demonstrate a distinct (random walk) pattern of basal movement of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase-containing vesicles in nontreated cells. DA increased the directional movement (by 3.5 fold) of the vesicles and an increase in their velocity (by 25%) that consequently promoted the incorporation of vesicles into the plasma membrane. The movement of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase-containing vesicles and incorporation into the plasma membrane were microtubule dependent, and disruption of this network perturbed vesicle motion toward the plasma membrane and prevented the increase in the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity induced by DA. Thus, recruitment of new Na(+),K(+)-ATPase molecules into the plasma membrane appears to be a major mechanism by which dopamine increases total cell Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity.
