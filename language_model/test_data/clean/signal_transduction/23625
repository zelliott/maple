Astrocytes are important for protecting neurons in the central nervous system. It has been reported that some antioxidants could protect astrocytes from ischemia/reperfusion-induced dysfunction. Cinnamtannin B-1 is a naturally occurring A-type proanthocyanidin that exhibits anti-oxidant properties. In this study, we investigated the effects of cinnamtannin B-1 on spinal cord astrocytes. Astrocytes were subjected to oxygen-glucose-serum deprivation for eight hours followed by reoxygenation with or without cinnamtannin B-1. We found that cinnamtannin B-1 protected astrocytes from oxygen-glucose-serum deprivation and reoxygenation-induced apoptosis. Concurrently, cinnamtannin B-1 promoted the proliferation of astrocytes whereas the extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) inhibitor reversed this effect. The results indicated that cinnamtannin B-1 protects astrocytes from oxygen-glucose-serum deprivation/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis by promoting astrocyte proliferation via an ERK pathway. Therefore, as an anti-oxidant, cinnamtannin B-1 might provide extra benefit for astrocyte protection during ischemia/reperfusion in the central nervous system.
