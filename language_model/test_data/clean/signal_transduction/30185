We previously showed in rat renal glomerular mesangial cells, that arginine vasopressin (AVP)-stimulated cell proliferation was mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) transactivation, and activation (phosphorylation) of ERK1/2 and p70S6 kinase (Ghosh et al. [2001]: Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 280:F972-F979]. In this paper, we extend these observations and show that different protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms play different roles in mediating AVP-stimulated ERK1/2 and p70S6 kinase phosphorylation and cell proliferation. AVP treatment for 0-60 min stimulated the serine/threonine phosphorylation of PKC isoforms alpha, delta, epsilon, and zeta. The activation of PKC was dependent on EGF-R and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation. In addition, inhibition of conventional and novel PKC isoforms by chronic (24 h) exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibited AVP-induced activation of ERK and p70S6 kinase as well as EGF-R phosphorylation. Rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of PKCdelta, inhibited both ERK and p70S6 kinase phosphorylation and cell proliferation. In contrast, a PKCepsilon translocation inhibitor decreased ERK1/2 activation without affecting p70S6 kinase or cell proliferation, while a dominant negative PKCzeta (K281W) cDNA delayed p70S6 kinase activation without affecting ERK1/2. On the other hand, GÃ¶6976, an inhibitor of conventional PKC isoforms, did not affect p70S6 kinase, but stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation without affecting cell proliferation. Our results indicate that PKCdelta plays an important role in AVP-stimulated ERK and p70S6 kinase activation and cell proliferation.
