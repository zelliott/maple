Stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) activates a set of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases that assist in delivering signals to the cell interior. Among the presumed substrates for these kinases, adaptor proteins, which juxtapose effector enzyme systems with the antigen receptor complex, figure prominently. Previous studies suggested that Lnk, a 38-kDa protein consisting of a single SH2 domain and a region containing potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, might serve to join Grb2, phospholipase C-gamma1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the TCR. To elucidate the physiological roles of Lnk in T cell signal transduction, we isolated the mouse Lnk cDNA, characterized the structure of the mouse Lnk gene, and generated transgenic mice that overproduce Lnk in thymocytes. Here we report that although Lnk becomes phosphorylated during T cell activation, it plays no limiting role in the TCR signaling process. Moreover, we have distinguished p38(Lnk) from the more prominent 36-kDa tyrosine phosphoproteins that appear in activated T cells. Together these studies suggest that Lnk participates in signaling from receptors other than antigen receptors in lymphocytes.
