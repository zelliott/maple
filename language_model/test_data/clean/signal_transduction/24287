The aim of the present study was to identify biochemical pathways driving the resistance of endothelial cells to apoptosis induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). (1) Although nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) was activated by TNF, its inhibition by MG-132 failed to sensitize these cells. (2) The activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol ester completely abolished the TNF-induced cell death. (3) The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin (Wo) triggered apoptosis and enhanced the TNF-induced cell death. (4) The MEK inhibitor PD98059 did not affect the TNF-induced apoptotic process. (5) The p38 is activated by TNF and its inhibition by SB203580 sensitized the cells to TNF. This is correlated with the inhibition of phosphorylation of heat-shock protein of 27 kDa (HSP27). These results indicate that TNF activates NF-kappaB, which does not drive any anti-apoptotic response, and p38, which plays an anti-apoptotic function probably through HSP27 phosphorylation. Moreover, PKC and PI3K are involved in the control of survival pathways.
