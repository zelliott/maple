G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate diverse biological processes in all eukaryotes, including yeast, insects, plants and humans. This evolutionary conservation allows an almost unrestricted interchange of signaling components between different cell types. A large number of model systems have been developed for the study of GPCRs, and yeasts provide one of the more attractive hosts since they are amenable to both genetic and biochemical manipulation, while their robustness, low cost and lack of endogenous GPCRs are ideal starting points for the development of assays suitable for high-throughput screening. The purpose of this review is to introduce readers to the possibilities of using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe for analysis of GPCRs. We describe the endogenous signaling pathways, the development of assays for heterologous GPCRs, and some of the technology available to elucidate GPCR structure and activity.
