Exposure to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin has been demonstrated to cause apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular pathways leading to deltamethrin-induced apoptosis have not been established. To identify these pathways, SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells were exposed to deltamethrin (100 nM-5 μM) for 24-48 h. Deltamethrin produced a time- and dose-dependent increase (21-300%) in DNA fragmentation, an indicator of apoptosis. Data demonstrate that the initiation of DNA fragmentation resulted from interaction of deltamethrin with Na⁺ channels and consequent calcium influx, as tetrodotoxin and the intracellular Ca²⁺ chelator BAPTA-AM completely prevented apoptosis. DNA fragmentation was accompanied by increased caspase-9 and -3 activities and was abolished by specific caspase-9 and -3 inhibitors. However, deltamethrin did not increase cytosolic cytochrome c levels, indicating that the mitochondrial pathway was likely not involved. Additional studies demonstrated that deltamethrin exposure activated caspase-12 activity and that pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knockdown of calpain prevented deltamethrin-induced DNA fragmentation, thus indicating a role for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway. This was confirmed by the observation that inhibition of eIF2α abolished deltamethrin-induced DNA fragmentation. Together, these data demonstrate that deltamethrin causes apoptosis through its interaction with Na⁺ channels, leading to calcium overload and activation of the ER stress pathway. Because ER stress and the subsequent unfolded protein response have been observed in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, these data provide mechanistic information by which high-level exposure to pyrethroids may contribute to neurodegeneration.
