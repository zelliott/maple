Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) can be expanded from different sources. We compared the influence of inflammation and TLR ligation on the phenotype and function of MSC derived from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AT), and Wharton's jelly (WJ). WJ-MSC were featured by a lack of TLR4 expression. While inflammation upregulated TLR3 in all three MSC types, TLR4 upregulation was observed only on BM-MSC. TLR ligation increased the production of inflammatory cytokines in BM- and AT-MSC but not in WJ-MSC and augmented anti-inflammatory cytokines in AT-MSC. Although inflammation increased in all MSC types the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, additional TLR triggering did not have further effect on WJ-MSC. The immunosuppressive potential of WJ-MSC on MLR was affected neither by inflammation nor by TLR triggering. This resistance was related to an overproduction of HGF. These data indicate that MSC source could be of importance while designing immunomodulating cell therapy in transplantation.
