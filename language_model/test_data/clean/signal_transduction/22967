Although farnesylation is required for a number of abscisic acid mediated responses in plants, knowledge of how this lipid modification of proteins regulates specific developmental and physiological processes remains unclear. Recent information from the Arabidopsis genome-sequencing project in combination with mutants deficient in farnesylation should unravel the role(s) of this process in plant signaling.
