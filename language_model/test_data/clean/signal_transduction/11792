CD45R monoclonal antibodies are able to distinguish two different subsets of the CD4 human T cells. This phenotypic split is accompanied by functional diversity. In this report we have analyzed the capabilities of CD45R subsets of CD4 human T cells to use interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-4 as growth factors. We have found that both cell subsets are able to proliferate after stimulation with Sepharose-CD3 in the presence of externally added IL-2 or IL-4. However, the response to IL-4 of CD4CD45RO cells was comparatively lower than the response of CD4CD45RA cells. Both cell subsets showed a good response to Sepharose-CD3 plus adherent cells (AC), but when IL-4 was present in the culture only the CD4CD45RA cells showed an enhancement in the Sepharose-CD3-induced proliferation, while proliferation of the CD4CD45RO T cell subset was inhibited. Similar effects were seen, however, in the response to CD4CD45RA or CD4CD45RO cells to Sepharose-CD3 plus IL-2. Although the precise mechanism of the inhibitory effect of IL-4 is not known, the results obtained suggest that IL-4 could interfere in some way with the signalling of IL-2 to the proliferation of the CD4CD45RO T cell subset.
