Steroid receptor coactivators p300 and CBP are highly expressed in advanced prostate cancer. They potentiate activation of androgen receptor by androgens and anti-androgens. In the present study, we have addressed the question whether these coactivators enhance activity of estrogen receptor-beta (ER-β), which is variably expressed in prostate cancers.

Expression levels of the coactivators p300 and CBP were manipulated by plasmid or siRNA transfections and activity of ER-β was measured by luciferase assays. Viability was measured by MTT assays and cellular migration was determined by wound-healing and Boyden chamber assays.

High expression of ER-β was found in PC3 cells which were used for the experiments. p300 or CBP enhanced activation of ER-β by genistein. Antiestrogens did not acquire agonistic properties in the presence of increased concentrations of either coactivator. Inhibition of p300 or CBP decreased genistein stimulation of ER-β. Genistein reduced migration of PC3 prostate cancer cells and down-regulation of p300 potentiated this effect.

p300 and CBP are implicated in regulation of ER-β activity and cellular migration in prostate cancer. These findings are important for understanding of action of ER-β in carcinoma of the prostate.
