To explore the role of protein kinase C (PKC) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) in the signal transduction cascade in the expression of interleukin-5 (IL-5) by peripheral blood T lymphocytes from allergic rhinitis.

Twenty-five allergic rhinitis patients and twenty-three deflection of nasal septum(DNS) persons in the study. T lymphocytes were isolated and purified from peripheral blood of each person and randomly divided into 3 groups: group A, blank (DNS and AR); group B, PKC excitomotor 12-myristate 13-acetate (DNS PMA and AR PMA); group C , PMA and curcumin (DNS PMA/curcumin and AR PMA/curcumin). ELISA was used to assess the expression of IL-5 in supernatants, and immunocytochemical staining for the activation of AP-1.

The percentage of cells of active AP-1, IL-5 protein in supernatants of allergic rhinitis T lymphocytes stimulated with PMA were significantly higher than those of allergic rhinitis T lymphocytes stimulated without PMA (P < 0.01) and with PMA and curcumin (P < 0.01); than those of deflection of nasal septum T lymphocytes stimulated with PMA (P < 0.01), with PMA and curcumin (P < 0.01) and without PMA. The percentage of cells of active AP-1, IL-5 protein in supernatants of allergic rhinitis T lymphocytes stimulated with PMA and curcumin were significantly lower than those of allergic rhinitis T lymphocytes stimulated with PMA (P < 0.01); but significantly higher than those of allergic rhinitis T lymphocytes stimulated without PMA and those of deflection of nasal septum T lymphocytes stimulated. There were good positive correlation between the percentage of cells of active AP-1 and IL-5 protein in supernatants (r = 0.92, P < 0.01).

AP-1 may participate in the signal transduction of PKC-triggered expression of IL-5 in allergic rhinitis T lymphocytes. This suggests the activation of PKC/AP-1 signal transduction cascade of T lymphocytes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis.
