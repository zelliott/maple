In response to pathophysiological stresses, cardiac myocytes undergo hypertrophic growth or apoptosis. Multiple signalling pathways have been implicated in these responses and among them, kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Akt. However, the distinction between signalling pathways originally believed to be specific for either hypertrophy, apoptosis or cell survival is fading. The existing data, coming from different experimental systems, often are conflicting. In this study, we sought to compare aspects of intracellular signalling activated by diverse stimuli in a single experimental system, adult rat cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, we assessed the role of these stimuli in eliciting a particular cell phenotype, i.e. whether they promote hypertrophy, cell survival or apoptosis. The results demonstrate that the hypertrophic agonist phenylephrine is the most potent activator of MAPKs/mitogen and stress- activated kinase MSK1, although its effect on Akt phosphorylation is relatively minor. The pro-apoptotic concentration of H₂O₂ activates strongly both MAPKs and PI3K/Akt pathways. Insulin-like growth factor-1 has a minimal effect on phosphorylation of MAPKs/MSK1, but it is a potent activator of Akt. In conclusion, hypertrophic, pro-survival or apoptotic stimuli operate through the same signalling pathways with different time course and amplitude of kinase activation. Thus, to determine the effect of different stimuli on cell fate, it is important to assess signalling pathways as a network and not as a single pathway.
