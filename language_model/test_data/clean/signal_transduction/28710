The N-terminal fragment of PTH(1-34) is critical for PTH1 receptor activation. Various modifications of PTH(1-14) have been shown to result in a considerable increase in signaling potency [Shimizu et al. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 21836-21843]. Our structural investigations revealed an unusually stable helical structure of the signaling domain (1-14), where residues 6 (Gln) and 10 (Gln or Asn) were located on the same face of the alpha-helix. To test whether a stable N-terminal alpha-helix is required for productive interaction with PTH1 receptor, we designed two conformationally restricted PTH(1-14) analogues, each containing a lactam bridge at positions 6 and 10. Specifically, substitutions Gln(6)-->Glu(6) and Asn(10)-->Lys(10) were introduced into the most potent [Ala(1,3,12),Gln(10),Har(11),Trp(14)]PTH(1-14)NH2 agonist. Both the Glu(6)-Lys(10) and Lys(6)-Glu(10) lactam-bridged analogues were characterized to examine the importance of orientation of the lactam. According to biological studies [Shimizu et al. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 2282-2290], none of the 6/10 substituted analogues (linear or cyclic) remained as active as the parent peptide. However, relative to their corresponding linear peptides, lactam-bridged analogues either maintained potency or showed 6-fold improvement. High-resolution structures as determined by 1H NMR and NOE-restrained molecular dynamics simulations clearly illustrate the structural differences between the linear and cyclic PTH(1-14) fragments, supporting the hypothesis that an alpha-helix is the preferred bioactive conformation of the N-terminal fragment of PTH. In addition, our results demonstrate that the structural order of the very first residues (1-4) of the signaling domain plays a significant role in PTH action.
