In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 pathway mediates the termination of snoRNAs and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). Both Nrd1 and the Set1 histone H3K4 methyltransferase complex interact with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during early elongation, leading us to test whether these two processes are functionally linked. The deletion of SET1 exacerbates the growth rate and termination defects of nrd1 mutants. Set1 is important for the appropriate recruitment of Nrd1. Additionally, Set1 modulates histone acetylation levels in the promoter-proximal region via the Rpd3L deacetylase and NuA3 acetyltransferase complexes, both of which contain PHD finger proteins that bind methylated H3K4. Increased levels of histone acetylation reduce the efficiency of Nrd1-dependent termination. We speculate that Set1 promotes proper early termination by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 complex by affecting the kinetics of Pol II transcription in early elongation.
