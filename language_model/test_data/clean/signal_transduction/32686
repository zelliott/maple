We analyze in detail the statistical properties of the spike emission process of a canonical integrate-and-fire neuron, with a linear integrator and a lower bound for the depolarization, as often used in VLSI implementations (Mead, 1989). The spike statistics of such neurons appear to be qualitatively similar to conventional (exponential) integrate-and-fire neurons, which exhibit a wide variety of characteristics observed in cortical recordings. We also show that, contrary to current opinion, the dynamics of a network composed of such neurons has two stable fixed points, even in the purely excitatory network, corresponding to two different states of reverberating activity. The analytical results are compared with numerical simulations and are found to be in good agreement.
