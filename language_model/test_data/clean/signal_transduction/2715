Deregulated signaling by the four members of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family (erbB family) is implicated in the genesis or progression of human cancers. However, efforts to analyze signaling by these receptors have been hampered by the diversity of ligands and extensive interreceptor cross talk. We have expressed the four human erbB family receptors, singly and in pairwise combinations, in a pro-B-lymphocyte cell line (Ba/F3) and investigated the range of interactions activated by the epidermal growth factor homology domain of the agonist neuregulin beta. The results provide the first comprehensive analysis of the response of this receptor family to a single peptide agonist. This peptide induced complex patterns of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and regulation of Ba/F3 cell survival and proliferation. These data demonstrate the existence of several previously undocumented receptor interactions driven by neuregulin.
