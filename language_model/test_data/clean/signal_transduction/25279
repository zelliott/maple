The hepatitis B viral X protein (HBx) is known as a transcription factor and potential oncogene. To gain a better view of the effect of HBx on the transcriptional regulation in the human liver cell, we constructed a HepG2 cell line stably expressing HBx (HepG2-HBx), and performed cDNA microarray analysis on 588 cellular cDNAs comparing with untransformed control cells. Two genes (IGFR-2, RhoA) of oncogenes, one gene (p55CDC) of cell cycle regulators, three genes (thrombin receptor, MLK-3, MacMARCKS) of intracellular transducers, one gene (HSP27) of stress response proteins, two genes (FAST kinase, Bak) of apoptosis response proteins, one gene (p21(WAF)) of transcription factors were highly up-regulated; one gene (transcription elongation factor SII) of transcription factors and two genes (monocyte chemotactic protein 1, T-lymphocyte-secreted protein I-309) of growth factors were highly down-regulated. These results showed selective transcriptional regulation by HBx in the human liver cell.
