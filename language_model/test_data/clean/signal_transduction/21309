Diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) is a novel phospholipid that has been found in plants and yeast but not in higher animals. It is produced through phosphorylation of phosphatidic acid (PA) by the novel enzyme PA kinase (PAK). In plants, DGPP is virtually absent in non-stimulated cells but its concentration increases within minutes in response to various stimuli, including osmotic stress and pathogen attack, implying a role in stress signalling. DGPP is broken down by the enzyme DGPP phosphatase (DPP). DPP-encoding genes have been cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DPP1). In S. cerevisiae, the expression of DPP1 is regulated coordinately with the majority of genes encoding enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis.
