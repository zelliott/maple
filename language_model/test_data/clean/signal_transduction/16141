Since 1911 epidemiological evidence indicates that S. haematobium is associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. However, the mechanisms of this interaction are not clearly defined. Using normal epithelial cells, S. haematobium parasite extracts were able to induce cancer-like phenotypes such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and tumorigenesis. The parasite extracts on normal urothelium also presented carcinogenic and mutagenic ability. To further elucidate the biological effects of this parasite, new estrogenic molecules were identified in its extracts. These estrogens are also present in the sera of Schistosoma-infected patients, and they have the ability to repress ER transcriptional activity both in estrogen-responsive MCF7 cells and normal urothelial HCV29 cells. This review will present some of the recent studies of mass spectrometry of S. haematobium extracts and sequence analysis of bladder tissue treated with the same extracts. Finally the molecular and cellular events that might be responsible for schistosomiasis-related bladder cancer will be discussed.
