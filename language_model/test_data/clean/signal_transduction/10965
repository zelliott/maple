The importance of androgen signaling is well recognized for numerous aspects of central nervous system (CNS) function, ranging from sex-specific organization of neuroendocrine and behavioral circuits to adaptive capacity, resistance and repair. Nonetheless, concepts for the therapeutic use of androgens in neurological and mental disorders are far from being established. This review outlines some critical issues which interfere with decisions on the suitability of androgens as therapeutic agents for CNS conditions. Among these, sex-specific organization of neural substrates and resulting differential responsiveness to endogenous gonadal steroids, convergence of steroid hormone actions on common molecular targets, co-presence of different sex steroid receptors in target neuronal populations, and in situ biotransformation of natural androgens apparently pose the principal obstacles for the characterization of specific neurotropic effects of androgens. Additional important, albeit less explored aspects consist in insufficient knowledge about molecular targets in the CNS which are under exclusive or predominant androgen control. Own experimental data illustrate the variability of pharmacological effects of natural and synthetic androgens on CNS functions of adaptive relevance, such as sexual behavior, anxiety and endocrine responsiveness to stress. Finally, we present results from an analysis of the consequences of aging for the rat brain transcriptome and examination of the influence of androgens on differentially expressed genes with presumable significance in neuropathology.
