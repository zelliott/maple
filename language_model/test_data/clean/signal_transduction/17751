The chemokine superfamily consists of small (8-10 kDa) molecules that function to attract, selectively, different subsets of leukocytes. Binding of chemokines to their appropriate G-protein-coupled receptors is necessary for primary immune responses and for homing of leukocytes to lymphoid tissues. Here, we have characterized the signaling pathways in primary T lymphocytes that regulate chemokine gene induction using an RNase protection assay. Dependence on stimulation through the coreceptor CD28 and sensitivity to the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus were studied using purified human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Lymphotactin (Ltn), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, and MIP-1beta were all rapidly induced and sensitive to cyclosporine treatment. At later time points, the expression of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta, but not of Ltn, was restored despite the inhibition of calcineurin activity. By contrast, the induction of interleukin-8 was delayed and was found to be cyclosporine insensitive. Calcineurin activity of IP-10 mRNA induction was contingent on the specific T-cell stimulation conditions, suggesting that IP-10 expression is modulated by calcineurin-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. Differential chemokine expression profiles result from the engagement of T-cell coreceptors and the requirement for, and the dependence on, calcineurin phosphatase activity.
