This review focuses on the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members involved in apoptosis, which is the predominant process controlling cell remodelling during post-lactational mammary gland involution. The members of the Bcl-2 protein family, whose expression levels are under the control of lactogenic hormones, internally control this mechanism also during lactation. They can physically interact with each other, sometimes in an antagonistic manner. Mammary glands undergo repeated cycles of structural development, functional differentiation and regression, therefore provide a unique model for investigating this family of proteins that regulate the fate of the secretory cells and consequently milk yield. The involvement of Bcl-2 family members is reviewed in mammary tissue during morphogenesis, at different stages of lactation cycle and in comparison with dairy and laboratory animals.
