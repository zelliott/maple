Nystedt and co-workers cloned in 1994 a second protease activatable receptor (PAR-2) that could be activated by trypsin but not by thrombin (1). In this study, we investigated whether trypsin induced stimulation of endothelial cells is linked to PAR-2 activation. We have found by mRNA analysis that endothelial cells of venous and arterial origin express both protease activatable receptors. The functional thrombin receptor and the protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) mediate apparently the same effects in human vascular endothelial cells. Both, the activation of the thrombin receptor with thrombin or SFLLRN and the activation of the PAR-2 with trypsin or SLIGRL induced intracellular calcium mobilisation and a subsequent release of von Willebrand factor (vWf) from Weibel-Palade bodies. As a consequence, it can be concluded that endothelial cells have two different receptors mediating the same cellular responses after activation.
