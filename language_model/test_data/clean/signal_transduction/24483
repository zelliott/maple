Chromatin is the physiologically relevant substrate for all genetic processes inside the nuclei of eukaryotic cells. Dynamic changes in the local and global organization of chromatin are emerging as key regulators of genomic function. Indeed, a multitude of signals from outside and inside the cell converges on this gigantic signaling platform. Numerous post-translational modifications of histones, the main protein components of chromatin, have been documented and analyzed in detail. These 'marks' appear to crucially mediate the functional activity of the genome in response to upstream signaling pathways. Different layers of cross-talk between several components of this complex regulatory system are emerging, and these epigenetic circuits are the focus of this review.
