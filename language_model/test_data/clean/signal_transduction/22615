SÃ©zary syndrome (SS) is the leukemic phase of cutaneous T cell lymphoma characterized by the proliferation of clonally derived CD4+ T cells that release cytokines of the Th2 T cell phenotype (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10), whereas Th1 T cell cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma) are markedly depressed as is expression of IL-12, a pivotal cytokine for Th1 cell differentiation. Normal Th1 cells express both the beta 1 and beta 2 chains of the IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) and tyrosine phosphorylate STAT4 in response to IL-12. Th2 T cells express only the IL-12R beta 1 and thus do not tyrosine phosphorylate STAT4 in response to IL-12. To determine whether SS cells are Th2-like at the level of IL-12 signal transduction, we analyzed RNA from seven patients for the presence of message for the IL-12R beta 1 and beta 2 genes using RNase protection assays and assessed whether IL-12 induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of STAT4 by immunoblotting. In PBL from six of seven SS patients tested, beta 2 message was expressed at low to undetectable levels and its expression could not be stimulated by either IFN-alpha or IFN- gamma, which stimulated beta 2 expression in control PBL. The absence of beta 2 expression is further supportive evidence for the Th2 lineage of SS cells. However, unlike normal Th2 cells, SS cells also showed severely reduced levels of STAT4, suggesting that they have a depressed response to any inducer of the STAT4 signal transduction pathway, including IFN-alpha. This is the first observation linking STAT4 gene expression with a human disease and suggests that dysregulation of STAT4 expression may be significant to the development and/or progression of SS.
