The Raf-MEK-ERK signalling pathway controls fundamental cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and survival. It remains enigmatic how this pathway can reliably convert a myriad of extracellular stimuli in specific biological responses. Recent results have shown that the Raf family isoforms A-Raf, B-Raf and Raf-1 have different physiological functions. Here we review how Raf isozyme diversity contributes to the specification of functional diversity, in particular regarding the role of Raf isozymes in cancer.
