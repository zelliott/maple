The accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in Arabidopsis was induced by toxin of Verticillium dahliae (VD-toxin), exogenous salicylic acid (SA) and nitric oxide donor (SNP). The effect of SNP was the most intense. H2O2 level was not increased in Arabidopsis treated with nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (NNA). It was identified with the results of DAB staining of H2O2 accumulates in the leaves of Arabidopsis. H2O2 was cytochemically detected in the cells of epidermal hair and the cell wall of vascular parenchyma cell. The results suggest that H2O2 acts as a second messenger to involve the defenses in Arabidopsis induced by SA and NO signal transduction. The relationship of NO and H2O2 signals was likely closer.
