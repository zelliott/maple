The interferon-inducible protein 202 (p202) has emerged as a key regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. To explore the role of p202 in adipocyte differentiation, p202 mRNA and protein levels in differentiating mouse adipose-derived stem cells (mASCs) were examined, and were found to continuously increase during mASC adipogenesis. The nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of p202 in the differentiation process was also determined. In addition, suppression and overexpression of p202 impaired and enhanced the differentiation process, respectively. Further, results of co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunofluorescence showed the interaction and intracellular co-localization of p202 with C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ at intermediate and/or late differentiation stages. Knockdown of p202 interfered with the elevated expression of C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ. In conclusion, the temporal and spatial profiles of p202 and the observed manner in which p202 affected the expression of these transcription factors provided evidence that p202 plays a role during mASC adipogenesis.
