Thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 6 (TRIP6), also known as zyxin-related protein-1 (ZRP-1), is an adaptor protein that belongs to the zyxin family of LIM proteins. TRIP6 is primarily localized in the cytosol or focal adhesion plaques, and may associate with the actin cytoskeleton. Additionally, it is capable of shuttling to the nucleus to serve as a transcriptional coregulator. Structural and functional analyses have revealed that through multidomain-mediated protein-protein interactions, TRIP6 serves as a platform for the recruitment of a wide variety of signaling molecules involved in diverse cellular responses, such as actin cytoskeletal reorganization, cell adhesion and migration, antiapoptotic signaling, osteoclast sealing zone formation and transcriptional control. Although the physiological functions of TRIP6 remain largely unknown, it has been implicated in cancer progression and telomere protection. Together, these studies suggest that TRIP6 plays multifunctional roles in different cellular responses, and thus may represent a novel target for therapeutic intervention.
