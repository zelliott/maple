At first sight, the nervous and vascular systems seem to share little in common. However, neural and vascular cells not only are anatomically closely tied to each other, but they also utilize and respond to similar classes of signals to establish correct connectivity and wiring of their networks. Recent studies further provide evidence that this neurovascular crosstalk is more important for understanding the molecular basis of neurological disease than originally anticipated. Moreover, neurovascular strategies offer novel therapeutic opportunities for neurodegenerative disorders.
