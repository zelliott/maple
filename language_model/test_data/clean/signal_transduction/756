The insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) has been implicated in breast cancer development acting through insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR), but also through estrogen receptor (ER). The effect of IGF on proteoglycan (PG) synthesis by two human breast cancer epithelial cell lines, the ER-positive MCF-7 and the ER-negative BT-20, was studied alone and in combination with genistein. Both cell lines synthesise hyaluronan (HA), matrix secreted and cell membrane-associated galactosaminoglycan containing proteoglycans (GalAGPGs) and heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in variable amounts. IGF-I affects the synthesis of PGs by BT-20 cells by decreasing the amounts of HA and secreted GalAGPGs and HSPGs and upregulates the expression of cell membrane-associated GalAGPGs and HSPGs. IGF-I exerts this effect on BT-20 cells acting mainly through receptors with protein tyrosine kinase activity (PTK). In contrast, IGF-I stimulates the synthesis of secreted GalAGPGs and HSPGs by MCF-7 cells, exhibiting only a slight suppression on synthesis of cell-associated GalAGPGs and HSPGs. The regulatory effect of IGF-I on PGs distribution in MCF-7 cells is mediated through a mix of pathways, which involves both receptors with PTK activity and PTK-independent signalling. It is suggested that the effects of IGF-I on the synthesis and distribution of PGs by epithelial breast cancer cells also depend on the presence or the absence of ER. The result of the IGF-I action is the balanced biosynthesis between the matrix and cell-associated PGs in both cell lines, approaching a common biosynthetic phenotype.
