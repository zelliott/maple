Accumulating evidence suggests that macrophages function as major effector cells in the pathological process of various human diseases. We examined here the role of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and caspases in the regulation of activation and apoptosis of macrophages. Activation of the human monoblastic leukaemia cell line, U937, by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increased the expression of CD14/CD86, and cytokine production. PMA stimulation also increased the expression of both pro-caspase-8 and pro-caspase-3 in U937, but not apoptosis or intracellular caspase-3 activity. PMA also increased the expression of X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in U937, suggesting an inhibitory action for XIAP on the caspase cascade in PMA-stimulated U937. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed a significant increase of nuclear NF-kappaB activity in PMA-stimulated U937. When a potent NF-kappaB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), was added to U937 cell culture in the presence of PMA, apoptosis was triggered by activation of caspase-3, which was induced by caspase-8 activation. XIAP expression was markedly suppressed in PMA-treated U937 in the presence of PDTC. The inhibitors of caspase-8 and caspase-3 mostly inhibited apoptosis of U937 treated with PMA in the presence of PDTC. Furthermore, a phenotype of U937 treated with PMA and PDTC in the presence of caspase inhibitor was almost identical to that of unstimulated U937. Our results suggest that the signalling pathways involved in the activation and apoptosis of human macrophages could be co-operatively regulated by the use of NF-kappaB and caspase inhibitors, thus enabling the control of macrophage function and number.
