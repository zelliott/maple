Vitamin D (VD) suppresses keratinocyte growth and induces its differentiation by binding to VD receptor. VD increases expression of phopholipase C and involucrin through VD response elements in the promoter. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) recruits mainly DRIP (vitamin D receptor interacting protein) during keratinocyte proliferation, but SRC (steroid receptor coactivator) during differentiation.
