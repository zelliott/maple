The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factors (TRAFs) have emerged as the major signal transducers for the TNF receptor superfamily and the interleukin-1 receptor/Toll-like receptor (IL-1R/TLR) superfamily. TRAFs collectively play important functions in both adaptive and innate immunity. Recent functional and structural studies have revealed the individuality of each of the mammalian TRAFs and advanced our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we examine this functional divergence among TRAFs from a perspective of both upstream and downstream TRAF signal transduction pathways and of signaling-dependent regulation of TRAF trafficking. We raise additional questions and propose hypotheses regarding the molecular basis of TRAF signaling specificity.
