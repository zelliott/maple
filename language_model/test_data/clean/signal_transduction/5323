Recent studies in hematopoietic cells have led to a growing appreciation of the diverse modes of molecular and functional cross-talk between canonical signaling pathways. However, these intersections represent only the tip of the iceberg. Emerging global analytical methods are providing an even richer and more complete picture of the many components that measurably interact in a network manner to produce cellular responses. Here we highlight the pieces in this Focus, emphasize the limitations of the present canonical pathway paradigm, and discuss the value of a systems biology approach using more global, quantitative experimental design and data analysis strategies. Lastly, we urge caution about overly facile interpretation of genome- and proteome-level studies.
