Allergic airway inflammation is a disease in which T helper 2 (Th2) cells have a critical function. The molecular mechanisms controlling Th2 differentiation and function are of paramount importance in biology and immunology. Recently, a network of PB1-containing adapters and kinases has been shown to be essential in this process owing to its function in regulating cell polarity and the activation of critical transcription factors. Here, we show in vivo data showing that T-cell-specific NBR1-deficient mice show impaired lung inflammation and have defective Th2 differentiation ex vivo with alterations in T-cell polarity and the selective inhibition of Gata3 and nuclear factor of activated T c1 activation. These results establish NBR1 as a novel PB1 adapter in Th2 differentiation and asthma.
