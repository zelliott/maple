In the present study we have investigated a possible role for the proline-rich SH2 domain protein Shb as a regulator of expression or activity of certain SH3 domain proteins and MAP kinase. The expression of the Shb binding proteins Eps8, Src, and p85 PI3-kinase, PI3-kinase activity, and MAP kinase activation were assessed in wild-type NIH3T3 cells and in NIH3T3 cells overexpressing the Shb cDNA. In addition, the expression of the SH3 domain STAT1 proteins was assessed in wild-type and Shb overexpressing cells. The Eps8 protein content and Eps8 mRNA steady-state levels were downregulated, whereas the protein contents of Src and p85 PI3-kinase were unaffected by Shb overexpression. There was, however, an increased basal PI3-kinase activity in Shb transfected cells after a 3-h serum starvation. Increased steady-state levels of STAT1 mRNA were accompanied by an increased STAT1 protein content in Shb overexpressing cells. Shb overexpression was not associated with an altered activation of p44 or p42 MAP kinases in response to PDGF stimulation. The data presented in this study suggest novel functions for the adaptor protein Shb regulating the expression of certain signal-transducing SH3 domain proteins and modulating PI3-kinase activity.
