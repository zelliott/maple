Omi/HtrA2 is a mitochondrial serine protease that is released into the cytosol during apoptosis and promotes cytochrome c (Cyt c)dependent caspase activation by neutralizing inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) via its IAP-binding motif. The protease activity of Omi/HtrA2 also contributes to the progression of both apoptosis and caspase-independent cell death. In this study, we found that wild-type Omi/HtrA2 is more effective at caspase activation than a catalytically inactive mutant of Omi/HtrA2 in response to apoptotic stimuli, such as UV irradiation or tumor necrosis factor. Although similar levels of Omi/HtrA2 expression, XIAP-binding activity, and Omi/HtrA2 mitochondrial release were observed among cells transfected with catalytically inactive and wild-type Omi/HtrA2 protein, XIAP protein expression after UV irradiation was significantly reduced in cells transfected with wild-type Omi/HtrA2. Recombinant Omi/HtrA2 was observed to catalytically cleave IAPs and to inactivate XIAP in vitro, suggesting that the protease activity of Omi/HtrA2 might be responsible for its IAP-inhibiting activity. Extramitochondrial expression of Omi/HtrA2 indirectly induced permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and subsequent Cyt c-dependent caspase activation in HeLa cells. These results indicate that protease activity of Omi/HtrA2 promotes caspase activation through multiple pathways.
