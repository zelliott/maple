There has been a rapid increase in the amount of information on the physiological and pathophysiological roles of nitric oxide (NO) in the brain. This molecule, which is formed by the constitutive isoforms of NO synthase, endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS), plays an obligatory role in the regulation of cerebral blood flow and cell viability and in the protection of nerve cells or fibres against pathogenic factors associated with Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, seizures, and migraine. Cerebral blood flow is impaired by decreased formation of NO from endothelial cells, autonomic nitrergic nerves, or brain neurons and also by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The NO-ROS interaction is an important topic in discussing blood flow and cell viability in the brain. Excessive production of NO by inducible NOS (iNOS) and nNOS in the brain participates in neurotoxicity. Recent studies on brain circulation have provided useful information about the involvement of impaired NO availability or uncontrolled NO production in cerebral pathogenesis, including Alzheimer's disease, seizures, vascular headaches, and inflammatory disorders. Insight into the role of NO in the brain will contribute to our better understanding of cerebral hemodynamic dysfunction and will aid in developing novel therapeutic measures in diseases of the central nervous system.
