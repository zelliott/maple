The molecular changes induced by alemtuzumab following binding of CD52 on B tumor cells were investigated. Alemtuzumab alone had no detectable impact on cell signaling but cross-linking of alemtuzumab on the surface of B tumor lines with anti-human Fc antibodies induced a transient Ca(2+) flux followed by phosphorylation of several kinases involved in stress and survival pathways, and expression of associated proteins including TNF-α. Cross-linking of alemtuzumab also induced capping and caspase-dependent apoptosis of the tumor lines. When using primary cells from B-CLL patients, alemtuzumab alone was capable of inducing protein phosphorylation and apoptosis through the cross-linking of alemtuzumab by FcγRIIb receptors on B-CLL cells. Apoptosis was prevented by blocking of FcγRIIb receptors with anti-CD32 antibody. Overall, our results indicate that cross-linking of alemtuzumab on B tumor cells can occur naturally through Fc receptor interaction and leads to the activation of specific cellular pathways and induction of apoptosis.
