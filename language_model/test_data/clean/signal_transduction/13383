Synchronized development of the embryo to the active stage of the blastocyst, differentiation of the uterus to the receptive state, and a "cross talk" between the blastocyst and uterine luminal epithelium are essential to the process of implantation. In spite of considerable accumulation of information and the present state of the knowledge, our understanding of the definitive mechanisms that regulate these events remains elusive. Although there are species variations in the process of implantation, many basic similarities do exist among various species. This review focuses on specific aspects of the implantation process in mice with the hope that many of the findings will be relevant to the process in humans. To establish signaling mechanisms of embryo-uterine interactions during implantation, studies on both embryonic and uterine consequences are required to generate more meaningful information. Due to ethical restriction and experimental limitation, it is difficult to generate such information in humans. This review has attempted to provide a comprehensive, but not complete, narration of a number of embryonic and uterine factors that are involved in the process of implantation in autocrine, paracrine, and/or juxtacrine manners in mice at the physiological, cellular, molecular, and genetic levels.
