Treatment of bone marrow progenitor cells (BMPC) with zidovudine (AZT) at various concentrations (0.5 to 20 microM) in vitro for 24 hr caused a concentration-dependent decrease in erythropoietin (Epo) receptor expression. The decrease in Epo receptors correlated with a decline in mRNA levels of the receptor. These results suggest that AZT-induced down-regulation of Epo receptor expression followed by loss of Epo-receptor mediated signal transduction is a significant contributory factor to AZT-induced erythroid toxicity.
