In a survey, the analytical tools to characterise and optimise properties and stabilities of interfaces in thin film biosensors are discussed. After an introduction to microscopic and spectroscopic techniques and different transducers, case studies are presented. They concern bioaffinity sensors with particular emphasis on biomimetic recognition structures, catalytic sensors, transmembrane sensors, cell sensors, and the ambitious goal of addressing individual biomolecular function units.
