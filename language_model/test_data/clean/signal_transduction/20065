Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease with a strong inflammatory component. Here we confirm the existence of a critical imbalance in the ratio of Th17 to Treg-cell populations in peripheral CD4(+)  T cells from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which favors inflammation. This was concurrent with increased IL-17 production from the CD4(+) CD45RA(-) FOXP3(lo)  Treg-cell subset, and elevated osteopontin (OPN) levels in serum from ACS patients. We demonstrate a direct effect of OPN in serum from ACS patients on increased IL-17 production by CD4(+) CD45RA(-) FOXP3(lo)  T cells, mediated through recruitment of the OPN receptors CD29 and CD44, and dependent on STAT3 and the nuclear hormone receptor retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) pathway, but not IL-6 production. To our knowledge and beyond the disease context of ACS, this study constitutes the first demonstration of a critical role for OPN in the positive regulation of inflammation through increased IL-17 production by CD4(+) CD45RA(-) FOXP3(lo)  cells.
