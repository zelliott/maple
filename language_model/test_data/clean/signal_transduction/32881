Dopamine binding sites of D1 and D2/D3 subtypes had been detected in the rat peripheral olfactory system and postulated to account for dopamine-dependent enhancement of olfactory memory and retro-inhibition of olfactory input within the olfactory bulb, respectively. We further assessed, in the present study, the mechanisms of these dopamine actions by using adenylyl cyclase activity assay and [35S]GTP radioautography in rat olfactory bulb and mucosa. The D1 agonist SKF 38393 increased adenylyl cyclase activity on membranes of the olfactory bulb, but not on those of the olfactory mucosa. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by SKF 38393 in the olfactory bulb was dose dependent, with a half-maximal effect (EC50) at 0.16 microM SKF 38393, reaching 40% over basal adenylyl cyclase activity, and was blocked by the D1 antagonist SCH 23390. The D2 agonists bromocriptine and quinpirole inhibited both basal and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities in the olfactory bulb and mucosa. These adenylyl cyclase inhibitions were dose dependent, with EC50 values of 0.1-0.3 microM for bromocriptine and 1-3 microM for quinpirole, equal to 25% of basal enzyme activity at concentrations of 1-10 microM, and were blocked by the D2 antagonist eticlopride. The D2 antagonist was devoid of any effect on basal and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities in the olfactory bulb and mucosa. Odorant-induced stimulation of adenylyl cyclase was blocked by D2 agonist in olfactory mucosa membranes, which suggests dopaminergic regulation of odor detection in the olfactory mucosa. By using microdissected fractions of the olfactory mucosa, D2 agonist-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was shown to occur only in lamina propria, thus co-localizing with D2 binding sites. [35S]GTP radioautography on tissue sections revealed D2 agonist-induced G-protein activation in olfactory nerve and glomerular layers of the olfactory bulb, and in the chorion of the olfactory mucosa. Taken together, these data demonstrate functional coupling of the dopamine receptors with adenylyl cyclase in both the olfactory bulb and mucosa, and document novel aspects of dopamine's physiological involvement in olfaction and of D2-mediated signal transduction.
