There is a strong indication that epithelial keratinocytes in cholesteatoma are protected against apoptosis. The late terminal differentiation program in cholesteatoma epithelium is disturbed.

Previously, minimal apoptosis has been demonstrated in cholesteatoma epithelium. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt/PKB) and the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling transduction pathways have been reported to protect epithelial cells against apoptosis. Both pathways have also been proven to regulate late terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. In cholesteatoma epithelium, MAPK activation has been shown to be associated with terminal differentiation. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether in human cholesteatoma epithelium protection against programmed cell death by means of PI3K/Akt survival signaling is present and associated with MAPK activation and terminal differentiation.

Fifteen human cholesteatoma and patient-matched retro-auricular skin samples were immunohistochemically stained for pAkt/PKB, phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase1/2 (pERK1/2), phosphorylated JNK/SAPK, phosphorylated p38, involucrin and filaggrin. Positive cells were counted by computer-assisted digital image analysis.

Protein expressions of pAkt/PKB, pERK1/2, pp38, and involucrin in cholesteatoma epithelium were significantly increased when compared with retro-auricular skin (p<0.01). Filaggrin expression was significantly decreased (p=0.03). The positive correlation was confirmed between both pERK1/2 and pp38, and involucrin (p < or = 0.05).
