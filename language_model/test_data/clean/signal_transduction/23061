The hypothalamic decapeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulates mobilization of two discrete pools of calcium in clonal (alphaT3-1) and primary pituitary gonadotropes. A multidisciplinary approach was implemented to investigate the effects of discrete calcium fluctuations on the signaling pathways linking the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and immediate early genes. Blockade of calcium influx through nifedipine-sensitive voltage-gated calcium channels reduced buserelin-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Fos while activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and c-Jun was unaffected. Inhibition of buserelin-stimulated ERK activity by nifedipine was also observed in rat pituitary cells in primary culture. Direct activation of alphaT3-1 cell L-type calcium channels with the agonist Bay-K 8644 resulted in phosphorylation of ERK and induction of c-Fos. However, simple voltage-induced channel activation did not produce a sufficient calcium signal, since depolarization with 35 mM KCl failed to induce activation of ERK. Depletion of intracellular calcium stores with thapsigargin did not affect buserelin-induced ERK activation. An inhibitor of protein kinase C decreased calcium influx through nifedipine-sensitive calcium channels and phosphorylation of ERK induced by buserelin. Pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase C did not block Bay-K 8644-induced ERK activation. These observations suggest that calcium influx through L-type channels is required for GnRH-induced activation of ERK and c-Fos and that the influence of calcium lies downstream of protein kinase C.
