The alpha1,2-mannosidase Mns1p involved in the N-glycosidic pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a type II membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. The localization of Mns1p depends on retrieval from the Golgi through a mechanism that involves Rer1p. A chimera consisting of the transmembrane domain of Mns1p fused to the catalytic domain of the Golgi alpha1,2-mannosyltransferase Kre2p was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum of Deltapep4 cells and in the vacuoles of rer1/Deltapep4 by indirect immunofluorescence. The split-ubiquitin system was used to determine if there is an interaction between Mns1p and Rer1p in vivo. Co-expression of NubG-Mns1p and Rer1p-Cub-protein A-lexA-VP16 in L40 yeast cells resulted in cleavage of the reporter molecule, protein A-lexA-VP16, detected by western blot analysis and by expression of beta-galactosidase activity. Sec12p, another endoplasmic reticulum protein that depends on Rer1p for its localization, also interacted with Rer1p using the split-ubiquitin assay, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum protein Ost1p showed no interaction. A weak interaction was observed between Alg5p and Rer1p. These results demonstrate that the transmembrane domain of Mns1p is sufficient for Rer1p-dependent endoplasmic reticulum localization and that Mns1p and Rer1p interact. Furthermore, the split-ubiquitin system demonstrates that the C-terminal of Rer1p is in the cytosol.
