Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has been implicated in many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Its role in pain, however, is under-appreciated. This may in part be due to the challenges involved in approaching the target from a therapeutic stand point. The scope of this brief review is to understand the direct and indirect roles of IL-1β in contributing to different pain states including inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and discuss approaches to block IL-1β production or IL-1β-receptor interactions.
