Traditional Chinese medicine, a rich source of potent cancer chemopreventive             agents, is attracting increasing attention worldwide. Recently, the anticancer             activity of Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) has been widely investigated.             However, the mechanisms are not yet fully understood. This study aimed to elucidate             the inhibitory effect of Huaier extract on angiogenesis and tumor growth. Incubation             with Huaier extract inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial             cells (HUVECs) and mouse mammary tumor cells (4T1). In addition, treatment with             Huaier extract decreased the motility and tube formation of HUVECs in a dose-dependent             manner in vitro. As determined by western blot analysis, Huaier extract dose-dependently             decreased the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK),             transcription factor p65, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), signal transducer and             activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and the expression of vascular endothelial             growth factor (VEGF). In ex vivo experiments, new vessel growth was suppressed             as shown by chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and rat aortic ring assays             in the presence of Huaier extract. To further evaluate the inhibitory effect,             4T1 cells were injected subcutaneously into BALB/c mice. The administration of             Huaier extract suppressed tumor volume, decreased microvessel density and induced             apoptosis. These data suggest that Huaier extract may serve as a potent anti-angiogenic             and antitumor agent.
