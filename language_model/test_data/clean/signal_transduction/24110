High density lipoprotein (HDL) activates endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), leading to increased production of the antiatherogenic molecule NO. A variety of stimuli regulate eNOS activity through signaling pathways involving Akt kinase and/or mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. In the present study, we investigated the role of kinase cascades in HDL-induced eNOS stimulation in cultured endothelial cells and COS M6 cells transfected with eNOS and the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor B-I. HDL (10-50 microg/ml, 20 min) caused eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179, and dominant negative Akt inhibited both HDL-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the enzyme. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) inhibition or dominant negative PI3 kinase also blocked the phosphorylation and activation of eNOS by HDL. Studies with genistein and PP2 showed that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Src, is an upstream stimulator of the PI3 kinase-Akt pathway in this paradigm. In addition, HDL activated MAP kinase through PI3 kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibition fully attenuated eNOS stimulation by HDL without affecting Akt or eNOS Ser-1179 phosphorylation. Conversely, dominant negative Akt did not alter HDL-induced MAP kinase activation. These results indicate that HDL stimulates eNOS through common upstream, Src-mediated signaling, which leads to parallel activation of Akt and MAP kinases and their resultant independent modulation of the enzyme.
