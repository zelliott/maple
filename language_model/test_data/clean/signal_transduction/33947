Our recent study identified 2,261 dysregulated genes in the esophagi of rats that received a 1-week exposure to the carcinogen N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA). We further reported that 1,323 of these genes were positively modulated to near-normal levels of expression in NMBA-treated animals that consumed dietary phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a constituent of cruciferous vegetables. Herein, we report our results with companion animals that were fed a diet containing 5% freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) instead of PEITC. We found that 462 of the 2,261 NMBA-dysregulated genes in rat esophagus were restored to near-normal levels of expression by BRB. Further, we have identified 53 NMBA-dysregulated genes that are positively modulated by both PEITC and BRB. These 53 common genes include genes involved in phase I and II metabolism, oxidative damage, and oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that regulate apoptosis, cell cycling, and angiogenesis. Because both PEITC and BRB maintain near-normal levels of expression of these 53 genes, their dysregulation during the early phase of NMBA-induced esophageal cancer may be especially important in the genesis of the disease.
