Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) is a major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Although it interacts with many types of cells and is linked to numerous events associated with sepsis and endotoxic shock, the mechanisms underlying these actions are poorly understood. We found that Ca-signaling induced by endotoxin in guinea-pig neutrophils and macrophages is caused by cross-recognition of LPS with platelet activating factor (PAF) receptors. However, the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha or the priming effect of O2- production was not affected by PAF antagonists. Thus, at least two distinct pathways are involved in the actions of LPS, one via the PAF receptor, while the other is independent of a PAF receptor and Ca-signaling.
