Ceramide has been implicated as an intermediate in the signal transduction of several cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Both ceramide and TNF activate a wide variety of cellular responses, including NF-kappaB, AP-1, JNK, and apoptosis. Whether ceramide transduces these signals through the same mechanism as TNF is not known. In the present study we investigated the role of the T cell-specific tyrosine kinase p56(lck) in ceramide- and TNF-mediated cellular responses by comparing the responses of Jurkat T cells with JCaM1 cells, isogeneic Lck-deficient T cells. Treatment with ceramide activated NF-kappaB, degraded IkappaBalpha, and induced NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression in a time-dependent manner in Jurkat cells but not in JCaM1 cells, suggesting the critical role of p56(lck) kinase. These effects were specific to ceramide, as activation of NF-kappaB by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, lipopolysaccharide, H(2)O(2), and TNF was minimally affected. p56(lck) was also found to be required for ceramide-induced but not TNF-induced AP-1 activation. Similarly, ceramide activated the protein kinases JNK and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase in Jurkat cells but not in JCaM1 cells. Ceramide also induced cytotoxicity and activated caspases and reactive oxygen intermediates in Jurkat cells but not in JCaM1 cells. Ceramide activated p56(lck) activity in Jurkat cells. Moreover, the reconstitution of JCaM1 cells with p56(lck) tyrosine kinase reversed the ceramide-induced NF-kappaB activation and cytotoxicity. Overall our results demonstrate that p56(lck) plays a critical role in the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, JNK, and apoptosis by ceramide but has minimal or no role in activation of these responses by TNF.
