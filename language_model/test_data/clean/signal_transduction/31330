The present review will describe progress in the utilization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in the treatment of nonsmall-cell lung cancer and the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Recent findings regarding clinical activity as well as markers associated with sensitivity to these agents will be reviewed.

The EGFR pathway plays a crucial role in human carcinogenesis by contributing to relevant processes in tumor development and progression, including cell proliferation, differentiation, regulation of apoptotic cell death, metastatic potential, and blood vessel formation. Anti-EGFR agents include monoclonal antibodies that target the EGFR extracellular receptor domain, and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target the EGFR intracellular domain. Both strategies have demonstrated encouraging results as monotherapies and in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in areodigestive malignancies.

These dramatic successes have led to further clinical studies of EGFR targeted therapy in aerodigestive malignancies, making a significant impact on the clinical care of patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
