The physiological effects of a drug depend not only on its molecular structure but also on the time-pattern of its administration. One of the main reasons for the importance of temporal patterns in drug action is biological rhythms--particularly those of circadian period. These rhythms affect most physiological functions as well as drug metabolism, clearance, and dynamic processes that may alter drug availability and target cell responsiveness with reference to biological time. We present an overview of the importance of time-patterned signals in physiology focused on the insights provided by a modeling approach. We first discuss examples of pulsatile intercellular communication by hormones such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signals in Dictyostelium amoebae. Models based on reversible receptor desensitization account in both cases for the existence of optimal patterns of pulsatile signaling. Turning to circadian rhythms, we examine how models can be used to account for the response of 24h patterns to external stimuli such as light pulses or gene expression, and to predict how to restore the physiological characteristics of altered rhythms. Time-patterned treatments of cancer involve two distinct lines of research. The first, currently evaluated in clinical trials, relies on circadian chronomodulation of anticancer drugs, while the second, mostly based on theoretical studies, involves a resonance phenomenon with the cell-cycle length. We discuss the implications of modeling studies to improve the temporal patterning of drug administration.
