Atherosclerotic vascular disease is the consequence of a chronic inflammatory process, and prolactin has been shown to be a component of the inflammatory response. Additionally, recent studies indicate that prolactin contributes to an atherogenic phenotype. We hypothesized that this may be the result of a direct effect of prolactin on atherogenesis through activation of the prolactin receptor. Human carotid atherosclerotic plaques were obtained from patients by endarteriectomies. The mRNA of prolactin receptor, but not of prolactin, was detected in these atherosclerotic plaques by quantitative real-time PCR. In situ hybridization confirmed the expression of the prolactin receptor in mononuclear cells. Analysis at the protein level using immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the prolactin receptor was abundantly present in macrophages near the lipid core and shoulder regions of the plaques. Our findings demonstrate that the prolactin receptor is present in macrophages of the atherosclerotic plaque at sites of most prominent inflammation. We therefore propose that prolactin receptor signaling contributes to the local inflammatory response within the atherosclerotic plaque and thus to atherogenesis.
