IL-7 signals are crucial for the survival of naive and memory T cells, and the IL-7R is expressed on the surface of these cells. Following viral infection, the IL-7R is expressed on only a subset of effector CD8 T cells, and has been demonstrated to be important for the survival of these memory precursors. IL-7 message levels remain relatively constant during the T cell response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, but a short-lived burst of GM-CSF is observed soon after infection. Retroviral expression of a chimeric GM-CSF/IL-7R, in which binding of GM-CSF by T cells leads to IL-7 signaling, allows for the delivery of an IL-7 signal in all effector T cells expressing the receptor. In mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, CD8 and CD4 T cells transduced with this chimeric receptor underwent an enhanced proliferative response compared with untransduced populations in the same host. Similarly, TCR transgenic CD8 cells expressing the chimeric receptor produced higher effector numbers during the peak of the T cell response to infection. Surprisingly, the enhanced proliferation did not lead to higher memory numbers, as the subsequent contraction phase was more pronounced in the transduced cell populations. These findings demonstrate that artificial IL-7 signaling during an infection leads to significantly increased Ag-specific effector T cell numbers, but does not result in increased numbers of memory progeny. The extent of contraction may be dictated by intrinsic factors related to the number of prior cell divisions.
