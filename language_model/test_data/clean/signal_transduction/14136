MicroRNAs (miRNA) can regulate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Here, we show that miR-338-3p is down-regulated in metastatic tumor tissues compared to primary tumors, and that that miR-338-3p can inhibit cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest, as well as restrain cell migration and invasion. PREX2a is confirmed as a direct target of miR-338-3p. Knockdown of PREX2a inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion through the PTEN/Akt pathway. miR-338-3p-dependent inhibition of proliferation and invasion can be rescued by PREXa. Overall, this study demonstrates that miR-338-3p affects the PTEN/Akt pathway by down-regulating PREX2a. This newly identified function of miR-338-3p provides novel insights into neuroblastoma and may foster therapeutic applications.
