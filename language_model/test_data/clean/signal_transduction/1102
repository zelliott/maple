Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is distinguished from other acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) by cytogenetic, clinical, as well as biological characteristics. The hallmark of APL is the t(15;17), which leads to the expression of the PML/RARalpha fusion protein. PML/RARalpha is the central leukemia-inducing lesion in APL and is directly targeted by all trans retinoic acid (t-RA) as well as by arsenic, both compounds able to induce complete remissions. This review focuses on potential stem cell involvement in APL outlining the knowledge about the APL-initiating stem cell and the influence of PML/RARalpha on the biology of the hematopoietic stem cell. Moreover, the importance of the blockage of t-RA signaling by the PML/RARalpha for the pathogenesis of APL is discussed, taking the relevance of the t-RA signaling pathway for the global hematopoiesis into account.
