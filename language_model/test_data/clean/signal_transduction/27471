Hippocampal levels of fatty acids extracted from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), free fatty acids (FFA), and lactate were measured after central fluid percussion traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats. At 5 min after injury, there was a decrease in fatty acids extracted from PIP2 suggesting a decrease in PIP2. At the same time point, total FFA increased in saline-treated TBI rats. Levels of arachidonic acid were significantly decreased in PIP2, while at the same time arachidonic and stearic acids increased in FFA in saline-treated TBI rats. No significant alterations in PIP2-derived fatty acids or FFA were observed at 20 min after TBI. Hippocampal concentrations of lactate were significantly elevated at 5 and 20 min after injury in saline-treated rats. In general, these alterations were blunted by preinjury administration of the muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine. These results suggest that the PIP2 signal transduction pathway is activated in the hippocampus at the onset of central fluid percussion TBI and that the enhanced phospholipase C-catalyzed phosphodiestric breakdown of PIP2 is a major mechanism of liberation of FFA in these sites immediately after such injury. The blunting of PIP2 and FFA alterations in animals treated with scopolamine suggests that activation of muscarinic receptors significantly contributes to the phospholipase C (PLC) signal transduction pathophysiology in TBI. The attenuation of lactate accumulation in scopolamine-treated rats suggests that TBI-induced muscarinic receptor activation also contributes to increased glycolytic metabolism and/or ionic imbalances.
