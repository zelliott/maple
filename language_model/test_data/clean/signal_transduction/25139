The crosstalk between 3', 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), intracellular calcium, and histamine release in rat mast cells using the stimulatory effect of three different drugs, thapsigargin, sodium fluoride (NaF), and compound 48/80 were studied. Each of these drugs induces histamine release by different mechanisms. The transducting pathways modulating cAMP and intracellular calcium levels were modified by using, cholera toxin (CTX) which ADP-rybosylates Gs-protein, pertussis toxin (PTX) which ADP-rybosylates Gi-protein, and okadaic acid (OA) which inhibits phosphatases 1 and 2a. Our results show that CTX increased cAMP levels and inhibited histamine release elicited by thapsigargin and compound 48/80. The inhibitory effect of CTX on histamine release was potentiated by OA in the presence of compound 48/80 but was decreased in the presence of thapsigargin. Calcium uptake was stimulated by NaF and compound 48/80. The previous treatment with OA increased calcium uptake when combined with compound 48/80 but not with NaF. Treatment with NaF highly stimulated calcium uptake and cAMP levels only when combined with OA and CTX. These results suggest that the modulatory effect of intracellular calcium and cAMP on histamine release depend more on the crosstalk of the activated signal transducting pathway than on the final level of calcium or cAMP, further supporting the theory that rat mast cells are divided into functionally distinct compartments.
