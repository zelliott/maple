Immune receptors are coupled to the activation of phosphatidylcholine phospholipase D (PC-PLD) that hydrolyses phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid and choline. As these receptors are also coupled to other signalling cascades, it has been difficult to define the precise cell activation events resulting from PLD activation in the absence of specific inhibitors. There is increasing evidence that phosphatidic acid acts as an intracellular signalling molecule regulating release of calcium from intracellular stores, sphingosine kinase and protein kinase C activation and membrane budding. Phosphatidic acid can also be rapidly converted into lysophosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol and arachidonates.
