Recent studies from our laboratory and others have shown that increases in cytoplasmic superoxide (O(2)(·-)) levels and Akt activation play a key role in agonist-stimulated NF-κB activation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that adenovirus (Ad)-mediated intramyocardial gene transfer of cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase (AdCu/ZnSOD) or a dominant-negative form of Akt (AdDNAkt) in mice would attenuate pressure overload-induced increases in activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-κB and cardiac hypertrophy. Adult C57BL/6 mice were subjected to thoracic aortic banding (TAB) or sham surgery, and intramyocardial injections of viral vectors (AdCu/ZnSOD, AdDNAkt, or control) were performed. There was robust transgene expression in the heart, which peaked 6-7 days after injection and then declined to undetectable levels by 12-14 days. In mice injected with AdBgL II, TAB caused a significant increase in O(2)(·-) generation and cardiac mass at 1 wk, and these responses were markedly attenuated by AdCu/ZnSOD. In addition, TAB induced time-dependent activation of NF-κB in the myocardium as measured longitudinally by in vivo bioluminescent imaging of NF-κB-dependent luciferase expression. This was also abolished by intracardiac AdCu/ZnSOD or AdDNAkt, but not the control vector. The inhibition of Akt and O(2)(·-)-mediated NF-κB activation in TAB hearts was associated with an attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy. Since a direct cause-and-effect relationship between NF-κB activation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy has been established previously, our data support the hypothesis that increased O(2)(·-) generation and Akt activation are key signaling intermediates in pressure overload-induced activation of NF-κB and cardiac hypertrophy.
