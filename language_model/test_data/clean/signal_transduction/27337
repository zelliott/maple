The application of molecular biological tools to the study of cancer has significantly advanced the field of human cancer research. Such study has demonstrated the involvement of two classes of highly conserved cellular genes in the malignant transformation process: oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Despite these advances in the molecular biology of human cancers, our understanding of human oral cancer lags behind that of cancer of other body sites. This review attempts to assess the current status of the molecular biology of human oral cancer.
