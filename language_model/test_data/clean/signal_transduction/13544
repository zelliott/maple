Treatment of rat glioma C6 cells with a beta-adrenergic agonist leads to a rise in cAMP level and a subsequent change in cell morphology from an epithelial to an astrocyte type of appearance. This morphological change is reverted by the addition of thrombin. In 10-15 min the cells acquire their normal epithelial morphology. The reversion by thrombin is inhibited by hirudin, but not by antithrombin III (an inhibitor of the proteolytic action of thrombin). Using the intracellular Ca2(+)-indicator fura-2, we observed that the addition of thrombin to the glioma cells generated a Ca2(+)-signal which was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with hirudin or with 1 mM neomycin. These results suggest that thrombin uses the phospholipid-inositol pathway to counteract the morphological response, which was induced by activation of the cAMP pathway.
