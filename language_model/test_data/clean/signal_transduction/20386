Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), especially expressed on monocytes/macrophages, connects microbial and sterile innate immune activation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria and several endogenous molecules, among others saturated fatty acids (SFAs), are able to induce signalling through this receptor. Downstream inflammatory cytokines orchestrate the immune response. Our aim was to investigate how long-lasting multifactorial stress affects Gram-negative signalling and search for possible correlations between cytokine production and TLR4 expression or SFA concentration.

Eight healthy males were studied during a 7-day ranger-training course with semi-continuous physical strain, together with energy and sleep restrictions. Blood drawn on days 0, 3, 5 and 7 was incubated ex vivo for 6 h with or without LPS 10 ng/mL, whereupon surface expression of TLR4 on CD14⁺ monocytes and supernatant concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) were measured. In addition, plasma free fatty acids were quantified.

Monocyte TLR4 expression was elevated throughout the course (p < 0.05 vs. baseline). Corresponding results were found for SFAs. The concentration of TNF-α increased significantly on day 3 and thereafter normalized, and a similar pattern was seen for IL-1β. No correlations were found between cytokine concentrations and monocyte TLR4 expression or plasma SFAs.

Multifactorial stress significantly affected ex vivo production of TNF-α and monocyte surface expression of TLR4. In addition, mobilization of fat resulted in increased plasma concentrations of SFAs. No associations between inflammatory cytokines and monocyte TLR4 expression or SFAs were found.
