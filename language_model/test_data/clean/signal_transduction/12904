Mutations to Pax3 and other Pax family genes in both mice and humans result in numerous tissue-specific morphological defects. Little is known, however, about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Pax genes regulate morphogenesis. We previously showed that Pax3 induces cell aggregation and a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in Saos-2 cells. We show here that Pax3-induced aggregates arise through the formation of distinct structures involving cell rearrangements and cell behaviors resembling those that occur during gastrulation and neurulation known as convergent extension. During these Pax3-induced processes, Dishevelled and Frizzled are localized to the actin cytoskeleton and both proteins coimmunoprecipitate focal adhesion components from detergent-insoluble cell fractions. We show further that these Pax3-induced cell movements are associated with activation of a Wnt-signaling cascade, resulting in induction and activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase/stress activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK). All of these Wnt-signaling factors exhibit altered subcellular distribution in Pax3-expressing cells. In particular, we show the localization of JNK/SAPK to both the nucleus and to cytoplasmic multi-vesicular structures. These data show that Pax3 regulates morphogenetic cell behavior and that regulation of a conserved, planar cell polarity/noncanonical Wnt-signaling cascade entailing JNK activation is a function of Pax3 activity.
