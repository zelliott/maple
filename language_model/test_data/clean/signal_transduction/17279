Citronellal is a monoterpene present in the oil of many species, including Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt (Poaceae).

The present study investigated the effect of citronellal on inflammatory nociception induced by different stimuli and examined the involvement of the NO-cGMP-ATP-sensitive K⁺ channel pathway.

We used male Swiss mice (n = 6 per group) that were treated intraperitoneally with citronellal (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg) 0.5 h after the subplantar injection of 20 μl of carrageenan (CG; 300 µg/paw), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; 100 pg/paw), prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂; 100 ng/paw) or dopamine (DA; 30 μg/paw). The mechanical nociception was evaluated at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 h after the injection of the agents, using a digital analgesimeter (von Frey). The effects of citronellal were also evaluated in the presence of L-NAME (30 mg/kg) or glibenclamide (5 mg/kg).

At all times, citronellal in all doses inhibited the development of mechanical nociception induced by CG (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01) and TNF-α (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, and p < 0.05). The citronellal was able to increase the pain threshold in the DA test (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, and p < 0.05) and in the PGE₂ test at all times (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05). L-NAME and glibenclamide reversed the antinociceptive effects of the citronellal at higher doses in the PGE₂ test.

These data suggest that citronellal attenuated mechanical nociception, mediated in part by the NO-cGMP-ATP-sensitive K⁺ channel pathway.
