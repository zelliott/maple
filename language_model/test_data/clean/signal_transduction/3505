In this article, development of articular cartilage and endochondral ossification is reviewed, from the perspective of both morphologic aspects of histogenesis and molecular biology, particularly with respect to key signaling molecules and extracellular matrix components most active in cartilage development. The current understanding of the roles of transforming growth factor β and associated signaling molecules, bone morphogenic proteins, and molecules of the Wnt-β catenin system in chondrogenesis are described. Articular cartilage development is a highly conserved complex biological process that is dynamic and robust in nature, which proceeds well without incident or failure in all joints of most young growing individuals.
