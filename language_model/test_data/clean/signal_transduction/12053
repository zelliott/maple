Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an affliction associated with increased systemic stress and cell death. We will review the role of keratin 18 (K-18) and caspase-cleaved CK-18 (ccK-18) as markers for increased apoptosis and necrosis during renal failure progression. The importance of preventative expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) in response to cell stress will also be discussed. The frequent development of CKD leads to serious complications. The potential of use of K-18 and HSP as early biomarkers of renal failure will be reviewed. Also, the role of these proteins with respect to dialysis regimes and in acute ischemic kidney injury following renal transplantation will be discussed.
