The global activator GacA, a highly conserved response regulator in Gram-negative bacteria, is required for the production of exoenzymes and secondary metabolites in Pseudomonas spp. The gacA gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was isolated and its role in cell-density-dependent gene expression was characterized. Mutational inactivation of gacA resulted in delayed and reduced formation of the cell-density signal N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone (BHL), of the cognate transcriptional activator RhIR (VsmR), and of the transcriptional activator LasR, which is known to positively regulate RhIR expression. Amplification of gacA on a multicopy plasmid caused precocious and enhanced production of BHL, RhIR and LasR. In parallel, the gacA gene dosage markedly influenced the BHL/RhIR-dependent formation of the cytotoxic compounds pyocyanin and cyanide and the exoenzyme lipase. However, the concentrations of another known cell-density signal of P. aeruginosa, N-oxododecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone, did not always match BHL concentrations. A model accounting for these observations places GacA function upstream of LasR and RhIR in the complex, cell-density-dependent signal-transduction pathway regulating several exoproducts and virulence factors of P. aeruginosa via BHL.
