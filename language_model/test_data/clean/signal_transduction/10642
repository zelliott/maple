Ste20 serine/threonine kinases regulate fundamental cellular processes including the cell cycle, apoptosis, and stress responses. Recent studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals demonstrate that Ste20 kinases also function in cell volume sensing and Cl- transport regulation. Yeast Ste20 initiates a shrinkage activated MAPK cascade that regulates organic osmolyte accumulation. Ste20 kinases thus play evolutionarily conserved roles in cellular volume sensing and regulation. They may also function in systemic osmotic homeostasis and to link cell-cycle events with cell volume.
