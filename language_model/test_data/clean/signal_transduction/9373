Brassinosteroids play diverse roles in plant growth and development. Plants deficient in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis or defective in signal transduction show many abnormal developmental phenotypes, indicating the importance of both BR biosynthesis and the signaling pathway in regulating these biological processes. Recently, using genetics, proteomics, genomics, cell biology, and many other approaches, more components involved in the BR signaling pathway were identified. Furthermore, the physiological, cellular, and molecular mechanisms by which BRs regulate various aspects of plant development, are being discovered. These include root development, anther and pollen development and formation, stem elongation, vasculature differentiation, and cellulose biosynthesis, suggesting that the biological functions of BRs are far beyond promoting cell elongation. This review will focus on the up-to-date progresses about regulatory mechanisms of the BR signaling pathway and the physiological and molecular mechanisms whereby BRs regulate plant growth and development.
