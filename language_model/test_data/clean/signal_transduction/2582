Bacitracin and other antibiotics that inhibit late stages in peptidoglycan biosynthesis induce vancomycin resistance in a high-level, inducibly vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium. Exposure to bacitracin led to synthesis of the lactate-containing UDP-MurNAc-pentadepsipeptide precursor required for vancomycin resistance. These findings indicate that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis can lead to induction of vancomycin resistance and raise the possibility that multiple signals may serve to induce resistance.
