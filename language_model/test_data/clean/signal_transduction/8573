Calcineurin, also known as protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B), is a calcium-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase. It couples intracellular calcium to dephosphorylate selected substrates resulting in diverse biological consequences depending on cell type. In mammals, calcineurin's functions include neuronal growth, development of cardiac valves and hypertrophy, activation of lymphocytes, and the regulation of ion channels and enzymes. This chapter focuses on the key roles of calcineurin in skeletal muscle differentiation, regeneration, and fiber type conversion to an oxidative state, all of which are crucial to muscle development, metabolism, and functional adaptations. It seeks to integrate the current knowledge of calcineurin signaling in skeletal muscle and its interactions with other prominent regulatory pathways and their signaling intermediates to form a molecular overview that could provide directions for possible future exploitations in human metabolic health.
