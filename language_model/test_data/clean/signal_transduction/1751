Transendothelial migration of activated lymphocytes from the blood into the tissues is an essential step for immune functions. The housekeeping chemokine CXCL12 (or stroma cell-derived factor-1alpha), a highly efficient chemoattractant for T lymphocytes, drives lymphocytes to sites where they are highly likely to encounter antigens. This suggests that cross-talk between the T-cell receptor (TCR) and CXCR4 (the CXCL12 receptor) might occur within these sites. Here we show that the zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70), a key element in TCR signaling, is required for CXCR4 signal transduction. The pharmacologic inhibition of ZAP-70, or the absence of ZAP-70 in Jurkat T cells and in primary CD4(+) T cells obtained from a patient with ZAP deficiency, resulted in an impairment of transendothelial migration that was rescued by the transfection of ZAP-70. Moreover, the overexpression of mutated forms of ZAP-70, whose kinase domain was inactivated, also abrogated the migratory response of Jurkat T cells to CXCL12. In contrast, no involvement of ZAP-70 in T-cell arrest on inflammatory endothelium under flow conditions or in CXCL12-induced actin polymerization was observed. Furthermore, CXCL12 induced time-dependent phosphorylation of ZAP-70, Vav1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs); the latter were reduced in the absence of functional ZAP-70. However, though a dominant-negative Vav1 mutant (Vav1 L213A) blocked CXCL12-induced T-cell migration, pharmacologic inhibition of the ERK pathway did not affect migration, suggesting that ERK activation is dispensable for T-cell chemotaxis. We conclude that cross-talk between the ZAP-70 signaling pathway and the chemokine receptor CXCR4 is required for T-cell migration.
