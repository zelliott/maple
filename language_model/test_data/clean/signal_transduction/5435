Chemokines and their receptors were discovered about twenty years ago as mediators of leukocyte traffic. Over the past decade, functional studies of these molecules have revealed their importance for cell migration processes during embryogenesis, which, in addition to providing mechanistic insights into embryonic development, could complement information about chemokine function in the immune system. Here, we review the roles of the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) and its receptor CXCR4 during zebrafish and mouse embryonic development, and discuss their function in regulating the interactions of cells with their extracellular environment, in directing their migration, and in maintaining their location.
