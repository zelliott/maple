Biofilm formation by the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a complex process with significant consequences for human health: it contributes to implanted medical device-associated infections. Recent advances in gene expression profiling and genetic analysis have begun to clarify the mechanisms that govern C. albicans biofilm development and acquisition of unique biofilm phenotypes. Such studies have identified candidate adhesin genes, and have revealed that biofilm drug resistance is multifactorial. Newly defined cell-cell communication pathways also have profound effects on biofilm formation. Future challenges include the elucidation of the structure and function of the extracellular exopolymeric substance that surrounds biofilm cells, and the extension of in vitro biofilm observations to newly developed in vivo biofilm models.
