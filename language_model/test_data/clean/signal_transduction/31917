Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) plays a central role in interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated cell proliferation by inhibiting apoptosis in a variety of cell types. The Stat3 pathway is essential for embryonic development. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of recombinant IL-6 on the viability and development of porcine diploid parthenotes cultured in vitro. Four-cell parthenotes, derived in vitro, were cultured to the blastocyst stage, with or without recombinant IL-6. The addition of 10 or 100 ng/ml of recombinant swine IL-6 into PZM3 medium increased the development rate of parthenotes to the blastocyst stage (P<0.05). When supplemented with 10 ng/ml of recombinant swine IL-6, the number of parthenotes at the blastocyst stage increased (P<0.05) and apoptosis decreased (P<0.05). Real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed that the addition of recombinant swine IL-6 decreased the mRNA expression of the pro-apoptotic gene Caspase3 (P<0.01) but increased the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl2l1 and Survivin. IL-6 receptors and Stat3 mRNA expression were upregulated after treatment with 10 ng/ml recombinant swine IL-6. Immunoblots and fluorescence labeling experiments showed that the levels of phosphorylated Stat3 were upregulated. These results suggest that recombinant swine IL-6 prevents apoptosis of porcine parthenotes and enhances porcine embryo viability through the IL-6/Stat3 signaling pathway in vitro.
