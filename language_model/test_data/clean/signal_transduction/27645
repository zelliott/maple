The collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) induces platelet activation through a similar pathway to that used by immune receptors. In the present study we have investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in GPVI signalling. Our results show that collagen-related peptide {CRP: [GCP*(GPP*)(10)GCP*G](n); P*=hydroxyproline}, which is selective to GPVI, induces formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P(3)] and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate [PI(3, 4)P(2)] in platelets. The increase in the two 3-phosphorylated lipids is inhibited completely by wortmannin and by LY294002, two structurally unrelated inhibitors of PI 3-kinase. The formation of inositol phosphates and phosphatidic acid (PA), two markers of phospholipase C (PLC) activation, by CRP are inhibited by between 50 and 85% in the presence of wortmannin and LY294002. This is associated with inhibition of elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) and aggregation. Wortmannin and LY294002 also partially inhibit elevation of Ca(2+) by CRP in murine megakaryocytes. Microinjection of the pleckstrin-homology PH domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, which binds selectively to PI(3,4, 5)P(3), but not the R28C (Arg(28)-->Cys) mutant which binds to PI(3, 4,5)P(3) with low affinity, also inhibits elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) in megakaryocytes, suggesting that it is this lipid species which mediates the action of the PI 3-kinase pathway. Studies in platelets show that the action of wortmannin and LY294002 is not mediated through an alteration in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma2. These results demonstrate that PI 3-kinase is required for full activation of PLCgamma2 by GPVI in platelets and megakaryocytes.
