Prostate cancer is a multifaceted progressive multistep disorder that arises because of accumulation of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, which escort to the transformation of normal cells into malignant derivatives. Despite tremendous strides have been made in the understanding of prostate cancer biology, yet approaches towards cancer-targeted therapy still face confrontations in standardization. This review brings to attention, the regulators in complex genetic backgrounds to enlighten our understanding of transformation and metastasis in human systems. Recent evidence gives a clue that prostate cancer may be linked to deregulated DNA damage repair processes, as various combinations of targeted deletions in genes controlling cell-cycle checkpoints; apoptosis and DNA repair result in prostate cancer progression and aggressiveness. An insight of the orchestration between DNA damage-based molecular responses and TRAIL provides an understanding of the mechanisms that cause apoptosis and may provide rationale for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
