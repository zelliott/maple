Localization of kinases and other signalling molecules at discrete cellular locations is often an essential component of signal transduction in eukaryotes. Caulobacter crescentus is a small, single-celled bacterium that presumably lacks intracellular organelles. Yet in Caulobacter, the subcellular distribution of several two-component signal transduction proteins involved in the control of polar morphogenesis and cell cycle progression changes from a fairly dispersed distribution to a tight accumulation at one or both poles in a spatial and temporal pattern that is reproduced during each cell cycle. This cell cycle-dependent choreography suggests that similarly to what happens in eukaryotes, protein localization provides a means of modulating signal transduction in bacteria. Recent studies have provided important insights into the biological role and the mechanisms for the differential localization of these bacterial signalling proteins during the Caulobacter cell cycle.
