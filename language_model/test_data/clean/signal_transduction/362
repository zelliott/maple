To unravel the cytotoxic effect of the recombinant CFP-10/ESAT-6 protein (rCFES) on WI-38 cells, an integrative analysis approach, combining time-course microarray data and annotated pathway databases, was proposed with the emphasis on identifying the potentially crucial pathways. The potentially crucial pathways were selected based on a composite criterion characterizing the average significance and topological properties of important genes. The analysis results suggested that the regulatory effect of rCFES was at least involved in cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival, and metabolisms of WI-38 cells. The survivability of WI-38 cells, in particular, was significantly decreased to 62% with 12.5 microM rCFES. Furthermore, the focal adhesion pathway was identified as the potentially most-crucial pathway and 58 of 65 important genes in this pathway were downregulated by rCFES treatment. Using qRT-PCR, we have confirmed the changes in the expression levels of LAMA4, PIK3R3, BIRC3, and NFKBIA, suggesting that these proteins may play an essential role in the cytotoxic process in the rCFES-treated WI-38 cells.
