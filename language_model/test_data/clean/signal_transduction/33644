The second EMBO workshop on ;Semaphorin function and mechanisms of action', held in the gorgeous surroundings of the 12th Century Abbaye des Vaulx de Cernay near Paris, France this May, brought together a wide range of scientists working in diverse systems with a common interest: the semaphorins. Emerging new themes discussed at the meeting included the recognition of an increasingly complex way in which different cells regulate responsiveness, and the significance of considering semaphorins in the pathology of various diseases.
