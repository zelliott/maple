This study explored the effect of hyperthyroid state on humoral immune response and NF-kappaB signaling in lymphocytes. Male Wistar rats were treated with l-thyroxin for four weeks. Animals were immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) after three weeks of l-thyroxin treatment. After one week of immunization, serum anti-SRBC titer was measured and NF-kappaB signaling was studied in lymphocytes by Western blot analysis of p-IKB-alpha, IKB-alpha, and p65. These results were compared with that of control rats. Antibody response and density of p-IKB-alpha and p65 were significantly higher in l-thyroxin treated rats in comparison to controls. The antibody response was found to have significant correlation with density of p-IKB-alpha and p65. Our results indicate that NF-kappaB signaling pathway in lymphocytes is activated in hyperthyroid state which might play a role in potentiation of antibody response.
