Peptidergic hormones, neurotransmitters, and neuromodulators are extracellular signaling molecules that play central roles in physiological signal transmissions between various cells, tissues, and organs. These factors are primarily translated as inactive precursor proteins according to the genetic information. These precursor proteins are then cleaved by various proteases including signal peptidases and processing enzymes to produce matured bioactive factors. During these processes, various fragmented peptides are also produced from the same precursor proteins. Such fragmented peptides may have various unexpected biological activities that have not been identified yet because these peptides are considered to be produced and released along with mature factors at the same secretary pathways. Recently, we found that various fragmented peptides of mitochondrial proteins that are produced during the maturation processes, such as fragments of cytochrome c oxidase, activate neutrophils whose functions are distinct from their parent proteins. These findings suggest the existence of many different functional peptides whose functions have not been identified yet. These unidentified peptides may play a variety of roles in various regulatory mechanisms, and therefore, they are expected to provide novel regulatory and signaling mechanisms, "Peptide World".
