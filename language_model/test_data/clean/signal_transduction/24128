Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA; 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate), an abundant constituent of serum, mediates multiple biological responses via G protein-coupled serpentine receptors. Schwann cells express the LPA receptors (Edg receptors), which, once activated, have the potential to signal through G(alphai) to activate p21(ras) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, through G(alphaq) to activate phospholipase C, or through G(q12/13) to activate the Rho pathway. We found that the addition of serum or LPA to serum-starved Schwann cells rapidly (10 min) induced the appearance of actin stress fibers via a Rho-mediated pathway. Furthermore, LPA was able to rescue Schwann cells from apoptosis in a G(alphai)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/MEK/MAPK-dependent manner. In addition, LPA increased the expression of myelin protein P(0) in Schwann cells in a Galpha(i)-independent manner but dependent on protein kinase C. By means of pharmacological and overexpression approaches, we found that the novel isozyme protein kinase Cdelta was required for myelin P(0) expression. Thus, the multiple effects of LPA in Schwann cells (actin reorganization, survival, and myelin gene expression) appear to be mediated through the different G protein-dependent pathways activated by the LPA receptor.
