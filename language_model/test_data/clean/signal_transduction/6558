In this review a number of uses of human T cell clones have been discussed. Before considering T cell cloning, however, it is worth bearing in mind that there are certain disadvantages to this approach to T cell immunity, not the least of which is that these cells, adapted as they are for in vitro growth, may be unrepresentative of the normal T cell, in terms of both specificity, and function. In addition, cloning is sufficiently difficult for it to be undertaken only where monoclonal populations are essential to the desired aim. Nevertheless, the range of uses discussed, and the fact that many have had a fundamental impact on our understanding of immune mechanisms, not only as mediated by T cells, but also of the intracellular mechanisms of antigen-presentation, the nature and mode of action of the cytokines, as well as the cell surface molecules and cascade of signals that orchestrate T cell activation, indicate the importance of T cell cloning. In the future, it is probable that the use of T cell clones with defined receptor usage will improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis, and thus aid both the prevention and treatment of disease. In addition, the T cell receptor structure will, no doubt, be elucidated, leading to a further quantum leap in our understanding of T cell immune mechanisms, as well as suggesting other avenues for exploration. In all these areas there is no doubt that the methodology of T cell cloning will continue to make a fundamental contribution.
