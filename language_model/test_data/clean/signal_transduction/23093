Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is a neuropeptide that acts through G protein coupled receptors and is involved in signal transmission in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Its receptor, gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), is expressed by various cell types, and it is overexpressed in cancer cells. In recent years, studies have suggested the relationship of GRP and inflammatory diseases. RC-3095, a selective GRPR antagonist, was found to have antiinflammatory properties in models of arthritis, gastritis, uveitis and sepsis. Furthermore, GRP mediates air pollutioninduced airway hyperreactivity and airway inflammation in mice. In conclusion, GRP and its receptor are relevant to the inflammatory response, being a potential therapeutic target several diseases are related to inflammation.
