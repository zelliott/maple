Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is a transmembrane protein belonging to the superfamily of rapid, ligand-operated channels. Theoretical models based on thermodynamic criteria assign portions of the polypeptide chains to the lipid bilayer region. From an experimental point of view, however, the relationship between the two moieties remains largely unexplored. Current studies from our laboratory are aimed at defining the structural, dynamic, and functional relationship between membrane lipids and AChR. We are particularly interested in establishing the characteristics of and differences between the lipids in each leaflet of the bilayer and the belt or "annular" lipids immediately surrounding AChR and the bulk bilayer lipids. We are also interested in determining the possible implications of lipid modifications on AChR channel properties. Toward these ends, fluorescence and other spectroscopic techniques, together with biochemical analyses and patch-clamp studies, are currently being undertaken. Correlations can be established between structural aspects of phospholipid packing in the immediate perimeter of AChR and other properties of these annular lipids revealed by dynamic spectroscopic and molecular modeling techniques. Lipid compositional analyses of the clonal muscle cell line BC3H-1 and chemical modification studies have been carried out by incubation of intact cells in culture and of membrane patches excised therefrom with liposomes of different lipid composition. These studies have been combined with electrophysiological measurements using the patch-clamp technique, with the aim of determining the possible effects of lipids on the channel properties of muscle-type AChR. A variety of experimental conditions, involving polar head and fatty acyl chain substitution of phospholipids and cholesterol incorporation, are being assayed in the BC3H-1 cells.
