Dimerization has emerged as a common mechanism for regulating the function of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Among these are chemokine receptors, which detect various chemokines and regulate a range of physiological process, including immune cell trafficking, cancer cell migration, and neuronal patterning. Homo- and heterodimerization in response to chemokine binding has been shown to be required for the initiation or alteration of signaling by a number of chemokine receptors. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, a new study indicates that the formation of heterodimers of chemokine receptor CXCR4 and the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) prevents each of them from actively signaling, suggesting a novel mechanism for silencing GPCR function.
