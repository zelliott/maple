Melanoma is generally resistant to chemotherapy, which may be related to defects in death receptor signaling and to defects in induction of apoptosis. Forkhead family transcription factors induce the expression of death receptor ligands such as Fas ligand (Fas-L) resulting in apoptosis. We therefore investigated whether a triple mutant form of forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 (FKHRL1/TM) can enhance Fas-L mediated-apoptosis in melanoma cells.   Two melanoma cells A2058 or DM6 were tested for their sensitivity to agonistic anti-Fas antibody (CH-11); adenovirus expressing FKHRL1/TM (Ad-FKHRL1/TM) was assessed for its capability to induce activation of the caspase pathway; the role of Fas-L in the Ad-FKHRL1/TM mediated-cell death was also assessed in vitro. Ad-FKHRL1/TM antitumor activity in vivo was also evaluated in a mouse melanoma xenograft model. We found that DM6 melanoma cells were more resistant to Fas/Fas-L-mediated apoptosis induced by agonistic anti-Fas antibody than A2058 melanoma cells. Ectopic expression of FKHRL1/TM in melanoma cells upregulated Fas-L expression, decreased procaspase-8 levels, and significantly increased Fas/FasL-mediated cell death in both cells lines; this induced cell death was partially blocked by a Fas/Fas-L antagonist. Importantly, Ad-FKHRL1/TM treatment of subcutaneous melanoma xenografts in mice resulted in approximately 70% decrease in tumor size compared with controls. These data indicate that overexpression of FKHRL1/TM can induce the Fas-L pathway in melanoma cells. Ad-FKHRL1/TM therefore might represent a promising vector for melanoma treatment.
