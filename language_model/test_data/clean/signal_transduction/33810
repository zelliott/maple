The smallpox virus can potentially be used as a biological weapon and pose a serious threat to human populations, thus rendering the development of measures against it particularly important. There is a lack of effective antiviral drugs for the treatment of smallpox and, as a result, a number of viral as well as host targets are being explored in preclinical and clinical studies to assess their efficacy as potential therapeutic agents. This review describes the latest approaches used to develop drugs against smallpox.
