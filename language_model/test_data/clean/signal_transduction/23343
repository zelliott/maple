Microfluidic devices can create hemodynamic conditions for platelet assays. We validated an 8-channel device in a study of interdonor response to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) with whole blood from 28 healthy individuals.

Platelet deposition was assessed before treatment or 24 h after ingestion of 325 mg ASA. Whole blood (plus 100 μmol/L H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone to inhibit thrombin) was further treated ex vivo with ASA (0-500 μmol/L) and perfused over fibrillar collagen for 300 s at a venous wall shear rate (200 s(-1)).

Ex vivo ASA addition to blood drawn before aspirin ingestion caused a reduction in platelet deposition [half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) approximately 10-20 μmol/L], especially between 150 and 300 s of perfusion, when secondary aggregation mediated by thromboxane was expected. Twenty-seven of 28 individuals displayed smaller deposits (45% mean reduction; range 10%-90%; P < 0.001) from blood obtained 24 h after ASA ingestion (no ASA added ex vivo). In replicate tests, an R value to score secondary aggregation [deposition rate from 150 to 300 s normalized by rate from 60 to 150 s] showed R < 1 in only 2 of 28 individuals without ASA ingestion, with R > 1 in only 3 of 28 individuals after 500 μmol/L ASA addition ex vivo. At 24 h after ASA ingestion, 21 of 28 individuals displayed poor secondary aggregation (R < 1) without ex vivo ASA addition, whereas the 7 individuals with residual secondary aggregation (R > 1) displayed insensitivity to ex vivo ASA addition. Platelet deposition was not correlated with platelet count. Ex vivo ASA addition caused similar inhibition at venous and arterial wall shear rates.

Microfluidic devices quantified platelet deposition after ingestion or ex vivo addition of aspirin.
