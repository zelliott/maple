An inverse correlation between the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 and the anti-atherogenic adipokine adiponectin has been reported in the chronic pathological conditions obesity, insulin resistance, coronary artery disease, and metabolic syndrome. We investigated whether this relationship is coincidental or has a causal basis. Here we show that interleukin-18 (IL-18) suppresses adiponectin transcription, mRNA expression, and secretion by 3T3-L1 adipocytes. IL-18 suppresses adiponectin promoter-reporter activity, an effect reversed by deletion or mutation of the NFATc4 core DNA-binding site. IL-18 induces NFATc4 phosphorylation (Ser(676)), nuclear translocation, and in vivo DNA binding. IL-18 induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation and enzyme activity, and pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126, ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, or small interference RNA targeted to ERK1/2 attenuates ERK1/2 activation and NFATc4 phosphorylation. Finally, inhibition of ERK1/2 or NFATc4 knockdown reverses IL-18-mediated adiponectin suppression. In contrast to its inhibitory effects on adiponectin expression, IL-18 potently stimulates PAI-1 secretion. These data demonstrate for the first time that IL-18 selectively suppresses adiponectin expression via ERK1/2-dependent NFATc4 activation and suggest that the inverse relationship observed between IL-18 and adiponectin in various chronic pathological conditions is causally related. Thus, targeting IL-18 expression may enhance adiponectin expression and mitigate disease progression.
