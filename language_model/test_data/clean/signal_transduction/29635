Fertilization is triggered by sperm-egg interaction and fusion that initiate a transient rise(s) in the free intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) that is responsible for a series of biochemical and cell biological events, so-called "egg activation". Calcium-dependent egg activation leads to the initiation of developmental program that culminates in the birth of individuals. A growing body of knowledge has uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying sperm-induced transient [Ca(2+)](i) increase(s) to some extent; namely, in most animals so far studied, a second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) seems to play a pivotal role in inducing [Ca(2+)](i) transient(s) at fertilization. However, signaling mechanisms used by sperm to initiate IP(3)-[Ca(2+)](i) transient pathway have not been elucidated. To approach this problem, we have employed African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, as a model animal and conducted experiments designed specifically to determine the role of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (SFKs or Src family PTKs) in the sperm-induced egg activation. This review compiles information about the use of PTK-specific inhibitors and activators for analyzing signal transduction events in egg fertilization. Specifically, we focus on molecular identification of Xenopus Src and the signaling mechanism of the Src-dependent egg activation that has been established recently. We also summarize recent advances in understanding the role of the Src family kinases in egg fertilization of other model organisms, and discuss future directions of the field.
