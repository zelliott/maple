We have previously identified Cia10 as an arthritis severity and articular damage quantitative trait locus. In this study, we used Illumina RatRef-12 microarrays to analyze the expression of 21,922 genes in synovial tissues from arthritis-susceptible DA and arthritis-protected DA.ACI(Cia10) congenics with pristane-induced arthritis. 310 genes had significantly different expression. The genes upregulated in DA, and reciprocally downregulated in DA.ACI(Cia10) included IL-11, Ccl12 and Cxcl10, as well as genes implicated in Th17 responses such as IL-17A, IL-6, Ccr6, Cxcr3 and Stat4. Suppressors of immune responses Tgfb and Vdr, and inhibitors of oxidative stress were upregulated in congenics. There was an over-representation of genes implicated in cancer and cancer-related phenotypes such as tumor growth and invasion among the differentially expressed genes. Cancer-favoring genes like Ctsd, Ikbke, and Kras were expressed in increased levels in DA, whereas inhibitors of cancer phenotypes such as Timp2, Reck and Tgfbr3 were increased in DA.ACI(Cia10). These results suggest that Cia10 may control arthritis severity, synovial hyperplasia and joint damage via the regulation of the expression of cancer-related genes, inflammatory mediators and Th17-related markers. These new findings have the potential to generate new targets for therapies aimed at reducing arthritis severity and joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis.
