We have previously shown that the binding of integrins with extracellular matrix component fibronectin (Fn) can improve the ability of bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) in resisting oxidant injury by up-regulating the activity of catalase and increasing the content of GSH. However, the molecular mechanism or its signaling pathway of this protection is still unclear. In order to examine the intracellular signaling mechanism activated by Fn-integrin binding reaction, the present study investigated the mRNA expression of catalase in primary cultured rabbit BECs using RT-PCR based on a cell-injury model made with ozone exposure. The product bands of target gene CAT were checked with Southern blot and oligonucleotide probe hybridization. The results showed that Fn (10 microg/ml) promoted the catalase mRNA transcription (P<0.01). This effect was abolished either by protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein or calmodulin inhibitor W(7) (P<0.01). These results indicate that the promotion of catalase activity induced by Fn-integrin reaction is partly due to the elevation of catalase mRNA transcription, and that its signalling are possibly relevant to tyrosine phosphorylation or calmodulin pathway.
