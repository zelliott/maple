Herbs have been considered natural and valuable sources for anticancer drug discovery. Herbal medicine has been prescribed in many countries over centuries for treating various diseases including infectious and malignant diseases. Nowadays, many of the drugs that have been used for treatment of malignant diseases are derived from natural products such as Taxol, a natural product isolated initially from Pacific Yew (Taxus brevifolia). This review article describes research on molecular mechanisms, especially cytotoxic effect of natural products from plant sources, primarily preclinical studies, involving human lung cancer cells in vitro for providing more knowledge and issues for potential drug development from medicinal herbs in the future.
