The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a validated target for therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most patients, however, either do not benefit or develop resistance to specific inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, such as gefitinib or erlotinib. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key intracellular kinase integrating proliferation and survival pathways and has been associated with resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this study, we assessed the effects of combining the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) with gefitinib on a panel of NSCLC cell lines characterized by gefitinib resistance and able to maintain S6K phosphorylation after gefitinib treatment. Everolimus plus gefitinib induced a significant decrease in the activation of MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways downstream of EGFR and resulted in a growth-inhibitory effect rather than in an enhancement of cell death. A synergistic effect was observed in those cell lines characterized by high proliferative index and low doubling time. These data suggest that treatment with everolimus and gefitinib might be of value in the treatment of selected NSCLC patients that exhibit high tumor proliferative activity.
