Members of the ras family of GTPases are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and transformation. The ras oncogene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer. In addition, other oncogene and tumor suppressor gene products are components of the signal transduction pathways in which Ras or other Ras-like GTPases play key regulatory functions. Current progress in the elucidation of these signal transduction pathways will be reviewed and the potential use of these insights for the development of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer will be discussed.
