Activated Akt kinase has been proposed as a central role in suppressing apoptosis by modulating the activities of Bcl-2 family proteins and/or caspase-9. To study the mechanism underlying the anti-apoptotic effect of taurine, the interaction between taurine and Akt/caspase-9 pathway was examined using a simulated ischemia model with cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes sealed in closed flasks. Taurine (20mM) treatment attenuated simulated ischemia-induced decline in the activity of Akt. Although taurine treatment had no effect on the expression of Bcl-2 in mitochondria and the level of cytosolic cytochrome c, it inhibited ischemia-induced cleavage of caspases 9 and 3. Moreover, adenovirus transfer of the dominant negative form of Akt objected taurine-mediated anti-apoptotic effects, cancelling the suppression of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities by taurine. These findings provide the first evidence that taurine inhibits ischemia-induced apoptosis in cardiac myocytes with the increase in Akt activities, by inactivating caspase-9.
