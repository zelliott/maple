The identification of heterozygous mutations (with an incidence up to 85%) in either the R132 residue of isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) or the R172 residue of IDH2 in human low-grade diffuse gliomas was remarkable because no oncogenic pathway had been previously documented correlated with these enzymes. In spite of a recent surge in elucidating the tumorigenic activity of IDH mutations in glioblastoma, the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. We showed here that C6 glioma cells transiently over-expressing IDH2(R172G) induced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, up-regulation of HIF-1α signaling and corresponding proteins expression that were closely related with tumor invasion and chemo-resistance. These results demonstrated a functional model in which IDH mutations were closely interrelated with glioma progression and could hold some therapeutic implications for future human glioma treatment.
