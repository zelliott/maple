It is known that certain type I membrane molecules (complement receptors type 1 and 2) belonging to the regulators of complement activation (RCA) family are involved in the regulation of B lymphocyte activation. In contrast, only GPI-anchored RCA molecules (CD55) have been described to be involved in T lymphocyte activation. In this study, we describe a novel function for the mouse RCA type I membrane protein Crry/p65 as a costimulatory molecule in CD4+ T cell activation. This is shown by increased anti-CD3-induced proliferation of CD4+ spleen T lymphocytes in the presence of the Crry/p65-specific mAb P3D2. Furthermore, Ab-induced coligation of Crry/p65 and CD3 favors IL-4 rather than IFN-gamma secretion in these cells. Crry/p65 signaling was also observed regardless of additional Ca2+, protein kinase C, or CD28-mediated costimuli. Analysis of intracellular intermediaries shows that Crry/p65-CD3 coligation enhances certain TCR/CD3-mediated signals, producing increased early tyrosine phosphorylation of many substrates and enhanced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-related kinase. These data fit well with the association of Crry/p65 with the tyrosine kinase Lck found in T cell lysates. The epitope recognized by the mAb P3D2 interferes with the protective role of Crry/p65 on C3 deposition. The relationship between protective function and costimulation by Crry/p65 is discussed. Our results support a multifunctional role for Crry/p65 in T cells and suggest new links between the natural and adaptive immune responses.
