We constructed a recombinant plasmid which expresses antisense src RNA after dexamethasone (Dexa) treatment, and transfected it into U937 human monoblastic leukemia cells (U937-ASRC). Induction of antisense src RNA expression diminished the amounts of c-Src and its protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity in U937-ASRC cells. The declines in c-Src and its PTK activity subsequently reduced the proliferation of U937-ASRC cells. To elucidate the growth signal transduction pathway downstream of c-Src, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was examined in U937-ASRC cells treated with Dexa. The decline in c-Src by induction of antisense src RNA expression decreased the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. Immunoprecipitated c-Src directly phosphorylated immunoprecipitated Shc on tyrosine residues in vitro. The amounts of Grb2 and Sos co-immunoprecipitated with Shc were decreased after Dexa treatment. However, the amount of Sos co-immunoprecipitated with Grb2 was apparently not affected by Dexa treatment. These results indicate that Grb2 and Sos constitutively associate with each other in U937 cells. Furthermore, the level of phosphorylation on tyrosine (204) essential for MAP kinase activation was decreased after Dexa treatment. Taken together with all these findings, it is suggested that c-Src directly phosphorylates Shc on tyrosine residues, which in turn binds to Grb2 constitutively associated with Sos to form a Shc-Grb2-Sos complex, and that the complex formation is coupled with MAP kinase activation mediated by Ras activation in U937 cells.
