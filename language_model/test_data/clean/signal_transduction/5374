TLR9 detects bacterial DNA (CpG DNA) and elicits both innate and adoptive immunity. Recent evidence indicates that TLR9 is expressed in more diverse cell types than initially thought. In this study, we report that HUVECs constitutively express TLR9 and selectively recognize unmethylated CpG motifs in bacterial DNA and synthetic immune stimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides. HUVECs respond to CpG DNA with rapid phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha and NF-kappaB-mediated gene transcription and surface expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and E-selectin independent of MAPK signaling. The telomere-derived TLR9 inhibitory oligonucleotide 5'-TTT AGG GTT AGG GTT AGG G-3', agents that block endosomal acidification such as chloroquine and bafilomycin A, and NF-kappaB inhibitors abrogated CpG DNA-induced signaling. HUVEC activation by CpG DNA led to markedly enhanced neutrophil adhesion under nonstatic conditions that was further enhanced when neutrophils were stimulated with CpG DNA. The adhesive interactions were blocked by Abs against CD18 and, to a lesser degree, by anti-E-selectin and anti-L-selectin Abs. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial DNA promotes beta(2) integrin and E-selectin-mediated HUVEC-neutrophil adherence, and indicate the ability of CpG DNA to initiate and/or maintain the inflammatory response.
