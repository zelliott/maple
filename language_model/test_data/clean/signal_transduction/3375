β-arrestin-1 (β-arr1) and β-arrestin-2 (β-arr2) are cytosolic proteins well-known to participate in G protein-coupled receptor desensitisation and signalling. We used genetically-inactivated mice to evaluate the role of β-arr1 or β-arr2 in platelet function, P2Y receptor desensitisation, haemostasis and thrombosis. Platelet aggregation, soluble fibrinogen binding and P-selectin exposure induced by various agonists were near normal in β-arr1-/- and β-arr2-/- platelets. In addition, deficiency in β-arr1 or β-arr2 was not critical for P2Y receptors desensitisation. A functional redundancy between β-arr1 and β-arr2 may explain these unchanged platelet responses. Interestingly, β-arr1-/- but not β-arr2-/- mice were protected against laser- and FeCl3-induced thrombosis. The tail bleeding times, number of rebleeds and volume of blood loss were unchanged in β-arr1-/- and β-arr2-/- mice, suggesting no defect in haemostasis. β-arr1-/- platelet activation upon adhesion to immobilised fibrinogen was inhibited, as attested by a 37 ± 5% (n = 3, p<0.0001) decrease in filopodia extension, suggesting defective signalling through integrin αIIbβ3. β-arr1 appeared to be located downstream of Src family kinases and to regulate αIIbβ3 signalling by increasing Akt phosphorylation. Overall, this study supports a role for β-arr1 in promoting thrombus formation, in part through its participation in αIIbβ3 signalling, and no role of β-arr1 and β-arr2 in agonist-induced platelet activation and P2Y receptors desensitisation.
