We have determined the expression pattern of the A-raf proto-oncogene in the embryonic and adult mouse. Western blot analysis of protein lysates from tissues of adult mice show that p69A-raf is ubiquitously expressed, but that levels of expression vary among different tissues. To determine the cell-specific expression pattern of A-raf, we generated transgenic mice expressing the beta-galactosidase reporter gene from the A-raf promoter. We show that A-raf expression is highly specific within a given tissue, and we identify cell types expressing this gene in the adult testis, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, ovary, oviduct, bladder, kidney, intestine, heart, spleen, thymus, and cerebellum. In the embryo, ubiquitous expression of the reporter gene is observed, but the highest levels of expression are specifically detected in the embryonic heart at stages 9.5-11.5 days post-coitum.
