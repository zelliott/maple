Mammalian cells require a constant supply of oxygen to maintain energy balance, and sustained hypoxia can result in cell death. It is therefore not surprising that sophisticated adaptive mechanisms have evolved that enhance cell survival during hypoxia. During the past few years, there have been a growing number of reports on hypoxia-induced transcription of specific genes. In this review, we describe a unique experimental approach that utilizes focused cDNA libraries coupled to microarray analyses to identify hypoxia-responsive signal transduction pathways and genes that confer the hypoxia-tolerant phenotype. We have used the subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH) method to create a cDNA library enriched in hypoxia-regulated genes in oxygen-sensing pheochromocytoma cells and have used this library to create microarrays that allow us to examine hundreds of genes at a time. This library contains over 300 genes and expressed sequence tags upregulated by hypoxia, including tyrosine hydroxylase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and junB. Hypoxic regulation of these and other genes in the library has been confirmed by microarray, Northern blot, and real-time PCR analyses. Coupling focused SSH libraries with microarray analyses allows one to specifically study genes relevant to a phenotype of interest while reducing much of the biological noise associated with these types of studies. When used in conjunction with high-throughput, dye-based assays for cell survival and apoptosis, this approach offers a rapid method for discovering validated therapeutic targets for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and tumors.
