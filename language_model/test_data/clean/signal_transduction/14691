Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play an important role in mediating stress responses in plants. In Arabidopsis, 20 MAPKs have been identified and classified into four major groups (A-D). Little is known about the role of group C MAPKs. We have studied the activation of Arabidopsis subgroup C1 MAPKs (AtMPK1/AtMPK2) in response to mechanical injury. An increase in their kinase activity was detected in response to wounding that was blocked by cycloheximide. Jasmonic acid (JA) activated AtMPK1/AtMPK2 in the absence of wounding. Wound and JA-induction of AtMPK1/2 kinase activity was not prevented in the JA-insensitive coi1 mutant. Other stress signals, such as abscisic acid (ABA) and hydrogen peroxide, activated AtMPK1/2. This report shows for the first time that regulation of AtMPK1/2 kinase activity in Arabidopsis might be under the control of signals involved in different kinds of stress.
