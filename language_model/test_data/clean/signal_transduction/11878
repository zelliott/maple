Nephrin and Neph-family proteins [Neph1-3 (nephrin-like 1-3)] belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell-adhesion receptors and are expressed in the glomerular podocytes. Both nephrin and Neph-family members function in cell adhesion and signalling, and thus regulate the structure and function of podocytes and maintain normal glomerular ultrafiltration. The expression of nephrin and Neph3 is altered in human proteinuric diseases emphasizing the importance of studying the transcriptional regulation of the nephrin and Neph3 genes NPHS1 (nephrosis 1, congenital, Finnish type) and KIRREL2 (kin of IRRE-like 2) respectively. The nephrin and Neph3 genes form a bidirectional gene pair, and they share transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. In the present review, we summarize the current knowledge of the functions of nephrin and Neph-family proteins and transcription factors and agents that control nephrin and Neph3 gene expression.
