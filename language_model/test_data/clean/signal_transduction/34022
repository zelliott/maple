Bradykinin (BK) is an inflammatory mediator, and shows elevated levels in regions of severe injury and inflammatory diseases. It has been shown to induce interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in inflammatory responses in rheumatoid arthritis. We investigated the signaling pathway involved in IL-6 production caused by BK in synovial fibroblasts. BK caused concentration- and time-dependent increases in IL-6 production. By using pharmacological inhibitors or genetic inhibition of the BK receptor, siRNA revealed that B2 but not B1 BK receptors are involved in BK-mediated up-regulation of IL-6. BK-mediated IL-6 production was attenuated by phospholipase C inhibitor (U73122), protein kinase Cdelta inhibitor (rottlerin), NF-kappaB inhibitor (PDTC), IkappaB protease inhibitor (TPCK) and NF-kappaB inhibitor peptide. Stimulation of synovial fibroblasts with BK activated IkappaB kinase alpha/beta (IKK alpha/beta), IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, p65 phosphorylation at Ser(276), p65 and p50 translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus and kappaB-luciferase activity. BK mediated an increase of IKK alpha/beta and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, kappaB-luciferase activity and p65 and p50 binding to the NF-kappaB element was inhibited by B2 BK receptor antagonist (HOE140), U73122 and rottlerin. Our results suggest that BK increased IL-6 production in synovial fibroblasts via the B2 BK receptor/PI-PLC/PKCdelta/and NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
