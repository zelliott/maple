The CD31(+) subset of human naive CD4(+) T cells is thought to contain the population of cells that have recently emigrated from the thymus, while their CD31(-) counterparts have been proposed to originate from CD31(+) cells after homeostatic cell division. Naive T-cell maintenance is known to involve homeostatic cytokines such as interleukin-7 (IL-7). It remains to be investigated what role this cytokine has in the homeostasis of naive CD4(+) T-cell subsets defined by CD31 expression. We provide evidence that IL-7 exerts a preferential proliferative effect on CD31(+) naive CD4(+) T cells from adult peripheral blood compared with the CD31(-) subset. IL-7-driven proliferation did not result in loss of CD31 expression, suggesting that CD31(+) naive CD4(+) T cells can undergo cytokine-driven homeostatic proliferation while preserving CD31. Furthermore, IL-7 sustained or increased CD31 expression even in nonproliferating cells. Both proliferation and CD31 maintenance were dependent on the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Taken together, our data suggest that during adulthood CD31(+) naive CD4(+) T cells are maintained by IL-7 and that IL-7-based therapies may exert a preferential effect on this population.
