Gibberella zeae, a homothallic ascomycetous fungus, does not seek a partner for mating. Here, we focused on the role(s) of putative pheromone and receptor genes during sexual development in G. zeae. Orthologs of two pheromone precursor genes (GzPPG1 and GzPPG2), and their cognate receptor genes (GzPRE2 and GzPRE1) were transcribed during sexual development. The expression of these genes was controlled by the mating-type (MAT) locus and a MAP kinase gene, but not in a MAT-specific manner. Targeted gene deletion and subsequent outcrosses generated G. zeae strains lacking these putative pheromone/receptor genes in various combinations (from single to quadruple deletions). All G. zeae deletion strains were similar to the self-fertile progenitor in both male- and female fertility and other traits. Sometimes, the deletions including DeltaGzPPG1;DeltaGzPRE2 caused increased numbers of immature perithecia. Taken together, it is clear that these putative pheromones/receptors play a non-essential role in the sexual development of G. zeae.
