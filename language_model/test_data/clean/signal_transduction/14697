Blood vessels and nerve fibers often course alongside one another in an orderly fashion throughout the brain. This clustering gives rise to a reciprocal signaling network between endothelial and nerve cells that follows highly stereotyped anatomical patterns. One such molecular signal that is produced by endothelial cells and acts on surrounding neurons is heat shock protein 70. Here we briefly review recent studies that have revealed a critical role of this signaling pathway during harmful insults to the brain, particularly during episodes of cerebral ischemia.
