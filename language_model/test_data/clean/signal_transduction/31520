Vasoinhibins are a family of peptides derived from prolactin, growth hormone and placental lactogen that act on endothelial cells to suppress vasodilation and angiogenesis and to promote apoptosis-mediated vascular regression. Some of the pathways by which vasoinhibins act have now been defined, and recent developments indicate that endogenous vasoinhibins exert tonic and essential actions on blood vessel growth, dilation and regression in vivo. By studying the pathways that can generate vasoinhibins, and the nature of their receptors and key biological mediators, it should be possible to clarify the role of vasoinhibins in controlling vascular function in health and disease.
