Methylation and demethylation of cytosine residues in the genomic DNA play key roles in a wide range of fundamental biological processes such as differentiation and development, genome stability, imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, carcinogenesis and aging. DNA methylation is considered to be a stable modification associated with the epigenetic silencing of genomic loci and maintained through cellular division. Recent studies however, suggest that DNA methylation and demethylation are considerably more dynamic than previously thought and may be involved in repression and derepression of gene activity during the lifespan of a cell. This article is focused on epigenetic mechanisms in the hormonal regulation of the cytochrome p450 27B1 or CYP27B1 gene activity that involve reversible epigenetic modifications to chromatin and DNA methylation profiles.
