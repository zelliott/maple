We have previously isolated dieckol, a nutrient polyphenol compound, from the brown alga, Ecklonia cava (Lee et al.,2010a). Dieckol shows both antitumor and antioxidant activity and thus is of special interest for the development of chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents against cancer. However, the mechanism by which dieckol exerts its antitumor activity is poorly understood. Here, we show that dieckol, derived from E. cava, inhibits migration and invasion of HT1080 cells by scavenging intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). H2O2 or integrin signal-mediated ROS generation increases migration and invasion of HT1080 cells, which correlates with Rac1 activation and increased expression and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Rac1 activation is required for ROS generation. Depletion of FAK by siRNA suppresses Rac1-ROS-induced cell migration and invasion. Dieckol treatment attenuated intracellular ROS levels and activation of Rac1 as well as expression and phosphorylation of FAK. Dieckol treatment also decreases complex formation of FAK-Src-p130C as and expression of MMP2, 9, and 13. These results suggest that the Rac1-ROS-linked cascade enhances migration and invasion of HT1080 cells by inducing expression of MMPs through activation of the FAK signaling pathway, whereas dieckol downregulates FAK signaling through scavenging intracellular ROS. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms by which dieckol is able to suppress human cancer progresssion and metastasis. Therefore, we suggest that dieckol is a potential therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.
