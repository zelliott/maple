Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the growth of multiple cysts that in many cases result in end-stage renal disease. Current strategies to reduce cyst progression in ADPKD focus on modulating cell turnover, fluid secretion, and vasopressin signalling; but an alternative approach may be to target pathways providing "general support" for cyst growth, such as surrounding blood vessels. This could be achieved by altering the expression of growth factors involved in vascular network formation, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin families. We highlight the evidence that blood vessels and vascular growth factors play a role in ADPKD progression. Recent experiments manipulating VEGF in ADPKD are described, and we discuss how alternative strategies to manipulate angiogenesis may be used in the future as a novel treatment for ADPKD.
