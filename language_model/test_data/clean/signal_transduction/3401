Two-component systems, composed of a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR), are the major signal transduction devices in bacteria. Originally it was thought that these two components function as linear, phosphorylation-driven stimulus-response system. Here, we will review how accessory proteins are employed by HKs and RRs to mediate signal integration, scaffolding, interconnection and allosteric regulation, and how these two components are embedded in regulatory networks.
