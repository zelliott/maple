Antigen arrays are becoming widely used tools for the characterization of the complexity of humoral immune responses. Current antibody profiling techniques provide modest and indirect information about the effector functions of the antibodies that bind to particular antigens. Here we introduce an antigen array-based approach for obtaining immune profiles reflecting antibody functionality. This technology relies on the parallel measurement of antibody binding and complement activation by features of the array. By comparing sera from animals immunized against the same antigen under different conditions, we show that identifying the position of an antigen in a 2-D space, derived from antibody binding and complement deposition, permits distinction between immune profiles characterized by diverse antibody isotype distributions. Additionally, the technology provides a biologically interpretable graphical representation of the relationship between antigen and host. Our data suggest that 2-D immune profiling could enrich the data obtained from proteomic scale serum profiling studies.
