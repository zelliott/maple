Cerebral ischemia induces neurogenesis, including proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells and migration of newly generated neuroblasts. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that decrease gene expression through mRNA destabilization and/or translational repression. Emerging data indicate that miRNAs have a role in mediating processes of proliferation and differentiation of adult neural progenitor cells. This article reviews recent findings on miRNA profile changes in neural progenitor cells after cerebral infarction and the contributions of miRNAs to their ischemia-induced proliferation and differentiation. We highlight interactions between the miR-124 and the miR17-92 cluster and the Notch and Sonic hedgehog signaling pathways in mediating stroke-induced neurogenesis.
