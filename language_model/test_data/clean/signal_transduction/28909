Activation of the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) has been shown to improve insulin resistance, adiposity, and plasma HDL levels. However, its antiatherogenic role remains controversial. Here we report atheroprotective effects of PPARdelta activation in a model of angiotensin II (AngII)-accelerated atherosclerosis, characterized by increased vascular inflammation related to repression of an antiinflammatory corepressor, B cell lymphoma-6 (Bcl-6), and the regulators of G protein-coupled signaling (RGS) proteins RGS4 and RGS5. In this model, administration of the PPARdelta agonist GW0742 (1 or 10 mg/kg) substantially attenuated AngII-accelerated atherosclerosis without altering blood pressure and increased vascular expression of Bcl-6, RGS4, and RGS5, which was associated with suppression of inflammatory and atherogenic gene expression in the artery. In vitro studies demonstrated similar changes in AngII-treated macrophages: PPARdelta activation increased both total and free Bcl-6 levels and inhibited AngII activation of MAP kinases, p38, and ERK1/2. These studies uncover crucial proinflammatory mechanisms of AngII and highlight actions of PPARdelta activation to inhibit AngII signaling, which is atheroprotective.
