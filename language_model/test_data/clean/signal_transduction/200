Many aspects of plant growth and development require specific protein interactions to carry out biochemical and cellular functions. Several proteins mediate these interactions, two of which specifically recognize phosphoproteins: 14-3-3 proteins and proteins with FHA domains. These are the only phosphobinding domains identified in plants. Both domains are present in animals and plants, and are used by plant proteins to regulate metabolic, developmental, and signaling pathways. 14-3-3s regulate sugar metabolism, proton gradients, and control transcription factor localization. FHA domains are modular domains often found in multidomain proteins that are involved in signal transduction and plant development.
