To investigate the relationship between the autophagy gene Beclin 1 involving the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway and the occurrence, development of epithelial ovarian carcinoma.

The expression of Beclin 1, Class I PI3K (p110alpha), Class III PI3K (hvps34) or p-PKB was, by immunohistochemistry, detected respectively in 25 normal ovarian tissues, 25 benign neoplasia tissues, 19 borderline tissues, and 69 epithelial ovarian carcinoma tissues.

The higher expressions of Beclin 1 and hvps34 were found in normal and benign ovarian neoplasia tissues; the expressions were reduced in the borderline lesion tissue; and the lowest level of expressions could be detected in the ovarian carcinoma tissue (P < 0.05). The expressions of p110alpha and p-PKB increased slightly in borderline ovarian tissue, and were higher in the epithelial ovarian carcinoma tissue than other three groups (P < 0.05). Beclin 1 expressions in the epithelial ovarian cancer tissues with stage I - II, high-middle grade differentiation and negative lymph node metastasis were higher than those with stage III - IV, low grade differentiation and positive lymph node metastasis, but the expressions of p110alpha and p-PKB in were lower (P < 0.05).

Beclin 1 expression is down-regulated in epithelial ovarian cancer tissue while the p110alpha, hvps34 and p-PKB are having the abnormal expressions on PI3K/PKB signaling pathway, which may be correlated with the occurrence and development of epithelial ovarian carcinoma.
