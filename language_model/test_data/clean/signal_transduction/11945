To discuss the significance of calcineurin (CaN) and nuclear factor of active T cells 1 (NFATc1) in the damage mechanism of the testis of rats with chronic fluorosis.

Eighteen clear class SD male rats, aging 6 week-old, were randomly divided into 3 groups, 6 rats in each. The rats of control group were fed with tap water (NaF < 1 mg/L) and the experimental rats were exposed to NaF (lower group: 5 mg/L, higher group: 50 mg/L) to established the chronic fluorosis model. After 8 months, we observed the occurrence of dental fluorosis among rats in different groups, and the contents of urine fluoride were detected by fluorine ion selective electrode method. The body of the rats were weighted as well as their testis. The testis tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and observed under light microscope to find the morphological changes. The expression of CaN and NFATc1's protein and mRNA in testis were detected by Immunocytochemistry (IHC) and In-situ hybridization (ISH).

The number of rats which was found dental fluorosis were separately 0, 4 and 5 in control group, low dose group and high dose group (χ(2) = 10.60, P < 0.05). The contents of urine fluoride were gradually increased in control group, low group and high group, which were (1.26 ± 0.17), (2.06 ± 0.64) and (7.69 ± 1.96)mg/L, respectively (F = 36.57, P < 0.05). The body weight were significantly different in all three groups(629.00 ± 16.00), (585.17 ± 17.27), (560.50 ± 16.07)g, F = 26.67, P < 0.05) and the testis weight were without statistical difference ((2.58 ± 0.17), (2.43 ± 0.31), (2.35 ± 0.38)g, F = 0.91, P > 0.05). Compared with the control group, the testicular structures were damaged in the experimental groups and especially significant in high dose group. The expression of CaN (59.10 ± 5.62, 77.93 ± 4.16, 101.69 ± 6.31, F = 74.18, P < 0.05) and NFATc1's (76.11 ± 4.41, 93.42 ± 3.85, 120.42 ± 9.31, F = 92.4, P < 0.05) protein in testis tissues were increased by the fluorine concentration. The mRNA expression of CaN and NFATc1 were separately (CaN: 58.76 ± 7.70, 82.01 ± 6.88, 99.47 ± 8.33, F = 42.65, P < 0.05 and NFATc1: 59.39 ± 4.74, 90.02 ± 5.37, 121.15 ± 7.69, F = 155.47, P < 0.05). There were positive correlation between the expression of CaN and NFATc1's protein and mRNA expression (r = 0.899, r = 0.908).

The changes in the signaling pathway of expression of CaN may be involved in the injury mechanism of testis tissues of rats with chronic fluorosis.
