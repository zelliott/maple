Gap junction channels and hemichannels formed of connexin subunits are found in most cell types in vertebrates. Gap junctions connect cells via channels not open to the extracellular space and permit the passage of ions and molecules of approximately 1 kDa. Single connexin hemichannels, which are connexin hexamers, are present in the surface membrane before docking with a hemichannel in an apposed membrane. Because of their high conductance and permeability in cell-cell channels, it had been thought that connexin hemichannels remained closed until docking to form a cell-cell channel. Now it is clear that at least some hemichannels can open to allow passage of molecules between the cytoplasm and extracellular space. Here we review evidence that gap junction channels may allow intercellular diffusion of necrotic or apoptotic signals, but may also allow diffusion of ions and substances from healthy to injured cells, thereby contributing to cell survival. Moreover, opening of gap junction hemichannels may exacerbate cell injury or mediate paracrine or autocrine signaling. In addition to the cell specific features of an ischemic insult, propagation of cell damage and death within affected tissues may be affected by expression and regulation of gap junction channels and hemichannels formed by connexins.
