Acquired resistance to targeted therapies threatens the value of these otherwise very promising agents. The recent description of resistance to the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor vismodegib (GDC-0449) in a medulloblastoma patient who had a dramatic initial response has spurred efforts to understand potential mechanisms of drug resistance. Elucidating these mechanisms will play a significant role in informing strategies to overcome this meaningful limitation.
