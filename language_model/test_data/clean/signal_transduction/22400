Cells of various types release small membrane vesicles called microparticles (MP) on their activation, as well as during the process of apoptosis. The properties and roles of MP generated in different contexts are diverse and are determined by their parent cell and the pathway of their generation, which affects their content. MP are involved in multiple cellular functions, including immunomodulation, inflammation, coagulation, and intercellular communication. MP are able to deliver molecular signals in the form of lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, or functional transmembrane proteins from the parent cell to distantly located targets. In this review, we summarize some of the current knowledge regarding MP and their functional roles in transfer of proteins, nucleic acids, and signal transduction stimulators between cells of different origins in different settings. We will focus on the ability of MP to mediate angiogenesis-related signals and their effect on cell development. The investigation of MP could elucidate new cellular communication pathways and may lead to better understanding of pathophysiological processes. From a clinical point of view, MP may serve as biomarkers for disease status and may be found useful for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting angiogenesis-related conditions.
