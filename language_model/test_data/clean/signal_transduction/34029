The expression of erythropoietin (Epo) and the Epo receptor (EpoR) has been detected in healthy tissue as well as in a variety of human cancers, including breast. Functional Epo/EpoR signaling in cancer cells, which contributes to disease initiation/progression, is not completely straightforward and is difficult to reconcile with the clinical practice of preventing/treating anemia in cancer patients with recombinant Epo. Preclinical and clinical investigations have provided contrasting results, ranging from a beneficial role that improves the patient's overall survival to a negative impact that promotes tumor growth progression. A careful gathering of Epo/EpoR biomolecular information enabled us to assemble an unexpected jigsaw puzzle which, via distinct JAK-dependent and JAK-independent mechanisms and different internalization/recycling as well as ubiquitination/degradation pathways, could explain most of the controversies of preclinical and clinical studies. However, until the mechanisms of the contrasting literature data are resolved, this new point of view may shed light on the Epo/EpoR paracrine/autocrine system and function, providing a basis for further studies in order to achieve the highest possible benefit for cancer patients.
