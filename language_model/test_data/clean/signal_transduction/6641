We have constructed a chimaeric gene consisting of the promoter of the soybean heat shock (hs) gene Gmhsp17, 6-L, the coding region of a hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) gene, and the termination sequence of the nopaline synthase (nos) gene. This gene fusion was introduced into tobacco by Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. Heat-inducible synthesis of mRNA was shown by northern hybridization, and translation of this RNA into a functional protein was indicated by plant growth on hygromycin-containing media in a temperature-dependent fashion. One hour incubation at 40 degrees C per day, applied for several weeks, was sufficient to express the resistant phenotype in transgenic plants containing the chimaeric hs-hpt gene. These data suggest that the hygromycin resistance gene is functional and faithfully controlled by the soybean hs promoter. The suitability of these transgenic plants for selection of mutations that alter the hs response is discussed.
