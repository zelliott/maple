Thrombopoietin (TPO) is recognized as the primary regulator of megakaryocyte and platelet production. Two alternative hypotheses for the mechanism of regulation have been proposed: (1) platelet and/or megakaryocyte mass regulate circulating TPO levels by binding to TPO through TPO receptors (c-MPL), with subsequent internalization and degradation of the protein; (2) TPO mRNA produced by bone marrow (BM) stromal cells or BM cells modulates blood TPO levels or platelet counts. In myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), including primary myelofibrosis (MF) and essential thrombocythemia (ET), elevated blood TPO levels occur despite increased platelet and megakaryocyte mass. Therefore, in these diseases, elevated blood TPO levels cannot be explained by the first mechanism. The present study, was designed to measure TPO mRNA production by BM mononuclear cells and BM stromal cells using a relative RT-PCR technique, to verify the second mechanism. We found no increase of TPO mRNA production in either BM cells or in BM stromal cells in patients with MF and ET. Furthermore, in those patients with MF who had elevated plasma TPO levels, TPO mRNA levels in bone marrow fibroblasts (BMFs) or BM cells were not elevated as compared with controls. Therefore, we concluded that in patients with MF, the elevated plasma TPO levels are not due to enhanced production of TPO mRNA either by BMF, or BM cells. The TPO receptor (c-MPL) abnormalities including reduced MPL protein levels or defective TPO induced signal transduction pathways are the likely mechanisms.
