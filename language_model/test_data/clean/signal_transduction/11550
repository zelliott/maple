Peptides act as effector agents that regulate and/or mediate physiological processes, serving as hormones, neurotransmitters and signal transducing factors. The low molecular weight peptides affect receptor-mediated events, which influence cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and neurocranial systems. While some peptides have been marketed as drugs, many have served as leads or templates for the development of non-peptide drugs that mimic peptide actions. This review presents the advantages and disadvantages of using peptides as drugs that bind as ligands to cell-surface receptors and considers their applications in such events. The value of both the peptides and their mimics is based on their participation in the biomodulation of physiological processes, which frequently employ scaffolding proteins acting in a cascading sequence of protein-to-protein interactions. The peptides bind to G-coupled surface receptors to initiate a signal that is transduced to the interior of the cell through multiple layers of phosphorylating enzymes and binding proteins. Peptides have been further employed to identify the molecular targets of signal transduction, the uncoupling of which might provide a means for various disease therapies. The exploitation of such peptide-mediated signal pathways, which are of primary importance to tumour cells, may provide an attractive strategy for anticancer therapy in the future.
