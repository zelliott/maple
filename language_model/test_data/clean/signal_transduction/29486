Nuclear receptor (NR) coregulators are key modulators of hormone signaling. Discovery of steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA), a coregulator that is active as a RNA, transformed thinking in the field of hormone action. The subsequent identification of SRA-binding coregulator proteins, including p68, SHARP and more recently SLIRP, has provided important insight into SRA's mechanism of action and potentially offers new opportunities to target NR signaling pathways for therapeutic gain. Here we outline advances in the field of NR coregulator biology, with a bias on recent progress in understanding SRA-protein interactions.
