Death receptors (DRs) are members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that possess a cytoplasmic death domain (DD). DRs regulate important operational and homeostatic aspects of the immune system. They transmit signals through apical protein complexes, which are nucleated by the DD adaptors FADD and TRADD, to control cellular outcomes that range from apoptosis to gene activation. FADD and TRADD also nucleate several distal signaling complexes, which mediate cross-talk between distinct DR signaling pathways. Moreover, together with other DR signal transducers, FADD and TRADD participate in functional complexes assembled by certain non-DR immune cell receptors, such as pattern-recognition receptors. Thus, DR signal transducers may provide important nodes of coordination in immune signaling networks.
