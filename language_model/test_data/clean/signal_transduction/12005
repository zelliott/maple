To investigate the expression of the anabolism of collagen regulation pathways connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) -transforming growth factor-betal (TGF-beta1) and glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) in women with uterine prolapse and a study of the clinic significance.

The expression of TGF-beta1, CTGF, and GPx1 was detected by immunohistochemical staining in pubocervical fascia tissue of 30 women with uterine prolapse, including ten cases of POP-QII, ten cases of POP-QIII, ten cases of POP-QIV, and 20 cases were control group with non-prolapse and non-malignant lesions.

There was a negative correlation between the POP-Q and expression of TGF-beta1. With the increase of POP-Q degree, the expression degree of TGF-beta1 decreased correspondingly, which also applied to CTGF and GPx1. On the other hand, there was a positive correlation between TGF-beta1 and CTGF. The synergistic change trend was found between TGF-beta1 and CTGF. It could also be seen between CTGF and GPx1 and betweenTGF-beta1 and GPx1.

The expression of the antioxidase GPx1 in pelvic support structure of POP women was decreased, which resulted in the antioxidation reduced. It could break the balance of oxidation and antioxidation in pelvic support structure, and may induce an increase of ROS level and the down-regulation of TGF-beta1-CTGF pathway. It could inhibit the anabolism of collagen and injury the pelvic support structure, thus promoting the occurrence and development of POP.
