Corosolic acid, a triterpenoid compound widely existing in many traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, has been proved to have antidiabetic effects on animal experiments and clinical trials. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we investigate its cellular effects and related signaling pathway. We demonstrate that it enhances glucose uptake in L6 myotubes and facilitates glucose transporter isoform 4 translocation in CHO/hIR cells. These actions are mediated by insulin pathway activation and can be blocked by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3) Kinase) inhibitor wortmannin. Furthermore, Corosolic acid inhibits the enzymatic activities of several diabetes-related non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in vitro, such as PTP1B, T-cell-PTP, src homology phosphatase-1 and src homology phosphatase-2.
