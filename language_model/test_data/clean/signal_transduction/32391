Recent findings concerning growth hormone-binding to its receptor and the post-receptor signal transduction mechanism of the hormone are reviewed. Growth hormone receptors have recently been included in the new cytokine receptor superfamily. The structure of the growth hormone receptor and a sequence of the chemical event leading to the expression of the effect of growth hormone, on cellular function, proliferation and differentiation, are reviewed in relation to ligands for the superfamily receptors.
