Cardiac hypertrophic program is a chronic, complex process, and occurs in response to long-term increases of hemodynamic load related to a variety of pathophysiological conditions. Mitochondria, known as "the cellular power plants", occupy about one-third of cardiomyocyte volume and supply roughly 90% of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Impairment of energy metabolism has been regarded as one of the main pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, we summarize here the molecular events of mitochondrial adaptations, including the mitochondrial genesis, ATP generation, ROS signaling and Ca(2+) homeostasis in cardiac hypertrophy, expecting that this effort will shed new light on understanding the maladaptive cardiac remodeling.
