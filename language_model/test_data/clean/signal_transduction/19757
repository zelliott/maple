Single-agent mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitors have recently been reported as effective salvage treatment in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The combined effect of mTORC1 inhibitor, RAD001, with chemotherapeutic agents used for relapsed or refractory NHL was examined. Synergistic interactions were observed for RAD001 plus gemcitabine or paclitaxel in six NHL cell lines; enhanced gemcitabine- and paclitaxel-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis associated with down-regulation of mTOR signaling was detected. Synergistic interactions were also observed with RAD001 plus gemcitabine and paclitaxel. In conclusion, synergistic cytotoxicity was observed with RAD001 plus gemcitabine and paclitaxel in NHL cells. Combination therapy with these three drugs should be examined in patients with refractory or relapsed NHL.
