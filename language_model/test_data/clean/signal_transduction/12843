Mast cells are thought to participate in a variety of immune responses, such as parasite resistance and the allergic reaction. Mast cell development depends on stem cell factor (Kit ligand) and its receptor, c-Kit. Gab2 is an adaptor molecule containing a pleckstrin homology domain and potential binding sites for SH2 and SH3 domains. Gab2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine after stimulation with cytokines and growth factors, including KitL. Gab2-deficient mice were created to define the physiological requirement for Gab2 in KitL/c-Kit signaling and mast cell development. In Gab2-deficient mice, the number of mast cells was reduced markedly in the stomach and less severely in the skin. Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) from the Gab2-deficient mice grew poorly in response to KitL. KitL-induced ERK MAP kinase and Akt activation were impaired in Gab2-deficient BMMCs. These data indicate that Gab2 is required for mast cell development and KitL/c-Kit signaling.
