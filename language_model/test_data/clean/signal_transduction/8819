The balance of cellular energy levels in response to changes of nutrient availability, stress stimuli or exercise is a critical step in maintaining tissue and whole body homeostasis. Disruption of this balance is associated with various pathologies, including the metabolic syndrome. Recently, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a central role in sensing changes in energy levels. The regulation of AMPK activity is currently the subject of significant investigation since this enzyme is a potential therapeutic target in both metabolic disorders and tumorigenesis. In this review, we present novel evidence of crosstalk between Fyn, one member of the Src kinase family, and AMPK.
