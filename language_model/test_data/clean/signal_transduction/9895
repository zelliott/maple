The Nodal family of signaling molecules includes critical intercellular regulators of early vertebrate development. In a recent issue of Nature, maternal transcripts encoding the zebrafish nodal squint were shown to be localized to the future organizer region by the four-cell stage, providing the earliest evidence of embryonic axis asymmetry in the zebrafish embryo.
