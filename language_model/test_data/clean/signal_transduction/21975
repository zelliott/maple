Endocytosis is an important mechanism to regulate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling. In contrast to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1; CD120a), the relevance of receptor internalization for signaling as well as the fate and route of internalized TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2; CD120b) is poorly understood. To analyze the dynamics of TNFR2 signaling and turnover at the plasma membrane we established a human TNFR2 expressing mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line in a TNFR1(-/-)/TNFR2(-/-) background. TNF stimulation resulted in a decrease of constitutive TNFR2 ectodomain shedding. We hypothesized that reduced ectodomain release is a result of TNF/TNFR2 complex internalization. Indeed, we could demonstrate that TNFR2 was internalized together with its ligand and cytoplasmic binding partners. Upon endocytosis the TNFR2 signaling complex colocalized with late endosome/lysosome marker Rab7 and entered the lysosomal degradation pathway. Furthermore, we identified a di-leucin motif in the cytoplasmic part of TNFR2 suggesting clathrin-dependent internalization of TNFR2. Internalization defective TNFR2 mutants are capable to signal, i.e. activate NFÎºB, demonstrating that the di-leucin motif dependent internalization is dispensable for this response. We therefore propose that receptor internalization primarily serves as a negative feed-back to limit TNF responses via TNFR2.
