Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, which do not play independently but work synergistically through complex interactions exacerbating neurodegeneration. Therefore, the mechanism that is directly implicated in controlling oxidative stress and inflammatory response could be an attractive strategy to prevent the onset and/or delay the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The transcription factor nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is the guardian of redox homeostasis by regulating a battery of antioxidant and phase II detoxification genes, which are relevant to defense mechanism against oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. In this study, we show that a recently identified Glycyrrhiza-inflata-derived chalcone, licochalcone E (Lico-E), attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses in microglial BV2 cells and protects dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells from 6-hydroxydopamine cytotoxicity. Lico-E activates Nrf2-antioxidant response element (ARE) system and up-regulates downstream NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of Lico-E are attenuated in siRNA-mediated Nrf2-silencing cells as well as in the presence with specific inhibitor of HO-1 or NQO1, respectively. Lico-E also has neuroprotective effect against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration in mice, with up-regulation of HO-1 and NQO1 in the substantia nigra of the brain. This study demonstrates that Lico-E is a potential activator of the Nrf2/ARE-dependent pathway and is therapeutically relevant not only to oxidative-stress-related neurodegeneration but also inflammatory responses of microglial cells both in vitro and in vivo.
