Genipin is a compound found in gardenia fruit extract with diverse pharmacological activities. However, the mechanism underlying genipin-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of genipin on COX-2 expression and determined that exposure to genipin dose-dependently enhanced the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a major COX-2 metabolite, in RAW 264.7 cells. These effects were mediated by genipin-induced activation of the COX-2 promoter, as well as AP-1 and NF-κB luciferase constructs. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt and MAPKs were also significantly activated by genipin, and Akt and MAPKs inhibitors (PD98059, SB20358, SP600125, and LY294002) inhibited genipin-induced COX-2 expression. Moreover, genipin increased production of the ROS and the ROS-producing NAPDH-oxidase (NOX) family oxidases, NOX2 and NOX3. Inhibition of NADPH with diphenyleneiodonium attenuated ROS production, COX-2 expression and NF-κB and AP-1 activation. These results suggest that the molecular mechanism mediating ROS-dependent COX-2 up-regulation and PGE2 production by genipin involves activation of Akt, MAPKs and AP-1/NF-κB.
