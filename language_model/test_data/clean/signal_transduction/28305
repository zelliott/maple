Calcium influx and the resulting increase in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i can induce enhanced sensitivity to temperature increases in nociceptive neurons. Using the patch-clamp technique and simultaneous calcium microfluorimetry we show that experimental elevation of [Ca2+]i using the calcium ionophore ionomycin resulted in a significant potentiation of heat-activated currents. This was not the case when rises in [Ca2+]i were elicited by depolarization of the cell membrane by current injection via the patch pipette. Our data provide first, however, indirect evidence that in sensory neurons calcium ions may be guided into different intracellular microdomains depending on the type of ion channel or pore through which they enter the cell. We conclude that the compartmentalization of sensory neurons for calcium ions may be decisive on further signalling cascades accounting, for example, for neuronal plasticity.
