Whereas cholinergic neurotransmitters are responsible for the release of a substantial portion of the CAs released from rat chromaffin cells by activation of the splanchinc nerves, the present data suggest that noncholinergic neurotransmission appears to play a more substantial role in the short- and long-term homeostatic regulation of TH activity, which serves to maintain the stores of CAs for subsequent release. In addition, studies using the PKA-deficient PC12 cells provided the first direct evidence that PKA actually mediates the phosphorylation of Ser40 in situ.
