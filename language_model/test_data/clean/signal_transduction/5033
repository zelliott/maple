Continuing efforts to discover novel means of combating fluconazole resistance in Candida albicans have identified an indole derivative that sensitizes strains demonstrating resistance to fluconazole. This tetracycle (3, ML229) does not appear to act through established Hsp90 or calcineurin pathways to chemosensitize C. albicans, as determined in Saccharomyces cerevisiae models, and may be a useful probe to uncover alternative resistance pathways.
