Quantum mechanics practiced in the present progressive mode can incorporate into itself the propagation of a signal of a local character. It is possible to view that any movement in the present progressive mode is mutli-agential in the sense of internal interactions due to the absence of an external agency coordinating the global situation simultaneously. The idea of living memory is discussed as carrying the leftover from those actions completed and registered in the present perfect mode and surviving at any present moment. The occurrence of both the signal propagation of a local character and living memory is upheld upon exchange interaction of a quantum mechanical origin. Empirical evidence suggesting the likelihood of such an exchange interaction is found in the neurotransmitter-gated ion channels located on the plasma membrane of the muscle cell in the vicinity of secretory vesicles containing acetylcholine near the nerve terminal. Another case from the empirical evidence is seen in the actomyosin system demonstrating the unidirectional propagation of variations in the acceleration of the displacement of an actin filament sliding on myosin molecules in the presence of ATP molecules.
