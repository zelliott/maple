Human effector memory (EM) CD4(+) T cells can rapidly transmigrate across an endothelial cell (EC) monolayer in response either to chemokine or to TCR-activating signals displayed by human dermal microvascular EC under conditions of venular shear stress. We previously reported that the TCR-stimulated transendothelial migration (TEM) depends on fractalkine (CX3CL1), PECAM-1 (CD31), and ICAM-1 (CD54) expression by the EC, whereas chemokine-stimulated TEM does not. In this study, we further analyze these responses using blocking mAb and small interfering RNA knockdown to show that TCR-stimulated TEM depends on CD99 on EC as well as on PECAM-1 and depends on nectin-2 (CD112) and poliovirus receptor (CD155) as well as EC ICAM-1. ICAM-1 is engaged by EM CD4(+) T cell LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) but not Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18); nectin-2 and poliovirus receptor are engaged by both DNAX accessory molecule-1 (CD226) and Tactile (CD96). EC junctional adhesion molecule-1 (JAM-1), an alternative ligand for LFA-1, contributes exclusively to chemokine-stimulated TEM and ICAM-2 appears to be uninvolved in either pathway. These data further define and further highlight the differences in the two pathways of EM CD4(+) T cell recruitment into sites of peripheral inflammation.
