Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the primary causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, which is an emerging swine immunosuppressive disease. To uncover cellular protein responses in PCV2-infected PK-15 cells, the comprehensive proteome profiles were analyzed utilizing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF identification. Multiple comparisons of 2-DE revealed that the majority of changes in protein expression occurred at 48-96 h after PCV2 infection. A total of 34 host-encoded proteins, including 15 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated proteins, were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis. According to cellular function, the differential expression proteins could be sorted into several groups: cytoskeleton proteins, stress response, macromolecular biosynthesis, energy metabolism, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, signal transduction, gene regulation. Western blot analysis demonstrated the changes of alpha tubulin, beta actin, and cytokeratin 8 during infection. Colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation analyses confirmed that the cellular alpha tubulin interacts with the Cap protein of PCV2 in the infected PK-15 cells. These identified cellular constituents have important implications for understanding the host interactions with PCV2 and brings us a step closer to defining the cellular requirements for the underlying mechanism of PCV2 replication and pathogenesis.
