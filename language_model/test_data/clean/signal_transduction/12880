Interleukin 24 (IL-24) encodes a secreted protein that exhibits significant homology to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) family of cytokines. Here we show that the human IL-24 is secreted by activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and is the ligand for two heterodimeric receptors, IL-22R1/IL-20R2 and IL-20R1/IL-20R2. The latter is also the receptor for IL-20. COS cells transfected with either IL-24 receptor heterodimers bind the ligand with similar saturation kinetics. IL-24 binding to either its endogenous receptors on human keratinocytes or to ectopically expressed receptors on baby hamster kidney cells leads to activation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for IL-24 being the fourth member of IL-10 family of cytokines to which their specific receptors have been identified.
