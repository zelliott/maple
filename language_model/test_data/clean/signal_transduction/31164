Mucolipin-1 is a membrane protein encoded by the gene MCOLN1, mutations in which result in the lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV). Efficient lysosomal targeting of mucolipin-1 requires di-leucine motifs in both the N-terminal and the C-terminal cytosolic tails. We have shown that aberrant lactosylceramide trafficking in MLIV cells may be rescued by wild-type mucolipin-1 expression but not by mucolipin-1 mistargeted to the plasma membrane or by lysosome-localized mucolipin-1 mutated in its predicted ion pore-selectivity region. Our data demonstrate that the correct localization of mucolipin-1 and the integrity of its ion pore are essential for its physiological function in the late endocytic pathway.
