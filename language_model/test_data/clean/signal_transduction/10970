Due to their structural characteristics and their diversity, the 22 members of the protocadherin-gamma (Pcdhgamma) family have been suggested to contribute to the establishment of specific connections in the nervous system. Here, we focus on a single isoform, Pcdhgamma-b1. Its expression is found in different brain regions and in developing spinal cord it is restricted to scattered cells, whereas all cells are labeled using an antibody that recognizes all Pcdhgamma isoforms. As a first step to understanding the signaling mechanisms downstream of Pcdhgamma, we identify the microtubule-destabilizing protein SCG10 as a cytoplasmic interactor for Pcdhgamma-b1 and other isoforms of the Pcdhgamma-b subfamily, and show that SCG10 and Pcdhgamma-b1 are found together in certain neuronal growth cones.
