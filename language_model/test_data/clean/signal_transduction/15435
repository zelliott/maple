Activation of the mTORC1 pathway has been implicated in many types of cancer, and several mTORC1 inhibitors are currently under clinical trials for treating various cancer patients. Notably, Temsirolimus has recently been approved for treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. However, the role of mTORC1 pathway in colorectal tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. We have recently found that the mTORC1 pathway is activated in intestinal adenomas of Apc mutant mice, accompanied by an elevated level of mTOR protein, and that treatment with RAD001, an mTORC1 inhibitor, suppresses the growth of these polyps. Our results suggest an important role of mTORC1 pathway in colorectal cancer, as well as a therapeutic possibility for mTORC1 inhibitors in its treatment.
