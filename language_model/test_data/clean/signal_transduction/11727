Objective. To study the effects of heat stress on dopamine (DA) and related phosphatidylinositol (PI) signal transduction system members: PLA2, PI, Ca2+ in rat striatum. Method. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group and heat stressed group. Heat stressed rats were placed in small hot chambers and taken out as soon as their rectal temperatures (Tr) reached the preset temperature. Then the animals were killed and their striatums were taken out. Fluorospectrophotometry, HPLC, Fura-2/AM fluoresence labelled method and acidalkaline titration were used to measure the content of DA, PI, [Ca2+]i and the enzyme activity of PLA2. Result. During heat stress, when rats' Tr reached 41.0 degrees C or higher, with increase of Tr, DA content increased continuously. When Tr = 43.0 degrees C, DA content was significantly higher than control. When Tr = 41.0 degrees C PLA2 activity was higher than control significantly, PI content of heat stressed group decreased significantly than control. [Ca2+]i increased significantly when Tr = 42.0 degrees C as compared with control. But if DA receptor2 (D2R) antagonist was given an hour before heat stress, [Ca2+]i decreased and Tr took a longer time to get to 42.0 degrees C. Conclusion. During heat stress, DA mediated PI signal transduction system was activated. The increase of [Ca 2+]i might be mediated by D2R, and D2R antagonist may improve thermotolerance.
