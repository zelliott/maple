PLC-epsilon was identified recently as a phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing phospholipase C (PLC) containing catalytic domains (X, Y, and C2) common to all PLC isozymes as well as unique CDC25- and Ras-associating domains. Novel regulation of this PLC isozyme by the Ras oncoprotein and alpha-subunits (Galpha(12)) of heterotrimeric G proteins was illustrated. Sequence analyses of PLC-epsilon revealed previously unrecognized PH and EF-hand domains in the amino terminus. The known interaction of Gbetagamma subunits with the PH domains of other proteins led us to examine the capacity of Gbetagamma to activate PLC-epsilon. Co-expression of Gbeta(1)gamma(2) with PLC-epsilon in COS-7 cells resulted in marked stimulation of phospholipase C activity. Gbeta(2) and Gbeta(4) in combination with Ggamma(1), Ggamma(2), Ggamma(3), or Ggamma(13) also activated PLC-epsilon to levels similar to those observed with Gbeta(1)-containing dimers of these Ggamma-subunits. Gbeta(3) in combination with the same Ggamma-subunits was less active, and Gbeta(5)-containing dimers were essentially inactive. Gbetagamma-promoted activation of PLC-epsilon was blocked by cotransfection with either of two Gbetagamma-interacting proteins, Galpha(i1) or the carboxyl terminus of G protein receptor kinase 2. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3-kinase-gamma had no effect on Gbeta(1)gamma(2)-promoted activation of PLC-epsilon. Similarly, activation of Ras in the action of Gbetagamma is unlikely, because a mutation in the second RA domain of PLC-epsilon that blocks Ras activation of PLC failed to alter the stimulatory activity of Gbeta(1)gamma(2). Taken together, these results reveal the presence of additional functional domains in PLC-epsilon and add a new level of complexity in the regulation of this novel enzyme by heterotrimeric G proteins.
