The treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma continues to be based on combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Although this treatment strategy produces a high cure rate, short- and long-term toxic effects continue to be problematic for young cured patients. In this review we focus on emerging novel therapies using small molecules that target specific survival pathways in the cancer cells. This approach is aimed at improving the cure rate while reducing treatment-related toxicity.
