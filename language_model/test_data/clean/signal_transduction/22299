The elimination of activated T cells by FAS-mediated signaling is an important immunoregulatory mechanism used to maintain homeostasis and prevent tissue damage. T cell receptor-dependent signals are required to confer sensitivity to FAS-mediated re-stimulation-induced cell death (RICD), however, the nature of these signals is not well understood. In this report, we show, using T cells from CD4-deficient mice reconstituted with a tail-less CD4 transgene, that CD4-dependent signaling events are a critical part of the competency signal required for RICD. This is in part due to defects in FAS receptor signaling complex formation as shown by decreased recruitment of FAS and caspase 8 into lipid rafts following antigen re-stimulation in the absence of CD4-dependent signals. In addition, in the absence of CD4-dependent signals, effector T cells have a selective defect in IL-2 secretion following peptide re-stimulation, while provision of exogenous IL-2 during re-stimulation partially restores susceptibility to RICD. Importantly, IL-2 production and proliferation after primary peptide stimulation is comparable between wild type and CD4-deficient T cells indicating that the requirement for CD4-dependent signaling events for IL-2 production is developmentally regulated and is particularly critical in previously activated effector T cells. In total, our results indicate that CD4 co-receptor dependent signaling events specifically regulate effector T cell survival and function. Further, these data suggest that CD4-dependent signaling events may protect against the decreased IL-2 production and resistance to cell death seen during chronic immune stimulation.
