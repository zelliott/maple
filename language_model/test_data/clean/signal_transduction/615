To investigate the regulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on immune suppressive cytokines in situ colon cancer cells.

The mRNA and protein expression spectrum of TLRs in HT-29 cells were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively. The cytokines and chemokines levels of supernant of HT-29 stimulated by lipoplysaccharide(LPS) were detected with ELISA.

TLR1-9 were expressed in HT-29 cells on mRNA level. After LPS stimulation, TLR4 mRNA and protein expressions were up-regulated in HT-29 cells, and TGF-beta, VEGF, IL-8, CCL20 and IL-6 levels increased significantly(all P<0.01). Except IL-6, up-regulation of the other cytokines was not suppressed by NF-kappa B inhibitor.

TLRs expressed on colon cancer cells may elevate the immune suppressive cytokines and chemokines, which promote the immune escape of cancer cells.
