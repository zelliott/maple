The isoform A of the insulin receptor (IR) (IR-A) is a bifunctional receptor, because it binds both insulin and IGF-II. IR-A activation by IGF-II plays a role in development, but its physiological role in adults is unknown. IGF-II signaling through IR-A is deregulated in cancer and favors tumor progression. We hypothesized that IGF-II binding to the IR-A elicits a unique signaling pathway. In order to obtain an unbiased evaluation of IR-A substrates differentially involved after IGF-II and insulin stimulation, we performed quantitative proteomics of IR-A substrates recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated protein complexes using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture in combination with antiphosphotyrosine antibody pull down and mass spectrometry. Using cells expressing only the human IR-A and lacking the IGF-I receptor, we identified 38 IR-A substrates. Only 10 were known IR mediators, whereas 28 substrates were not previously related to IR signaling. Eleven substrates were recruited by stimulation with both ligands: two equally recruited by IGF-II and insulin, three more strongly recruited by IGF-II, and six more strongly recruited by insulin. Moreover, 14 substrates were recruited solely by IGF-II and 13 solely by insulin stimulation. Interestingly, discoidin domain receptors, involved in cell migration and tumor metastasis, and ephrin receptor B4, involved in bidirectional signaling upon cell-cell contact, were predominantly activated by IGF-II. These findings indicate that IR-A activation by IGF-II elicits a unique signaling pathway that may play a distinct role in physiology and in disease.
