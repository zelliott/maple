Glioblastoma is the most malignant and common brain tumor. To promote their growth, these glioma cells secrete a variety of soluble factors including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which functions as an inhibitor of plasminogen activators. We report here with the basis of microarray gene expression analysis that CXCR4 expressing glioma cells are capable of expressing PAI-1 mRNA and protein upon CXCL12 stimulation. Pretreatment with U0126, an inhibitor of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) 1/2, abrogated CXCL12-induced PAI-1 expression. Pertussis toxin (PTX), an inhibitor of Galpha(i) proteins, also had inhibitory effects, indicating that the activation of Galpha(i) and ERK MAPK are required for this response. Interestingly, CXCL12 showed additive effects with another PAI-1 inducers, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and/or tumor growth factor (TGF)-beta1, in increasing PAI-1 expression. These results indicate that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in glioma cells may be another mechanism for these cells to express PAI-1, which may be involved in angiogenesis and tumor invasion in brain tumors.
