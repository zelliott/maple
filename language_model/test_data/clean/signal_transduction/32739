The molecular events whereby gastrin occupancy of G/CCK(B) receptors leads to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activation have been examined. We report here that this peptide promotes the association between two non-receptor tyrosine kinases, p60Src and p125FAK, and elicits a parallel increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of both kinases. Gastrin-induced PI 3-kinase activity was coprecipitated with p60Src and p125FAK and was inhibited by herbimycin A, the selective Src inhibitor PP-2 or cytochalasin D, which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and prevents p125FAK activity. These results indicate, for the first time, that a p60Src/p125FAK complex acts upstream of the gastrin-stimulated PI 3-kinase pathway.
