To evaluate the significance of murine double minute 2 (MDM2) oncoprotein in human breast cancer as a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, an estrogen receptor (ER) alpha regulator, and a prognostic marker and to study how MDM2 is overexpressed, we investigated its status in tissue samples and examined the correlation between overexpression and MDM2 gene abnormalities, status, and clinicopathological parameters. We detected MDM2 oncoprotein in both nucleus and cytoplasm by frozen-section immunohistochemistry. There was a significant correlation between MDM2 overexpression and low-grade nuclear atypia, absence of lymph node involvement, and increased levels of ER alpha protein. Our molecular assays found no point mutations in Ser17, but there was a correlation between MDM2 overexpression and the lack of splice variant mRNAs. These results suggest that the distribution of MDM2 reflects its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling ability; that interaction between p53 and MDM2 for tumor progression is not enhanced by point mutations at codon 17; and that the expression of MDM2 splice variants is a reason for the lack of its overexpression. MDM2 overexpression correlates with favorable prognostic parameters. A decreased level of MDM2 will lead to a deviation from the ER alpha signaling pathway.
