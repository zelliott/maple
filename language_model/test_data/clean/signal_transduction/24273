Integrin receptors facilitate T cell function by mediating adhesive events critical for T cell trafficking and recognition of foreign antigen, including interactions with vascular endothelium, extracellular matrix components, and antigen-presenting cells. Consequently, the functional activity of integrin receptors is acutely regulated by various intracellular signals delivered by other cell surface receptors, resulting in rapid changes in T cell adhesion and migration. This review highlights recent insights into our understanding of the signaling events by which the CD3/T cell receptor complex and chemokine receptors regulate integrin function and T cell migration. These studies highlight novel functions for several signaling molecules, including the tyrosine kinases Itk and ZAP-70, and the adapter protein SLAP-130/Fyb. In addition, analysis of the regulation of integrin function and chemokine-mediated migration has highlighted the critical role that spatial localization of signaling molecules plays in signal transduction, and the importance of the actin cytoskeleton in T cell function.
