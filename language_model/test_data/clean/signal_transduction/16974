The Nrf2 (NF-E2 related factor 2)-ARE (antioxidant response element) pathway controls a powerful array of endogenous cellular antioxidant systems and is an important pathway in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain. Using a combination of quantitative proteomics and siRNA screening, we have identified novel protective mechanisms of the Nrf2-ARE pathway against oxidative stress in astrocytes. Studies from our lab and others have shown Nrf2 overexpression protects astrocytes from oxidative stress. However, the exact mechanisms by which Nrf2 elicits these effects are unknown. In this study, we show that induction of Nrf2 reduces levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by various oxidative stressors and results in robust cytoprotection. To identify the enzymes responsible for these effects, we used stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and quantitative shotgun proteomics to identify 72 Nrf2-regulated proteins in astrocytes. We hypothesized a subset of these proteins might play a critical role in Nrf2 protection. In order to identify these critical proteins, we used bioinformatics to narrow our target list of proteins and then systematically screened each candidate with siRNA to assess the role of each in Nrf2 protection. We screened each target against H2O2, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and 4-hydroxynonenal and subsequently identified three enzymes-catalase, prostaglandin reductase-1, and peroxiredoxin-6-that are critical for Nrf2-mediated protection in astrocytes.
