Peptide T (PT), an octapeptide fragment located in the V2 region of the HIV-1 gp120-coating protein, appears to be beneficial in the treatment of psoriasis. Our previous investigations suggest that keratinocytes play a key role in conditioning the therapeutic effects of PT in psoriasis. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of PT and the peptidomimetic natural products, Dhurrin and Prunasin, on the expression of the IL-6, IL-8, IL-23, HSP70 and ICAM-1 on IFN-γ and TNF-α-NHEK activated cells. Moreover, we analysed the interference of PT and its analogues through STAT-3 activation. Our results show that the analogues tested exhibit the beneficial biological effects of PT, suggesting the primary role of keratinocytes upon which PT and the peptidomimetics act directly, by reducing proinflammatory responses. Its reduction appears to be important for therapeutic approach in psoriasis pathogenesis.
