The neuropeptide S (NPS)-NPS receptor 1 (NPSR1) pathway has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. The purpose of this study was to identify downstream gene targets regulated by NPSR1 upon NPS stimulation. A total of 104 genes were found significantly up-regulated and 42 down-regulated by microarray analysis 6 h after NPS administration. By Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, the categories 'cell proliferation', 'morphogenesis' and 'immune response' were among the most altered. A TMM microarray database comparison suggested a common co-regulated pathway, which includes JUN/FOS oncogene homologs, early growth response genes, nuclear receptor subfamily 4 members and dual specificity phosphatases. The expression of four up-regulated genes, matrix metallopeptidase 10 (MMP10), INHBA (activin A), interleukin 8 (IL8) and EPH receptor A2 (EPHA2), exhibited a significant NPS dose-response relationship as confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase-PCR and for MMP10 by immunoassay. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that MMP10 and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 (TIMP3) were both strongly expressed in bronchial epithelium, and macrophages and eosinophils expressed MMP10 in asthmatic sputum samples. Because remodeling of airway epithelium is a feature of chronic asthma, the up-regulation of MMP10 and TIMP3 by NPS-NPSR1 signaling may be of relevance in the pathogenesis of asthma.
