Endothelin peptides have been shown to increase cholinergic neurotransmission in the airway. Genetic differences in airway responsiveness to methacholine where reported in mice. The present study compared the airway reactivity to methacholine in C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice, the involvement of endothelin on this reactivity and endothelin levels in lung homogenates. Whole airway reactivity was analyzed by means of an isolated lung preparation where lungs were perfused through the trachea with warm gassed Krebs solution at 5 ml/min, and changes in perfusion pressure triggered by methacholine at increasing bolus doses (0.1-100 microg) were recorded. We found that the maximal airway response to methacholine was much greater in C57Bl/6 than in BALB/c (Emax 34+/-2 vs 12+/-1 cmH(2)O, respectively). Bosentan (mixed endothelin A/B receptor antagonist; 10 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before sacrifice) reduced lung responsiveness to methacholine in C57Bl/6 (58% at EC50 level) but had no effect in BALB/c mouse strain. This effect seems to be mediated by the endothelin ET(A) receptor since it was significantly reduced by the selective endothelin ET(A) receptor antagonist, BQ 123. Immunoreactive endothelin levels were higher in C57Bl/6 than in BALB/c lungs (43+/-5 vs 19+/-5 pg/g of tissue). In conclusion, airway reactivity to methacholine and lung endothelins content varies markedly between C57Bl/6 and BALB/c strains. Endothelins upregulate lung responsiveness to methacholine only in C57Bl/6, an effect achieved through the endothelin ET(A) receptor.
