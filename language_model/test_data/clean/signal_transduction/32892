A cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) designated as striatal enriched phosphatase with a molecular weight of 46 kDa (STEP46) is highly expressed in striatal neurons with dopamine D1-receptors. To examine the hypothesis that STEP46 is involved in the neuronal functions modulated by the cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-signaling system, we introduced the complementary DNA of STEP46 into the pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, which exhibits neuronal differentiation characterized by neurite outgrowth in response to cAMP and nerve growth factor stimulation, and we established subclonal cell lines that constitutively overexpress STEP46 protein with PTPase activity. The subclones expressing STEP46 showed increased neurite outgrowth during differentiation induced by a cAMP analogue (dibutyryl cAMP). The positive regulatory role of STEP46 in the cAMP-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells indicates that STEP46 may play a role in neuronal processes modulated by the cAMP-signaling cascade as a PTPase.
