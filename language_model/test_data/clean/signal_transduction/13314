Secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) modulate neuronal survival and neurotransmitter release. Here we show that sPLA2 (group III) synergistically increases glutamate-induced cell death and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in cultured primary cortical and hippocampal neurons. Whereas 1 microM glutamate elicited transient [Ca2+]i increases in all neurons that recovered 66% to baseline, 25 ng/ml sPLA2 pretreatment resulted in sustained [Ca2+]i increases, with only 5% recovery. At 250 nM glutamate, 25% of neurons failed to respond, and the average recovery time was 101 +/- 12 sec; sPLA2 increased recovery time to 158 +/- 6 sec, and only 2% of cells failed to respond. Both the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801 and the calcium-channel blocker cobalt inhibited this effect. Experiments with the glutamate uptake inhibitor L-trans-pyrollidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (2.5 microM) indicated that glutamate uptake sites are not a likely modulation point by sPLA2, whereas arachidonic acid (AA) potentiated calcium responses to glutamate. Thus the enhancement of glutamate-induced [Ca2+]i increases by sPLA2 may be due to modulation at NMDA receptors and/or calcium channels by AA. These results indicate that sPLA2 affects neuronal responses to both nontoxic (0.1-10 microM) and toxic (=25 microM) concentrations of glutamate, implicating this enzyme in neuronal functions in pathology.
