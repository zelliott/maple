The p21-activated kinases (Paks) are serine/threonine protein kinases that bind to and, in some cases, are stimulated by activated forms of the small GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac. With the recent discovery of several novel isoforms, Paks are now categorized into two subgroups based on architectural similarities. The Group I Paks (Pak1, Pak2, Pak3) have been studied in greater detail and shown to be involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as gene transcription, cell morphology, motility, and apoptosis. Here we summarize recent findings that shed light on the newly recognized Group II Paks (Pak4, Pak5, Pak6) and review both similarities and differences between kinases of the two Pak subgroups.
