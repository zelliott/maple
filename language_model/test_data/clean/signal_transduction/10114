Both the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and Wnt signaling cascades are active in the majority of colorectal cancers. Nevertheless, a direct link between these two key pathways has remained elusive. Recent reports show that one of the bioactive products of COX-2, prostaglandin E2, activates components of the canonical Wnt signaling system. The findings reviewed below reveal important crosstalk between these pathways, which may provide opportunities for the development of new drugs for treatment and/or prevention of colorectal cancer.
