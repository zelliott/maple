Integrin activity on cells such as T lymphocytes is tightly controlled. Here we demonstrate a key role for lipid rafts in regulating integrin function. Without stimulation integrin LFA-1 is excluded from lipid rafts, but following activation LFA-1 is mobilised to the lipid raft compartment. An LFA-1 construct from which the I domain has been deleted mimics activated integrin and is constitutively found in lipid rafts. This correlation between integrin activation and raft localisation extends to a second integrin, alpha4beta1, and the clustering of alpha4beta1 is also raft dependent. Both LFA-1 and alpha4beta1-mediated adhesion is dependent upon intact lipid rafts providing proof of the functional relevance of the lipid raft localisation. Finally we find that non-raft integrins are excluded from the rafts by cytoskeletal constraints. The presence of integrin in lipid rafts under stimulating conditions that activate these receptors strongly indicates that the rafts have a key role in positively regulating integrin activity.
