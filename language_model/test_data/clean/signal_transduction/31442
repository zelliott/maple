Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is, without doubt, the neurotransmitter for which the number of receptors is the highest. Fifteen genes encoding functional 5-HT receptors have been cloned in mammalian brain. 5-HT(3) receptors are ionotropic receptors, whereas all the others are metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 5-HT receptor diversity is further increased by post-genomic modifications, such as alternative splicing (up to 10 splice variants for the 5-HT(4) receptor) or by mRNA editing in the case of 5-HT(2C) receptors. The cellular and behavioral implications of 5-HT(2C) receptor editing are of great physiological importance. Signaling of 5-HT receptors involves a great variety of pathways, but only some of these have been demonstrated in neurons. The classical view of neurotransmitter receptors localized within the synaptic cleft cannot be applied to 5-HT receptors, which are mostly (but not exclusively) localized at extra-synaptic locations either pre- or post-synaptically. 5-HT receptors are engaged in pre- or post-synaptic complexes composed of many GPCR-interacting proteins. The functions of these proteins are starting to be revealed. These proteins have been implicated in targeting, trafficking to or from the membrane, desensitization, and fine-tuning of signaling.
