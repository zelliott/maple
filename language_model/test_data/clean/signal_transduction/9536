The possibility to induce myocardial regeneration by the activation of resident cardiac stem cells (CSCs) has raised great interest. However, to propose endogenous CSCs as therapeutic options, a better understanding of the complex mechanisms controlling heart morphogenesis is needed, including the cellular and molecular interactions that cardiomyocyte precursors establish with cells of the stromal compartment. In the present study, we co-cultured immature cardiomyocytes from neonatal mouse hearts with mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to investigate whether these cells could influence cardiomyocyte growth in vitro. We found that cardiomyocyte proliferation was enhanced by direct co-culture with MSCs compared with the single cultures. We also showed that the proliferative response of the neonatal cardiomyocytes involved the activation of Notch-1 receptor by its ligand Jagged-1 expressed by the adjacent MSCs. In fact, the cardiomyocytes in contact with MSCs revealed a stronger immunoreactivity for the activated Notch-intracellular domain (Notch-ICD) as compared with those cultured alone and this response was significantly attenuated when MSCs were silenced for Jagged-1. The presence of various cardiotropic cytokines and growth factors in the conditioned medium of MSCs underscored the contribution of paracrine mechanisms to Notch-1 up-regulation by the cardiomyocytes. In conclusions these findings unveil a previously unrecognized function of MSCs in regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation through Notch-1/Jagged-1 pathway and suggest that stromal-myocardial cell juxtacrine and paracrine interactions may contribute to the development of new and more efficient cell-based myocardial repair strategies.
