The Notch signaling plays a key role in cell differentiation, survival, and proliferation through diverse mechanisms. Thus, alterations of the Notch signaling can lead to a variety of disorders including human malignancies. In this review, we will focus on recent advancements in identification of aberrant Notch signaling in cancer, and the possible underlying mechanisms in breast cancer. We will also highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting Notch for cancer treatment.
