During development of the limb Shh plays a key role as a mediator of zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). However, the molecular mechanisms by which Shh directs anterior/posterior patterning in the limb remain unknown. Members of the Gli gene family encode zinc-finger transcription factors and represent likely candidates for being regulators of Shh target genes. In this review we would like to summarize the current knowledge on expression and function of Gli genes in limb development.
