To determine whether 12-myristate 13-acetate phorbol ester (PMA) can increase hyperactivated motility of human sperm.

A controlled pharmacological study using computer-assisted semen analysis.

Andrology laboratory in a medical research institution.

Normal semen was obtained from 48 men.

Washed sperm were exposed to different concentrations of PMA alone or with P and pentoxifylline (PTX) for up to 2 hours and sperm motility measured by a computer-assisted semen analyzer.

The percentage of sperm with hyperactivated motility was determined from the motility parameters: curvilinear velocity, linearity, and maximum amplitude of lateral head displacement.

Phorbol ester PMA increased hyperactivated motility in a dose- and time-dependent manner. At 1 hour, the average increases in hyperactivated motility were as follows: 2 microM, 4.8% +/- 1.5%; 6 microM, 9.6% +/- 1.5%; and 20 microM, 11.3% +/- 2.2%. The PMA effect was not altered when P or PTX were added although each separately had a positive effect on hyperactivation.

Phorbol ester PMA stimulates human sperm hyperactivated motility, indicating the involvement of protein kinase C in the signal transduction pathway.
