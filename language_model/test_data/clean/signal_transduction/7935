The DNA damage checkpoint is a signal transduction pathway that integrates DNA repair with cell cycle arrest and other cellular responses. The checkpoint response is also directly associated with mutagenic translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). For example, checkpoint activation requires complexes with roles in TLS regulation, and leads to elevated mutation levels. A role in TLS regulation implies that the checkpoint contributes to the generation of mutations, rather than their prevention. It can also explain several currently obscure aspects of this response.
