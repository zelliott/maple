Cardiac hypertrophy is a key structural feature of diabetic cardiomyopathy in the late stage of diabetes. Recent studies show that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy in diabetic mice, but more novel miRNAs remain to be investigated. In this study, diabetic cardiomyopathy, characterized by hypertrophy, was induced in mice by streptozotocin injection. Using microarray analysis of myocardial tissue, we were able to identify changes in expression in 19 miRNA, of which 16 miRNAs were further validated by real-time PCR and a total of 3212 targets mRNA were predicted. Further analysis showed that 31 GO functions and 16 KEGG pathways were enriched in the diabetic heart. Of these, MAPK signaling pathway was prominent. In vivo and in vitro studies have confirmed that three major subgroups of MAPK including ERK1/2, JNK, and p38, are specifically upregulated in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy during hyperglycemia. To further explore the potential involvement of miRNAs in the regulation of glucose-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to high glucose and transfected with miR-373 mimic. Overexpression of miR-373 decreased the cell size, and also reduced the level of its target gene MEF2C, and miR-373 expression was regulated by p38. Our data highlight an important role of miRNAs in diabetic cardiomyopathy, and implicate the reliability of bioinformatics analysis in shedding light on the mechanisms underlying diabetic cardiomyopathy.
