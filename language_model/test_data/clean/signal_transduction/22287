A molecular approach to enhance the antitumour activity of topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitors relies on the use of chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases (PARP). Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle progression and cell death. Recent findings showed that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 and PARP-2 counteract camptothecin action facilitating resealing of DNA strand breaks. Moreover, repair of DNA strand breaks induced by poisoned TOP1 is slower in the presence of PARP inhibitors, leading to increased toxicity. In the present study we compared the effects of the camptothecin derivative topotecan (TPT), and the PARP inhibitor PJ34, in breast (MCF7) and cervix (HeLa) carcinoma cells either PARP-1 proficient or silenced, both BRCA1/2(+/+) and p53(+/+). HeLa and MCF7 cell lines gave similar results: (i) TPT-dependent cell growth inhibition and cell cycle perturbation were incremented by the presence of PJ34 and a 2 fold increase in toxicity was observed in PARP-1 stably silenced HeLa cells; (ii) higher levels of DNA strand breaks were found in cells subjected to TPT+PJ34 combined treatment; (iii) PARP-1 and -2 modification was evident in TPT-treated cells and was reduced by TPT+PJ34 combined treatment; (iv) concomitantly, a reduction of soluble/active TOP1 was observed. Furthermore, TPT-dependent induction of p53, p21 and apoptosis were found 24-72h after treatment and were increased by PJ34 both in PARP-1 proficient and silenced cells. The characterization of such signaling network can be relevant to a strategy aimed at overcoming acquired chemoresistance to TOP1 inhibitors.
