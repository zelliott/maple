We tested the involvement of protein tyrosine kinase and G-protein transducing pathways in the formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) during exocytosis in mouse spermatozoa. In capacitated spermatozoa, stimulation with solubilized zona pellucida (ZP) or progesterone led to the formation of DAG and to exocytosis of the acrosomal granule. Stimulation of DAG formation and exocytosis by ZP were inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by pre-exposure to tyrphostin A48, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. These ZP-induced responses were also reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by prior incubation with pertussis toxin, a G-protein (Gi class) inhibitor. On the other hand, generation of DAG and exocytosis triggered by progesterone were inhibited if spermatozoa were preincubated with different concentrations of tyrphostin A48, but were not affected by pre-exposure to pertussis toxin. Progesterone acts on at least two novel surface receptors, one being a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A (GABAA)-like receptor. Transducing mechanisms coupled to this receptor were tested directly by stimulating spermatozoa with GABA. Treatment of capacitated spermatozoa with GABA resulted in DAG formation and exocytosis. These responses were not seen when cells were preincubated with tyrphostin A48. Pertussis toxin, however, did not affect the generation of DAG and exocytosis triggered by GABA, in agreement with results obtained using progesterone. Taken together, these results indicate that DAG formation during acrosomal exocytosis is differentially regulated by transducing pathways activated by oocyte-associated agonists.
