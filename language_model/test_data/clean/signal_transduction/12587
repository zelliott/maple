Interactions between inhibitors of the proteasome and histone deacetylases have been examined in human T-leukemia/lymphoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Co-exposure of cells to bortezomib and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) synergistically induces T-leukemia/lymphoma cells to undergo apoptosis, consistent with a significant increase in mitochondrial injury and caspase activation. These events are accompanied by inhibition of cyto-protective signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, Raf-1/mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and AKT pathways, and activation of stress-related cascades, including the stress-activated kinases c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK). Moreover, bortezomib in conjunction with SAHA efficiently induces apoptosis of primary T-leukemia/lymphoma cells and inhibits tumor growth in a murine xenograft model established with subcutaneous injection of Jurkat cells. Taken together, these findings confirm the synergistic anti-tumor effect of the proteasome and histone deacetylase inhibitors, and provide an insight into the future clinical applications of bortezomib-SAHA combining regimen in treating T-cell malignancies.
