The subcellular localization of ion channels to discrete microdomains is critical for proper electrical signaling in the cardiovascular system. Ion channels are important components of many signal transduction pathways; therefore, this localization ensures that the channels are located in proximity to the signaling molecules that modulate them, permitting dynamic regulation of cardiovascular function. However, little is known about the mechanisms governing the subcellular localization of ion channels. Whereas protein-protein interactions play an important role in ion channel localization, the recent discovery of ion channels in sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich lipid rafts presents a novel mechanism for ion channel localization. Furthermore, many signaling proteins are localized to lipid rafts, including several that play an important role in cardiovascular function. This review focuses on the localization of cardiovascular ion channels to lipid rafts and its impact on channel function.
