Quorum sensing is an important mechanism for the regulation of genes in many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the absence of one or more components of the quorum-sensing system results in a significant reduction in virulence. Recent advances in the past year have demonstrated that the quorum-sensing signal molecule 3O-C(12)-HSL is also a potent stimulator of multiple eukaryotic cells and thus may alter the host response during P. aeruginosa infections. Therefore, via the regulation of multiple factors and the production of 3O-C(12)-HSL, quorum-sensing systems have a significant effect on the virulence of the bacteria and also on how the host responds to P. aeruginosa infections.
