Organogenesis involves a dynamic balance of the mechanisms regulating cell division, differentiation and death. The development of the chicken embryo inner ear offers a well-characterised model at the morphological level to study which signals are implicated in the modulation of cellular activation and commitment. The early developmental decisions that control the origin of the inner ear elements are just beginning to be identified by complementary in vivo and in vitro studies. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and nerve growth factor (NGF) are among the best characterised diffusible factors acting during inner ear development. Although the cellular actions of these factors are beginning to be understood, the signalling pathways triggered by them still remain largely unknown. In this context, viral vehicles can be used to deliver genes and then analyse their functional roles during inner ear development. A model is proposed where the actions of IGF-I and NGF contribute to the combinatorial expression of Jun and Fos family members in particular domains of the otic vesicle. Some of these mechanisms may be also implicated in otic regeneration.
