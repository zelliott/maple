The degeneracy of the genetic code allows for multiple codons to encode the same amino acid. However, alternative codons and amino acids are used unevenly among genes, a phenomenon termed codon-usage bias. Genes regulating amino acid biosynthesis of Salinibacter ruber, an extremely halophilic bacterium were studied in order to determine the synonymous codon usage patterns. Factors responsible for codon usage variation among the genes were investigated using codon usage indices and multi-variate statistical approach. Overall codon usage data analysis indicated that codons ending in G and/or C were predominant among the genes. Multi-variate statistical analysis showed that there was a single major trend in the codon usage variation among the genes, which had a strong positive correlation (r = 0.93, P < 0.01) with (G + C) content of the genes. Further, correlation analysis indicated that genes with higher expression level and showing a greater degree of codon usage bias were GC-rich and preferred codons with C or G nucleotides at the third position. A set of thirteen codons were identified through Chi-square test as optimal codons, which were preferred in highly expressed genes. It could be concluded that mutational bias had a profound effect on codon usage pattern. In addition, translational selections also operated with a proper balance, making the genes translationally more efficient. The frequency of these codons appeared to be correlated with the level of gene expression and might be a useful indicator in the case of genes (or open-reading-frames) whose expression levels are unknown.
