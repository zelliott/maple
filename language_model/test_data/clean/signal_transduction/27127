1. Extracellular recordings from rat mesenteric paravascular nerve bundles were made in order to characterize the responses of different populations of afferents supplying the small intestine to intravenous cholecystokinin (CCK; in the form of sulphated CCK8). 2. Approximately 70% of mesenteric nerve bundles contained CCK-sensitive afferent fibres. Responsive afferents had low spontaneous discharge (1.6 +/- 0.3 impulses s-1) and showed a 14-fold increase in firing at the peak of the response to 50 pmol CCK with the overall response lasting several minutes. The onset of the response occurred after a latency of (3.9 +/- 0.1 s) following i.v. administration of CCK, which corresponds largely to the circulation delay in these animals. The threshold dose of CCK was < 5 pmol. 3. The response to 100 pmol CCK was completely abolished by devazepide (0.5 mg kg-1) and by chronic subdiaphragmatic vagotomy performed 10-14 days prior to experimentation, indicating that CCK sensitivity was via CCKA receptors and exclusively mediated via vagal afferents rather than splanchnic or enteric afferents. 4. Evidence that CCK-sensitive afferents had mucosal receptive fields was indicated by the lack of any response to luminal distension and the sensitivity of the CCK response to luminal anaesthesia. Furthermore, CCK-sensitive afferents responded to luminal hydrochloric acid (50 mM) in a slowly adapting manner. The response to acid was significantly reduced (P < 0.005), but not abolished, by devazepide at a time when the response to exogenous CCK had been completely eliminated. 5. The exquisite sensitivity of some vagal mucosal afferents to CCK suggests that they may play a physiological role in the reflex and behavioural consequences of CCK release from the small intestine, possibly acting in a paracrine fashion. However, this sensitivity to CCK represents only one aspect of the broad chemosensitivity of these mucosal afferents and is not an obligatory component of the signal transduction pathway.
