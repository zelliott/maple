Osteoclasts are hematopoietic cells essential for bone resorption. To study the derivation of these interesting cells, we developed a stepwise culture system where stromal cells promote embryonic stem (ES) cells to differentiate into mature osteoclasts. Three phases to this differentiation process include (1) induction of hematopoiesis, along with the generation of osteoclast precursors, (2) expansion of these precursors, and (3) terminal differentiation into mature osteoclasts in the presence of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamine D3 . Although the transition of ES cells to the hematopoietic lineage was not blocked by an antibody to c-fms, later phases were dependent on a signaling through this transmembrane receptor as indicated by the finding that anti-c-fms treatment of cells in the second and third phases reduced the number of osteoclasts produced by 75% and more than 99%, respectively. Blockade of signaling through another tyrosine kinase-type receptor, c-kit, did not affect any stages of osteoclastogenesis, although generation of other hemopoietic lineages was reduced to less than 10% of untreated. When small numbers of ES cells were directly cultured under conditions that promote osteoclast differentiation, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells were observed at the edge but not inside of colonies. This suggests that some types of cell-cell interactions may inhibit development of mature osteoclasts. The culture system developed here provides an important tool for osteoclast biology.
