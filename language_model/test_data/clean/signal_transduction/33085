With limitation to the "proinflammatory program" induced in endothelial cells by exposure to interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6, we review the available data on the signaling for these three cytokines, from receptor engagement to induction of gene transcription. Only a few molecular pathways have been characterized so far, and key issues in endothelial biology, such as endothelial specificity of gene expression and heterogeneity of different endothelial populations, remain largely unexplored.
