Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The NADPH oxidase constitutes a major source of superoxide anion in phagocytic cells, and its activation is associated with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 secretion by these cells. We investigated the effects of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan and its metabolites (EXP3174 and EXP3179) on NADPH oxidase activity and MMP-9 secretion in human phagocytic cells. EXP3179, but not losartan and EXP3174, dose-dependently inhibited (P<0.05) phorbol myristate acetate and insulin-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity. EXP3179 also inhibited phorbol myristate acetate-induced NADPH oxidase in endothelial cells. In addition, EXP3179 inhibited (P<0.05) both phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated p47phox translocation from cytosol to membranes and protein kinase C activity. Affinity experiments and enzymatic assays confirmed that EXP3179 inhibited several protein kinase C isoforms. EXP3179 also inhibited (P<0.05) phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated MMP-9 secretion. In a study performed in 153 hypertensive patients, phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity was lower (P<0.05) in losartan-treated compared with untreated patients and in patients treated with other angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists or with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Plasma levels of MMP-9 were lower (P<0.05) in losartan-treated hypertensives compared with the other group of patients. Thus, EXP3179 acts as a blocker of the NADPH oxidase in phagocytic cells by a potential mechanism that targets the protein kinase C signaling pathway. This effect can be involved in reduced MMP-9 secretion by these cells. It is proposed that the EXP3179 metabolite may confer to losartan the specific capacity to reduce oxidative stress mediated by phagocytic cells in hypertensive patients.
