Astrocytes were identified about 150 years ago, and, for the longest time, were considered to be supporting cells in the brain providing trophic, metabolic, and structural support for neural networks. Research in the last 2 decades has uncovered many novel molecules in astrocytes and the finding that astrocytes communicate with neurons via Ca2+ signaling, which leads to release of chemical transmitters, termed gliotransmitters, has led to renewed interest in their biology. This chapter will briefly review the unique morphology and molecular properties of astrocytes. The reader will be introduced to the role of astrocytes in blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintenance, in Ca2+ signaling, in synaptic transmission, in CNS synaptogenesis, and as neural progenitor cells. Mention is also made of the diseases in which astrocyte dysfunction has a role.
