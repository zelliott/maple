The relationship between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase-positive neurons and blood vessels was investigated within the rat basal ganglia. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase-positive cell bodies, dendrites or axon-like processes surrounding many but not all blood vessels were observed in the caudate-putamen, ventral pallidum, medial part of the globus pallidus, substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. It is concluded that this close relationship contributes to the local vasodilator effect of nitric oxide in the regulation of blood flow in cerebral blood vessels.
