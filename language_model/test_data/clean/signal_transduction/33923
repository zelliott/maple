G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have ubiquitous roles in transducing extracellular signals into cellular responses. Therefore, the concept that members of this superfamily of surface proteins are directly modulated by changes in membrane voltage could have widespread consequences for cell signalling. Although several studies have indicated that GPCRs can be voltage dependent, particularly P2Y(1) receptors in the non-excitable megakaryocyte, the evidence has been mostly indirect. Recent work on muscarinic receptors has stimulated substantial interest in this field by reporting the first voltage-dependent charge movements for a GPCR. An underlying mechanism is proposed whereby a voltage-induced conformational change in the receptor alters its ability to couple to the G protein and thereby influences its affinity for an agonist. We discuss the strength of the evidence behind this hypothesis and include suggestions for future work. We also describe other examples in which direct voltage control of GPCRs can account for effects of membrane potential on downstream signals and highlight the possible physiological consequences of this phenomenon.
