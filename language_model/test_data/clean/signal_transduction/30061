We demonstrated recently that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are able to induce apoptosis of resting human lymphocytes as well as Jurkat lymphoblastic T cells. We now analyzed the signaling pathway involved in apoptosis mediated by human HLA class I allele-specific mAb OK2F3 and mouse monomorphic mAb W6/32. An inhibitor of a broad spectrum of caspases had only a moderate inhibiting effect, and an inhibitor of caspase 3 failed to inhibit HLA class I-mediated apoptosis. Although caspase 3 activation was not observed, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was found in half of the apoptotic cells. Importantly, the mitochondrio-nuclear redistribution of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), a caspase-independent mitochondrial death effector, was detected after 1 hour of treatment with human anti-HLA mAb and was associated with large-scale DNA fragmentation, whereas the release of cytochrome c, which is responsible for caspase-dependent internucleosomal fragmentation, followed AIF translocation and occurred after 2 hours. Our results indicate that apoptosis mediated through HLA class I molecules represents a unique mechanism of cell death in Jurkat T lymphoblasts that involves two parallel pathways, one caspase-independent and the other caspase-dependent. This study clarifies the precise mechanism of anti-HLA antibody-induced apoptosis which might have clinical implications.
