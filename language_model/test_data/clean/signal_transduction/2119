A rearranged TCR alpha transgene remains transcriptionally inactive in rag-2-/- thymocytes but can be induced by CD3-mediated signals with concomitant maturation of double-negative (DN) thymocytes to the CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) stage. Reciprocally, the same signals silence pre-TCR alpha (pT alpha) expression. In normal C57BL/6 thymocytes, TCR alpha expression is not detected in DN thymocytes while, in contrast, TCR beta expression is initiated at the most immature c-kit+CD44+CD25- stage and continues throughout thymocyte development. pT alpha expression is first detected at the intermediate c-kit +/- CD44+CD25+ DN stage, increases during transition to the more mature c-kit-CD44-CD25+ stage and is lost at the DP stage. Thus, although TCR beta and pT alpha expression are independent, the pre-TCR complex mediates signals controlling the appearance of alpha beta TCR through selective regulation of TCR alpha and pT alpha genes.
