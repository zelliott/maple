Activation of the kinase cascade (protein kinase C (PKC), tyrosine kinase (TK), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a key feature of the transduction pathway, elicited by preconditioning signals and mediating their cardioprotective effects. We assessed whether such an activation occurred during cardiac operations and could thus represent a target for cardioprotective strategies.

A total of 20 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery were studied. During the first 10 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), 10 were treated with sevoflurane (2.5 minimum alveolar concentration), an inhalational anesthetic that mimics preconditioning through a similar activation of the kinase cascade. Ten case-matched patients undergoing 10 minutes of sevoflurane-free CPB served as controls. Right atrial biopsies were taken before and 10 minutes after CPB and were then processed for the measurement of PKC, TK, and p38 MAPK activities by enzyme assay techniques. Troponin I was also monitored over the first 2 postoperative days.

Compared with pre-CPB values, PKC and p38 MAPK activities (in nanomoles per milligram of protein per minute and arbitrary units, respectively) increased significantly and to the same extent in both groups: PKC, from 20.7+/-0.7 to 29.9+/-3.9 in controls (p = 0.037) and from 18.4+/-1.1 to 23.9+/-1.8 in sevoflurane (p = 0.016); p38 MAPK, from 88.6+/-8.5 to 312.9+/-66.2 in controls (p = 0.005) and from 114.6+/-14.7 to 213.4+/-51.8 in sevoflurane (p = 0.045). Conversely, sevoflurane triggered a significant increase in TK activity (from 68.5+/-1.4 to 83.7+/-2.9 picomoles per milligram of protein per minute p = 0.0015) which did not occur in controls (from 67.5+/-1.9 to 76.8+/-4.2 picomoles per milligram of protein per minute, p = 0.09). Likewise, the peak postoperative value of troponin I was not different between controls and sevoflurane-treated patients (3.4+/-0.6 vs 2.4+/-0.4, p = 0.21).

Cardiopulmonary bypass triggers an activation of the kinase cascade that is mechanistically linked to opening of potassium channels. The direct opening of these channels by the anesthetic sevoflurane does not increase kinase activation further, nor does it improve markers of cell necrosis, thus suggesting that pharmacologically targeting potassium channels may overlap the preconditioning-like effects of CPB alone.
