Polyomaviruses are highly suspected to be involved in the development of cancer. A strong correlation has been established between the activity of an early viral genome and the development of a transformed phenotype. Polyomavirus transforming antigens (T-antigens) are the major suspects in the process of deregulating cellular equilibrium. Multiple interactions between T-antigens and cellular regulatory proteins have been detected at different regulatory levels including signal transduction, gene expression, cell cycle progression, and possible DNA repair. In this context, we are reviewing the most recent experimental evidence which, in combination with more than thirty years of studies of polyomaviruses, could help us understand whether and how viral infection contributes to the development of malignant transformation.
