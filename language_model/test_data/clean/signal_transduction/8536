Time course microarray data consist of mRNA expression from a common set of genes collected at different time points. Such data are thought to reflect underlying biological processes developing over time. In this article, we propose a model that allows us to examine differential expression and gene network relationships using time course microarray data. We model each gene-expression profile as a random functional transformation of the scale, amplitude, and phase of a common curve. Inferences about the gene-specific amplitude parameters allow us to examine differential gene expression. Inferences about measures of functional similarity based on estimated time-transformation functions allow us to examine gene networks while accounting for features of the gene-expression profiles. We discuss applications to simulated data as well as to microarray data on prostate cancer progression.
