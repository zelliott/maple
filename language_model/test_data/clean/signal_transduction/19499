We have been extensively investigating the mechanisms by which neuropeptides regulate feeding behavior by using a goldfish (Carassius auratus) model. In this species, the anorexigenic action of melanocortin peptide is centrally mediated via the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)/CRH receptor neuronal system, whereas sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8s) is involved in the appetite regulation as a peripheral anorexigenic factor. The aim of the present study was to identify the mechanism of the anorexigenic effect of peripherally injected CCK-8s, which has not yet been identified in goldfish. Co-administration of capsaicin, a neurotoxin that destroys primary sensory afferents, at 100 nmol/g BW, blocked the anorexigenic action of intraperitoneally injected CCK-8s (100 pmol/g BW), whereas the anorexigenic action of intracerebroventricularly injected CCK-8s (5 pmol/g BW) was not blocked by co-administration of capsaicin. Pre-treatment with a specific CRH receptor antagonist, Î±-helical CRH((9-41)), attenuated the anorexigenic action of CCK-8s. The expression level of CRH mRNA in the diencephalic tissue of the CCK-8s-injected group was not changed, but the level of proopiomelanocortin mRNA was significantly increased at 1h after treatment. Therefore, we have identified for the first time that the reduction of appetite induced by peripherally injected CCK-8s in goldfish appears to be mediated by the vagal afferent and subsequently through the melanocortin- and corticotropin-releasing hormone-signaling pathways.
