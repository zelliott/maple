To observe matrine-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells in relation to activation of the apoptotic pathway in vitro.

K562 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of matrine at different concentrations for 4 days, and the morphological and ultramicrostructural changes of the cells were observed using inverted microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The expression of apoptosis-related protein p27kip1 was detected by immunocytochemistry.

Compared to untreated K562 cells, the cells treated with matrine at 0.10 g/L exhibited apoptostic characteristics in the cellular morphology and ultramicrostructure, with the expression of p27kip1 protein upregulated in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.

Matrine-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells is associated with cell apoptosis, and upregulation of p27kip1 protein expression may play a crucial role in the process of apoptosis.
