The regulation of prostaglandin (PG) production by the uterine decidua may be an important mechanism controlling the onset and maintenance of human parturition. The present in vitro study has evaluated the potential for endothelin-1 (ET-1) to activate cell signalling and PGE2 alpha production in human primary decidua cell cultures. ET-1 stimulated a dose-dependent increase in inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and PG precursor release as evidenced by respective increases in [3H] inositol monophosphate accumulation and [14C] arachidonate release from radiolabelled decidua cells. PGF2 alpha production was increased in some but not all cell preparations in response to ET-1 alone. Pretreatment of decidua cells with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) enhanced PGF2 alpha production but not arachidonate release in response to ET-1. These in vitro observations support a possible role for ET-1 in the regulation of decidual PG production during parturition.
