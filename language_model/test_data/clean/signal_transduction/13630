Recently, it has been reported that testosterone membrane signaling regulates actin reorganization and induces pro-apoptotic responses in colon tumor cells. In the present study the membrane androgen receptors (mARs)-induced activation of Rac1 GTPase and the involvement of PI3K/Rac1 signaling in controlling the apoptotic responses in testosterone treated Caco2 colon cancer cells has been analyzed. In line with previous findings, activation of mAR by testosterone conjugates triggered early and transient actin reorganization as indicated by the significant decrease of the G/Total actin ratio after 15- and 30-min treatment of the cells. Interestingly, stimulation of mAR rapidly activated the Rac1 GTPase. This effect was evident after 15 min and persisted for at least 24 h. Testosterone induced Rac1 activation was fully blocked in Caco2 cells pre-treated with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, indicating that Rac1 signaling is acting downstream of the PI3K pathway. Remarkably, when cells were pre-treated with wortmannin that blocks the PI3K/Rac1 signaling, apoptotic response was almost fully inhibited. These finding suggest that Rac1 activation, triggering actin redistribution, is involved in testosterone induced pro-apoptotic responses governed by mAR activation and emphasize the regulatory role of PI3K/Rac1 signaling in colon tumors.
