The regulatory (R) subunit is the cAMP receptor of protein kinase A. Following cAMP binding, the inactive PKA holoenzyme complex separates into two active catalytic (C) subunits and a cAMP-bound R dimer. Thus far, only monomeric R structures have been solved, which fell short in explaining differences of cAMP binding for the full-length protein as compared to the truncated R subunits. Here we solved a full-length R-dimer structure that reflects the biologically relevant conformation, and this structure agrees well with small angle X-ray scattering. An isoform-specific interface is revealed between the protomers. This interface acts as an intermolecular sensor for cAMP and explains the cooperative character of cAMP binding to the RIÎ± dimer. Mutagenesis of residues on this interface not only leads to structural and biochemical changes, but is also linked to Carney complex disease.
