Neuropeptide Y (NPY) elevates the permeability of cultured rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) in monolayer cultures under hypoxic conditions (5% O(2)) possibly by binding to the NPY Y(3) receptor. The present study evaluated the effects of NPY compared to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). RAECs were cultured on the upper chamber base of a double-chamber culture system, FITC-labeled albumin was introduced into the chamber, and permeation into the lower chamber was measured. Treatment was with 3 x 10(-7) M NPY or 10(-7) g/ml VEGF for 2 h along with specific inhibitors. The VEGF receptor-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin SU-1498 and the protein kinase C inhibitor bis-indolylmaleimide I (GF-109203X) suppressed the VEGF-induced increase in monolayer permeability but not that caused by NPY. Furthermore, although the action of NPY was blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by phospholipase C inhibitor 1-(6-[[(17beta)-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U-73122), it was less sensitive than VEGF. However, the effects of both NPY and VEGF on the permeability of the RAEC monolayer were blocked with equal concentration dependence by STI571 (imatinib mesylate), which is an inhibitor of Abl tyrosine kinase in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm. The myosin light-chain kinase inhibitor 1-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine HCl (ML-9) suppressed both NPY- and VEGF-induced increment in permeability by approximately 70%, whereas the calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitor DY-9760e could decrease to below the baseline. These results indicate that the NPY Y(3)-receptor subtype is specifically linked to the effects of STI571 on endothelial cells, and that NPY, a sympathetic coneurotransmitter, may increase vascular permeability in association with altered intracellular or nuclear signal transduction.
