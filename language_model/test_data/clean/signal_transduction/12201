The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAKs/STATs) pathway in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Sixty specific pathogen-free male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: a model group (MG) and a control group (CG). In the MG group, nephropathy was induced by unilateral nephrectomy and a single tail vein injection of adriamycin (5 mg/kg). Ten rats were sacrificed every 2 weeks in each group. The expressions of smooth muscle alpha actin (alpha-SMA), collagen (COL)-IV, STAT1, and STAT3 were examined using histochemical techniques, and Western blotting was used to examine the protein levels of STAT1, STAT3, phosphorylated (P)-STAT1, P-STAT3, and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta(1)). The expressions of JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT3, suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1, SOCS3, protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS)1, and PIAS3 were also measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. A steady and significant increase in the expressions of alpha-SMA, COL-IV and TGFbeta(1) were observed in MG rats over the whole experimental course. Increased STAT1 and P-STAT1 levels in MG rats were observed by week 6, whereas increased levels of STAT3 and P-STAT3 were noted by week 2. At the mRNA levels, JAK1, STAT1, and PIAS1 were significantly increased in MG rats in week 2, whereas JAK2 mRNA showed a significant decrease by weeks 2 and 4, followed by an significant increase in week 6. Significantly increased STAT3 levels were noted in week 2, followed by a steady and significant decrease in weeks 4 and 6. Significantly reduced levels of SOCS1, SOCS3, and PIAS3 mRNA were noted at all time points. We conclude that the JAKs/STATs signaling pathway may play an important role in the pathological process of rapid focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in the rat model.
