Analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana endomembrane system has shown that plant cell viability depends on a properly functioning vacuole and intact vesicular trafficking. The endomembrane system is also essential for various aspects of plant development and signal transduction. In this review, we discuss examples of these newly discovered roles for the endomembrane system in plants, and new experimental approaches and technologies that are based on high-throughput screens, which combine chemical genetics and automated confocal microscopy.
