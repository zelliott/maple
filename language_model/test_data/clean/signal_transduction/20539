To reveal specific gene activation in nitric oxide (NO)-related inflammation we studied differential gene expression in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Total RNA was isolated from 20 biopsies of inflamed mucosa from Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients each as well as from six controls, labeled with (32)P-dCTP and hybridized to a human NO gene array. Significant genes were analyzed for functional gene interactions and heatmaps generated by hierarchical clustering. A selection of differentially expressed genes was further evaluated with immunohistochemical staining.

Significant gene expression differences were found for 19 genes in CD and 23 genes in UC compared to controls, both diseases with high expression of ICAM1 and IL-8. Correlation between microarray expression and corresponding protein expression was significant (r = 0.47, p = 0.002). Clustering analysis together with functional gene interaction analysis revealed clusters of coregulation and coexpression in CD and UC: transcripts involved in angiogenesis, inflammatory response mediated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1, and tissue fibrosis. Also, a fourth cluster with transcripts regulated by the transcription factor Sp1 was found in UC.

Expression analysis in CD and UC revealed disease-specific regulation of NO-related genes, which might be involved in perpetuating inflammatory disease activity in IBD.
