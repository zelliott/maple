Anesthetic and ischemic preconditioning share similar signal transduction pathways. The authors tested the hypothesis that the beta1-adrenergic signal transduction pathway mediates anesthetic and ischemic preconditioning in vivo.

Pentobarbital-anesthetized (30 mg/kg) rabbits (n = 96) were instrumented for measurement of systemic hemodynamics and subjected to 30 min of coronary artery occlusion and 3 h of reperfusion. Sixty minutes before occlusion, vehicle (control), 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration desflurane, or sevoflurane, and esmolol (30.0 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) were administered for 30 min, respectively. Administration of a single 5-min cycle of ischemic preconditioning was instituted 35 min before coronary artery occlusion. In separate groups, the selective blocker esmolol or the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 (250 microg/kg) was given alone and in combination with desflurane, sevoflurane, and ischemic preconditioning.

Baseline hemodynamics and area at risk were not significantly different between groups. Myocardial infarct size (triphenyltetrazolium staining) as a percentage of area at risk was 61 +/- 4% in control. Desflurane, sevoflurane, and ischemic preconditioning reduced infarct size to 34 +/- 2, 36 +/- 5, and 23 +/- 3%, respectively. Esmolol did not alter myocardial infarct size (65 +/- 5%) but abolished the protective effects of desflurane and sevoflurane (57 +/- 4 and 52 +/- 4%, respectively) and attenuated ischemic preconditioning (40 +/- 4%). H-89 did not alter infarct size (60 +/- 4%) but abolished preconditioning by desflurane (57 +/- 5%) and sevoflurane (61 +/- 1%). Ischemic preconditioning (24 +/- 7%) was not affected by H-89.

The results demonstrate that anesthetic preconditioning is mediated by the beta1-adrenergic pathway, whereas this pathway is not essential for ischemic preconditioning. These results indicate important differences in the mechanisms of anesthetic and ischemic preconditioning.
