Leptin concentrations are elevated in the majority of obese individuals raising the possibility that leptin resistance contributes to their obesity. Peripheral leptin administration for 48 h caused a several-fold increase in mRNA encoding the suppressors of cytokine signaling SOCS-3 and CIS in hypothalamus and peripheral tissues. Paradoxically, CIS and SOCS-3 mRNAs are also elevated in the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse. Forced expression of CIS in insulinoma cells prevented transactivation mediated by leptin. Thus tissues continuously exposed to leptin and/or other factors associated with obesity accumulate excessive amounts of SOCS-3 and CIS which could provide a potential mechanism for leptin resistance.
