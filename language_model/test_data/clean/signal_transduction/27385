Glucagon and tGLP-1 receptors can be either coexpressed or selectively expressed in beta-cell models. Our results indicate that both these peptides can regulate insulin secretion from beta-cells through their own specific receptors. The finding of a selective expression of G proteins in insulin and glucagon cells indicates a clear difference in their transduction pathways. A key role of the G alpha s family in beta-cell function is further supported by its conserved cell distribution between different species. In conclusion, one could postulate that in the human beta-cells, tGLP-1 and glucagon receptors could mediate their action through different G protein alpha-subunits of the G alpha s family.
