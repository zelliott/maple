Taxotere (Docetaxel) is a novel microtubulin inhibitor which is currently in phase II/III clinical trial. We found that the sensitivity to taxotere was correlated with apoptotic cell death determined by the internucleosomal DNA ladders in gastric cancer cell lines. The treatment of taxotere activated proapoptotic genes such as bcl-Xs and bax genes. The relationship between the mRNA induction of bcl-Xs and bax genes and the internucleosomal DNA ladders by taxotere was significant, respectively (p<0.05). The introduction of bcl-Xs gene into MKN45 gastric cancer cells increased the sensitivity to VP-16 and taxotere 2-3-fold in the IC50 values, whereas the introduction of bax gene increased the sensitivity to CDDP, VP-16 and taxotere 2-5-fold in the IC50 values, as compared to that of the Neo-transfected MKN45 cells. The mRNA overexpression of bax gene was found in the bcl-Xs-transfected cells. Likewise, the mRNA overexpression of bcl-Xs gene was also found in the bax-transfected cells. These results indicate that the activation of bcl-2 family genes such as bcl-Xs and bax plays a crucial role in modulating apoptotic cell death in the sensitivity to anticancer drugs, and suggest that these proapoptotic genes might interact in the up-regulation for activating downstream signals leading to apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.
