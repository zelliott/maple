Severe traumatic brain injury stimulates the release of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) into CSF. Studies in cultured mouse astrocytes suggest that sICAM-1 induces the production of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms for MIP-2 induction. sICAM-1 induced MIP-2 in astrocytes lacking membrane-bound ICAM-1, indicating that its action is due to heterophilic binding to an undescribed receptor rather than homophilic binding to surface ICAM-1. Signal transduction may be mediated by src tyrosine kinases, as the src tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin A and PP2 abolished MIP-2 induction by sICAM-1. Phosphorylation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not of p38 MAPK, occurred further downstream, as evidenced by western blot analysis combined with the use of herbimycin A and specific MAPK inhibitors. By contrast, induction of MIP-2 by tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) involved both p42/44 MAPK and p38 MAPK. Following stimulation with either sICAM-1 or TNF-alpha, astrocyte supernatants promoted chemotaxis of human neutrophils and incubation of these supernatants with anti-MIP-2 antibodies more efficiently suppressed the migration induced by sICAM-1 than by TNF-alpha. These results show that sICAM-1 induces the production of biologically active MIP-2 in astrocytes by heterophilic binding to an undefined receptor and activation of src tyrosine kinases and p42/44 MAPK.
