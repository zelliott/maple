Apoptosis, a mechanism involving programmed cell death, is important for normal development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Apoptotic cells are defined by their fragmented nuclei with condensed chromatin, fragmented or condensed cytoplasm and formation of apoptotic bodies. The apoptotic signal transducing pathways activated by a variety of stimuli, including depletion of growth factors, heat shock, cytokines, DNA damaging reagents and crosslinking of Fas receptor, finally converge into the phylogenically conserved apoptotic main machinery, consisting of death-driving ICE-family proteases and anti-cell death protein Bcl-2. Recently, we noted that necrotic cell death induced by chemical hypoxia shares at least some part of the apoptotic main machinery. Using this system, we have shown that Bcl-2 prevents the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential observed in both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. We also showed that the ICE protease cascade operates in apoptosis and that Bcl-2 functions upstream of the ICE prolease cascade. Here, we review the signal transducing pathway of the apoptotic main machinery.
