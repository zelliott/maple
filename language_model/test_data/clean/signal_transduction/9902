Expression of the HXT genes encoding glucose transporters in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by two interconnected glucose-signaling pathways: the Snf3/Rgt2-Rgt1 glucose induction pathway and the Snf1-Mig1 glucose repression pathway. The Snf3 and Rgt2 glucose sensors in the membrane generate a signal in the presence of glucose that inhibits the functions of Std1 and Mth1, paralogous proteins that regulate the function of the Rgt1 transcription factor, which binds to the HXT promoters. It is well established that glucose induces degradation of Mth1, but the fate of its paralogue Std1 has been less clear. We present evidence that glucose-induced degradation of Std1 via the SCF(Grr1) ubiquitin-protein ligase and the 26S proteasome is obscured by feedback regulation of STD1 expression. Disappearance of Std1 in response to glucose is accelerated when glucose induction of STD1 expression due to feedback regulation by Rgt1 is prevented. The consequence of relieving feedback regulation of STD1 expression is that reestablishment of repression of HXT1 expression upon removal of glucose is delayed. In contrast, degradation of Mth1 is reinforced by glucose repression of MTH1 expression: disappearance of Mth1 is slowed when glucose repression of MTH1 expression is prevented, and this results in a delay in induction of HXT3 expression in response to glucose. Thus, the cellular levels of Std1 and Mth1, and, as a consequence, the kinetics of induction and repression of HXT gene expression, are closely regulated by interwoven transcriptional and posttranslational controls mediated by two different glucose-sensing pathways.
