The intracellular signaling pathway by which tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces its pleiotropic actions is well characterized and includes unique components as well as modules shared with other signaling pathways. In addition to the currently known key effectors, further molecules may however modulate the biological response to TNF. In our attempt to characterize novel regulators of the TNF signaling cascade, we have identified transmembrane protein 9B (TMEM9B, c11orf15) as an important component of TNF signaling and a module shared with the interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways. TMEM9B is a glycosylated protein localized in membranes of the lysosome and partially in early endosomes. The expression of TMEM9B is required for the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by TNF, IL-1beta, and TLR ligands but not for apoptotic cell death triggered by TNF or Fas ligand. TMEM9B is essential in TNF activation of both the NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways. It acts downstream of RIP1 and upstream of the MAPK and IkappaB kinases at the level of the TAK1 complex. These findings indicate that TMEM9B is a key component of inflammatory signaling pathways and suggest that endosomal or lysosomal compartments regulate these pathways.
