Genetic experiments have recently been used to identify a family of 'regulator of G-protein signaling' (RGS) proteins, which downregulate signaling by heterotrimeric G proteins. The first biochemical studies of RGS proteins have shown that they accelerate the GTPase activities of G-protein alpha subunits, thus driving G proteins into their inactive GDP-bound forms. The physiological significance of the large number of different RGS proteins remains to be explored.
