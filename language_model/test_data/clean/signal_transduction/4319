Integrins are remarkably multifunctional: they mediate cell adhesion and migration, orchestrate organization of the actin-based cytoskeleton, and activate signal transduction pathways. Recent studies have identified a variety of steps and hierarchies in these intracellular cytoskeletal and signaling responses, laying the groundwork for future studies on specificity and coordination with responses to growth factors.
