CX3CL1 (fractalkine), a membrane-bound chemokine that induces both the adhesion and the migration of leukocytes, is involved in the recruitment of cells into tissues undergoing inflammatory responses. To explore the regulation of CX3CL1 in pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, CX3CL1 expression in lung fibroblasts was examined. Normal human fibroblasts were obtained from Promocell (Lonza Walkersville Inc, Md) and were incubated in the presence or absence of various inflammatory stimuli. Culture supernatants were collected, and the soluble CX3CL1 levels were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of CX3CL1 mRNA transcripts in lung fibroblasts was assessed using quantitative TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. Interleukin (IL)-1β or interferon (IFN)-γ individually induced negligible soluble CX3CL1 secretion by human lung fibroblasts after 24 h. However, the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ induced dramatic increases in both soluble CX3CL1 protein and mRNA transcripts in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Synergistic up-regulation of cell-associated CX3CL1 protein also was observed after treatment with IL-1β and IFN-γ. The secretion and expression of lung fibroblast-derived CX3CL1 were markedly reduced by specific inhibitors of the STAT-1 transcription factor. These findings suggest that lung fibroblasts are an important cellular source of CX3CL1 and may play a role in pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis.
