Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a major risk factor for developing heart failure, the leading cause of death in the world. Growth/differentiation factor 1 (GDF1), a transforming growth factor-Î² family member, is a regulator of cell growth and differentiation in both embryonic and adult tissues. Evidence from human and animal studies suggests that GDF1 may play an important role in cardiac physiology and pathology. However, a critical role for GDF1 in cardiac remodelling has not been investigated. Here, we performed gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies using cardiac-specific GDF1 knockout mice and transgenic mice to determine the role of GDF1 in pathological cardiac hypertrophy, which was induced by aortic banding (AB). The extent of cardiac hypertrophy was evaluated by echocardiographic, hemodynamic, pathological, and molecular analyses. Our results demonstrated that cardiac specific GDF1 overexpression in the heart markedly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction, whereas loss of GDF1 in cardiomyocytes exaggerated the pathological cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in response to pressure overload. Mechanistically, we revealed that the cardioprotective effect of GDF1 on cardiac remodeling was associated with the inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 and Smad signaling cascades. Collectively, our data suggest that GDF1 plays a protective role in cardiac remodeling via the negative regulation of the MEK-ERK1/2 and Smad signaling pathways.
