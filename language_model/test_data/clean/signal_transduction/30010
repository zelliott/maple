Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as subcellular messengers in such complex cellular processes as mitogenic signal transduction, gene expression, regulation of cell proliferation, replicative senescence, and apoptosis. They serve to maintain cellular homeostasis and their production is under strict control. However, the mechanisms whereby ROS act are still obscure. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of signaling mechanisms and recent data about the involvement of ROS in: (i) the regulation of the mitogenic transduction elements, particularly protein kinases and phosphatases; (ii) the regulation of gene expression; and (iii) the induction of replicative senescence and the role, if any, in aging and age-related disorders.
