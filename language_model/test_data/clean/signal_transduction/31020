Three structurally related protein complexes, the COP9 signalosome, the proteasome lid, and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, are revealing new insights into developmental processes and into cell cycle control in healthy cells and cells exposed to genotoxic stress. Newly discovered cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases assembled on the CUL4 platform may provide links between DNA replication, chromatin, and proteolysis.
