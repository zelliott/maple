TLRs are primary sensors of invading pathogens, recognizing conserved microbial molecules and activating signaling pathways that are pivotal to innate and adaptive immune responses. However, a TLR signaling pathway must be tightly controlled because its excessive activation can contribute to the pathogenesis of many human diseases. This review provides a summary of the different mechanisms that are involved in the negative regulation of TLR signaling pathways.
