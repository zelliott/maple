The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the principal neurogenic niche present in the adult non-human mammalian brain. Neurons generated in the SVZ migrate along the rostral migratory stream to reach the olfactory bulb. Brain injuries stimulate SVZ neurogenesis and direct migration of new progenitors to the sites of injury. To date, cortical injury-induced adult SVZ neurogenesis in mice remains ambiguous and migration of neural progenitors to the site of injury has not been studied in detail. Here we report that aspiration lesion in the motor cortex induces a transient, but significant increase in the proliferation as well as neurogenesis in the SVZ. New neural progenitors migrate ectopically to the injured area with the assistance of blood vessels and reactive astrocytes. The SVZ origin of these progenitors was further confirmed using lentiviral transduction. In addition, we show that astrocyte-assisted ectopic migration is regulated by CXCR4/SDF-1 signaling pathway. Finally, upon reaching the lesion area, these progenitors differentiate mainly into glial cells and, to a lesser extent, mature neurons. These data provide a detailed account of the changes occurring in the SVZ and the cortex following lesion, and indicate the potential of the endogenous neural progenitors in cortical repair.
