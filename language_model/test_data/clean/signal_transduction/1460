Endothelial cells responses to a variety of agonists include release of endothelium dependent vasodilators, such as endothelium dependent relaxing factor (EDRF) and prostacyclin (PGI2). These substances act on vascular smooth muscle to cause relaxation and also have potent anti-aggregatory effects on platelets. A study of the mechanisms of signal transduction involved in these processes was undertaken. An investigation of intracellular calcium using FURA-2 and INDO-1 loaded endothelial cells shows transient elevation in response to vasodilator agonists. The calcium content of endothelial cells calculated using 45Ca flux techniques is increased in response to bradykinin and thrombin. Receptor activation leads to increased phosphoinositide turnover in endothelial cells and activates protein kinase C, the latter may be involved in feedback regulation. Patch clamp studies have demonstrated receptor-operated ionic channels in the endothelial cell membrane. Thus, intracellular calcium concentration is elevated in response to receptor activation, both as a result of liberation of calcium from intracellular stores and calcium entry from extracellular sources. Endothelial cells also respond to particulate stimuli. They can selectively bind and phagocytize bacteria. Phagocytosis leads to generation of superoxide aionin, a process which also seems to be controlled by elevation of intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C. In addition phagocytosis activates endothelial cells resulting in increased migration, division and further phagocytosis. All in all, the plethora of different endothelial responses to a variety of stimuli suggests a complex and multipotent cell type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
