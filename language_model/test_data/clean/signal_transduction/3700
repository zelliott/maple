The replicative capacity of cells may limit the lifespan of key systems in the body. It has long been known that normal human cells have a finite lifespan when placed in cell culture, and their lifespan is dependent on the age of the individual donor. The mechanism of the genetic program that times this process has been elusive. The telomere hypothesis of cell aging proposes that the length of the telomeric repeat array at chromosomal termini can time replication number and signal cell cycle arrest when critical telomere lengths are obtained. The erosion of telomeric DNA in normal tissues appears to be due to the lack of expression of components of the telomere maintenance system. Telomerase, the key enzyme involved in telomere replication, is not expressed in somatic tissues, but is expressed in germ cells, where telomere length is stably maintained, so that viable chromosomes can be transmitted to the next generation. Evidence is reviewed that correlates telomere length, telomerase activity, and the manipulation of telomere length with cell replicative capacity and cellular immortalization. Strong circumstantial evidence exists that indicates a role for telomere biology in the control of replicative capacity and in tumorigenesis.
