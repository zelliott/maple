A novel strategy has been suggested to enhance rapamycin-based cancer therapy through combining mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-inhibitors with an inhibitor of the phosphatydilinositol 3-kinase PI3K/Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway. However, recent study demonstrated the potentiating effect of rapamycin on all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated differentiation of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, prompting us to investigate the effects of longitudinal inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway on both proliferation and differentiative capacity of AML. In NB4, HL-60, U937 and K562 cell lines, rapamycin exerted minimal antiproliferative effects, and combining PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 and rapamycin inhibited proliferation more than LY 294002 alone. Rapamycin potentiated differentiation of ATRA-treated NB4 cells, but the combination of rapamycin and LY 294002 inhibited the expression of CD11b in both ATRA- and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated cells more than PI3K inhibitor alone. These results demonstrate that, although the combination of PI3K inhibitor and rapamycin is more effective in inhibiting proliferation of AML, the concomitant inhibition of PI3K and mTOR by LY 294002 and rapamycin has more inhibitory effects on ATRA-mediated differentiation than the presence of PI3K-inhibitor alone, and diminishes positive effects of rapamycin on leukemia cell differentiation.
