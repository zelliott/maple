Contraction induces marked metabolic changes in muscle, and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a good candidate to explain these effects. Recent work using a muscle-specific knockout of the upstream kinase, LKB1, has confirmed that the LKB1-->AMPK cascade is the signaling pathway responsible for many of these effects.
