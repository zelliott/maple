Inhibitory signaling is crucial in the regulation of the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we show that KIR2DL1, an inhibitory receptor of NK cells, associates with supervillin, an F-actin binding protein. Interaction of supervillin with KIR2DL1 is dependent on the KIR2DL1 receptor stimulation and requires the phosphorylation of tyrosines in both ITIM motifs. "Knockdown" of expression of supervillin by RNA interference (RNAi) restores the KIR2DL1-suppressed cytotoxicity of NK cells. Inhibition of supervillin by RNAi also enhances the polarization of cytolytic granules (both granzyme B and perforin) to the synapse formed between YTS-GFP-KIR2DL1 NK cells and 721.221-HLA-Cw4 target cells. Further study reveals that supervillin is required for KIR2DL1-mediated inhibition of Vav1 and ERK phoshorylation. Moreover, we have found that binding of supervillin with KIR2DL1 facilitates the recruitment of SHPs especially SHP-2 to KIR2DL1 receptor. Thus, our findings demonstrate that supervillin is a novel molecule that associates with KIR2DL1 receptor and regulates the inhibitory signaling in NK cells.
