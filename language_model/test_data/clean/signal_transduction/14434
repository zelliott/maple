The two-component system MtrBA is involved in the osmostress response of Corynebacterium glutamicum. MtrB was reconstituted in a functionally active form in liposomes and showed autophosphorylation and phosphatase activity. In proteoliposomes, MtrB activity was stimulated by monovalent cations used by many osmosensors for the detection of hypertonicity. Although MtrB was activated by monovalent cations, they lead in vitro to a general stabilization of histidine kinases and do not represent the stimulus for MtrB to sense hyperosmotic stress.
