We have determined that prostaglandin H synthase-2 localises strongly to the nuclear membrane as well as being found in the endoplasmic reticulum in human amnion-derived WISH cells which have been stimulated with interleukin 1beta and phorbol ester. This is consistent with findings in cells of non-reproductive origin. There is strong evidence that prostaglandin J2 derivatives, which in other tissues exhibit tumour suppressing, antiproliferative and/or differentiation promoting activities, act through binding of intracellular receptors which then enter the nucleus. In addition, some arachidonic acid derivatives are clearly generated by enzymes at the nuclear envelope and localise to sites in nuclei or bind sites in nuclei. The WISH cell line will make an excellent system for studying these perinuclear intracellular prostanoid signaling mechanisms.
