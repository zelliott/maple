The protein kinase D (PKD) family consists of three serine/threonine protein kinases: PKC mu/PKD, PKD2, and PKC nu/PKD3. While PKD has been the focus of most studies to date, no information is available on the intracellular distribution of PKD2. Consequently, we examined the mechanism that regulates its intracellular distribution in human pancreatic carcinoma Panc-1 cells. Analysis of the intracellular steady-state distribution of fluorescent-tagged PKD2 in unstimulated cells indicated that this kinase is predominantly cytoplasmic. Cell stimulation with the G protein-coupled receptor agonist neurotensin induced a rapid and reversible plasma membrane translocation of PKD2 by a mechanism that requires PKC activity. In contrast to the other PKD isoenzymes, PKD2 activation did not induce its redistribution from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Thus, this study demonstrates that the regulation of the distribution of PKD2 is distinct from other PKD isoenzymes, and suggests that the differential spatio-temporal localization of these signaling molecules regulates their specific signaling properties.
