Changes in gene expression are the main outcome of hormone signaling cascades that widely control plant physiology. In the case of the hormones gibberellins, the transcriptional control is exerted through the activity of the DELLA proteins, which act as negative regulators in the signaling pathway. This review focuses on recent transcriptomic approaches in the context of gibberellin signaling, which have provided useful information on new processes regulated by these hormones such as the regulation of photosynthesis and gravitropism. Moreover, the enrichment of specific cis-elements among DELLA primary targets has also helped extend the view that DELLA proteins regulate gene expression through the interaction with multiple transcription factors from different families.
