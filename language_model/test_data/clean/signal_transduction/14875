An Arabidopsis hy4 mutant that is specifically impaired in its ability to undergo blue light dependent photomorphogenesis was used to identify cryptochrome 1 signaling-related components. Proteomic analysis revealed about 205 differentially expressed protein spots in the blue light-irradiated hy4 mutant compared to the wild-type. The proteins corresponding to 28 up-regulated and 33 down-regulated spots were identified. Obvious morphological changes in the hy4 mutant were closely related to the expression of various transcription factors. Our findings suggest that blue light signals may be involved in many cellular processes including disease resistance and stress responses.
