Protection against insect bites is one of the main strategies in prevention and control of the vector-borne diseases. However, due to the obvious shortcomings of traditional control methods, it is necessary to develop new control measures. Most insects rely on their olfactory systems for host and mate location. Interfering with insect olfactory systems is becoming a hot research area in the control of vector-borne diseases. As odorant receptors play a major role in perception of odorant molecules by insect olfactory system, this paper summarizes the recent progress on insect odorant receptors and their olfactory signal transduction.
