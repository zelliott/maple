It has been suggested that steroids interact with peptide hormones in part by rapid, potentially non-genomic, mechanisms. The peptide hormone epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulates cell proliferation and ion transport using ERK1/2 as downstream signal. Furthermore, the EGF-receptor (EGF-R) is involved in signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors, growth hormone and cytokines via transactivation. We show that aldosterone modulates Na(+)/H(+)-exchange in renal collecting duct-derived Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells via ERK1/2 in a similar way as compared to growth factors. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that aldosterone uses the EGF-R as heterologous signal transducer in MDCK cells. Aldosterone induces a rapid increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cytosolic Ca(2+)-concentration of similar extend as compared to EGF. Furthermore, aldosterone stimulates EGF-R Tyr-phosphorylation. Inhibition of EGF-R kinase abolished aldosterone-induced signaling. Aldosterone-induced Ca(2+)-influx seems to be mediated by the activation of ERK1/2, whereas ERK1/2 activation does not depend on Ca(2+)-influx. Our data show that aldosterone uses the EGF-R-ERK1/2 signaling cascade to elicit its rapid effects in MDCK cells.
