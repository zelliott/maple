Mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species have been implicated as a common feature that connects aging of organisms and age-related diseases. Efficient elimination of these radicals by antioxidants correlates with increased life span. Understanding how the mitochondrion signals to the nucleus to regulate antioxidant proteins might be a key to aging processes and treatment of human diseases.
