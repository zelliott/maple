Signaling networks are complex both in terms of the chemical and biophysical events that underlie them, and in the sheer number of interactions. Computer models are powerful tools to deal with both aspects of complexity, but their utility goes beyond simply replicating signaling events in silicon. Their great advantage is as a tool to understanding. The completeness of the description demanded by computer models highlights gaps in knowledge. The quantitative description in models facilitates a mapping between different kinds of analysis methods for complex systems. Systems analysis methods can highlight stable states of signaling networks and describe the transitions between them. Modeling also reveals functional similarities between signaling network properties and other well-understood systems such as electronic devices and neural networks. These suggest various metaphors as a tool to understanding. Based on such descriptions, it is possible to regard signaling networks as systems that decode complex inputs in time, space and chemistry into combinatorial output patterns of signaling activity. This would provide a natural interface to the combinatorial input patterns required by genetic circuits. Thus, a combination of computer modeling methods to capture the complexity and details, and useful abstractions revealed by these models, is necessary to achieve both rigorous description as well as human understanding.
