Although indirubin is known to exhibit anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities, very little is known about its mechanism of action. In this study, we investigated whether indirubin mediates its effects through interference with the NF-kappaB pathway. As examined by the DNA binding of NF-kappaB, we found that indirubin suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-kappaB activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Indirubin also suppressed the NF-kappaB activation induced by various inflammatory agents and carcinogens. Further studies showed that indirubin blocked the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB alpha through the inhibition of activation of IkappaB alpha kinase and phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65. NF-kappaB reporter activity induced by TNFR1, TNF receptor-associated death domain, TRAF2, TAK1, NF-kappaB-inducing kinase, and IKKbeta was inhibited by indirubin but not that induced by p65 transfection. We also found that indirubin inhibited the expression of NF-kappaB-regulated gene products involved in antiapoptosis (IAP1, IAP2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and TRAF1), proliferation (cyclin D1 and c-Myc), and invasion (COX-2 and MMP-9). This correlated with enhancement of the apoptosis induced by TNF and the chemotherapeutic agent taxol in human leukemic KBM-5 cells. Indirubin also suppressed cytokine-induced cellular invasion. Overall, our results indicate that anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities previously assigned to indirubin may be mediated in part through the suppression of the NF-kappaB activation pathway.
