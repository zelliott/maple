During embryogenesis, the development of the respiratory tract is closely associated with the formation of an extensive neuronal network. While the topic of respiratory innervation is not new, and similar articles were published previously, recent studies using animal models and genetic tools are breathing new life into the field. In this review, we focus on signaling mechanisms that underlie innervation of the embryonic respiratory tract.
