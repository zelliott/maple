Visceral glomerular epithelial cells (GEC) are critical for normal permselectivity of the kidney. Nephrin is a molecule that is expressed specifically in GEC in a structure called the slit diaphragm and is required for normal morphology and permselectivity of GEC. However, the mechanisms of action of nephrin are not understood precisely. The intracellular domain of nephrin has six conserved tyrosine residues. It was hypothesized that these tyrosine residues are phosphorylated by Src-family kinases and that this phosphorylation modulates the function of nephrin. A transient transfection system was used to study the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of nephrin in its function. When nephrin was co-transfected with Src-family kinases Fyn or Src in Cos-1 cells, nephrin was strongly tyrosine phosphorylated by Fyn and less so by Src. The results with tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutations suggested that multiple tyrosine residues contribute to phosphorylation mediated by Src-family kinases. The intracellular domain of nephrin is known to interact with another slit diaphragm protein, podocin. When nephrin and podocin were transfected with Fyn, the interaction between nephrin and podocin was augmented significantly. Podocin was not tyrosine phosphorylated by Fyn; thus, the increased interaction is likely to be secondary to tyrosine phosphorylation of nephrin. Fyn also significantly augmented the activation of the AP-1 promoter induced by nephrin and podocin. In summary, Fyn phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of nephrin on tyrosine, leading to enhanced association with podocin and downstream signaling of nephrin.
