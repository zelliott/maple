Cord blood (CB) has been established to be an alternative source of haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HPC) for transplantation. The number of HPC per CB unit is limited, which results in engraftment delay. Ex vivo expansion of HPC improvement must overcome this.

Flow cytometry was used to extensively phenotype HPC pre- and post-expansion and CFDA-SE staining was used to track cell divisions. The NSG mouse model was employed in transplantation studies to determine long and short term repopulation in human cells. Gene array analysis was used to evaluate signalling pathways regulated following ex vivo expansion of HPC.

expansion of CD34(+) HPC impaired their regenerative function. In this xenograft transplantation model we showed that repopulating activity of CB cells declined following expansion. Expanded HPC had delayed engraftment at early and late stages post-transplant. High resolution division tracking revealed that the cultured HPC had reduced expansion and self-renewal probability and increased differentiation rate compared to non-expanded cells. Gene expression analysis exposed significant modulation of a complex network of genes and pathways that normally maintain HPC proliferation and limit their differentiation.

The decline in short-term engraftment is consistent with the loss of rapid SCID repopulating ability r(SRA) by expanded CD34(+) CD38(+) cells recently reported. Our data raise concerns for future clinical applications of expanded HPC alone in transplantation.
