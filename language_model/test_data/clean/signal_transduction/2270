TNF-alpha regulates the expression of many proinflammatory and profibrogenic gene products in macrophages, and hence plays a vital role in controlling the inflammatory response. We have shown previously that exposure of macrophages to TNF-alpha stimulates the activation of members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of activation of the p38mapk by TNF-alpha in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. Exposure to TNF-alpha resulted in the activation of p38mapk, as measured by 1) the trans-phosphorylation of recombinant activating transcription factor-2 substrate by immunoprecipitated p38mapk and 2) specific tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated p38mapk. In addition, selective ligation of the TNF-alpha receptor CD120a (p55) with human TNF-alpha was sufficient to induce p38mapk activation. Using an in vitro kinase assay with recombinant kinase-inactive p38mapk as substrate in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP, the upstream kinases MKK3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3) and MKK4 were found to be activated in response to TNF-alpha. These findings suggest that TNF-alpha transiently phosphorylates and activates the three members of the MAPK family, namely p42(mapk/erk2), p46 c-Jun amino-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), and p38mapk following cross-linking of CD120a (p55), and that MKK3 and MKK4 are capable of phosphorylating p38mapk.
