Wnt signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. To investigate the possible role of Wnt signaling in the regulation of ovarian follicular development, secondary follicles were isolated and cultured in vitro in the presence or absence of its activator (LiCl or Wnt3a) or inhibitor (IWR-1). We have demonstrated that activation of Î²-catenin signals by activators dramatically suppressed follicular development by increasing granulosa cell apoptosis and inhibiting follicle steroidogenesis. In contrast, inhibition of Wnt signaling by IWR-1 was observed with better developed follicles and increased steroidogenesis. Further studies have shown that the transcription factor Forkhead box O3a (Foxo3a) and its downstream target molecules were modulated by the activators or the inhibitor. These findings provide evidence that Wnt signaling might negatively regulate follicular development potentially through Foxo3a signaling components.
