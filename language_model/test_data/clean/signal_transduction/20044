Members of the TNF family can promote signals in myeloid cells and both positively and negatively regulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines depending on the target myeloid cell type. Using the yeast-two hybrid system, we identified transmembrane protein 126A (TMEM126A) as a binding partner for CD137L (4-1BB ligand). We found that TMEM126A associated and co-localized with CD137L in a mouse macrophage cell line and knockdown of TMEM126A with siRNA abolished the CD137L-induced tyrosine phosphorylation as well as the up-regulation of M-CSF, IL-1β and TN-C expressions. Knockdown of TMEM126A also blocked the down-regulation of IL-1β and IL-6 expressions induced by CD137L in thioglycollate-elicited primary peritoneal macrophages. Knockdown of TMEM126A by stable retroviral TMEM126A shRNA transduction also abolished CD137L-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and cell adherence. These findings identify a novel molecule that bridges TNF family cytokines and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in myeloid cells.
