Extracellular ATP (eATP) is now recognized as an important signaling agent in plant growth and defense response to environmental stimuli. eATP has dual functions in plant cell signaling, which is largely dependent on its concentration in the extracellular matrix (ECM). A lethal level of eATP (extremely low or high) causes cell death, whereas a moderate level of eATP benefits plant growth and development. Ecto-apyrases (Nucleoside Triphosphate-Diphosphohydrolase) help control the eATP concentrations in the ECM, and thus contributing to the mediation of plant growth and defense response upon environmental stress. In this review, we summarize eATP signaling in plants and highlight the correlation between eATP homeostasis control and programmed cell death.
