Apoptosis is a cell death process morphologically distinct from necrosis. Cells undergoing apoptosis shrink, the plasma membrane forms blebs, and the nucleus condenses. The nuclear DNA is degraded into oligonucleosomal fragments. Apoptosis plays regulatory and protective roles by eliminating unnecessary and dangerous cells, respectively. Many factors involved in apoptosis have been identified, their roles and interactions being understood at the molecular level. The bcl-2 family regulates apoptosis, and its members are classified into two groups: anti-apoptotic that inhibits apoptosis and pro-apoptotic that induces or accelerates it. The members form dimers to inactivate each other. Caspases cleave other members of the caspase family to activate their proteolytic activity in a cascade-like fashion, and the final target proteins prosecute apoptosis. In the case of Fas or tumor necrosis factor receptors, apoptotic signals are transmitted to the caspases via protein-protein interactions, whereas in other cases they originate from mitochondria. In the early process of apoptosis, cytochrome c, which usually is involved in the respiratory chain, is released from mitochondria into the cytosol, then bind to Apaf-1, a homologue of CED-4 of nematoda, to process pro-caspase-9. The resulting activated caspase-9 cleaves pro-caspase-3 into an activated form, which is responsible for the later process of apoptosis.
