We have investigated the role of 3',5'-cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate (cAMP) in mediating the coupling between energy metabolism and cell cycle progression in both synchronous cultures and oscillating continuous cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For the first time, a peak in intracellular cAMP was shown to precede the observed breakdown of trehalose and glycogen during cell cycle-related oscillations. Measurements in synchronous cultures demonstrated that this peak can be associated with the cell cycle dynamics of cAMP under conditions of glucose-limited growth, which was found to differ significantly from that observed in synchronous glucose-repressed cultures. Our results support the notion that cAMP plays a major role in mediating the integration of energy metabolism and cell cycle progression, both in the single cell and during cell cycle-related oscillations in continuous culture, respectively. Evidence is presented that the dynamic behaviour of intracellular cAMP during the cell cycle is modulated depending on nutrient supply. The implications of these findings regarding the role of cAMP in regulating cell cycle progression and energy metabolism are discussed.
