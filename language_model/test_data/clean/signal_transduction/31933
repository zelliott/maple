Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that play a central role in host cell recognition and responses to virus infection, leading to the production of interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. In parallel, in order to establish an infection, viruses have to develop exclusively strategies to interfere with TLRs signaling, particularly some important adaptors activation such as MyD88, NF-kappaB, TRIF and IRFs, and suppress or escape host's antiviral immune response. In this paper, we review the latest findings on the various strategies used by viruses to modulate TLRs-mediated innate immune response, with special emphasis on immune evasion mechanism of VACV, HCV and HIV. By highlighting recent progress in these areas, we hope to convey a greater understanding of how viruses hamper TLRs signaling and how to overcome viral infection.
