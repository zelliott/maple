Although circulating levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8), a potent pro-inflammatory chemokine, and many other inflammatory mediators increase in response to cardiopulmonary bypass, only a small proportion of patients develop a clinically significant systemic inflammatory response. The natural mechanisms that control the inflammatory response are poorly understood. To investigate the role of IL-8 in a human inflammatory model, 15 adult patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for elective coronary artery bypass grafting were studied. Following reperfusion, plasma IL-8 levels increased significantly from 58 pg/mL (pre-bypass) and 66 pg/mL (after 20 min of bypass) to 98 pg/mL (p = .02 and .04, respectively), but this was accompanied by a concomitant threefold decrease in the IL-8 binding affinity of circulating neutrophils (Dissociation constant (KL) post-reperfusion/KL pre-bypass = 3.2; KL post-reperfusion/KL after 20 min of bypass = 2.8). IL-8-triggered release of myeloperoxidase and elastase by peripheral blood neutrophils ex vivo was also down-regulated following reperfusion. There were no significant changes in beta 2 integrin expression or inositol polyphosphate metabolism of peripheral blood neutrophils. These changes in receptor affinity and neutrophil responsiveness to IL-8 may represent an important in vivo regulatory mechanism which serves to prevent excessive tissue injury from inflammatory triggers.
