Lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), a major lipid component of oxidized low density lipoprotein, inhibits endothelial cell (EC) migration and proliferation, which are critical processes during angiogenesis and the repair of injured vessels. However, the mechanism(s) of lysoPC-induced inhibition of EC migration and proliferation has not been clarified. In this report, we demonstrate the critical role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in growth factor-stimulated EC migration and proliferation as well as their inhibition by lysoPC. EC migration and proliferation stimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) were blocked by inhibition of ERK activity by both the specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1 inhibitor PD98059 and the overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of MEK1. Conversely, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of MEK1 increased EC migration and proliferation, which were comparable to those of ECs stimulated with FGF-2. LysoPC inhibited FGF-2-induced ERK activation via prevention of Ras activation without inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ERK activity is required for FGF-2-induced EC migration and proliferation and suggest that inhibition of the Ras/ERK pathway by lysoPC contributes to the reduced EC migration and proliferation.
