Gonadotropin and TSH receptors belong to a subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors. TSH and FSH receptor present a particular intracellular traffic: they present a polarized basolateral expression in thyroid follicular cells and in Sertoli cells respectively. By contrast, the LH receptor is expressed circumferentially in target gonadic cells. We expressed these receptors in MDCK cells (a well characterized model of polarized epithelial cells) to understand this difference of properties. We show that the three receptors have a polarized basolateral expression in these cells. All contain a basolateral targeting signal. Furthermore, gonadotropin receptors undergo a partial transcytosis which is not observed for the TSH receptor. We show that heterotrimeric G proteins play a role in this mechanism of transcytosis. This effect is not mediated by adenylate cyclase activation and involves a population of G proteins different from that involved in signal transduction. We thus used in vitro mutagenesis to delineate the basolateral localization signal of the FSH receptor. Surprisingly, the signal is localized in the C-terminal tail of the intracellular domain which is not conserved between the three receptors. It contains 14 amino-acids and its activity is mainly dependent on a tyrosine and a leucine residue. The basolateral localization signal of the FSHR is not colinear with its internalization signal. This signal is autonomous and dominant because, when transferred to an apically targeted membrane protein, the neurotrophin receptor, it redirects the chimeric construct to the basolateral domain of MDCK cells. The basolateral localization signal of the FSH receptor is thus the first signal identified for a G protein-coupled receptor and more generally for a hormone receptor.
