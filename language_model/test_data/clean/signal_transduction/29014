The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins plays a critical role in regulating the development of several tissues and organ systems. The ability of Hh proteins to exert their biological effects is regulated by a series of post-translational processes. These processes include an intramolecular cleavage, covalent addition of cholesterol and/or palmitate, and conversion into a multimeric freely diffusible form. The processing of Hh proteins affects their trafficking, potency, and ability to signal over several cell diameters. Here we review the current understanding of the Hh signaling mechanisms that govern the establishment of the Hh gradient and the transduction of the Hh signal in the light of recent data.
