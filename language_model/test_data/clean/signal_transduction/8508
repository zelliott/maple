NADPH oxidases (Nox) have been the subject of very intensive research over the past several years, which has led to in-depth understanding of the function of these enzymes in health and disease. Discovery of novel Nox enzymes and identification of a very wide range of tissue expression has increased our understanding of how NADPH oxidases may regulate so many distinct cellular functions and how the dysfunction of these enzymes may lead to disease. The present Forum issue summarizes the most novel aspects of NADPH oxidase biology, focusing on linking the molecular basis of NADPH oxidase function, compartmentalization, and differential expression patterns to diseases such as those of the pulmonary system, inflammation, central nervous system disorders, endothelial and vascular dysfunction, as well as disorders involving angiogenesis and stem cell and endothelial progenitor cell functions. Establishing these links may be the first step for future therapeutic use of NADPH oxidase inhibitors, which are discussed at length within this Forum issue.
