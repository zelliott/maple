Recent discoveries indicate that gain-of-function mutations in the Notch1 receptor are very common in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. This review discusses what these mutations have taught us about normal and pathophysiologic Notch1 signaling, and how these insights may lead to new targeted therapies for patients with this aggressive form of cancer.
