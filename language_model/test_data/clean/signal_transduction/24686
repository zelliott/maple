Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), PTH, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are potent regulators of osteoblast proliferation. In UMR 106-01 rat osteosarcoma cells with osteoblast-like features, PGE2 and PTH inhibit, while EGF stimulates, mitogenesis. Both PGE2 and PTH increase intracellular cAMP levels, cytosolic calcium, and inositol phosphate turnover. In a variety of cell types, EGF mediates its effects in part via activation of receptor protein-tyrosine kinase and other protein kinases, such as protein kinase-C. The nuclear mechanisms of PGE2, PTH, and EGF regulation of osteoblast proliferation are unknown. Accordingly, we have examined the effects of these agents on mitogenesis, second messenger generation, and primary response genes, which may link second messenger activation to subsequent alterations in gene expression. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from UMR 106-01 cells treated for 3 h with 2 microM PGE2, 10 nM PTH, or 10 ng/ml EGF in the presence of cycloheximide demonstrated that all three agents induced the expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNA. In contrast, only EGF stimulated cellular proliferation and induced Egr-1 mRNA. Also, unlike PGE2 and PTH, EGF did not increase intracellular cAMP levels. c-fos mRNA was induced by treatment with 50 ng/ml tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate or by 40 ng/ml forskolin, while induction of Egr-1 mRNA was stimulated by treatment with tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, but not forskolin. Thus, EGF signal transduction differs from that of PGE2 and PTH in UMR 106-01 osteoblast-like cells, in that EGF does not stimulate the protein kinase-A second messenger system, but causes activation of Egr-1, a primary response gene that may play a role in the mitogenic effect of EGF.
