The gammadelta T cell receptors (TCRs) and alphabeta TCRs are similar in both sequence and structure; however, gammadelta+ and alphabeta+ T cells are not merely similar lymphocytes with subtly different receptors. These cell types differ in several ways, including the types of antigens recognized, the mechanism of antigen presentation and recognition and the mechanism and kinetics of downstream signaling events. gammadelta TCRs can directly recognize antigens in the form of intact proteins or non-peptidic compounds, unlike alphabeta TCRs which recognize peptide antigens bound to major histocompatibility complex molecules (MHC). One of the major classes of human gammadelta+ T cells expresses Vgamma9Vdelta2 TCRs which recognize pyrophosphomonoester, alkylamine and aminobisphosphonate antigens. This review focuses on the recently determined structure of a Vgamma9Vdelta2 TCR, with emphasis on antigen recognition and receptor signaling.
