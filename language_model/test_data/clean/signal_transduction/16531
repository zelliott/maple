The second messengers cAMP and cGMP are of central importance in signal transduction pathways. To assure pathway specificity adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases are highly selective for their substrates, ATP and GTP, respectively. The universal class III cyclases are equipped with a variety of purine-binding modes, which have been identified by structure determination and mutagenesis. Most selection mechanisms rely on a pair of residues which form hydrogen bonds to N1 and the N(6)-amino or O(6)-keto group of adenine and guanine, respectively. Furthermore, selection is supported by hydrogen bonds involving the peptide backbone and by constraints imposed by hydrophobic side-chains.
