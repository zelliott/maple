Cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) is a ubiquitous glycoprotein, whose physiological role is poorly characterized. It has been suggested that PrP(c) participates in neuritogenesis, neuroprotection, copper metabolism, and signal transduction. In this study we detailed the intracellular events induced by PrP(c) antibody-mediated cross-linking in PC12 cells. We found a Fyn-dependent activation of the Ras-Raf pathway, which leads to a rapid and transient phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinases. In addition, this activation cascade relies on the engagement of integrins, and involves focal adhesion kinase activation. We demonstrated the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 as a consequence of PrP(c) stimulation, and showed that phosphocaveolin-1 scaffolds and coordinates protein complexes involved in PrP(c)-dependent signaling. Moreover, we found that caveolin-1 phosphorylation, is a mechanism for recruiting the C-terminal Src kinase and inactivating Fyn, so as to terminate cell signaling. Furthermore our data support a significant role for PrP(c) as a response mediator in neuritogenesis and cell differentiation.
