The biochemical cascade linking activation of phospholipase C-coupled thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors to rat ERG (r-ERG) channel modulation was studied in situ using perforated-patch clamped adenohypophysial GH3 cells and pharmacological inhibitors. To check the recent suggestion that Rho kinase is involved in the TRH-induced r-ERG current suppression, the hormonal effects were studied in cells pretreated with the Rho kinase inhibitors Y-27632 and HA-1077. The TRH-induced r-ERG inhibition was not significantly modified in the presence of the inhibitors. Surprisingly, the hormonal effects became irreversible in the presence of HA-1077 but not in the presence of the more potent Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. Further experiments indicated that the effect of HA-1077 correlated with its ability to inhibit protein kinase C (PKC). The hormonal effects also became irreversible in cells in which PKC activity was selectively impaired with GF109203X, GÃ¶6976 or long-term incubation with phorbol esters. Furthermore, the reversal of the effects of TRH, but not its ability to suppress r-ERG currents, was blocked if diacylglycerol generation was prevented by blocking phospholipase C activity with U-73122. Our results suggest that a pathway involving an as yet unidentified protein kinase is the main cause of r-ERG inhibition in perforated-patch clamped GH3 cells. Furthermore, they demonstrate that although not necessary to trigger the ERG current reductions induced by TRH, an intracellular signal cascade involving phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis by phospholipase C, activation of an alpha/betaII conventional PKC and one or more dephosphorylation steps catalysed by protein phosphatase 2A, mediates recovery of ERG currents following TRH withdrawal.
