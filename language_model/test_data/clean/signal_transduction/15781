Activation of Notch signaling by Jagged-1 (Jag-1) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) promotes a differentiated phenotype characterized by increased expression of contractile proteins. Recent studies show that microRNAs (miR)-143/145 regulates VSMC phenotype. The serum response factor (SRF)/myocardin complex binds to CArG sequences to activate miR-143/145 transcription, but no other regulators are known in VSMC. Using miR arrays, we found miR-143/145 induced following expression of a constitutively active Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD). We hypothesized that miR-143/145 is required for Jag-1/Notch-induced VSMC differentiation. Activation of Notch receptors by Jag-1 caused CBF1-dependent up-regulation of miR-143/145, increased differentiation, and decreased proliferation. Conversely, inhibiting basal Notch signaling decreased steady state levels of miR-143/145. Using SRF knockdown, we found that Jag-1/Notch induction of miR-143/145 is SRF independent, although full acquisition of contractile markers requires SRF. Using miR-143/145 promoter reporter constructs we show Jag-1/Notch increases promoter activity, and this is dependent on intact CBF1 consensus sites within the promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that N1ICD-containing complexes bind to CBF1 sites in the miR-143/145 promoter. We also identified N1ICD complex binding to CBF1 sites within the endogenous human miR-143/145 promoter. Using miR-143/145-interfering oligonucleotides, we demonstrate that Jag-1/Notch signaling requires induction of both miR-143 and miR-145 to promote the VSMC contractile phenotype. Thus, miR-143/145 is a novel transcriptional target of Jag-1/Notch signaling in VSMC. We propose miR-143/145 as activated independently by Jag-1/Notch and SRF in parallel pathways. Multiple pathways converging on miR-143/145 provides potential for fine-tuning or amplification of VSMC differentiation signals.
