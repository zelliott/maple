Remarkably, SCF(Cdc4) ubiquitin ligase binds and ubiquitinates Sic1 decorated with six, but not five, phosphates. This numerical wizardry suggests how analog inputs can be rectified to digital outputs. Unraveling the counting mechanism promises to generate new insights into the architecture of protein nanoprocessors.
