Antigen-induced aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) on mast cells induces degranulation to release chemical mediators, leading to acute allergic inflammation. We have demonstrated that the treatment of rat mast cells, RBL-2H3, with a phenoxazine derivative Phx-1 (2-amino-4,4alpha-dihydro-4alpha,7-dimethyl-3H-phenoxazine-3-one) suppresses the antigen-induced degranulation. Biochemical analysis reveals that the complementary signaling pathway through Gab2 and Akt is inhibited by this compound in mast cells. These findings suggest that phenoxazine derivatives may have a therapeutic potential for allergic diseases by inhibiting mast cell degranulation.
