Beta-catenin participates in signal transduction and developmental patterning in Xenopus and Drosophila embryos as a component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Its signaling activity is distinct from its role in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, and it probably acts either in the cytosol or in the nucleus. The adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein is also implicated in beta-catenin signaling.
