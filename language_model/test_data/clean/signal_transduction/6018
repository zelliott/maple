The relationship between enhanced myocardial oxidative stress and impaired beta-adrenergic signaling remains to be characterized during the development of dilated cardiomyopathy.

Alterations in myocardial oxidative stress and beta-adrenergic signaling, as well as left ventricular (LV) functional and structural changes, were evaluated during the development of cardiomyopathy in TO-2 hamsters; F1B hamsters served as controls. LV dysfunction was first apparent at 8 weeks of age and deteriorated thereafter in the TO-2 hamsters. At 32 weeks, the animals exhibited heart failure with an increased plasma norepinephrine concentration. Cardiac myolysis, as demonstrated by elevated plasma concentration of cardiac troponin T, peaked at 8 weeks. The glutathione redox ratio revealed increased oxidative stress in the LV myocardium in TO-2 hamsters even at 4 weeks and became manifest after 8 weeks. The hearts of TO-2 hamsters had significantly reduced superoxide dismutase activity from 8 weeks onward compared with control hamsters. However, glutathione peroxidase activity was unchanged at any time point. The LV functional response to isoproterenol was markedly reduced at 8 weeks, without any apparent changes in the amount of beta-adrenergic signaling molecules, and it deteriorated thereafter. Adenylyl cyclase activity was significantly decreased, despite increased amounts of both G(s) alpha mRNA and protein, in the LV myocardium at 18 weeks.

Myocardial oxidative stress is actually enhanced in the initial development of LV dysfunction. Both activation of myocardial oxidative stress and impairment of beta-adrenergic signaling become prominent at the stage of severe LV dysfunction. Myocardial oxidative stress may be involved in the development of beta-adrenergic desensitization.
