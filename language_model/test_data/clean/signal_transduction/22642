Proteinase-activated receptors (PARs), ubiquitous surface molecules participating on many biological processes have been recently discovered. Specific receptors for thrombin (PAR-1 and PAR-3) and trypsin (PAR-2) are described in this review. They belong to a family of G protein-coupled receptors activated by amino acid sequence of N-terminal part of bound ligand revealed by site-specific proteolysis. PARs participate in tissue growth and differentiation, regeneration and reparation, inflammatory response regulation, malignant transformation, but even in vascular tonus and blood pressure regulation.
