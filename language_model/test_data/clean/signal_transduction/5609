A role for c-Abl in B cell development and signaling has been suggested by previous work showing that c-Abl-deficient mice have defects in bone marrow B cell development and that c-Abl-deficient B cells are hypoproliferative in response to antigen receptor stimulation. Here we show that in addition to defects in early B cell development, c-Abl-deficient mice have defects in peripheral B cell development, including reduced percentages of peritoneal B-1 cells as well as transitional and marginal zone B cells in the spleen. It has been shown that c-Abl kinase activity increases upon B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation and that one of the targets of tyrosine phosphorylation by c-Abl is CD19. However, the consequences of c-Abl activity on B cell activation and CD19 signaling remain unknown. Here, we show that c-Abl-deficient splenic B cells exhibit reduced calcium flux in response to CD19 cross-linking, consistent with a role for c-Abl in CD19-dependent signaling. Additionally, we show that c-Abl-deficient B cells are defective in their ability to be activated in response to antigen receptor engagement, suggesting a functional role for c-Abl in BCR-dependent activation signaling pathways.
