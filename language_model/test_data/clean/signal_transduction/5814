Based on abscisic acid (ABA) inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth assays, we isolated an ABA overly sensitive mutant (abo4-1) caused by a mutation in the Arabidopsis thaliana POL2a/TILTED1(TIL1) gene encoding a catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon. The dominant, ABA-insensitive abi1-1 or abi2-1 mutations suppressed the ABA hypersensitivity of the abo4-1 mutant. The abo4/til1 mutation reactivated the expression of the silenced Athila retrotransposon transcriptional silent information (TSI) and the silenced 35S-NPTII in the ros1 mutant and increased the frequency of somatic homologous recombination (HR) approximately 60-fold. ABA upregulated the expression of TSI and increased HR in both the wild type and abo4-1. MEIOTIC RECOMBINATION11 and GAMMA RESPONSE1, both of which are required for HR and double-strand DNA break repair, are expressed at higher levels in abo4-1 and are enhanced by ABA, while KU70 was suppressed by ABA. abo4-1 mutant plants are sensitive to UV-B and methyl methanesulfonate and show constitutive expression of the G2/M-specific cyclin CycB1;1 in meristems. The abo4-1 plants were early flowering with lower expression of FLOWER LOCUS C and higher expression of FLOWER LOCUS T and changed histone modifications in the two loci. Our results suggest that ABO4/POL2a/TIL1 is involved in maintaining epigenetic states, HR, and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis.
