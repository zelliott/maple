It is well known that ligand binding to the high-affinity GM-CSF receptor (GMR) activates JAK2. However, how and where this event occurs in a cellular environment remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that clathrin- but not lipid raft-mediated endocytosis is crucial for GMR signaling. Knockdown expression of clathrin heavy chain or intersectin 2 (ITSN2) attenuated GMR-mediated activation of JAK2, whereas inhibiting clathrin-coated pits or plagues to bud off the membrane by the dominant-negative mutant of dynamin enhanced such event. Moreover, unlike the wild-type receptor, an ITSN2-non-binding mutant of GMR defective in targeting to clathrin-coated pits or plagues [collectively referred to as clathrin-coated structures (CCSs) here] failed to activate JAK2 at such locations. Additional experiments demonstrate that ligand treatment not only enhanced JAK2/GMR association at CCSs, but also induced a conformational change of JAK2 which is required for JAK2 to be activated by CCS-localized CK2. Interestingly, ligand-independent activation of the oncogenic mutant of JAK2 (JAK2V617F) also requires the targeting of this mutant to CCSs. But JAK2V617F seems to be constitutively in an open conformation for CK2 activation. Together, this study reveals a novel functional role of CCSs in GMR signaling and the oncogenesis of JAK2V617F.
