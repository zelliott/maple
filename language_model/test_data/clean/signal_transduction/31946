Tropomyosin-receptor-kinase B (TrkB receptor) activation plays an important role in the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). This study reports a novel finding that, SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (Shp-2) binds to the TrkB receptor in RGCs and negatively regulates its activity under glaucomatous stress. This enhanced binding of TrkB and Shp2 is mediated through caveolin. Caveolin 1 and 3 undergo hyper-phosphorylation in RGCs under stress and bind to the Shp2 phosphatase. Shp2 undergoes activation under glaucomatous stress conditions in RGCs in vivo with a concurrent loss of TrkB activity. Inhibiting the Shp2 phosphatase restored TrkB activity in cells exposed to excitotoxic and oxidative stress. Collectively, these findings implicate a molecular basis of Shp2 mediated TrkB deactivation leading to RGC degeneration observed in glaucoma.
