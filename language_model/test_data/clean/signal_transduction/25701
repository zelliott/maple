Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) has been reported to decrease vascular lesion formation. However, the critical role of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) PPARγ in vascular lesion formation following transplantation is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of VSMC PPARγ-mediated signaling in transplantation-associated vascular lesion formation.

Carotid arteries from smooth muscle cell-selective PPARγ knockout (SMPG KO) and wild-type mice were transplanted to CBA/CaJ recipient mice. The recipient mice received a control diet or pioglitazone-containing diet. Pioglitazone reduced vascular lesion formation in transplanted wild-type, but not in SMPG KO carotid arteries. Histological analysis suggested that PPARγ attenuates vascular lesion formation through antiinflammatory signaling, as evidenced by the increase of intimal inflammatory cells and tumor necrosis factor-α expression in SMPG KO allografts. Intravital microscopy revealed increased inflammatory cell rolling and attachment to endothelial cells in small blood vessels of SMPG KO mice following cytokine stimulation. SMPG KO mice, as shown by Western blotting, have elevated vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry demonstrated SMPG KO allografts have increased VCAM-1.

Loss of PPARγ in VSMC promotes transplantation-associated vascular lesion formation through increased VCAM-1 expression. VSMC PPARγ also mediates pioglitazone-reduced vascular lesion formation.
