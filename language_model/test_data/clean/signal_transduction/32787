Activation of beta-adrenoreceptors induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In the present study, we examined isoproterenol-evoked intracellular signal transduction pathways leading to activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Inhibitors for cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) abolished isoproterenol-evoked ERK activation, suggesting that Gs protein is involved in the activation. Inhibition of Gi protein by pertussis toxin, however, also suppressed isoproterenol-induced ERK activation. Overexpression of the Gbetagamma subunit binding domain of the beta-adrenoreceptor kinase 1 and of COOH-terminal Src kinase, which inhibit functions of Gbetagamma and the Src family tyrosine kinases, respectively, also inhibited isoproterenol-induced ERK activation. Overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of Ras and Raf-1 kinase and of the beta-adrenoreceptor mutant that lacks phosphorylation sites by PKA abolished isoproterenol-stimulated ERK activation. The isoproterenol-induced increase in protein synthesis was also suppressed by inhibitors for PKA, Gi, tyrosine kinases, or Ras. These results suggest that isoproterenol induces ERK activation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through two different G proteins, Gs and Gi. cAMP-dependent PKA activation through Gs may phosphorylate the beta-adrenoreceptor, leading to coupling of the receptor from Gs to Gi. Activation of Gi activates ERKs through Gbetagamma, Src family tyrosine kinases, Ras, and Raf-1 kinase.
