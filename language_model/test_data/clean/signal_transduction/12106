Insulin resistance of skeletal muscle glucose transport is a key-defect for the development of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. However, it is known that both an acute bout of exercise and chronic endurance exercise training can bring beneficial effects on insulin action in insulin-resistant states. However, little is currently known about the molecular effects of acute exercise on muscle insulin signaling in the post-exercise state in insulin-resistant organisms. This review provides new insight into the mechanism through which acute exercise restores insulin sensitivity, highlighting an important role for inflammatory proteins and S-nitrosation in the regulation of insulin signaling proteins in skeletal muscle.
