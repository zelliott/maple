Through the expression of inflammatory mediators and immune-related molecules, epithelial cells function as immune effector cells in a wide variety of tissues; the expression of the CD40 receptor on these cells contributes this role. Engagement of CD40 activates epithelial cells and results in their release of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators as well as pro-fibrotic molecules. As such, epithelial CD40 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders, generation of self-tolerance, and rejection of allografts.
