Members of the Rho family of small GTPases control cell adhesion and motility through dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Although twelve family members have been identified, only three of these - RhoA, Rac and Cdc42 - have been studied in detail. RhoA regulates the formation of focal adhesions and the bundling of actin filaments into stress fibres. It is also involved in other cell signalling pathways including the regulation of gene expression and the generation of lipid second messengers [1] [2]. RhoA is very closely related to two other small GTPases about which much less is known: RhoB and RhoC (which are approximately 83% identical). Perhaps the most intriguing of these is RhoB. RhoA is largely cytosolic but translocates to the plasma membrane on activation. RhoB, however, is entirely localised to the cytosolic face of endocytic vesicles [3] [4]. This suggests a potential role for RhoB in regulating endocytic traffic; however, no evidence has been presented to support this. RhoA has been shown to act at the plasma membrane to regulate the clathrin-mediated internalisation of transferrin receptor [5] and of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor [6]. We have recently demonstrated that RhoB binds the RhoA effector, PRK1 and targets it to the endosomal compartment [7]. We show here that RhoB acts through PRK1 to regulate the kinetics of epidermal growth factor receptor traffic.
