Human RFamide-related peptide-1 (hRFRP-1, MPHSFANLPLRF-NH(2)) binds to neuropeptide FF receptor 2 (NPFF(2)R) to dramatically diminish cardiovascular performance. hRFRP-1 and its signaling pathway may provide targets to address cardiac dysfunction. Here, structure-activity relationship, transcript, Ca(2+) transient, and phospholabeling data indicate the presence of a hRFRP-1 pathway in cardiomyocytes. Alanyl-substituted and N-terminal truncated analogues identified that R(11) was essential for activity, hRFRP-1((8-12)) mimicked hRFRP-1, and [A(11)]hRFRP-1((8-12)) antagonized the effect of hRFRP-1 in cellular and integrated cardiac performance. RFRP and NPFF(2)R transcripts were amplified from cardiomyocytes and heart. Maintenance of the Ca(2+) transient when hRFRP-1 impaired myocyte shortening indicated the myofilament was its primary downstream target. Enhanced myofilament protein phosphorylation detected after hRFRP-1 treatment but absent in [A(11)]hRFRP-1((8-12))-treated cells was consistent with this result. Protein kinase C (PKC) but not PKA inhibitor diminished the influence of hRFRP-1 on the Ca(2+) transient. Molecules targeting this pathway may help address cardiovascular disease.
