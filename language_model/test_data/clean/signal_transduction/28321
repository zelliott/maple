The neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR), is involved in a diverse array of cellular responses, including apoptosis, neurite outgrowth and myelination. Stimulation of p75NTR with neurotrophin can activate multiple downstream signals, including the small GTP binding protein Rac, the transcription factor NF-kappa B and the stress activated kinase, JNK. How these signals are generated and regulated to produce a specific cellular effect has yet to be fully elucidated. A number of proteins have recently been shown to interact with the intracellular domain of p75NTR. Here, we review these p75NTR interacting factors and the current evidence as to how they contribute to the functional effects of p75NTR activation.
