Advances in studies of rice innate immunity have led to the identification and characterization of host sensors encoding receptor kinases that perceive conserved microbial signatures. Receptor kinases that carry the non-orginine-aspartate domain, are highly expanded in rice (Oryza sativa) compared with Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Researchers have also identified a diverse array of microbial effectors from bacterial and fungal pathogens that triggers immune responses upon perception. These include effectors that indirectly target host Nucleotide binding site/Leucine rich repeat proteins and transcription activator-like effectors that directly bind promoters of host genes. Here we review the recognition and signaling events that govern rice innate immunity.
