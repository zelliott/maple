Interindividual variation, be it of environmental or genetic origin, is crucial for biological evolution as well as in the medical context. This variation is not always directly visible, yet may be revealed under some environmental or genetic condition. In this essay is presented the example of the developmental model system underlying vulva formation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where an intercellular signaling network (EGF-Ras-MAP kinase, Notch and Wnt pathways) is involved in spatial patterning of the fates of the vulva precursor cells. Variation may be studied at two levels: (1) rare deviations in the system's output, i.e. the spatial pattern of vulva precursor cell fates ; (2) so-called << cryptic >> variation in the underlying intercellular signaling network, without change in the system's output. Like every biological system, this network displays genetic and -environmental epistasis.
