The present experiment demonstrates that the exposure of angiotensin II (AII) produced an up-regulation of the AT2 receptor mRNA level in rat cortical cells. AII (10(-9)-10(-5) M) exerted a marked increase of AT2 receptor mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum increase was observed at 3 hr of AII stimulation and lasted 3 hr. The up-regulation of AT2 receptor mRNA was antagonized by PD123319, an AT2 receptor antagonist, but not by SC-52458, an AT1 receptor antagonist, thus suggesting that the increase in AT2 receptor mRNA is mediated via AT2 receptor. This increase is blocked by serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, but not by the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate, thus suggesting the involvement of serine/threonine phosphatase in this process. Protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7 and calphostin C, did not inhibit the AII-induced up-regulation significantly. In addition, calcium ionophore, A23187 had no effect. These findings suggest that the AT2 receptor mRNA expression by AII is regulated by the activity of serine/threonine phosphatase in the cortical neurons. This observation is also the first example concerning the regulation of AT2 receptor within the brain.
