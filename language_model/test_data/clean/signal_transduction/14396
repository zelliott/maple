N,N'-Dialkyl-1,2-bis(2,6-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylenediamines show structural analogy with estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators. Because the vasodilator properties of these compounds are unknown, we investigated their potential to relax porcine coronary arteries and determined the mechanism(s) of relaxation. Isolated porcine coronary arterial rings were suspended in organ chambers, precontracted with KCl (30 mM), and the relaxant response was determined by measurement of changes in isometric force. Dependent on the chemical structure, the drugs induced concentration-dependent relaxation in rings with and without endothelium. N,N'-Dipropyl-1,2-bis(2,6-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylenediamine (8) was most potent and showed a 12- to 15-fold higher vasodilatory effect than 17beta-estradiol (E2). The vasorelaxation was independent of endothelium. Calcium concentration-dependent contractions in high-potassium depolarizing medium were insurmountably inhibited by 8. The effect of the L-type Ca2+ channel activator (S)-(-)-Bay K 8644 [(S)-(-)-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-[2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-pyridine-carboxylic acid methyl ester], which induced a leftward shift of Ca2+ contraction, was blocked by 8. The relaxant response to 8 was unaffected by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 (7alpha-[9-[(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentyl]-sulfinyl]nonyl]-estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17beta-diol) and K+ channel blockers, i.e., TEA, glibenclamide, and 4-aminopyridine. Furthermore, the vasodilatory effect of 8 was unaffected by the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536 [9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine], the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ [1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one], the protein kinase A inhibitor KT 5720 [(9S,10S,12R)-2,3,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-10-hydroxy-9-methyl-1-oxo-9,12-epoxy-1H-diindolo[1,2,3-fg: 3',2',1'-kl]pyrrolo[3,4-i][1,6]benzodiazocine-10-carboxylic acid hexyl ester], the protein kinase G inhibitor KT 5823 [(9S,10R,12R)-2,3,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-10-methoxy-2,9-dimethyl-1-oxo-9,12-epoxy-1H-diindolo[1,2,3-fg:3',2',1'-kl]pyrrolo[3,4-i][1,6]benzodiazocine-10-carboxylic acid methyl ester], and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB 203580 [4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole]. Western blot analysis demonstrated that 8, unlike E2, raloxifene, and tamoxifen, failed to stimulate p38 MAPK. It is concluded that N,N'-dipropyl-1,2-bis(2,6-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylenediamine induces endothelium-independent relaxation of coronary arteries; the mechanism apparently involves inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels. The drug may be protective against cardiovascular diseases.
