We have examined the mechanism by which the cAMP-responsive factor CREB stimulates target gene expression following its phosphorylation at Ser-133. Using an in vitro transcription assay, we found that two signals were required for target gene activation: a phospho(Ser-133)-dependent interaction of CREB with RNA polymerase II via the coactivator CBP and a glutamine-rich domain interaction with TFIID via hTAF(II)130. The adenovirus E1A oncoprotein was found to inhibit phospho(Ser-133) CREB activity by binding to CBP and specifically blocking recruitment of RNA Pol II to the promoter. Our results suggest that the recruitment of CBP-RNA Pol II complexes per se is not sufficient for transcriptional activation and that activator-mediated recruitment of TFIID is additionally required for induction of signal-dependent genes.
