Impaired functioning of pancreatic beta cells is a key hallmark of type 2 diabetes. beta cell function is modulated by the actions of different classes of heterotrimeric G proteins. The functional consequences of activating specific beta cell G protein signaling pathways in vivo are not well understood at present, primarily due to the fact that beta cell G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are also expressed by many other tissues. To circumvent these difficulties, we developed a chemical-genetic approach that allows for the conditional and selective activation of specific beta cell G proteins in intact animals. Specifically, we created two lines of transgenic mice each of which expressed a specific designer GPCR in beta cells only. Importantly, the two designer receptors differed in their G protein-coupling properties (G(q/11) versus G(s)). They were unable to bind endogenous ligand(s), but could be efficiently activated by an otherwise pharmacologically inert compound (clozapine-N-oxide), leading to the conditional activation of either beta cell G(q/11) or G(s) G proteins. Here we report the findings that conditional and selective activation of beta cell G(q/11) signaling in vivo leads to striking increases in both first- and second-phase insulin release, greatly improved glucose tolerance in obese, insulin-resistant mice, and elevated beta cell mass, associated with pathway-specific alterations in islet gene expression levels. Selective stimulation of beta cell G(s) triggered qualitatively similar in vivo metabolic effects. Thus, this developed chemical-genetic strategy represents a powerful approach to study G protein regulation of beta cell function in vivo.
