We previously reported that IRF-9/STAT2 functional interaction could drive the expression of retinoic acid-induced gene G (RIG-G), independently of STAT1 and the classical JAK-STAT pathway, providing a novel alternative pathway for interferons (IFN) to mediate their multiple biological properties. In addition, we also found that IRF-1 could regulate RIG-G induction as well as the expression of IRF-9 and STAT2 in some cases. But the mechanisms by which IRF-1 exerted its action remained to be elucidated. Here, we showed that STAT1 could significantly enhance the effects of the IRF-9/STAT2 complex or IRF-1 on RIG-G induction through an activated JAK-STAT pathway, though it was not essential for RIG-G expression. In STAT1-deficient U3A cells, IRF-1 could induce RIG-G expression via the IFN-stimulated response elements in the RIG-G gene promoter, but it failed to upregulate IRF-9 and STAT2 unless the U3A cells were reconstituted by exogenous STAT1. In STAT1-expressing cells, IRF-1 indirectly activated RIG-G expression through an IRF-9/STAT2-dependent manner. Taken together, we concluded that the expression of RIG-G was independent on the classical JAK-STAT pathway, but could be greatly increased by it. This work will be of great benefit to us for a better understanding of the mechanisms on RIG-G gene expression regulation.
