Understanding of the interactions between estradiol (E₂) and IGF-I is still incomplete. Cell lines derived from the MCF-7 breast cancer cells were generated with suppressed expression of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), termed IGF-IR.low cells, by stable transfection using small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vector. Vector for control cells carried sequence generating noninterfering RNA. Concomitant with reduction in the IGF-IR levels, the IGF-IR.low cells also showed a reduction in estrogen receptor α (ERα) and progesterone receptor expressions, and an elevation in the expression of ERβ. The number of the IGF-IR.low cells was reduced in response to IGF-I and human GH plus epidermal growth factor, but E₂ did not cause an increase in the number of the IGF-IR.low cells compared to controls. The proliferation rate of IGF-IR.low cells was only reduced in response to E₂ compared to controls, whereas their basal and hormone-stimulated apoptosis rate was increased. Phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) was increased in the IGF-IR.low cells after treatment with E₂, without affecting control cells. Furthermore, phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 was elevated in the IGF-IR.low cells compared to the controls. In conclusion, suppressing IGF-IR expression decreased the level of ERα but increased the level of ERβ. Overall growth rate of the IGF-IR.low cells was reduced mostly through an increase in apoptosis without affecting proliferation substantially. We hypothesize that a decreased ERα:ERβ ratio triggered a rapid phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which in turn phosphorylated the p53 tumor suppressor and accelerated apoptosis rate.
