Branching morphogenesis, defined as the growth and branching of epithelial tubules, is a fundamental developmental process involved in the formation of a variety of mammalian tissues, including the kidney. Defective renal branching may result in a number of clinically relevant abnormalities, including renal agenesis, renal dysplasia, multiplex kidneys, and hypertension. In this review we describe the morphological events that generate the characteristic tree-like structure of the mammalian collecting system. We also highlight new knowledge related to both established and novel signaling systems that are important for stimulating and inhibiting branching morphogenesis.
