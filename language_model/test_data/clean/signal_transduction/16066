Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play a crucial role in programmed cell death (PCD), a biological process required for the sculpturing of the embryonic limbs. However, it is unknown if BMP signaling directly promotes cell death, or if it induces a molecular cascade that culminates in cell death. Given that Smad8, which encodes one component of BMP signaling, is expressed during the regression of interdigital tissue and responds to BMPs, we presumed that it may be expressed in other cell death areas during chick limb development such as the anterior and posterior necrotic zones (ANZ and PNZ). The present study found that the Smad8 expression pattern in the anterior mesoderm of the hindlimb is very similar to that observed in limbs stained to detect cell death. Also, BMPs and retinoic acid, which act as apoptosis-promoting factors, induced expression of Smad8 before the onset of cell death, while sonic hedgehog protein, acting as a survival factor, inhibited Smad8 expression in the ANZ. However, although there was correlation between Smad8 expression patterns and PCD in the ANZ, phosphorylated forms of SMAD1/5/8 and TUNEL staining did not co-localize in dying cells. Interestingly, a short pulse of BMP was sufficient to trigger cell death. On the other hand, most dying cells were located in the avascular region, while many cells expressing Smad8 were located in the vascular region of the ANZ. These results suggest that BMPs mediated by SMAD signaling activate a molecular cascade that culminates in PCD.
