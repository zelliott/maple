Adipose tissue is a critical regulator of energy balance and substrate metabolism, and synthesizes several different substances with endocrine or paracrine functions, which regulate the overall energetic homeostasis. An excessive amount of adipose tissue has been associated with the development of type 2 diabetes, premature atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease. It is believed that the adverse metabolic impact of visceral fat relies on a relative resistance to the action of insulin in this depot compared to other adipose tissue depots. However, information on insulin signalling reactions in human fat is limited. In this paper, we review the major insulin signalling pathways in adipocytes and their relevance for metabolic regulation, and discuss recent data indicating different signalling properties of visceral fat as compared to other fat depots, which may explain the metabolic and hormonal specificity of this fat tissue depot in humans.
