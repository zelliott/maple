O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is decisively involved in protecting mammalian cells against genotoxic effects of alkylating carcinogens. We analysed regulation of MGMT expression after exposing rat hepatoma H4IIE cells to various 'stress' factors. Treatments that damage DNA such as alkylation, hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet or X-ray exposure, as well as restriction enzymes introduced into cells by electroporation or arrest of replication by hydroxyurea significantly induced MGMT mRNA (2.5 to 5-fold). Slight induction (up to 2.5-fold) was observed after heat shock or cadmium/zinc treatment. No or only a very weak induction (less than 1.5-fold) was observed after treatment with 6-thioguanine, 5-azacytidine, transfection of methylated DNA, depletion of MGMT by feeding with O6-methylguanine or O6-benzylguanine, serum starvation and feeding of starved cells, cAMP, TPA and dexamethasone treatment. Inhibitors of protein kinases, H8 and H9, induced MGMT mRNA. On the other hand, an inhibitor of phosphatases (sodium vanadate) prevented induction of MGMT by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The data indicate that DNA breaks are an ultimate signal for MGMT mRNA induction and that protein phosphorylation is involved in regulating MGMT expression.
