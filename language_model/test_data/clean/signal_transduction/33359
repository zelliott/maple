We investigated the cross-talk between the histamine and ATP receptors in HL-60 human promyelocytes. While both histamine and extracellular ATP increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) we found that histamine treatment causes a decrease in the subsequent ATP-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx from extracellular space. In addition, histamine also inhibited the subsequent ATP-induced inositol 1.4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation in a manner comparable to the Ca2+ release. However, histamine did not inhibit thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release and influx, thus indicating that histamine does not directly inhibit the Ca2+ release-activated channel (CRAC). Ca2+ elevation induced by 2'- and 3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) ATP (BzATP), which does not produce IP3, was also inhibited by treatment with histamine, suggesting the presence of ATP-gated channels that are regulated by histamine. Treatment with dibutyryl cAMP or 8-bromo-cAMP inhibited the subsequent ATP-induced response similar to histamine. Moreover, the incubation of cells with N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H89), a protein kinase A inhibitor abolished histamine's inhibitory effect on the ATP-induced [Ca2+]i rise and IP3 formation. These results suggest that histamine inhibits both ATP-induced IP3 production and ATP-activated channel opening, through protein kinase A activation.
