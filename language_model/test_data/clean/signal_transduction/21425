The lining of the intestine is renewed at an extraordinary rate, outpacing all other tissues in the vertebrate body. The renewal process is neatly organized in space, so that the whole production line, from the ever-youthful stem cells to their dying, terminally differentiated progeny, is laid out to view in histological sections. A flurry of recent papers has clarified the key regulatory signals and brought us to the point where we can begin to give a coherent account, for at least one tissue, of how these signals collaborate to organize the architecture and behaviour of a stem-cell system.
