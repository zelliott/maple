The formation of multimolecular assemblies of signaling molecules at the plasma membrane is key to triggering signaling cascades following activation of transmembrane receptors at the plasma membrane. We have developed a method to immunoisolate activated T cell receptors (TCRs) and associated signaling molecules in plasma membrane subdomains from Jurkat T leukemic cells. The immunoisolation procedure for the signaling complexes uses magnetic beads, which are coupled to TCR-activating antibodies. Following mechanical cellular disruption using nitrogen cavitation, conjugates of these beads with Jurkat cells are formed and isolated. TCR-signaling complexes within plasma membrane fragments associate with the antibody-coupled beads and are retrieved along with the beads using a magnet. We found that the immunoisolated plasma membrane fragments are highly enriched for activated TCRs and associated signaling proteins. This isolation procedure allows a detailed and precise biochemical analysis of the assembly of signaling proteins in plasma membrane subdomains.
