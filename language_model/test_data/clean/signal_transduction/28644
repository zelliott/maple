The intermingled differentiation and sorting out of Dictyostelium prestalk-O and prespore cells requires the diffusible signaling molecule DIF-1, and provides an example of a spatial information-independent patterning mechanism. To further understand this patterning process, we used genetic selection to isolate mutants in the DIF-1 response pathway. The disrupted gene in one such mutant, dimA(-), encodes a bZIP/bRLZ transcription factor, which is required for every DIF-1 response investigated. Furthermore, the dimA(-) mutant shows strikingly similar developmental defects to the dmtA(-) mutant, which is specifically defective in DIF-1 synthesis. However, key differences exist: (1) the dmtA(-) mutant responds to DIF-1 but does not produce DIF-1; (2) the dimA(-) mutant produces DIF-1 but does not respond to DIF-1; and (3) the dimA(-) mutant exhibits cell autonomous defects in cell type differentiation. These results suggest that dimA encodes the key transcriptional regulator required to integrate DIF-1 signaling and subsequent patterning in Dictyostelium.
