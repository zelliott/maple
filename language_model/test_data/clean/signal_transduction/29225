Neurons can change their gene expression patterns according to the inputs they have received. This activity-dependent gene regulation mechanism plays an important role in the formation of neural circuits during development. Further, by regulating the synaptic plasticity, this mechanism may function as an essential one for each organism to adapt flexibly to its environment. This review summarizes our current knowledge about the activity-dependent gene regulation mechanism in neurons, focusing on the transcription factors and signaling pathways involved in this mechanism.
