Protein phosphatases of the 2C family (PP2C) function in the regulation of several signaling pathways from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the HAB1 PP2C is a negative regulator of the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Here, we show that plants expressing a mutant form of HAB1 in which Gly246 was mutated to Asp (G246D) display strong ABA insensitive phenotypes. Our results indicate that the G246D mutation has a hypermorphic rather than a dominant negative effect. The data suggest that this mutation localized in a conserved motif in the PP2C catalytic domain could be used in other PP2Cs to reveal their biological functions.
