The use of recombinant adenoviruses (Ad) to express secreted antagonists of growth factors represents a powerful strategy for studying physiologic functions of growth factor pathways in experimental animals. Indeed, a single adenoviral injection can produce characteristic high-level and persistent plasma expression of soluble receptor ectodomains or secreted protein antagonists, allowing highly stringent conditional inactivation of target pathways in vivo. In this review, we describe our experience using recombinant Ad to inactivate growth factor pathways in vivo and discuss their advantages and limitations. Using our studies on vascular endothelial growth factor and Wnt systems as examples, we further describe how recombinant Ad can unveil previously unknown physiological roles of signaling pathways. Finally, we discuss the potential physiological and therapeutic relevance of our findings.
