On the one hand, redox emerges as a key mechanism in regulating intra- and intercellular signaling and homeostatic systems. On the other hand, cells of the B lineage provide powerful systems to unravel the intra- and intercellular mechanisms that coordinate the processes of development and terminal differentiation.

This essay summarizes a few paradigmatic examples of redox regulation and signal modulation that emerged from, or were confirmed by, studies on the development, differentiation and function of B cells.

While a role for intra- and intercellular redox signaling has been firmly established for differentiating B cells, many fundamental questions remain open, including the cellular sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the spatial and temporal constraints of ROS signaling, and the functional role of the antioxidant response.

Given their robustness and biotechnological and clinical interest, cells of the B lineage continue to be fruitful goldmines from which redox biologists can dig novel mechanistic knowledge of general relevance.
