Adhesion molecules play vital roles in airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) or airway inflammation. Our previous study indicated that adhesion molecule catenin alpha-like 1 (CTNNAL1) is relevant closely to asthma susceptibility, but its biological function or significance is still unclear. In the present study, we observed the temporal and spatial distribution of CTNNAL1 expression in mouse lung tissue with the OVA-sensitized asthma model and found that the level of CTNNAL1 mRNA showed a prominent negative correlation with pulmonary resistance (R(L)). To study the function of CTNNAL1 in airway, effects of CTNNAL1 on proliferation and wound repair activity of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) was investigated with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technique. The results showed that: (1) CTNNAL1 ASO could decelerate the repairing velocity and proliferation of HBEC; (2) CTNNAL1 expression was increased on the edge cells of mechanic wounded area in culture; (3) extracellular matrix component fibronectin (Fn) obviously promoted wound repair activity and proliferation of HBEC, which could be blocked by CTNNAL1 ASO; (4) Western blot showed that Fn could promote FAK phosphorylation, which also be inhibited by CTNNAL1 ASO. In conclusion, the level of CTNNAL1 mRNA expression is highly correlated to airway resistance; CTNNAL1 may contribute to the wound repair and proliferation of HBEC. Furthermore, it may serve to Fn mediated cell-extracellular adhesion and its signal transduction.
