The biochemistry underlying the physiological, adaptive, and toxic effects of carbon monoxide (CO) is linked to its affinity for reduced transition metals. We investigated CO signaling in the vasculature, where hemoglobin (Hb), the CO most important metal-containing carrier is highly concentrated inside red blood cells (RBCs).

By combining NMR, MS, and spectrophotometric techniques, we found that CO treatment of whole blood increases the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) in RBC cytosol, which is linked to a significant Hb deglutathionylation. In addition, this process (i) does not activate glycolytic metabolism, (ii) boosts the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), (iii) increases glutathione reductase activity, and (iv) decreases oxidized glutathione concentration. Moreover, GSH concentration was partially decreased in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose and the PPP antagonist dehydroepiandrosterone. Our MS results show for the first time that, besides Cys93, Hb glutathionylation occurs also at Cys112 of the Î²-chain, providing a new potential GSH source hitherto unknown.

This work provides new insights on the signaling and antioxidant-boosting properties of CO in human blood, identifying Hb as a major source of GSH release and the PPP as a metabolic mechanism supporting Hb deglutathionylation.

CO-dependent GSH increase is a new RBC process linking a redox-inactive molecule, CO, to GSH redox signaling. This mechanism may be involved in the adaptive responses aimed to counteract stress conditions in mammalian tissues.
