Prostate cancer is the leading cause for noncutaneous cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. The disease is biologically characterized as being either androgen dependent or androgen independent. Whereas androgen-dependent prostate cancer can be successfully treated with androgen ablative therapy, to date no cure exists for androgen-independent disease. Mechanisms involved in the progression of prostate cancer to androgen independence are not known. Here we present evidence that in addition to growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, G protein- coupled receptors can mediate survival signals in prostate cancer cells. The G protein- coupled receptors exert their effects by activating multiple intracellular signal transduction networks that promote prostate cancer cell survival, including the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, protein kinase B (Akt) and nuclear factor-kB. Prostate-expressed G protein- coupled receptors and their downstream effectors may prove to be effective targets in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
