The question of how electromagnetic fields--static or low to high frequency--interact with biological systems is of great interest. The current discussion among biologists, chemists, and physicists emphasizes aspects of experimental verification and of defining microscopic and macroscopic mechanisms. Both aspects are reviewed here. We emphasize that in certain situations nonthermal interactions of electromagnetic fields occur with cellular systems.
