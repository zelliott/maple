Cytokines of the gp130 family exert their diverse biological effects by formation of stable high affinity transmembrane receptor complexes that are characterized by the presence of the shared transmembrane signalling receptor gp130. Different gp130 ligands form signalling complexes that vary in both composition and stoichiometry. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of selected ligands and receptor elements indicates that ligands display three topologically conserved receptor recognition epitopes that interact with complementary ligand recognition elements. The composition of the signalling complex and downstream biological responses is defined by the relative affinity of different receptor components for these epitopes. The detailed structure of receptor recognition epitopes indicates that the generation of small molecule cytokine mimetics may be a feasible objective.
