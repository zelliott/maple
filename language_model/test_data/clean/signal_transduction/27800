The TEL/PDGFR beta (T/P) fusion protein isolated from patients bearing a t(5;12) translocation is transforming when expressed in haematopoietic cells. To examine the signal transduction events activated by this protein, we measured the effect of T/P on activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) in mouse bone marrow-derived Ba/F3 cells. Significant increase in the activity of JNK/SAPK1 was observed in transient transfection as well as in Ba/F3 cells stably expressing T/P. This activation was abrogated when the T/P-expressing cells were treated with a specific inhibitor of the PDGFR beta tyrosine kinase, indicating that the activity of the PDGFR beta part of the fusion protein was involved in JNK/SAPK activation. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), a direct activator of JNK/SAPK, prevented T/P-induced JNK/SAPK activation. In addition, inhibition of phosphoinositide-3 OH kinase (PI-3 kinase), a promoting survival factor, potentiated the effect of T/P on JNK/SAPK activation. Interestingly, expression of T/P was shown to initiate an apoptotic response that was enhanced by treatment of cells with the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002, suggesting that T/P mediated cell death through activation of JNK/SAPK signalling pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of the dominant negative mutant of MKK4 decreased T/P-mediated apoptosis, while a dominant-negative mutant of PI-3 kinase enhances cell death. These findings indicate that activation of JNK/SAPK by T/P is related to apoptosis rather than cell proliferation and transformation.
