Depletion of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) gene expression resulted in augmented tau and glycosynthetase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), in contrast, TRH administration resulted in decreases of 75% in GSK-3beta and 90% in Tau phosphorylation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. To further study TRH regulation of tau phosphorylation, immunoblotting was used to explore G-protein coupled TRH receptor activation of the phosphokinase C (PKC) and phosphokinase A (PKA) signaling pathways. TRH was found to rapidly activate PKA (2.5 fold in 10 min) while it suppressed PKC (levels decreased by 85% vs. control) in hippocampal neurons. This process was also discovered to be a cell type-specific response, as TRH activated PKC in only hypothalamic neurons. Further investigation revealed that the Src inhibitor Protein Phosphatase 2 (PP2, 50 uM) could block TRH inhibition of PKC, GSK-3beta, and tau phosphorylation with no effects on PKA. In addition, the PKC inhibitor GF109203 Bis (10 uM) was also able to suppress TRH inhibition of GSK-3beta, leading to increased GSK-3 beta activity. Independent of these effects, inhibition of PKA by H89 (10 uM) significantly blocked TRH inhibition of GSK-3 beta. These data suggests that both PKA and PKC are independently crucial to TRH's effects on GSK-3 beta, and support the roles of two distinct pathways involving suppression of PKC via the Src kinase and activation of PKA in mediating TRH effects on GSK-3 beta and tau. These dual signaling pathways between TRH and tau may provide mechanisms for the precise regulation of tau phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in neurons.
