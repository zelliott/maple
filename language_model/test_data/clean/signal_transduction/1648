The adaptor protein Crk has been reported to associate with focal adhesions and is thought to be involved in integrin-mediated signaling pathway. However, the precise mechanism of Crk-dependent regulation of cytoskeleton still remains under investigation. In this study, we have established a v-Crk-inducible cell line in rat fibroblasts 3Y1 cells and found that v-Crk activated Rho and induced actin stress fiber formation. In addition to the induction of tyrosine-phosphorylation of p130(Cas) and paxillin, we demonstrated that v-Crk induced threonine-phosphorylated bands sized at 72/78 kDa found specifically in 3Y1 cells. Both of the inhibitors of Rho and Rho-associated kinase, C3 and Y27632, respectively, inhibited these v-Crk-induced biochemical effects. Although v-Crk-induced cells exhibited a decrease of cell motility, integrin stimulation recovered the suppression of motility. Furthermore, v-Crk enhanced motility in chemotactic assay toward fibronectin with additional activation of Rho and the increase of levels of CD44 cleavage. These results suggest that v-Crk activated Rho and induced actin stress fiber formation and CD44 cleavage leading to the regulation of cell motility.
