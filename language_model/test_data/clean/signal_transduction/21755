Nutrient and oxygen availability are key metabolic parameters for biopharmaceutical manufacturing. In order to enable mammalian cells to manifest their intracellular nutrient and oxygen levels we engineered a genetic sensor circuitry which converts signals impinging on the cellular redox balance into a robust reporter gene expression readout. Capitalizing on the Streptomyces coelicolor redox control system, consisting of REX modulating ROP-containing promoters in an NADH-dependent manner, we designed a mammalian dual sensor transcription control system by fusing REX to the generic VP16 transactivation domain of Herpes simplex, which reconstitutes an artificial transactivator (REDOX) able to bind and activate chimeric promoters assembled by placing a ROP operator module 5' of a minimal eukaryotic promoter (P(ROP)). When nutrient levels were low and resulted in depleted NADH pools REDOX-dependent P(ROP)-driven expression of secreted (human-secreted alkaline phosphatase; SEAP) or intracellular (Renilla reniformis luciferase; rLUC) reporter genes was high as a consequence of increased REDOX-P(ROP) affinity. Conversely, at hypoxic conditions leading to high intracellular NADH levels, strongly reduced REDOX-P(ROP) interaction mediated low-level transgene expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells. Other molecules (for example, 2,4-dinitrophenol, cyanide or hydrogen peroxide) which are known to imbalance the intracellular NADH/NAD+ poise could also be detected using the REDOX-P(ROP) sensor circuitry. REDOX's sensor capacity (nutrient and oxygen levels) operated seamlessly in transgenic CHO-K1 cell derivatives adapted for growth in serum-free suspension cultures and enabled precise monitoring of the population's metabolic state. As the first genetic metabolic sensor designed for mammalian cells, REDOX may foster advances in process development and biopharmaceutical manufacturing.
