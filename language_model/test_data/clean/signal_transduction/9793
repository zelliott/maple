It is becoming increasingly clear that members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family have roles in the central nervous system that extend beyond their well-established roles as neurotrophic and neuroprotective factors. Recent findings have indicated that the TGF-β signaling pathways are involved in the modulation of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the adult mammalian brain. In this review, we discuss how TGF-β, bone morphogenetic protein and activin signaling at central synapses modulate synaptic plasticity, cognition and affective behavior. We also discuss the implications of these findings for the molecular understanding and potential treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as anxiety, depression and other neurological disorders.
