Ionic channel proteins are possible sites of microwave interaction at the cell membrane level. Patch-clamp data, using single channel and total current recording, indicated that low level microwave fields may modify some functional parameters of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in primary chick myotubes, suggesting a possible effect of microwaves on myogenic cells. Here, we investigated the biological relevance of such results, in relation to the possible involvement of intracellular signaling processes. We exposed L6-C5 myogenic cells to low power electromagnetic fields and observed the consequences on hormonal activation of phospholipases C and D. We found that increased inositol phospholipid turnover, induced by acetylcholine and arginine vasopressin activation of phospholipase C, was not modified in microwave irradiated myoblasts or myotubes. Moreover, vasopressin-dependent phospholipase D activation, assessed by measuring the [3H]-free choline release, was not modified by microwave irradiation. Our conclusions suggest that low level microwave fields do not modify signal transduction pathways activated by acetylcholine and vasopressin in L6-C5 myogenic cells.
