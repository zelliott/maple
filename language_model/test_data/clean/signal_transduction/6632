Neutrophil activation and adaptation are beginning to be understood in quantitative and mechanistic detail. Neutrophil responses to chemoattractants involve cell surface receptors, guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins and intracellular second messengers which are generated within a few seconds of the presentation of the ligand. Novel real-time fluorescent methods have made it possible to examine the dynamics of assembly and disassembly of receptors and G proteins during cell activation and to model, by computer, the complex sequence of ligand-receptor events. Rapid amplification cascades of signals are observed in both stimulatory and inhibitory receptor pathways. The adaptation of neutrophils involves uncoupling between receptors and G proteins, both by sequestering receptors from the transduction sequence and by reducing the activatibility of the G proteins.
