Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) has been found to play an anti-anabolic and/or a catabolic role in adult human articular cartilage via regulation of multiple signaling pathways. Upon FGF-2 stimulation, a molecular crosstalk between the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) pathways are initiated, where PKCδ positively regulates downstream MAPK signaling. In this study, we explored the relationship between fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), Ras, and PKCδ in FGF-2 signaling in human articular chondrocytes. Pathway-specific inhibition using both chemical inhibitors and siRNA targeting FGFR1 demonstrated that, upon FGF-2 stimulation, FGFR1 controlled both Ras and PKCδ activation, which converged on the Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 axis. No crosstalk was observed between Ras and PKCδ. Quantitative PCR analyses revealed that both Ras and PKCδ contributed to FGF-2-mediated upregulation of MMP-13, ADAMTS5, and repression of aggrecan gene. Correspondingly, FGF-2-mediated proteoglycan loss was effectively reversed by individual pathway-specific inhibitor of Ras, PKCδ, and ERK1/2 in both 3-dimensional alginate bead culture and cartilage organ culture systems. Our findings suggest that FGFR1 interacts with FGF-2 and then activates Ras and PKCδ, which concertedly drive MAPK signaling to mediate biological effects of FGF-2. Such an integration of dual inputs constitutes a novel mechanism of FGF-2 signaling cascade in human articular chondrocytes.
