Interleukin-33 (IL-33) was recently recognized as a member of the IL-1 cytokine family. The triggers no matter environmental or endogenous that provoke IL-33 cellular release may be associated with inflammation, infection or tissue damage. However, to date, the regulatory role of IL-33 in the control of melanogenesis has not been elucidated.

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of IL-33 on melanogenesis and to explore its underlying mechanisms.

Melanocytes were exposed to IL-33. Then cell viabilities were measured by MTT assay. The improving activities of IL-33 were examined by melanin synthesis, tyrosinase (TYR) activity assay. The expressions of relative proteins were assessed by Western blotting.

IL-33 increased the TYR activity and melanin content in a dosage-dependent manner at concentrations of 1-10ng/ml. Treatment with 10ng/ml of IL-33 enhanced the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), TYR, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP-1) and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) in normal human foreskin-derived epidermal melanocytes (NHEM). Furthermore, IL-33 could remarkably promote the phosphorylation levels of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). This pro-melanogenic effect could be partially reversed by the pre-treatment with the special p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, and protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H89.

Our results collectively indicated that IL-33 improved melanin biosynthesis in NHEM. This function might be attributed to the fact that IL-33 stimulates the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and CREB, increases the TYR, TRP-1 and DCT expression through MITF, finally resulting in the augment of melanogenesis.
