We have previously reported that a physiological range of shear stress induces neutrophil homotypic aggregation mediated by lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3) interactions. To further characterized the homotypic aggregation, actin polymerization was investigated in neutrophils stimulated by shear stress in comparison with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). In fMLP-stimulated neutrophils, actin polymerization was localized in the pseudopods, and this reaction was not mediated by a cytosolic level of Ca2+. In contrast to fMLP stimulation, the actin polymerization induced by shear stress in a cone-plate viscometer was localized in cell-cell contact regions, and this polymerization required the increase of intracellular Ca2+. This shear stress-induced actin polymerization was not observed when neutrophils were pretreated with anti-LFA-1 or anti-ICAM-3 antibody. In conclusion, LFA-1 and ICAM-3 interaction mediated by the increase of [Ca2+]i generated the intercellular signal in order to accumulate F-actin in the cell-cell contact regions.
