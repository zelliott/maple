The activation of PI-3 kinase/AKT/PKB signal transduction pathway has implicated in the cell growth regulation and proliferation.

To determine a role of PI-3 kinase/AKT/PKB signal transduction pathway in the kidney of Angiotensin II-induced hypertensive rats.

NZW (New Zealand White) rats have been infused by Angiotensin II using osmotic minipump for six days (n = 8). Control group was untreated rats (n = 6). PI-3 inase and AKT/PKB activities were measured in the presence or absence of different inhibitors.

Angiotensin II elevated mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) to 182 +/- 2 mm Hg (p < 0.001) vs untreated control rats (95 +/- 3 mm Hg). Ras-GTPase and PI-3 Kinase activities were elevated in angiotensin II-treated group. Ras inhibitors FPT III and BMS/191563 attenuated MABP to 122 +/- 2 and 127 +/- 4 mm Hg (p < 0.05) and abolished Ras-GTPase and PI-3 Kinase activities. AKT/PKB activity followed the PI-3 kinase activity.

PI-3 kinase/AKT/PKB signal transduction pathway in the kidney is activated and mediates Angiotesin II-induced hypertension.
