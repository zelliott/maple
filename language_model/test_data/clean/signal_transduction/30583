Panaxynol (PNN) occurs in many foods such as carrot, celery, and several reports have shown that it has neuritogenic and neuroprotective properties. In this study, we have investigated the antiproliferative effect and the mechanism of PNN on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced proliferation of rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (RASMCs). PNN significantly inhibited PDGF-BB-induced proliferation and DNA synthesis of RASMCs in a concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis showed that PNN blocked the cell cycle progression at the G(1)/S phase. Preincubation of RASMCs with 9 microM PNN resulted in a significant inhibition of PDGF-BB-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation expression and PDGF-BB-induced CREB phosphorylation expression. The results indicated that the inhibitory effect of PNN on the PDGF-BB-induced proliferation of RASMCs might be mediated by blocking phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and that of CREB.
