The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a major part of the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system. The function of the CSF and the tissue that secretes it, the choroid plexus (CP) has traditionally been thought as providing the brain with essential nutrients, removing products of neuronal activity of the central nervous system, and providing mechanical support for the brain's fragile cellular network. More recent studies suggest, however, that the CP and CSF system play a much more active role in the function of the central nervous system being a target, source and pathway for neuroendocrine signaling within the brain.
