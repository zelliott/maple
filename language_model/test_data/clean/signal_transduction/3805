The attributes of consciousness are briefly discussed and matched to the known characteristics of the serotonergic neuronal system. In particular sleep, the action of agonist drugs, the regulatory role and monitoring components, together with the receptor areas for serotonergic activity, are identified as significant correlates of consciousness. Fr√∂hlich-like phenomena are attributed to the topology of the serotonergic cell which is posited to produce excitations in the gigaHz or very high frequency range. Coding by discrete channel frequency and propagation throughout the vast microtubule cytoskeletal structure of serotonergic activity is proposed as the biophysical basis of consciousness in higher mammals, particularly humans.
