Hydroquinone is a toxic compound and a major benzene metabolite. We report that it strongly inhibits the activation of macrophages and associated cells. Thus, it suppressed the production of proinflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-3, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-23], secretion of toxic molecules [nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)] and the activation and expression of CD29 as judged by cell-cell adhesion and surface staining experiments. The inhibition was due to the induction of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 in LPS-activated macrophages, since blocking HO-1 activity with ZnPP, an HO-1 specific inhibitor, abolished hydroquinone's NO inhibitory activity. In addition, hydroquinone and inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway had very similar inhibitory effects on LPS-induced and CD29-mediated macrophage responses, including the phosphorylation of Akt. Therefore, our data suggest that hydroquinone inhibits macrophage-mediated immune responses by modulating intracellular signaling and protective mechanisms.
