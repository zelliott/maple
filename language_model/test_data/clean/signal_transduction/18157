Mechanical stress-induced matrix deformation plays a fundamental role in regulating cellular activities; however, little is known about its underlying mechanisms. To understand the effects of matrix deformation on chondrocytes, we characterized primary chondrocytes cultured on three-dimensional collagen scaffoldings, which can be loaded mechanically with a computer-controlled "Bio-Stretch" device. Cyclic matrix deformation greatly stimulated proliferation of immature chondrocytes, but not that of hypertrophic chondrocytes. This indicates that mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation is developmental stage specific. Synthesis of cartilage matrix protein (CMP/matrilin-1), a mature chondrocyte marker, and type X collagen, a hypertrophic chondrocyte marker, was up-regulated by stretch-induced matrix deformation. Therefore, genes of CMP and type X collagen are responsive to mechanical stress. Mechanical stimulation of the mRNA levels of CMP and type X collagen occurred exactly at the same time points when these markers were synthesized by nonloading cells. This indicates that cyclic matrix deformation does not alter the speed of differentiation, but affects the extent of differentiation. The addition of the stretch-activated channel blocker gadolinium during loading abolished mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation, but did not affect the up-regulation of CMP mRNA by mechanical stretch. In contrast, the calcium channel blocker nifedipine inhibited both the stretch-induced proliferation and the increase of CMP mRNA. This suggests that stretch-induced matrix deformation regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation via two signal transduction pathways, with stretch-activated channels involved in transducing the proliferative signals and calcium channels involved in transducing the signals for both proliferation and differentiation.
