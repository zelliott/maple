The available knowledge concerning second messengers such as Ca(2+) and cAMP has grown immensely in the past few years. The concept of tight spatial compartmentalisation of these signals within cells has led to more refined models of intracellular signalling. The development of recombinant probes based on the green fluorescent protein have allowed the monitoring of these second messenger levels in single cells, with high spatial and temporal resolution.
