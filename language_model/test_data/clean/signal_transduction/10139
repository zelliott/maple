Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death is an important issue in Primary Open Angle-Glaucoma (POAG) in terms of both vision loss and health care costs. Yet, the pathophysiology underlying RGC death in glaucoma is unclear. A growing body of evidence indicates that proteases that modulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) milieu in the retina, either directly or indirectly, play an important role in dictating the fate of RGCs. Recent evidence indicates that proteases, in addition to ECM-remodeling, have broader functional roles in glutamate receptor processing and predisposing RGCs to secondary damage. This review is focused on discussing the role of two groups of proteases, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the plasminogen activators (PAs), in RGC death. In a long-run, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of proteases may lead to the development of adjunctive treatment options to attenuate RGC death and improve vision loss in glaucoma.
