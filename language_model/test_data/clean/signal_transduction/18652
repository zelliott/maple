To perform the vital functions of motility and division, cells must undergo dramatic shifts in cell polarity. Recent evidence suggests that polarized distributions of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which are clearly important for regulating cell morphology during migration, also play an important role during the final event in cell division, which is cytokinesis. Thus, there is a critical interplay between the membrane phosphoinositides and the cytoskeletal cortex that regulates the complex series of cell shape changes that accompany these two processes.
