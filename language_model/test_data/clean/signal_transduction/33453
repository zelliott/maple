To study the effects of acrylonitrile on the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways and related gene expressions in rat brain and rat glial cells.

The microarray and EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) techniques were used to investigated NF-kappaB pathway and related gene expressions changes in rat brain after treated with 0 mg/kg and 200mg/kg ACN for 14,28 and 90 days and rat normal glial cells after treated with 0, 25, 50 and 75 microg/ml ACN for 4 and 24 hours.

ACN induced the NF-kappaB pathway related gene expression (NIK, IKK, NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB 2, IkappaBa, c-myc) in rat brain (in vivo) and in rat glial cells (in vitro). It was confirmed by EMSA results that ACN caused activation of the NF-kappaB pathway in rat brain and rat glial cells.

There is some relationship between gene expression of NF-kappaB pathway and ACN-induced oxidative stress.
