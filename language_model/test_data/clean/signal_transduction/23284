F-actin binding proteins ezrin and paxillin are involved in cell adhesion and cell migration/invasion. The aim of the study was to investigate their role in urothelial bladder carcinogenesis.

Expression of ezrin and paxillin was studied by immunohistochemistry in 104 and 96 cases of urothelial bladder tumors, respectively. Correlations with clinicopathologic data and expression of p53, E-cadherin, and Î²-catenin were examined.

Positive ezrin and paxillin protein expression was found in 99% and 93.7% of cases, respectively. Membranous expression of ezrin was significantly lower in high grade tumors and correlated with invasion. Multivariate analysis showed that ezrin is an independent predictor of muscularis propria invasion. Paxillin expression was significantly decreased in urothelial carcinomas compared with tumors of low malignant potential and low paxillin levels also correlated with advancing tumor stage and invasion. A statistically significant correlation was found between membranous ezrin and E-cadherin as well as between ezrin and paxillin expression in urothelial tumors.

Down-regulation of ezrin and paxillin in urothelial bladder tumors is associated with aggressive tumor features and invasiveness.
