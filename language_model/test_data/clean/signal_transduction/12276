We used dexamethasone (DEX)-treated osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, and investigated the effects of an AMP-activated protein kinase activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta- D-ribonucleoside (AICAR), a Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor, fasudil hydrochrolide, as well as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, simvastatin and pitavastatin, all of which inhibit the mevalonate pathway. DEX (10(-8) M) significantly enhanced mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 antagonists, follistatin and Dan, and addition of each of 10 (-4) M AICAR, 10 (-5) M fasudil, 10(-6) M simvastatin, and 10(-6) M pitavastatin significantly reversed the enhancement in mRNA expression of follistatin and Dan and stimulated that of BMP-2 in the cells (p<0.05). DEX (10(-8) M) also significantly suppressed mineralization in the cells, and addition of each of these agents significantly reversed the suppression of mineralization (p<0.05). These findings suggest that the mevalonate pathway was involved in glucocorticoid-induced osteoblast dysfunction, and that its inhibition might promote bone formation through BMP-2 and alleviate glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.
