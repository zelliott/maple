Some Magnolia (Magnoliaceae) species are used for the empirical treatment of diabetes mellitus, but the antidiabetic properties of Magnolia dealbata have not yet been experimentally validated. Here we report that an ethanolic extract of Magnolia dealbata seeds (MDE) and its active principles honokiol (HK) and magnolol (MG) induced the concentration-dependent 2-NBDG uptake in murine 3T3-F442A and human subcutaneous adipocytes. In insulin-sensitive adipocytes, MDE 50 μg/ml induced the 2-NBDG uptake by 30% respect to insulin, while HK and MG, 30 μM each, did it by 50% (murine) and 40% (human). The simultaneous application of HK and MG stimulated 2-NBDG uptake by 70% in hormone-sensitive cells, on which Magnolia preparations exerted synergic effects with insulin. In insulin-resistant adipocytes, MDE, HK and MG induced 2-NBDG uptake by 57%, 80% and 96% respect to Rosiglitazone (RGZ), whereas HK and MG simultaneously applied stimulated 2-NBDG uptake more efficiently than RGZ (120%) in both murine and human adipocytes. Inhibitors of the insulin-signaling pathway abolished the glucose uptake induced by Magnolia dealbata preparations, suggesting that their antidiabetic effects are mediated by this signaling pathway. In addition, MDE, HK and MG exerted only mild to moderate proadipogenic effects on 3T3-F442A and human preadipocytes, although the combined application of HK and MG markedly increased the lipid accumulation in both cell types. In summary, Magnolia dealbata and its active principles HK and MG stimulate glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant murine and human adipocytes using the insulin signaling pathway.
