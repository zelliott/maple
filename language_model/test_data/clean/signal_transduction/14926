Valproic acid (VPA), a mood stabilizer and anticonvulsant, has a variety of neurotrophic functions; however, less is known about how VPA regulates neurite outgrowth. Here, using N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells as the model, we show that VPA upregulates Gadd45a to trigger activation of the downstream JNK cascade controlling neurite outgrowth. VPA induces the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the substrate paxillin, while VPA induction of neurite outgrowth is inhibited by JNK inhibitors (SP600125 and the small JNK-binding peptide) or a paxillin construct harboring a Ser 178-to-Ala mutation at the JNK phosphorylation. Transfection of Gadd45a, acting through the effector MEKK4, leads to the phosphorylation of the JNK cascade. Conversely, knockdown of Gadd45a with siRNA reduces the effect of VPA. Taken together, these results suggest that upregulation of Gadd45a explains one of the mechanisms whereby VPA induces the neurotrophic effect, providing a new role of Gadd45a in neurite outgrowth.
