The ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy constitute key signalling pathways in the host response to infection. The identification of adaptors linking the two pathways has prompted a re-examination of the latter's involvement in inflammatory reactions and the clearance of bacteria. The ubiquitin-autophagy pathway is a preferred target for effectors from pathogens that seek to exploit and evade the host defence mechanisms. A number of new players and signalling nodes have recently been identified. Here, we discuss these new insights into the host's control of bacterial infection.
