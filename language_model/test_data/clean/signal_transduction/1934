To clarify if Epstein-Barr virus encoded LMP1 induces matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression via NF-kappa B or AP-1 signaling pathway, which gives evidence to the elucidation of the mechanism of LMP1- mediated carcinogenesis.

To determine whether LMP1 or its mutants contribute to MMP9 production via NF-kappa B or AP-1 transcription factor, MMP9-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT), NF-kappa B mut 9-CAT, AP-1 mut MMP9-CAT were transfected into human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells stably expressing LMP1 (HNE2-LMP1) or its mutants, [HNE2-LMP1 (1-185), HNE2-LMP1 (1-231), HNE2-LMP1 delta 187-351] by electroporation technic. The difference of MMP9 reporter activity among those cell lines was detected by CAT assay and expression of MMP9 was determined in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells stably expressing LMP1 or its mutants by zymographic analysis. In the meantime, efforts were made to demonstrate if LMP1 regulates NF-kappa B or AP-1 activation using reporter gene analysis.

In contrast with vector-transfected cells, MMP9 CAT activity in HNE2-LMP1, HNE2-LMP1 (1-185), HNE2-LMP1(1-231), HNE2-LMP1 delta 187-351 increased 7.2, 1.3, 3.3, 4.0 times respectively. Zymographic analysis demonstrated that the 92 kDa MMP9 expression was induced in HNE2-LMP1, HNE2-LMP1(1-231) and HNE2-LMP1 delta 187-351 cells, whereas it was negative in HNE2-pSG5 and HNE2-LMP1 (1-185) cells. As compared to the HNE2 cells, NF-kappa B or AP-1 reporter activity in HNE2-LMP1 cells were increased 13.8, 8.4 fold respectively. Moreover, In contrast with MMP9 CAT-transfected cells, MMP9 CAT activity in NF-kappa B mut MMP9-CAT or AP-1 mut MMP9-CAT transfected HNE2-LMP1, HNE2-LMP1 (1-185), HNE2-LMP1(1-231) and HNE2-LMP1 delta 187-351 cells were significantly decreased by 18.1% or 16.3%, 35.0% or 33.3%, 29.1% or 26.1% from the original level. However, there was no difference in NF-kappa B mut MMP9-CAT or AP-1 mut MMP9-CAT transfected HNE2-pSG5, HNE2-LMP1 (1-185) cells.

In nasophargyngeal carcinoma, Epstein-Barr virus-encoded LMP1 induces MMP9 transcription and enzymatic activity via an NF-kappa B or AP-1 signaling pathway, which may contribute to invasiveness and metastasis.
