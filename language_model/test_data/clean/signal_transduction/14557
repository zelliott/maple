Insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) have an ancient origin and play essential roles in fundamental biological processes. Although IGFs are principally known for their roles in regulating cell growth and survival, their ability to influence cell motility is just as significant. In the past 20 years, research has provided indisputable evidence for the regulatory role of IGFs in the migration of various cell types. Cell migration is crucial for reproduction, development, and tissue regeneration; IGFs play an important role in coordinating these processes. Moreover, studies continue to uncover the IGFs' role in stimulating cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. This review surveys current knowledge on the cell migration-modulating properties of IGFs and the biochemical pathways by which these peptides regulate cell movement in both physiological and pathological conditions.
