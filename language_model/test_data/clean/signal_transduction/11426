1,25(OH)(2)-Vitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], PTH and 17beta-estradiol increase intracellular Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) in rat enterocytes by stimulating inner Ca(2+) store mobilization and voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels through non-genomic activation of second-messenger cascades. The participation of store-operated Ca(2+) (SOC) channels in 17beta-estradiol regulation of enterocyte [Ca(2+)](i) has also been suggested. The aim of this work was to investigate whether PTH and/or 17beta-estradiol exert additive or synergistic effects acting in concert with the classic intestinal calciotropic hormone 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Fura-2-loaded rat duodenal cells were stimulated using rPTH (10 nM), 17beta-estradiol (0.1 nM) or 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (0.1 nM). The resulting Ca(2+) signal was characterized by an almost immediate rise in [Ca(2+)](i) (within 30 s) rapidly reaching peak levels, followed by a plateau phase that remained sustained as long as the cells were exposed to the stimulus. The addition of PTH at the sustained phase induced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) or, conversely, the addition of the secosteroid after the PTH-induced effect, did not induce additional increases in [Ca(2+)](i). Simultaneous treatment with both hormones resulted in an elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) equivalent to the maximal level caused by either agonist alone, suggesting common components for [Ca(2+)]i stimulation by PTH and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Treatment with 17beta-estradiol at the sustained phase induced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) or, conversely, treatment with the secosteroid after the 17beta-estradiol effect, induced additional increments in [Ca(2+)](i) (58 % and 63 %, respectively). Simultaneous treatment of enterocytes with both steroids potentiated their individual effects to the same extent as when added sequentially, also indicative of additive actions mediated by different sources of calcium signaling cascades. Moreover, 17beta-estradiol failed to further increase the 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced initial Ca(2+) elevation in Ca(2+)-free medium, thus suggesting that extracellular influx mechanisms rather than intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization account for estrogen potentiation of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) modulation of [Ca(2+)](i) in duodenal cells.
