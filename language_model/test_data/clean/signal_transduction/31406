The major physiological function of erythropoietin is the induction of erythropoiesis. A growing body of evidence indicates, however, that this hormone has tissue-protective effects and prevents tissue damage during ischemia and inflammation. This review article summarizes the present knowledge on the cardiovascular and renal protective effects of erythropoietin and discusses the possible underlying mechanisms.
