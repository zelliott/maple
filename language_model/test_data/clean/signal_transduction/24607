A two chain model, composed of ligand-binding and signal transducing subunits, first identified in the interleukin-6 receptor system, has been revealed in several other cytokine systems. Common signal transducers shared by several receptor systems may explain a functional redundancy characteristic of cytokines. The signaling pathway from the receptor to gene activation is now becoming clearer due to the successful molecular cloning of several transcription factors.
