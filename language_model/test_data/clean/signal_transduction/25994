Despite significant infiltration into tumors, the effector function of macrophages (MPs) and microglia (MG) appears to be suppressed in gliomas. Although STAT3 pathway is thought to play a role in this process, the exact mechanism by which gliomas induce STAT3 activation in MPs and MG is not known. Because activation of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) can induce STAT3, and because gliomas express high levels of S100B, a RAGE ligand, we hypothesized that MP/MG STAT3 activity may be modulated through S100B-RAGE interaction. Exposure of N9 MG and bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMM) to GL261 glioma condition medium (GCM) and low (nM) levels of S100B increased RAGE expression, induced STAT3 and suppressed MG function in vitro. Furthermore, neutralization of S100B in GCM, partially reversed IL-1Î² suppression in BMM, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of GCM to be in part due to S100B. Finally, blockage of S100B-RAGE interaction inhibited STAT3 activation in N9 MG and in glioma MG/MP in vivo. These findings suggest that the RAGE pathway may play an important role in STAT3 induction in glioma-associated MG/MPs, and that this process may be mediated through S100B.
