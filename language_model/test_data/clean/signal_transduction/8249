We previously reported (Bell, D., P. Chomarat, D. Broyles, G. Netto, G.M. Harb, S. Lebecque, J. Valladeau, J. Davoust, K.A. Palucka, and J. Banchereau. 1999. J. Exp. Med. 190: 1417-1426) that breast cancer tumors are infiltrated with mature dendritic cells (DCs), which cluster with CD4(+) T cells. We now show that CD4(+) T cells infiltrating breast cancer tumors secrete type 1 (interferon gamma) as well as high levels of type 2 (interleukin [IL] 4 and IL-13) cytokines. Immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections revealed intense IL-13 staining on breast cancer cells. The expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 in breast cancer cells suggests that IL-13 actually delivers signals to cancer cells. To determine the link between breast cancer, DCs, and CD4(+) T cells, we implanted human breast cancer cell lines in nonobese diabetic/LtSz-scid/scid beta2 microglobulin-deficient mice engrafted with human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells and autologous T cells. There, CD4(+) T cells promote early tumor development. This is dependent on DCs and can be partially prevented by administration of IL-13 antagonists. Thus, breast cancer targets DCs to facilitate its development.
