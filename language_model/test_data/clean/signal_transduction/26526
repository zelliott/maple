The introduction of cyclosporine (CsA) has improved graft survival, but it causes nephropathy, which limits its clinical utility. Recently, we reported that carbamylated erythropoietin (CEPO) protected kidneys from ischemia reperfusion injury as well as EPO. To investigate the clinical  applications of CEPO, we next evaluated the long-term therapeutic effect of CEPO using a CsA-induced nephropathy model. CsA caused renal dysfunction, while EPO/CEPO administration significantly improved renal function. EPO treatment significantly increased Hb concentration, while CEPO treatment  neither enhanced nor reduced Hb concentration. CsA treatment induced tubular apoptosis, while EPO/CEPO administration inhibited it and increased PI3 kinase activation and Akt phosphorylation. In parallel, morphological assessment revealed that EPO/CEPO significantly reduced CsA-induced interstitial  fibrosis and inhibited interstitial macrophage infiltration. In addition, real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that cortical mRNA levels of TGF-Î²1 and type I collagen were suppressed in the EPO/CEPO group. These results suggest a new therapeutic approach using CEPO to protect kidneys from CsA-induced  nephropathy.
