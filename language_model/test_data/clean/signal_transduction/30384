Systemic therapy of metastatic kidney cancer has undergone dramatic changes over the past years. One reason for this is our increasing knowledge of different histological subtypes and associated genetic aberrations. Furthermore, signalling pathways have been identified to be relevant for tumour progression and therapeutic intervention. Until some years ago, systemic therapy for kidney cancer consisted of cytokines. In this review, new drugs for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer are discussed. These drugs predominantly interact the VEGF, EGFR and mTOR signalling pathways. Four drugs have been studied in phase III trials and were (or will soon be) approved for treatment of metastatic kidney cancer. Additionally, many drugs are currently being tested in phase I and phase II trials. At present, the following scenarios have an impact on therapy decisions: different prognostic groups, first-line and second-line therapy, combination therapies and the impact of different histological subtypes.
