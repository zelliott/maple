Adaptor MyD88 has a pivotal role in TLR and IL-1R signaling and is involved in mediating excessive inflammation. MyD88 is composed of a death domain and a Toll/IL-1R domain connected by an intermediary domain (INT). The alternatively spliced form of MyD88 lacking the INT prevents signaling through MyD88-dependent TLRs. We designed a peptide from the INT and showed that it inhibits TLR4 activation by LPS when linked to a cell-penetrating peptide. As a new approach for the delivery of signaling-inhibitory peptides, INT peptide acylation also provided efficient cell translocation and inhibition of activation. We determined that INT peptide targets IL-1R-associated kinase 4. Furthermore, MyD88 mutant and molecular modeling refines the MyD88- IL-1R-associated kinase 4 interaction model based on the Myddosome structure. In addition to TLR4, INT peptide also inhibited TLR5, TLR2, TLR9, and IL-1R signaling but not TLR3, which uses Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-β signaling adaptor. Inhibition of signaling in murine and human cells was observed by decreased NF-κB activation, cytokine mRNA synthesis, and phosphorylation of downstream kinases. In the endotoxemic mouse model, INT peptide suppressed production of inflammatory cytokines and improved survival, supporting therapeutic application of INT peptides for the suppression of inflammatory conditions mediated by MyD88.
