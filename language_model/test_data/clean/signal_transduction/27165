The mechanism by which Bcl-2 can insulate cells against multiple diverse apoptotic signals is largely undefined. How is it possible that Bcl-2, which possesses no known catalytic function, can protect against multiple cell-death signals? A proposal to address this question postulates that Bcl-2 functions at convergence points common to most cell-death signal-transduction pathways. This review attempts to integrate observations regarding cell-death signalling in an effort to define points of convergence. The ceramide/ SAPK/JNK and NF kappa B pathways, in particular, were emphasized. Potential points at which Bcl-2 may function frequently involve the transmembrane trafficking of molecules implicated in the mediation of apoptosis. The selectivity of this process and the effector proteins with which Bcl-2 associated remain to be elucidated.
