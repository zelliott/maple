To construct CyclinD (CycD) (-/-)/Patched (Ptc) (+/-) double knockout mice to study the relationship between Hedgehog and Rb signaling pathways.

Amphimixis was performed between female heterozygote CycD knockout mice CycD (+/-) and male heterozygote Ptc knockout mice Ptc (+/-), thus CycD (+/-)/Ptc (+/-) double knockout mice were obtained. These mice underwent secondary matched and thus construct CycD (-/-)/Ptc (+/-) double knockout mice.

CycD (-/-)/Ptc (+/-) double knockout mice, CycD (+/-)/Ptc (+/-) heterozygote double knockout mice, and CycD knockout mice CycD (-/-)/Ptc (+/+) were gained.

The method of amphimixis can construct CycD (--)/Ptc (+/-) double knockout mice that can be used to disclose the regulation between Ptc gene and CycD gene and the relativity between Hedgehog and Rb pathways in mammals.
