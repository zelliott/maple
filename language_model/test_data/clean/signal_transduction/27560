M1/WT4 cells, derived from the murine myeloid leukemic M1 cells by over-expression of the receptor for CSF-1, were transfected with expression vectors encoding SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3 or Cis-1. The differentiation response to CSF-1 and IL-6 was analyzed in the resulting cell lines. Myeloid differentiation in response to CSF-1 was not affected by any of the SOCS proteins, whereas the IL-6-mediated differentiation was inhibited by SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 and slightly delayed by SOCS-2 expression. In M1/WT4 cells IL-6 causes strong tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, whereas the response to CSF-1 is weaker. The expression of the SOCS proteins had no effect on CSF-1 mediated STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation; however, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in response to IL-6 but did not abolish it. It appears, therefore, that SOCS-1, -2 and -3 and Cis-1 do not inhibit tyrosine kinase activity involved in CSF-1 mediated cell differentiation, whereas SOCS-1 and -3 are inhibiting kinase activity required for IL-6-mediated differentiation.
