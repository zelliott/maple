Engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1), a bipartite guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rac 1, was identified as a susceptibility gene for glomerular disease. Here, we reported that ELMO1 interacted with COX-2 in human mesangial cells. Furthermore, we identified ELMO1 as a posttranslational regulator of COX-2 activity. We demonstrated that COX-2 cyclooxygenase activity increased fibronectin promoter activity. The protein-protein interaction between ELMO1 and COX-2 increased the cyclooxygenase activity of COX-2 and, correspondingly, fibronectin expression. We also found that ET625, the dominant negative form of ELMO1 lacking Rac1 activity, interacted with COX-2, increased cyclooxygenase activity of COX-2 and enhanced COX-2-mediated fibronectin upregulation. To further rule out Rac1 as an ELMO1-mediated regulator of COX-2 activity, we employed the constitutive active Rac1, Rac1(Q63E), and demonstrated that Rac1 signaling has no effect on COX-2-mediated fibronectin promoter activity. These results suggest that ELMO1 contributes to the development of glomerular injury through serving as a regulator of COX-2 activity. The interaction of ELMO1 with COX-2 could play an important role in the development and progression of renal glomerular injury.
