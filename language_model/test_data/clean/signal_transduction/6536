There is substantial evidence that Ca2+ fluxes occur during most forms of apoptosis, and that inhibiting such fluxes protects cells from death. IP3 receptors--ligand-gated channels that release Ca2+ from intracellular stores--are emerging as key sites for regulation by pro- and anti-apoptotic factors.
