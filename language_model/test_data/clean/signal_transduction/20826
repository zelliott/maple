The dynamics of changes in the level of cyclic purine nucleotides was studied in the tissues of rats with experimental D-hypovitaminosis in the range of 5 min-24 h after administration of hormonal doses of polyhydroxylated ecdysterone hydroxysterolne and predecessor of 1.25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol)--vitamin D3. The early sharp increase of intracellular pools cEMP in the liver tissue, small intestine, brain and heart mucosa was observed. It precedes the modulation of nucleic acid biosynthesis and supposes activation of the effect of oxysterenes of G-signal (phospholipid) system in the early phase at the expense of interaction with receptors exposed on plasmatic membrane of the cells.
