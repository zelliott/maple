In plants, anthocyanins often appear at specific developmental stages, but are also induced by a number of environmental factors. The coordinated expression of genes encoding the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway enzymes is controlled at the transcriptional level usually by an R2R3Myb transcription factor. However, little is known about the effects of R2R3-Myb on plant resistance to environmental stresses. In this study, we introduced an R2R3Myb transcription factor gene Mdmyb10, a regulatory gene of anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple fruit, into Arabidopsis and analyzed its function to osmotic stress in transgenic plants. Under high osmotic stress, the Mdmyb10 over-expressing plants exhibited growth better than wild-type plants. The elevated tolerance of the transgenic plants to osmotic stress was confirmed by the changes of flavonoids, chlorophyll, malondialdehyde and proline contents. These results preliminarily showed that the Mdmyb10 can possibly be used to enhance the high osmotic-tolerant ability of plants.
