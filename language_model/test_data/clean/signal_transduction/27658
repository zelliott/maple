Candida albicans undergoes reversible morphogenetic transitions between budding, pseudohyphal and hyphal growth forms that promote the virulence of this pathogenic fungus. The regulatory networks that control morphogenesis are being elucidated; however, the primary signals that trigger morphogenesis remain obscure, and the physiological outputs of these networks are complex.
