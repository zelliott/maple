It is of great importance to know the endogenous mechanism in burn-induced organ injuries, not only for the understanding of pathophysiological processes after burn, but also for guiding the clinical treatment. Recent studies have widened and deepened our scope and understanding of secondary injuries to various organs. However, a unanimous understanding of molecular pathway involved in all burn-induced organ injuries has not been attained. Relatively, the mechanism of endogenous cellular injuries as a result of burn injury could be regarded as a common one to explain the causation of cellular injury, and to guide the prevention and treatment for the burn-induced complications using cytoprotection strategy. This review summarized four aspects of the mechanism of endogenous cellular injuries, including cellular injuries induced by ischemic/hypoxic-oxidative stress, excessive inflammatory factors released by inflammatory cells, immunosuppression caused by suppression of function of adaptive immune cells, and dysfunction of important supportive cells of various organs.
