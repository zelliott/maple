Mast cells mediate both IgE-dependent allergic reactions and protective responses against acute infections, possibly through the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We find that antigen interacts synergistically with TLR2 and TLR4 ligands to markedly enhance production of cytokines in murine mast cell lines. However, the TLR ligands neither stimulated degranulation and release of arachidonic acid nor influenced such responses to antigen, probably because these ligands failed to generate a necessary calcium signal. The enhanced cytokine production could be attributed to synergistic activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in addition to the engagement of a more effective repertoire of transcription factors for cytokine gene transcription. The synergistic interactions of TLR ligands and antigen might have relevance to the exacerbation of IgE-mediated allergic diseases by infectious agents.
