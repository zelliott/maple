For mating Chlamydomonas eugametos gametes to fuse with their partners, they must first lyse part of the anterior cell wall and protrude their mating structures. These responses can be artificially induced by compounds that raise the Cai level, viz. InsP3, A23187, TFP and ethanol. We conclude that calcium should be considered with cAMP to be involved in signal transduction during C. eugametos mating.
