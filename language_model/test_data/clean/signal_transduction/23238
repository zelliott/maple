Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial step in tumor progression and has an important role during cancer invasion and metastasis. Although fucosyltransferase IV (FUT4) has been implicated in the modulation of cell migration, invasion and cancer metastasis, its role during EMT is unclear. This study explores the molecular mechanisms of the involvement of FUT4 in EMT in breast cancer cells. Breast cancer cell lines display increased expression of FUT4, which is accompanied by enhanced appearance of the mesenchymal phenotype and which can be reversed by knockdown of endogenous FUT4. Moreover, FUT4 induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and inactivation of GSK3β and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, resulting in increased Snail and MMP-9 expression and greater cell motility. Taken together, these findings indicate that FUT4 has a role in EMT through activation of the PI3K/Akt and NF-κB signaling systems, which induce the key mediators Snail and MMP-9 and facilitate the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype. Our findings support the possibility that FUT4 is a novel regulator of EMT in breast cancer cells and a promising target for cancer therapy.
