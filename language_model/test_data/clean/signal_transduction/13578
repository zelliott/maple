Glucocorticoids are primary stress hormones necessary for life that regulate numerous physiologic processes in an effort to maintain homeostasis. Synthetic derivatives of these hormones have been mainstays in the clinic for treating inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders, and hematologic cancers. The physiologic and pharmacologic actions of glucocorticoids are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. Ligand-occupied GR induces or represses the transcription of thousands of genes through direct binding to DNA response elements, physically associating with other transcription factors, or both. The traditional view that glucocorticoids act through a single GR protein has changed dramatically with the discovery of a large cohort of receptor isoforms with unique expression, gene-regulatory, and functional profiles. These GR subtypes are derived from a single gene by means of alternative splicing and alternative translation initiation mechanisms. Posttranslational modification of these GR isoforms further expands the diversity of glucocorticoid responses. Here we discuss the origin and molecular properties of the GR isoforms and their contribution to the specificity and sensitivity of glucocorticoid signaling in healthy and diseased tissues.
