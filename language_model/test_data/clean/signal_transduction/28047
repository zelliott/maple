Signaling between the ligand ephrinB2 and the respective receptors of the EphB class is known to play a vital role during vascular morphogenesis and angiogenesis. The relative contribution of each EphB receptor type present on endothelial cells to these processes remains to be determined. It has been shown that ephrinB2-EphB receptor signal transduction leads to a repulsive migratory behavior of endothelial cells. It remained unclear whether this anti-migratory effect can be mediated by EphB4 signaling alone or whether other EphB receptors are necessary. It also remained unclear whether the kinase activity of EphB4 is pivotal to its action. To answer these questions, we developed a cellular migration system solely dependent on ephrinB2-EphB4 signaling. Using this system, we could show that EphB4 activation leads to the inhibition of cell migration. Furthermore we identified PP2, a known inhibitor of kinases of the Src family, and PD 153035, a known inhibitor of EGF receptor kinase, as inhibitors of EphB4 kinase activity. Using PP2, the inhibition of cell migration by ephrinB2 could be relieved, demonstrating that the kinase function of EphB4 is of prominent importance in this process. These results show that EphB4 activation is not only accompanying ephrinB2 induced repulsive behavior of cells, but is capable of directly mediating this effect.
