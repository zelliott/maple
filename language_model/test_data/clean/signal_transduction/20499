Pre-natal alcohol exposure causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), the most common, preventable cause of developmental disability. The developing cerebellum is particularly vulnerable to the effects of ethanol. We reported that ethanol inhibits the stimulation of axon outgrowth in cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) by NAP, an active motif of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), by blocking NAP activation of Fyn kinase and its downstream signaling molecule, the scaffolding protein Cas. Here, we asked whether ethanol inhibits the stimulation of axon outgrowth by diverse axon guidance molecules through a common action on the Src family kinases (SFK). We first demonstrated that netrin-1, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neural cell adhesion molecule L1 stimulate axon outgrowth in CGNs by activating SFK, Cas, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). The specific SFK inhibitor, PP2, blocked the stimulation of axon outgrowth and the activation of the SFK-Cas-ERK1/2 signaling pathway by each of these axon-guidance molecules. In contrast, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stimulated axon outgrowth and activated ERK1/2 without first activating SFK or Cas. Clinically relevant concentrations of ethanol inhibited axon outgrowth and the activation of the SFK-Cas-ERK1/2 pathway by netrin-1, GDNF, and L1, but did not disrupt BDNF-induced axon outgrowth or ERK1/2 activation. These results indicate that SFK, but not ERK1/2, is a primary target for ethanol inhibition of axon outgrowth. The ability of ethanol to block the convergent activation of the SFK-Cas-ERK1/2 pathway by netrin-1, GDNF, L1, and ADNP could contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of FASD.
