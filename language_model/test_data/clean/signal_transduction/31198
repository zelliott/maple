IL-2 is expressed predominantly by activated T cells, and regulates T cell function by activating, via its receptor, the latent transcription factor STAT5. This signaling can occur in either a paracrine (between cells) or an autocrine (same cell) manner, although the kinetics by which these two signaling modes operate during in vivo T cell responses are unknown. In the current study, IL-2 expression and signaling in a clonotypic population of antiviral CD4+ T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry during the initial 24 h of priming. IL-2 expression and STAT5 activation peaked in parallel, but surprisingly, were almost completely mutually exclusive. Thus, only paracrine IL-2 signaling could be observed. As an additional indication of the efficiency of paracrine IL-2 signaling, polyclonal CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells displayed detectable STAT5 activation under steady-state conditions, which was strongly enhanced by neighboring IL-2-expressing antiviral CD4 cells.
