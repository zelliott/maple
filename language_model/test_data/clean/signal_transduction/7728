The dauer juvenile (DJ) stage of the insect parasitic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae is the only stage in the life cycle which is capable of surviving outside its host and it is adapted for tolerating environmental stresses and for host finding. We have isolated 45 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that are up-regulated in response to desiccation in S. carpocapsae DJs. The majority of these ESTs were co-expressed in response to desiccation and osmotic stress and were generally not induced in response to heat and cold stress. Thirty-two ESTs showed similarity to known sequences. Among these were sequences which encode putative signalling molecules or transcription factors, sequences which detoxify reactive oxygen species, two C-type lectin sequences, ESTs which encode membrane-associated proteins and seven distinct late embryogenic abundant (LEA) sequences. We also isolated 13 novel ESTs. These data show that the molecular response to desiccation stress in entomopathogenic nematode DJs is complex and parallels many of the adaptive changes which occur in drought tolerant plants during exposure to desiccation and osmotic stress. A notable feature of the desiccation response of plants is the number and diversity of hydrophilic LEA proteins synthesised in response to desiccation. All of the LEA sequences detected in animals to date, including those reported in this study, belong to LEA3 group. We show that S. carpocapsae expresses several novel sequences which encode putative hydrophilic and natively unfolded proteins. It is likely that these novel and putative proteins play an important role in desiccation tolerance, possibly by carrying out analogous roles in nematodes to those carried out by the other LEA protein classes in plants.
