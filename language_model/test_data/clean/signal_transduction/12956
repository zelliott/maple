Caveolae are small, cholesterol-rich, hydrophobic membrane domains, characterized by the presence of the protein caveolin and involved in several cellular processes, including clathrin-independent endocytosis, the regulation and transport of cellular cholesterol, and signal transduction. Recently, caveolae have been identified as providing a novel route by which several pathogens are internalized by antigen-presenting cells and as centers for signal transduction. Here, we review the distribution and role of caveolae and caveolin in mammalian immune cells.
