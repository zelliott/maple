Periodontal ligament (PDL) cells, a major component of the tooth supporting apparatus, share osteoblastic characteristics including their responsiveness to parathyroid hormone (PTH). Clinical studies have already pointed to the benefit of PTH in supporting regenerative processes in the craniofacial region. However, those reports did not analyze which cells mediated the PTH effect on the alveolar bone. The aim of the present study has been to further elucidate the mechanism of action of continuous PTH application on human PDL-cells mimicking a local bolus application and to analyze its intracellular signalling pathways to widen the theoretical basis for future development of reliable local PTH delivery protocols. Analyses of PDL of extracted human teeth as well as cultured human PDL-cells demonstrated strong expression of PTH-receptor-1 by immune fluorescencecytochemistry/histochemistry. To examine the effect of short time continuous PTH treatment on PDL-cell osteogenic differentiation, PDL-cells were stimulated for 48h. Analyses for mRNA and protein expression of the early osteogenic marker alkaline-phosphatase revealed an enhanced expression. Pathways analyses mediating the PTH effect resulted in a similar effect when PDL-cells were stimulated with either the signal specific fragments lacking the PKA-activating domain PTH(3-34), PTH(7-34), second-messenger-analogues PKC (PMA) or inhibitors for PKA (H8). Inhibition of the PKC-dependent pathway by stimulation with PTH(1-31), PKA second-messenger-analogue (forskolin) or PKA-inhibitor (RO-32-0432) abolished the PTH effect These data indicate abundant expression of PTH1R within the PDL and a stimulatory effect of short time continuous PTH on PDL cell differentiation towards an osteogenic phenotype and suggested local PTH application protocols as a possible treatment option in periodontal therapy.
