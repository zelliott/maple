This review considers the proteins of the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) family and their role in the regulation of actin-based motility. It contains detailed classification of the WASP family proteins and data on their subcellular localization. Impairments of expression of the WASP family proteins cause certain cell pathologies. The review also deals with domain organization of these proteins and proteins interacting with various domains of the WASP proteins. Special attention is given to analysis of the role of the WASP family proteins in initiating directed actin assembly in the leading edge of the migrating cell and on the surface of some bacteria. Putative pathways of regulation of WASP proteins by various protein ligands and their links with cell signaling systems are considered.
