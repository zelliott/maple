Suppression of oncogenic Wnt-mediated signaling holds promise as an anti-cancer therapeutic strategy. We previously reported a novel class of small molecules (IWR-1/2, inhibitors of Wnt response) that antagonize Wnt signaling by stabilizing the Axin destruction complex. Herein, we present the results of structure-activity relationship studies of these compounds.
