CR1 (C3b receptor) and CR2 (C3d/EBV receptor) are two C3 receptors expressed on B lymphocytes. CR1 and CR2 have structural similarities and their cross-linking at the B cell surface by antibodies or specific ligands in multimeric forms induce B cell activation. However, activation of human B cells through cell surface interactions or by intracellular protein kinase C activators leads to phosphorylation of CR2 but not CR1. CR2 is phosphorylated on serine and tyrosine residues. Analysis of post-membrane events associated with CR2 revealed intracellular interactions of CR2 with p53, a plasma membrane anti-oncogene-encoded phosphoprotein, and with p120, a nuclear phosphoribonucleoprotein. These intracellular interactions probably represent important steps in the signalling functions of CR2.
