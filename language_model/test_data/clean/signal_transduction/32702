The objective of this study was to record the ECG of the smallest living mammal to extend the domain of data for comparative AV nodal electrophysiologic purposes. These data are needed to establish the relationship between the PR interval and heart size in mammalian species of all sizes.

In recently born mice (age 1.5 to 8 weeks) weighing between 2.5 and 10 g and with estimated heart weights between 15 and 60 mg, ECGs, using bipolar limb leads, were recorded during general anesthesia. The PR interval, representing AV transmission time was about 40 msec, which is quite long for hearts of this size. On the basis of detailed analysis of the data, we postulate the presence of a fixed delay or discontinuous propagation in the AV node not only in newborn mice, but in mammals of all sizes.

AV transmission times obtained in mammals (including humans) cannot be explained on the basis of generally accepted, classic AV conduction theories. The acceptance of the presence of a fixed delay in the AV node may ultimately be of value to better understand AV node function during sinus rhythm and supraventricular arrhythmias.
