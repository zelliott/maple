Opponent signaling refers to processes in which antagonistic signals are produced by different, but closely related, stimuli. It allows enhanced discrimination and more accurate behavioral responses. We explored opponent signaling in the Drosophila melanogaster olfactory system by measuring frequency response functions between odorant concentrations and primary olfactory neuron responses. Random fluctuations in concentration of two aliphatic and two aromatic fruit odorants were used to modulate action potentials from basiconic antennal sensilla. We separated action potentials by two-dimensional cluster analysis using amplitude and cross-correlation with a median action-potential template. Frequency response functions were fitted with either bandpass or second-order low-pass functions and then divided into two polarity groups, excitatory and inhibitory, by fitting the frequency response functions. Cluster analysis gave two, three, or four action potential clusters for each sensillum recording. Sensilla were then grouped by the patterns of response polarities of the individual neurons into four sensillum types, one with four neurons and three with two neurons. All four odorant compounds produced a mixture of excitatory, inhibitory, and null responses in different neurons. Statistical analysis of frequency response parameters for individual odorants gave only weak correlation between dynamics and some neuron types, even when comparing the dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory responses to the same odorant. However, response dynamics were significantly different between aliphatic and aromatic compounds, and between the two aliphatic compounds. Each odorant caused opposing excitatory and inhibitory signals to be sent to the antennal lobe along at least two pairs of axonal pathways.
