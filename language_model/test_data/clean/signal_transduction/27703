Thermally-responsive culture surfaces were designed using copolymers of N-isopropylacrylamide, 4-(aminomethyl)styrene, and acrylic acid. These surfaces contained functional amine and carboxyl groups, which allowed biomolecules to be grafted by amide formation. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules (collagen type IV, and chondroitin sulfate) were investigated, as surface-grafted biomolecules, for their ability to stimulate cell attachment, proliferation, and function by signaling only from the basal side of cultured cells. Surface analysis of biomolecule-grafted porous inserts showed covalent binding of biomolecules to either amine or carboxyl groups. Multiple attachment to amine and/or carboxyl groups served as cross-linking points that made the polymer hydrogel permanently adherent to the culture surface. Immunofluorescence microscopy techniques gave positive identification of grafted biomolecules. Grafting of EGF improved cell proliferation versus that on nongrafted controls, or controls grafted only with ECM molecules. ECM grafting induced cell attachment on attachment-resistant surfaces. Analysis of trans-epithelial resistance, fluid transport, and polarized g-glutamyl transpeptidase activity indicated that simultaneous grafting of both EGF and ECM produced better polarized cell function than nongrafted controls, or controls grafted with only one type of biomolecule. Covalent grafting of biomolecules did not interfere with cells ability to detach from thermally responsive surfaces upon temperature decrease.
