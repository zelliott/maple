In both dividing and interphase cells, microtubules are remodeled in response to signal transduction pathways triggered by a variety of stimuli. Members of the Rho family of small GTPases have emerged as key intermediates in transmitting signals to cortical factors that mediate capture of dynamic microtubules at specific sites. The specificity of cortical capture appears to be controlled by microtubule tip proteins and cortical receptors that bind these proteins. Recent studies suggest that some of the proteins interacting with microtubule tips behave as bridging proteins between the microtubule tip proteins and their cortical receptors. Such bridging proteins may enhance cortical capture of microtubules directly or indirectly through interactions with the actin cytoskeleton.
