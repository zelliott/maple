Aspects of electronics at the molecular level are reviewed. Molecules can store information in their different states. To transmit information, they need to interact with other molecules, but this affects the states. Excitation transfer is also more complex than sometimes realised. Information processing is best treated in terms of the whole system of interacting molecules, so that molecules cannot be treated simply as small conventional electronic components.
