Adults with malignant glioma, especially the most common subtype, glioblastoma multiforme, have an unacceptably poor outcome with current therapies. Malignant gliomas are amongst the most angiogenic of cancers, and VEGF is the dominant angiogenic mediator in these tumors.

To summarize the clinical experience of VEGF-directed treatment for malignant glioma.

We reviewed the completed, ongoing and planned clinical trials evaluating anti-VEGF strategies for malignant glioma patients.

Recent studies incorporating anti-VEGF agents plus cytotoxic therapy among recurrent malignant glioma patients have achieved unprecedented improvements in radiographic response, time to progression and survival. Furthermore, acceptable toxicity was observed. Hence, a major current focus in neuro-oncology is to further develop antiangiogenic strategies for this desperate patient population.
