Plants often grow in soils that contain very low concentrations of the macronutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur. To adapt and grow in nutrient-deprived environments plants must sense changes in external and internal mineral nutrient concentrations and adjust growth to match resource availability. The sensing and signal transduction networks that control plant responses to nutrient deprivation are not well characterized for nitrogen, potassium, and sulfur deprivation. One branch of the signal transduction cascade related to phosphorus-deprivation response has been defined through the identification of a transcription factor that is regulated by sumoylation. Two different microRNAs play roles in regulating gene expression under phosphorus and sulfur deprivation. Reactive oxygen species increase rapidly after mineral nutrient deprivation and may be one upstream mediator of nutrient signaling. A number of molecular analyses suggest that both short-term and longer-term responses will be important in understanding the progression of signaling events when the external, then internal, supplies of nutrients become depleted.
