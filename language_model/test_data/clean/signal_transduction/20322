The cerebral endothelium can be a vital source of signaling factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor that defends the neuronal parenchyma against stress and injury. But the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully defined. Here, we use cell models to ask how vascular neuroprotection is sustained. Human brain endothelial cells were grown in culture, and conditioned media were transferred to primary rat cortical neurons. Brain endothelial cell-conditioned media activated neuronal Akt signaling and protected neurons against hypoxia and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Blockade of Akt phosphorylation with the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 negated this vascular neuroprotective effect. Upstream of Akt signaling, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor TrkB (neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor, type 2) was involved because depletion with TrkB/Fc eliminated the ability of endothelial-conditioned media to protect neurons against hypoxia. Downstream of Akt signaling, activation of GSK-3Î² (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta), caspase 9, caspase 3 and Bad pathways were detected. Taken together, these findings suggest that the molecular basis for vascular neuroprotection involves TrkB-Akt signaling that ameliorates neuronal apoptosis. Further investigation of these mechanisms may reveal new approaches for augmenting endogenous vascular neuroprotection in stroke, brain injury, and neurodegeneration.
