Monocyte recruitment by proinflammatory cytokines is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Lewis(y-6) and H (Le(y)/H) are blood group antigens up-regulated on RA synovial endothelium. We have previously shown that both soluble Le(y)/H and a glucose analog of H, H-2g, are angiogenic and mediateleukocyte-endothelial adhesion via induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1. We hypothesized that soluble Le(y)/H plays an important role in monocyte recruitment in RA.

We examined the role of H-2g in monocyte chemotaxis in vitro. We used an RA synovial tissue (ST)-SCID mouse chimera model to evaluate the role of H-2g in monocyte recruitment in vivo. We used Western blots to examine signaling molecules activated by H-2g in monocytes.

H-2g induced human monocyte migration in vitro, which was mediated by Src and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), since inhibitors and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) of Src and PI 3-kinase significantly decreased H-2g-induced monocyte migration (P < 0.05). H-2g significantly increased mononuclear cell (MNC) homing in vivo into an RA ST-SCID mouse chimera (P < 0.05). Transfection of MNCs with Src antisense ODNs blocked H-2g-induced MNC recruitment into the RA ST-SCID mouse chimera. Additionally, H-2g induced marked phosphorylation of protein kinase CalphaI/betaII (PKCalphaI/betaII), Src, IkappaBalpha, and Akt in monocytes. Src, Akt, and NF-kappaB were shown to be downstream targets of PKCalphaI/betaII, since an inhibitor of PKCalphaI/betaII reduced H-2g-mediated phosphorylation of Src, Akt, and NF-kappaB in monocytes.

These data suggest that H-2g may be a novel mediator of monocyte recruitment in chronic inflammatory diseases like RA.
