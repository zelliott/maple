Zinc is a trace element that is essential for the function of many enzymes and transcription factors. Zinc deficiency results in defects in innate and acquired immune responses. However, little is known about the mechanism(s) by which zinc affects immune cell function. Here we show that stimulation with the Toll-like receptor 4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) altered the expression of zinc transporters in dendritic cells and thereby decreased intracellular free zinc. A zinc chelator mimicked the effects of LPS, whereas zinc supplementation or overexpression of the gene encoding Zip6, a zinc transporter whose expression was reduced by LPS, inhibited LPS-induced upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II and costimulatory molecules. These results establish a link between Toll-like receptor signaling and zinc homeostasis.
