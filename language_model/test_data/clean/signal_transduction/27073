Morphine administered as a subcutaneous implant was previously reported to inhibit the mitogen-induced initial increases in cytoplasmic free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in mouse splenocytes. The present studies were initiated to determine whether morphine affects signal transduction subsequent to activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in immune cells. Administration of morphine significantly inhibited the phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated increase in interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression in both CD4+ and CD8+ mouse T cells. In contrast, morphine treatment had no effect on PMA/calcium ionophore (A23187)-induced increase in IL-2 secretion, suggesting a selective inhibition of IL-2R expression. Simultaneous administration of morphine and the opiate antagonist naltrexone blocked the effect of morphine on CD4+ cells. The inhibition of PMA-stimulated IL-2R expression was not reproduced by incubating splenocytes with morphine (10(-8)-10(-5) M). These results suggest that this effect of morphine was mediated through opiate-receptors, but not directly via opiate receptors located on T cells. Moreover, adrenalectomy abolished this effect of morphine in CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of morphine on IL-2R expression in CD4+ T cells may be mediated through a morphine-induced increase in corticosteroid levels. Thus, opiate-induced immunosuppression may involve an inhibition of post-PKC events, especially IL-2R expression, as well as impairment of earlier events in the activation of immune cells such as the increase in [Ca2+]i.
