Bicarbonate ion is fundamental to the biology of all living organisms. HCO(3)(-) is vital to such diverse physiological processes as carbon fixation, cellular homeostasis, sperm maturation, and nucleotide synthesis. A defined subset of adenylyl cyclases identified in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are directly activated by HCO(3)(-). As such, cAMP represents the first identified biological effector for fluctuations in intracellular inorganic carbon levels. The identification of a signal transduction pathway activated by HCO(3)(-) has far reaching implications for understanding how the cell responds to fluctuations in this essential anion.
