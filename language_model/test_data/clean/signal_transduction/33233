Ozone, one of the most reactive oxidant gases to which humans are routinely exposed, induces inflammation in the lower airways. The airway epithelium is one of the first targets that inhaled ozone will encounter, but its role in airway inflammation is not well understood. Expression of inducible genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as interleukin (IL)-8, is controlled by transcription factors. Expression of the IL-8 gene is regulated by the transcription factors nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, NF-IL-6, and possibly activator protein-1 (AP-1). Type II-like epithelial cells (A549) were grown on a collagen-coated membrane and exposed in vitro to 0.1 ppm ozone or air. Exposure to ozone induced DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB, NF-IL-6, and AP-1. IL-8 mRNA and IL-8 protein levels were also increased after ozone exposure. These results link ozone-induced DNA-binding activity of transcription factors and the production of IL-8 by epithelial cells thus demonstrating a potential cellular cascade resulting in the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the airway lumen.
