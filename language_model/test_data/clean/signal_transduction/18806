Phospholipase D (PLD) hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond of the predominant membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine producing phosphatidic acid and free choline. This activity can participate in signal transduction pathways and impact on vesicle trafficking for secretion and endocytosis, as well as receptor signalling. Phospholipids can regulate PLD activity directly, through specific intermolecular interactions, or indirectly, through their effect on the localization or activity of PLD's protein effectors. This short review highlights these various phospholipid inputs into the regulation of PLD activity and also reviews potential roles for PLD-generated phosphatidic acid, particularly a mechanism by which the phospholipid may participate in the process of vesicular trafficking.
