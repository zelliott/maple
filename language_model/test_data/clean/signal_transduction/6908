Osteoclasts are one of the key therapeutic targets for a variety of orthopedic diseases such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. In this study, we synthesized a novel compound N-(3-(cyclohexylcarbamoyl) phenyl)-1H-indole-2- carboxamide (termed as OA-4) and investigated the effects of OA-4 on the differentiation and function of osteoclasts. OA-4 markedly diminished osteoclast differentiation and osteoclast specific gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, OA-4 dose-dependently suppressed osteoclastic bone resorption. Furthermore, we found OA-4 attenuated RANKL-induced p38 phosphorylation without affecting JNK or NF-ÎºB signaling pathways. Collectively, we synthesized a novel compound OA-4 which can inhibit osteoclast formation and functions via the suppression of p38 signaling pathway.
