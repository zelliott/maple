Simultaneous measurements of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and tension were performed to clarify whether the mechanisms which cause the neuropeptide Y (NPY)-elicited contraction and potentiation of noradrenaline contractions, and the NPY inhibition of forskolin responses are linked to a single or different NPY receptor(s) in rat mesenteric small arteries. In resting arteries, NPY moderately elevated [Ca(2+)](i) and tension. These effects were antagonized by the selective Y(1) receptor antagonist, (R)-N(2)-(diphenacetyl)-N-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-D-argininea mide (BIBP 3226) (apparent pK(B) values of 8.54+/-0.25 and 8.27+/-0.17, respectively). NPY (0.1 microM) caused a near 3 fold increase in sensitivity to noradrenaline but did not significantly modify the tension-[Ca(2+)](i) relationship for this agonist. BIBP 3226 competitively antagonized the contractile response to NPY in arteries submaximally preconstricted with noradrenaline (pA(2) 7.87+/-0.20). In arteries activated by vasopressin, the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (3 microM) induced a maximum relaxation and a return of [Ca(2+)](i) to resting levels. NPY completely inhibited these effects. The contractile responses to NPY in arteries maximally relaxed with either sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or nifedipine were not significantly higher than those evoked by the peptide at resting tension, in contrast to the contractions to NPY in forskolin-relaxed arteries. BIBP 3226 competitively antagonized the contraction to NPY in forskolin-relaxed arteries with a pA(2) of 7.92+/-0.29. Electrical field stimulation (EFS) at 8-32 Hz caused large contractions in arteries relaxed with either forskolin or noradrenaline in the presence of phentolamine. These responses to EFS were inhibited by BIBP 3226. Similar EFS in resting, non-activated arteries did not produce any response. The present results suggest that different intracellular pathways are linked to a single NPY Y(1) receptor in intact rat mesenteric small arteries, and provide little support for involvement of other postjunctional NPY receptors in the contractile responses to NPY. Neurally released NPY also seems to act through Y(1) receptors, and may serve primarily as an inhibitor of vasodilatation.
