The glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (Tgf-beta) superfamily, which is produced by Sertoli cells and plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSC). The addition of proper amount of GDNF to the culture media can promote SSC proliferation in vitro. Besides, GDNF regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of SSCs through various signaling pathways. This review focuses on the effects of GDNF on the proliferation and differentiation of mammalian SSCs and GDNF-mediated signaling pathways.
