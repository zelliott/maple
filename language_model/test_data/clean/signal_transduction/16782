Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic inflammatory disease, including synovial proliferation and excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines production, leading to cartilage and bone destruction. Cytokine-mediated immunity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases such as RA. Recently, the IL-1 family member IL-33, was recognized to perform as an inflammatory cytokine, exerted profound effects in human RA and experimental inflammatory arthritis. Furthermore, inhibition of IL-33 signaling proposed a potential therapeutic approach. In this review, we summarize recent advances on the pathological roles of IL-33 in RA and discuss the therapeutic significance of these new findings.
