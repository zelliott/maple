Embryonic development is initiated after the fertilizing spermatozoon enters the egg and triggers a process known as 'egg activation'. Activation results in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, cortical granule exocytosis (CGE), cell cycle resumption and recruitment of maternal mRNA. Various treatments can induce parthenogenetic activation characterized by the same manifestations. Signal transduction pathways similar to those known for somatic cells mediate the mammalian egg activation. This review focuses on the signal transduction pathways that occur during mammalian fertilization and during parthenogenetic egg activation. We discuss the possibility that members of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTKs) families, the Src family PTKs in particular, operate during egg activation and that protein kinase C can induce CGE.
