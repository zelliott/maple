Activation of apoptosis introduces a site-specific break within intron 11 of the MLL gene. Using the CD95 apoptotic signaling pathway in human lymphoblastoid cells, the 5' fragment of MLL undergoes translocation to intron 4 of AF9 and the proleukemogenic MLL-AF9 fusion gene created is transcribed. Both the breaks in MLL and transcription of the MLL-AF9 fusion gene are suppressed in the presence of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, zVAD.fmk. Duplicate cells containing sequence identical MLL-AF9 fusion junctions were identified within a cell population that had recovered from apoptosis. This indicated that cells harboring a translocation initiated by apoptotic cleavage had divided. These data are consistent with a novel pathogenic role for the apoptotic program where translocations with leukemogenic potential are created within cells that have the capacity to divide.
