We attempted apoptotic cell death induction of T cells infected with human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) which induces HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T cell leukemia. T cells acutely infected and expressing HTLV-Igag Ags were killed by cross-linking their TCR with anti-CD3 mAb. Cells in apoptotic process were found by staining with annexin V. The apoptosis was not affected by costimulation through CD28 molecules and was resistant to ligation of Fas molecules. Whereas the virus-infected T cells expressed higher levels of HLA-DR, CD25, CD80, and CD86 Ags than apoptosis-resistant PHA-blasts, the T cell apoptosis was enhanced by addition of exogenous IL-2. Furthermore, in this apoptosis, monocytes played an important role because T cells infected in the absence of monocytes were resistant to the death signals. The apoptosis-sensitive T cells responded to TCR signaling more strongly by proliferating than those apoptosis-resistant cells. Monocytes weakly affected the expression levels of viral Ags on T cells. However, HTLV-I-infected monocytes primed T cells to die by subsequent TCR signaling. T cells primed with the monocytes, subsequently infected in the absence of monocytes, were killed by TCR signaling. These observations suggest that primed and infected T cells could be killed by activation-induced cell death.
