Tumor-induced immune suppression is a major impediment to many potentially effective cancer therapies. TGF-β has previously been described as having both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive characteristics. In this issue of Cancer Discovery, Pang and colleagues show that myeloid-specific TGF-β signaling is a critical mediator in tumor metastasis. These findings point to a more specific means to reduce cancer immunosuppression, prevent metastasis, and minimize treatment-related adverse events.
