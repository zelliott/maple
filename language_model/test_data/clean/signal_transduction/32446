The role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the signal transduction process when macrophage cells were stimulated by the chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was investigated in the cell line PU5-1.8. Addition of fMLP to PU5-1.8 cells induced a rapid generation of inositol trisphosphate and a translocation of PKC. Concomitantly there was an influx of Ca2+ followed by its expulsion. PKC was likely involved in Ca2+ extrusion as short-term pretreatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) enhanced the removal of preloaded 45Ca2+ but had no significant effect on fMLP-stimulated 45Ca2+ influx. Depletion of cellular PKC activity through down-regulation or exposure of cells to PKC inhibitors also blocked the fMLP-stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux. Further experiments using PMA revealed that PKC also decreased vesicular Ca2+ and stimulated the catabolism of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. These results lend support to the notion that PKC serves as a negative feedback modulator in Ca2+ signalling and further suggest that it operates at several target sites.
