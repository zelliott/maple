In addition to well established trophic functions, neurotrophins acutely affect neurotransmitter secretion from the presynaptic nerve terminal, influence synaptic development, and may serve as selective retrograde messengers that regulate synaptic efficacy. The crucial question related to the mechanisms of neurotrophin-mediated signaling is whether acute effects of neurotrophins are spatially restricted to the activated synapses. Here we have used a local perfusion technique for local delivery of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) to various regions of developing Xenopus embryo neurons in culture. Within minutes after a focal exposure of a soma or a small ( approximately 30 micrometer in length) axonal segment to NT-3, we observed an increase in the spontaneous neurotransmitter secretion from the presynaptic nerve terminals located approximately 300-400 micrometer away from the site of NT-3 application. Secretory activity along the axonal shaft was not affected. Our findings suggest that the NT-3-mediated signal may rapidly travel through neuronal cytoplasm over unexpectedly long distances and modulate neurotransmitter release specifically at the presynaptic nerve terminals.
