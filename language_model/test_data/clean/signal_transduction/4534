Previous studies suggested that Protein L (PpL), the bacterial Ig-binding protein, activates mast cells. PpL presumably performs the activation by interacting with membrane-bound IgEκ, but the underlying mechanisms behind the process remain unclear. In the current study, we found that cell-surface FcεRI expression is a critical factor participant in PpL-mediated full activation of murine mast cells, which includes cytokine production, the degranulation response, and leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) release, and that engagement of the FcεRI with IgEκ and PpL is enough to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ITAM in the FcRβ- and γ-signaling subunits. Introduction of mutations in two canonical tyrosine residues (Y47F/Y58F) of the FcRγ-ITAM completely abolished the above-mentioned mast cell functions, with the exception of LTC(4) release. Importantly, the FcRβ-ITAM acts as a signal transducer that is responsible for LTC(4) release independently of the FcRγ-ITAM. Taken together, our results suggest crucial and distinct functions for the FcRβ- and γ-ITAMs in the FcεRI-dependent full activation of mast cells induced by IgEκ and PpL.
