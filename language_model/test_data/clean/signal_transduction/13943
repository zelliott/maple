It is reported, in the process of diabetic nephropathy (DN), inflammatory-related p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway has a close relationship with renal injury. On the one hand,many factors in the upstream including hyperglycemia, abnormal hemodynamics, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory cytokines could activate p38MAPK signaling pathway. On the other hand,the activated p38MAPK signaling pathway could lead to renal damage via activating inflammatory cells, inducing the expression of inflammatory mediators, and intervening cytokines production. CHM could intervene p38MAPK signaling pathway through multi-ways, including inhibiting inflammatory cytokines expression, regulating phosphorylated p38MAPK (p-p38MAPK) expression, and reducing fibrogenic factors expression.
