Bone marrow stem cells develop into haematopoietic and mesenchymal lineages, but have not been known to participate in steroidogenic cell production. Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), also designated adrenal 4 binding protein (Ad4BP), is an essential orphan nuclear receptor for steroidogenesis as well as for adrenal and gonadal gland development. In the present study, we revealed that the adenovirus-mediated forced expression of SF-1 can transform cultured primary long-term cultured bone marrow cells into steroidogenic cells, showing the de novo synthesis of multiple steroid hormones in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This finding may provide an initial step in innovative autograft cell transfer therapy for steroid hormone deficiencies.
