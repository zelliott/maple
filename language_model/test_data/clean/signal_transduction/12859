Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in egg activation signaling at fertilization. We show that in Xenopus, fertilization stimulates a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of egg proteins, as revealed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Immunofluorescent microscopic analysis demonstrated that the phosphorylation occurs in cortical area of the egg animal hemisphere. To further characterize subcellular compartment for fertilization-dependent tyrosine kinase signaling, we isolated low density detergent-insoluble membrane (LD-DIM) fraction from Xenopus eggs. The egg LD-DIM was enriched in cholesterol and GM1 ganglioside. It also contained signaling molecules such as Xyk (Xenopus egg Src), Gq alpha, Ras, integrin beta 1 and CD9. Fertilization stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Xyk and some other LD-DIM proteins. Remarkably, sperm stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the LD-DIM proteins in vitro. The sperm-dependent phosphorylation was sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors PP2 and genistein. We found that pretreatment of eggs with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, a cholesterol-binding substance, led to a decrease in cholesterol, Xyk and sperm-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in LD-DIM. In methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-treated eggs, sperm-induced Ca(2+) transient and first cell division were also inhibited. These findings suggest that the egg LD-DIM might serve as subcellular microdomain for tyrosine kinase signaling in Xenopus egg fertilization.
