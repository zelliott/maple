To characterize the expression and function of interleukin (IL) 19, a recently described T-helper 2 anti-inflammatory IL, on endothelial cell (EC) pathophysiological features.

The expression and effects of anti-inflammatory ILs on EC activation and development of angiogenesis are uncharacterized. We demonstrate by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot that IL-19 is expressed in inflamed, but not normal, human coronary endothelium and can be induced in cultured human ECs by serum and basic fibroblast growth factor. IL-19 is mitogenic and chemotactic, and it promotes EC spreading. IL-19 activates the signaling proteins STAT3, p44/42, and Rac1. In functional ex vivo studies, IL-19 promotes cordlike structure formation of cultured ECs and enhances microvessel sprouting in the mouse aortic ring assay. IL-19 induces tube formation in gelatinous protein (Matrigel) plugs in vivo.

To our knowledge, these data are the first to report expression of the anti-inflammatory agent, IL-19, in ECs; and the first to indicate that IL-19 is mitogenic and chemotactic for ECs and can induce the angiogenic potential of ECs.
