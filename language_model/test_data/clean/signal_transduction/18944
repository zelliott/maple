G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPK) are important key switches in signal transduction pathways. A novel class of proteins was identified in the genomes of two unrelated organisms that harbor both a GPCR and a PIPK domain. Dictyostelium discoideum contains one GPCR-PIPK, which is crucial in cell-density sensing, and the genomes of Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora ramorum each encode twelve GPCR-PIPKs. Intriguingly, these are currently the only species that have these two domains combined in one protein. Here, the structural and regulatory characteristics of GPCR-PIPKs are presented and discussed. It is hypothesized that, upon activation, GPCR-PIPKs are able to trigger heterotrimeric G-protein signaling and phosphoinositide second-messenger synthesis.
