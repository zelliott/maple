When considering the complicated nature of cell/tissue interactions with biomaterials, especially materials with nanometric surface features, observation of changes in one or two selected genes or proteins may not be sufficient. To get a fuller understanding of the scope of responses effected by nanotopography on cells, many genes need to be surveyed. Recent developments in molecular biology have lead to the commercial production of microarrays. Microarray presents a powerful tool by which many genes (up to many thousands) can be probed simultaneously. In this study, 1718 gene arrays have been used to measure human fibroblast response to 13-nm-high polymer demixed islands. The results have shown many changes in genes involved in signaling, cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, gene transcription, and protein translation; these results have been used to build a more complete overview of fibroblast response to the islands. The use of microarray has expanded the range of observations possible using established microscopical and biochemical techniques.
