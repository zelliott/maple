Due to the evolutionary conservation of innate immune mechanisms, Drosophila has been extensively used as a model for the dissection in genetic terms of innate host immunity to infection. Genetic screening in fruit flies has set the stage for the pathways and systems required for responding to immune challenge and the dynamics of the progression of bacterial and fungal infection. In addition, fruit flies have been used as infection models to dissect host-pathogen interactions from both sides of this equation. This chapter describes our current understanding of the genetics of the fruit fly immune response and summarizes the most important findings in this area during the past decade.
