Leukocyte interactions with vascular endothelium during inflammation depend on cascades of adhesion molecule engagement, particularly during selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling. Leukocyte rolling is also facilitated by members of the integrin and Ig families. Specifically, leukocyte rolling velocities during inflammation are significantly increased in ICAM-1-deficient mice, with ICAM-1 expression required for optimal P- and L-selectin-mediated rolling. Elimination of ICAM-1 expression in L-selectin-deficient mice significantly reduces leukocyte rolling. Whether disrupted leukocyte rolling in L-selectin and ICAM-1 double-deficient (L-selectin/ICAM-1-/-) mice affects leukocyte entry into sites of inflammation in vivo was assessed in the current study by using experimental models of inflammation; thioglycollate-induced peritonitis, chemokine-induced neutrophil migration to the skin, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, rejection of allogeneic skin grafts, and septic shock. In many cases, the loss of both L-selectin and ICAM-1 expression dramatically reduced leukocyte migration into sites of inflammation beyond what was observed with loss of either receptor alone. In fact, the effects from loss of both L-selectin and ICAM-1 effectively eliminated multiple chronic inflammatory responses in L-selectin/ICAM-1-/- mice. By contrast, the combined loss of L-selectin and ICAM-1 expression had minimal effects on the generation of Ag-specific T cell responses or humoral immunity. Thus, members of the selectin and Ig families function synergistically to mediate optimal leukocyte rolling and entry into tissues, which is essential for the generation of effective inflammatory responses in vivo.
