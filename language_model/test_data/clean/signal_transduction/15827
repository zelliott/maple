Cancer is a complex disease which greatly affects the human health. It has been widely reported that certain biological pathways play important roles in the process of tumorigenesis, tumor progression and metastasis. Identification and simulation of these pathways can help to understand the underlying mechanisms. With the deposition of huge amount of microarray data, many groups have developed a series of algorithms and models to analyze the microarray datasets for the identification and simulation of tumor related pathways. In this paper, firstly we review the recent development of these algorithms and models; then list the related software and data sources; and finally discuss the existence problems and perspectives in this field.
