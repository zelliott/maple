Elevated plasma levels of endothelial microparticles (EMPs) are associated with the presence of clinical atherosclerosis. Considering the anti-inflammatory properties of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on the endothelium, we studied the effect of fluvastatin on the release of EMPs in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC).

EMPs were generated in TNF-alpha-activated HCAECs. The absolute number of EMPs was enumerated using a novel two-color flow cytometric immunostaining technique with TruCount beads as an internal reference. EMPs are defined as EC membrane vesicles (1-2 microm in size) with a characteristic immunophenotype. The addition of fluvastatin to TNF-alpha-activated HCAECs significantly suppressed EMP release. Fluvastatin suppressed TNF-alpha-induced Rho activation. The Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, reproduced the effect of statin.

EMP release from TNF-alpha-activated HCAECs is suppressed by fluvastatin. In addition, the Rho/Rho-kinase may play an important role in modulating EMP release.
