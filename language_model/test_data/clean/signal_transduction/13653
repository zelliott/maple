The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways play essential roles in rhabdomyosarcoma. Singular targeting of each pathway is ineffective due to extensive cross-talk and compensatory feedback between these two pathways. Dual blockade with inhibitors of PI3K and MAPK in combination synergistically inhibits growth of rhabdomyosarcoma both in vitro and in vivo.
