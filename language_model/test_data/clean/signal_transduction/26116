In an accompanying paper, we find specific localization of diabetogenic T cells only to islets of Langerhans bearing the specific antigen. Instrumental in the specific localization was the presence of intraislet dendritic cells bearing the β-cell-peptide-MHC complex. Here, we report that the entry of diabetogenic CD4 T cells very rapidly triggered inflammatory gene expression changes in islets and vessels by up-regulating chemokines and adhesion molecules. Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression was notable in blood vessels, as was intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). ICAM-1 was also found on β-cells. These expression changes induced the entry of nonspecific T cells that otherwise did not localize to the islets. In contrast to the entry of diabetogenic CD4 T cells, the entrance of nonspecific T cells required a chemokine response and VCAM-1 expression by the islets. IFN-γ was important for the early gene expression changes in the islets. By microarray analysis, we detected up-regulation of a group of IFN-inducible genes as early as 8 h post-T-cell transfer. These studies establish that entry of diabetogenic T cells induces a state of receptivity of islets to subsequent immunological insults.
