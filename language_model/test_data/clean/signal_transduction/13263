When primary root apical tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana were irradiated by heavy-ion microbeams with 120 microm diameter, strong inhibition of root elongation and curvature were observed at the root tip. Irradiation of the cells that become the lower part of the root cap after gravistimulation showed strong inhibition of root curvature, whereas irradiation of the cells that become the upper part of the root cap after gravistimulation did not show severe damage in either root curvature or root growth. Further analysis using smaller area microbeams with 40 microm diameter indicated that the greatest inhibition of curvature occurred at the root tip and the next greatest inhibition occurred in the cells in the lower part of the root cap. These results indicate not only that the root tip and columella cells are the most sensitive sites for root gravity, but also that signalling of root gravity would go through the lower part of the cap cells after perception.
