Clustering of cell adhesion receptors and their interactions with the cytoskeleton are key events in the formation and function of cell adhesion structures. On the free cell surface, cadherin molecules interact with the cytoskeleton/membrane skeleton by being bound or corralled, and such interactions are greatly enhanced by the formation of cadherin oligomers. Corralled cadherin molecules undergo hop diffusion from one compartment to an adjacent one (membrane skeleton fence model), which prompts the initial formation of small adhesion clusters at cell-cell contact sites, but larger-scale assemblies of cadherin and actin filaments might require a further co-ordinated recruitment of these molecules.
