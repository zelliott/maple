Like axons, dendrites need guidance for proper orientation and positioning within the brain. Guidance determines synaptic connectivity as well as the strength of transmission. Recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that several cell-surface receptors, previously known as axon guidance molecules, are also responsible for the directed outgrowth of dendrites. Collectively, these studies reveal that the function of guidance molecules in individual neurons and individual processes is diverse and likely to be specifically regulated. Here, these studies are reviewed and emerging issues and implications are discussed.
