The physiological effects of the second messenger cAMP are displayed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase-medicated phosphorylation of specific target proteins which in turn control diverse cellular functions. We have determined this enzyme substrate phosphorylation in the presence of various glycosaminoglycans using a cAMP-dependent protein kinase isolated from rat liver. The results indicate that sulfated and unsulfated polysaccharides are able to inhibit phosphorylation of histone type IIa catalysed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Based on their impact upon substrate phosphorylation, glycosaminoglycans can be divided into three groups: group I with the highest inhibitory effect: dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate; group II: chondroitin 4-sulfate and group III with the lowest inhibitory effect: chondroitin 6-sulfate, keratan sulfate and hyaluronic acid.
