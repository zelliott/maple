The activation of human platelets is inhibited by two intracellular pathways regulated by either cGMP- or cAMP-elevating agents. There is considerable evidence that the inhibitory effects of cGMP and cAMP are mediated by the cGMP-PK and cAMP-PK, respectively, in human platelets. The cGI-PDE is an additional target for cGMP, and the cGMP-mediated elevation of cAMP levels contributes to the well known synergism between cAMP- and cGMP-elevating platelet inhibitors. Stimulation of both cAMP-PK and cGMP-PK prevents the agonist-induced activation of MLCK and PKC and inhibits the agonist-induced calcium mobilization from intracellular stores without any major effect on the ADP-regulated cation channel. These studies suggest that the inhibition of an early event of platelet activation, e.g. activation of PLC, is an effect common to both cGMP-PK and cAMP-PK stimulation. A common substrate of both cGMP-PK and cAMP-PK, the 46/50 kDa protein VASP, has been recently identified as a novel microfilament- and focal contact-associated protein whose phosphorylation correlates very well with platelet inhibition. Future investigations will have to identify the precise molecular mechanism of cyclic nucleotide inhibition of Ca2+ discharge from intracellular stores and whether cGMP-PK- and cAMP-PK-mediated VASP phosphorylation is an important component of this effect of cyclic nucleotides in human platelets.
