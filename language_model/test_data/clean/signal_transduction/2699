Insulin-like growth factors I and II are peptides with a structural homology for proinsulin, and are involved in hepatocyte proliferation. IGF-I and IGF-II, however, have different metabolic roles, and their mechanisms of action are incompletely known. We hypothesized that IGF-I and IGF-II act by different signal transduction pathways. To test this hypothesis, hepatocytes from 200 g male Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated by a two-step collagenase perfusion technique and plated at a density of 10(5) cells/16 mm Primaria plate. Proliferation was measured by [3H]thymidine ([3H]thy) incorporation into DNA, and an autoradiographic nuclear labeling index (LI). To analyze signal transduction, cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels were measured 5 min after addition of reagents by a radioimmunoassay. Reagents (doses) used were: IGF-I (2 nM), IGF-II (2 nM), the inhibitory peptide somatostatin-14 (SS14) (10 nM), and the adenylyl cyclase antagonist dideoxyadenosine (DDA) (10 microM). A summary of the findings is as follows: (1) IGF-I stimulates [3H]thy, LI and cAMP accumulation. (2) IGF-II stimulates [3H]thy and LI but not cAMP; (3) IGF-I but not IGF-II effects are inhibited by SS14 and DDA. We conclude that the hepatotrophic effects of IGF-I and IGF-II occur by different mechanisms: IGF-I is cAMP-dependent, IGF-II is cAMP-independent.
