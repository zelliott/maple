The shoot and root meristems contain small populations of stem cells that constantly renew themselves while providing precursor cells to build all other plant tissues and organs. Cell renewal, growth and differentiation in the meristems are co-ordinated by networks of transcription factors and intercellular signals. The past two years have revealed how auxin and cytokinin signals are integrated with each other and with regulatory genes in the shoot and root meristems. Small RNAs have also emerged as novel intercellular signals. Downstream of meristem regulatory genes, links have been made to cell division control and chromatin function. Protection of genome integrity, partly through programmed cell death after DNA damage, has recently been revealed as a specialised function in plant stem cells.
