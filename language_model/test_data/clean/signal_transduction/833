RNA was extracted from spleens of diarrhea and non-diarrhea piglets of Jiuyang Pig, Jianbai Pig and Landrace. RNA pools were established and DDRT-PCR using three anchored and seven arbitrary primers combined with silver staining was conducted to identify ESTs differentially expressed in diarrhea resistance to E. coli K88. Five cDNA were identified in the non-diarrhea RNA pools. Among them two are new sequences and three are highly identical to the ESTs in the GeneBank, of which two have known functions. One is the mammalian Nck adaptor protein 1 and the other is the human LINE-1 reverse transcriptase.
