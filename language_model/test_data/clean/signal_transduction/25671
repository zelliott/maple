Previously, we found that male JYD mice developed type 2 diabetes but female mice did not, and that decreased expression levels of caveolin-1 were correlated with the development of a diabetic phenotype in these mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that sex hormones affect the expression of caveolin-1 and contribute to the development of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in JYD mice. We used glucose and insulin tolerance tests to examine insulin sensitivity in male, female and orchidectomized male JYD mice. Glucose uptake was analyzed by using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. We also examined insulin-signaling molecules and caveolin proteins in various tissues in these mice by Western blotting. In addition, we examined changes of caveolin-1 expression in L6 skeletal muscle cells treated with 17-β estradiol or dihydroxytestosterone. We found that glucose and insulin tolerance were impaired and hyperglycemia developed in male, but not female, JYD mice. Expression of insulin-signaling molecules such as insulin receptor, protein kinase B, and glucose transporter-4 were decreased in male JYD mice compared with female mice. Orchidectomized JYD male mice showed improved glucose and insulin tolerance with a concomitant increase in the expression of insulin-signaling molecules and caveolin-1 in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Moreover, 17-β-estradiol treatment increased the expression of caveolin-1 in differentiated skeletal muscle cells. We conclude that sex hormones modulate the expression of caveolin-1 and insulin-signaling molecules, subsequently affecting insulin sensitivity and the development of type 2 diabetes in JYD mice.
