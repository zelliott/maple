The purpose of this study was to determine whether myeloid differentiation factor88-dependent Toll-Like Receptor-4 (TLR-4) signaling contributed to the inhibition of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) by Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA).

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 12 / group) were randomly distributed into three groups: Tan IIA, control, and sham. The rats from Tan IIA and control groups under-went intra-aortic elastase perfusion to induce AAAs, and those in the sham group were perfused with saline. Only the Tan IIA group received Tan IIA (2 mg / rat / d). Aortic tissue samples were harvested at 24 d after perfusion and evaluated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.

The over-expression of Toll-Like Receptor-4 (TLR-4), Myeloid Differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), Phosphorylated Nuclear Factor κB (pNF-κB) and Phosphorylated IκBα (pIκBα) induced by elastase perfusion were significantly decreased by Tan IIA treatment.

Tan IIA attenuates elastase-induced AAA in rats possibly via the inhibition of MyD88-dependent TLR-4 signaling, which may be one potential explanation of why Tan IIA inhibits AAA development through multiple effects.
