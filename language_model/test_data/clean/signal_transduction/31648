Protein kinase C-delta (PKCδ), a member of the lipid-regulated serine/threonine PKC family, has been implicated in a wide range of important cellular processes. In the past decade, the critical role of PKCδ in the regulation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways has been widely explored. In most cases, over-expression or activation of PKCδ results in the induction of apoptosis. The phosphorylations and multiple cell organelle translocations of PKCδ initiate apoptosis by targeting multiple downstream effectors. During apoptosis, PKCδ is proteolytically cleaved by caspase-3 to generate a constitutively activated catalytic fragment, which amplifies apoptosis cascades in nucleus and mitochondria. However, PKCδ also exerts its anti-apoptotic and pro-survival roles in some cases. Therefore, the complicated role of PKCδ in apoptosis appears to be stimulus and cell type dependent. This review is mainly focused on how PKCδ gets activated in diverse ways in response to apoptotic signals and how PKCδ targets different downstream regulators to sponsor or restrain apoptosis induction.
