A recent study by our group indicated that peripheral B cells in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). This raised the logical question of how HCV circumvents the antiviral immune responses of B cells. Because type I interferon (IFN) plays a critical role in the innate antiviral immune response, IFNβ expression levels in peripheral B cells from CHC patients were analyzed, and these levels were found to be comparable to those in normal B cells, which suggested that HCV infection failed to trigger antiviral immune responses in B cells. Sensing mechanisms for invading viruses in host immune cells involve Toll-like receptor-mediated and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-mediated pathways. Both pathways culminate in IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) translocation into the nucleus for IFNβ gene transcription. Although the expression levels of RIG-I and its adaptor molecule, IFN promoter-stimulator-1, were substantially enhanced in CHC B cells, dimerization and subsequent nuclear translocation of IRF-3 were not detectable. TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1) and IκB kinase ε (IKKε) are essential for IRF-3 phosphorylation. Constitutive expression of both kinases was markedly enhanced in CHC B cells. However, reduced expression of heat shock protein of 90 kDa, a TBK1 stabilizer, and enhanced expression of SIKE, an IKKε suppressor, were observed in CHC B cells, which might suppress the kinase activity of TBK1/IKKε for IRF-3 phosphorylation. In addition, the expression of vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein-C, a putative inhibitor of HCV replication, was negligible in B cells. These results strongly suggest that HCV utilizes B cells as a reservoir for persistent infection.
