The muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M produced a concentration-dependent increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis in bovine pial arteries. The maximal effect was 5.9 +/- 0.89 fold over basal levels, and the EC50 for oxotremorine-M was 8.9 x 10(-6) M. The phosphoinositide response in arteries with the luminal endothelium removed was similar to the response in intact arteries. The specific muscarinic antagonists pirenzepine, 4-DAMP and methoctramine produced parallel shifts of the concentration-response curve to oxotremorine-M, with the following order of potency (pKB): 4-DAMP (8.59 +/- 0.10) greater than pirenzepine (8.12 +/- 0.11) greater than methoctramine (6.77 +/- 0.20). These results indicate that muscarinic stimulation activates phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cerebral arteries, and that the muscarinic receptors mediating this increase are similar to the M1 subtype.
