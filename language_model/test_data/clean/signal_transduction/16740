Structurally similar to retinoic acid (RA), the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) controls many developmental and physiological processes via complicated signaling networks that are composed of receptors, secondary messengers, protein kinase/phosphatase cascades, transcription factors, and chromatin-remodeling factors. In addition, ABA signaling is further modulated by mRNA maturation and stability, microRNA (miRNA) levels, nuclear speckling, and protein degradation. This chapter highlights the identified regulators of ABA signaling and reports their homologues in dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants.
