Tetraspanins are small transmembrane proteins present on the cell surface of almost every eukaryotic cell. Through binding with other transmembrane and intracellular proteins, they regulate diverse cellular processes ranging from cell adhesion and motility to synapse formation and tumor progression. Here, we provide a brief overview of molecular, cellular and clinical studies to illustrate how the multiple functions of this fascinating family of molecules stem from their interplay with multiple molecular partners. In particular, we emphasize the special relationship between tetraspanins and the cell adhesion molecules integrins in regulating cell physiology in health and disease.
