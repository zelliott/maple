Chromium picolinate (CrPic) has been discovered as a supplemental or alternative medication for type 2 diabetes, but its mechanism of action is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the possible anti-diabetic mechanisms of CrPic in insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes; the insulin resistance was induced by treatment with high glucose and insulin for 24 h. The effects of CrPic on glucose metabolism and the glucose uptake-inducing activity of CrPic were investigated. Meanwhile, the effects of CrPic on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation were visualized by immonofluorescence microscopy. In addition, its effects on insulin signaling pathways and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades were assessed by immunoblotting analysis and real-time PCR. The results showed that CrPic induced glucose metabolism and uptake, as well as GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane (PM) in both control and insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes without any changes in insulin receptor beta (IR-beta), protein kinase B (AKt), c-Cbl, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun phosphorylation and c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP) mRNA levels. Interestingly, CrPic was able to increase the basal and insulin-stimulated levels of p38 MAPK activation in the control and insulin-resistant cells. Pretreatment with the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 partially inhibited the CrPic-induced glucose transport, but CrPic-activated translocation of GLUT4 was not inhibited by SB203580. This study provides an experimental evidence of the effects of CrPic on glucose uptake through the activation of p38 MAPK and it is independent of the effect on GLUT4 translocation. The findings also suggest exciting new insights into the role of p38 MAPK in glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation.
