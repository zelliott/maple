Siglecs are expressed on most white blood cells of the immune system and are known to modulate the activity of cell signaling receptors via regulatory motifs in their cytoplasmic domains. This immunoglobulin subfamily of coreceptors recognize sialic acid containing glycans as ligands, which are found on glycoproteins and glycolipids of all mammalian cells. By virtue of their ability to recognize this common structural element, siglecs are increasingly recognized for their ability to help immune cells distinguish between self and nonself, and dampen autoimmune responses.
