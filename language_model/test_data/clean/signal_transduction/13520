Chicken embryo fibroblast cells overexpressing activated mutant forms of human pp60c-src, but not those overexpressing normal human pp60c-src, exhibited high levels of type I phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase activity associated with pp60c-src. Levels of PI kinase activity were positively correlated with src tyrosine protein kinase activity and not with absolute levels of pp60c-src. Our results suggest that a linkage exists between certain forms of pp60c-src and the PI signal transduction pathway.
