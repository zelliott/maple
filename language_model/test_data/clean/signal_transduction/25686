Recently, it was reported that in a 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model, neuronal cell death is associated with the cdk5-mediated hyperphosphorylation of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), a transcription factor that is critically required for neuronal survival. In the present study, we investigated the possible involvement of cdk5-mediated MEF2D down-regulation on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PC12 cell death. 6-OHDA was found to significantly increase nitric oxide (NO) production and to induce apoptosis in a time-dependent manner in PC12 cells. Furthermore, 6-OHDA was found to markedly reduce MEF2D levels under conditions that could induce PC12 cell apoptosis. In addition, PC12 cell death and MEF2D degradation by 6-OHDA were prevented by the cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine, but roscovitine could not restore the 6-OHDA-induced inactivation of Akt. These results suggest that the cell death and MEF2D degradation caused by 6-OHDA are dependent on cdk5 activity. On the other hand, roscovitine enhanced the 6-OHDA-induced activations of ERK1/2 and JNK, but reduced the 6-OHDA-induced activation of p38. These results suggest that PC12 cell death by 6-OHDA appears to be regulated by the down-regulation of MEF2D via some interaction between cdk5 and MAP kinase.
