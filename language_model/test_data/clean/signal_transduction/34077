In order to investigate the toxic effect of intermittent high glucose (IHG) and sustained high glucose (SHG) on rat pancreatic beta cell functions and the potential involved mechanisms, isolated rat islets and INS-1 beta cells were exposed to SHG (25 mmol/l) or IHG (11.1 and 25 mmol/l glucose alternating every 12 h) for 72 h. The results showed that IHG induced a more significant impairment of insulin release response in rat islets and INS-1 cell than SHG. Simultaneously, the intracellular levels of endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress were more markedly increased in islets and INS-1 cells exposed to IHG. However, there was no significant difference between reducing cell viability, insulin content and gene expression induced by SHG and IHG. Taken together, this study suggested the more serious toxic effect on rat pancreatic beta cell function induced by IHG treatment may be due to excessive activation of cellular stress.
