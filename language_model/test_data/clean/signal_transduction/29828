The purpose of immunological memory is to protect the host from reinfection, to control persistent infections, and, through maternal antibody, to protect the host's immunologically immature offspring from primary infections. Immunological memory is an exclusive property of the acquired immune system, where in the presence of CD4 T cell help, T cells and B cells clonally expand and differentiate to provide effector systems that protect the host from pathogens. Here we describe how T and B cell memory is generated in response to virus infections and how these cells respond when the host is infected again by similar or different viruses.
