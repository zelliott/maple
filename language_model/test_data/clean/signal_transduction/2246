Glycogen synthesis was studied in rat hepatocytes isolated by EDTA perfusion. Insulin induced a one and a half to twofold increase in glucose incorporation into glycogen. Insulin stimulated glycogen synthesis was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (IC50 approximately 40 nM) and LY 294002 (IC50 approximately 20 microM) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD 98059 (IC50 approximately 40 microM). Wortmannin was without appreciable effect on non-insulin stimulated glycogen synthesis, while LY 294002 and PD 98059 also inhibited the non-insulin stimulated glycogen synthesis. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 ribosomal protein-S6 kinase, was without effect on glycogen synthesis regardless of insulin stimulation.
