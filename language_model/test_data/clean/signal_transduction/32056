Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) constitute a large multigene family in various plant species. CDPKs have been shown to have important roles in various physiological processes, including plant growth and development and abiotic and biotic stress responses in plants. Functional analysis using gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutants has revealed the biological function of CDPKs in planta. Several CDPKs have been shown to be essential factors in abiotic stress tolerance, positively or negatively regulating stress tolerance by modulating ABA signaling and reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This review summarizes recent results describing the biological function of CDPKs that are involved in abiotic stress tolerance.
