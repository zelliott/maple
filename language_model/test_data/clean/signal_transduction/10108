In this communication, we present a genetic analysis of the glnN promoter region of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. luxAB reporter fusions were used to characterize the glnN promoter by deletion and site-directed mutational analysis. Reporter gene expression analysis was performed in S. elongatus wild-type and mutant strains to reveal the role of the global nitrogen responsive transcription factor NtcA and of the P(II) signalling protein on regulation of glnN gene expression. A non-canonical NtcA-binding motif is responsible for NtcA-dependent, nitrogen-responsive regulation of glnN. The P(II) signalling protein has opposing effects on NtcA-dependent glnN expression. Under conditions of nitrate-growth, it depresses expression, whereas under conditions of combined nitrogen starvation, it is required for full induction. Furthermore, sequences upstream of the NtcA-binding site have repressive effect on glnN promoter activity.
