Interleukin-1 (IL-1)-family cytokines are mediators of innate and adaptive immunity. They exert proinflammatory effects by binding a primary receptor that recruits a receptor accessory protein to form a signaling-competent heterotrimeric complex. Here we present the crystal structure of IL-1Î² bound to its primary receptor IL-1RI and its receptor accessory protein IL-1RAcP, providing insight into how IL-1-type cytokines initiate signaling and revealing an evolutionary relationship with the fibroblast growth factor receptor family.
