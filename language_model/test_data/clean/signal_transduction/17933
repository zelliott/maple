There exists individual enteroendocrine cells spread throughout the gastrointestinal mucosa that release specific peptide, as well as nonpeptide, hormones to have various endocrine action on target cells bearing cell surface receptors selectively sensitive to these regulatory substances. Following receptor activation, a series of events is set into motion that serves to transduce the information imparted to the target cell. Such transduction mechanisms are numerous, and may be excitatory or inhibitory to the cell depending upon which G-protein subunits the receptor is coupled.
