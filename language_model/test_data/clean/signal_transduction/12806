The effects of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and its putative intracellular mediators on progesterone (P) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) formation were studied in rat granulosa cells. A calcium ionophore (A23187), 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and melittin (a phospholipase A2-stimulator) were used to later intracellular calcium, protein kinase C, and arachidonic acid levels, respectively. During a 5-h incubation, LHRH increased basal P levels but failed to affect the formation of P induced by cholera toxin (CT). On the other hand, both basal and CT-stimulated PGE2 formation were increased by LHRH. Treatment of the cells with A23187 or TPA attenuated the formation of P induced by CT or FSH. By contrast, A23187 or TPA significantly augmented CT- or FSH-stimulated PGE2 formation. Interestingly, the effects of A23187 and TPA on PGE2 were synergistic, whether or not FSH or CT was present during the incubation. This synergy was not observed with regard to P formation. Melittin also increased basal P and PGE2 levels, and enhanced the stimulation of PGE2 by A23187 or TPA. However, in the combined presence of A23187 and TPA, melittin failed to further enhance the high levels of PGE2 accumulated. These findings further support a role for the intracellular calcium, protein kinase C, and arachidonic acid metabolic pathways in the multiple actions of LHRH in the ovary.
