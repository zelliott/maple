A photoresponsive nanocarrier for amines based on gold nanoparticles (GNPs) having a photocleavable succinimidyl ester has been developed. It offers a useful platform for the synthesis of caged compounds. Using the GNPs, we have developed caged histamine for the first time and applied it to evoke intracellular signaling by controlled near-UV irradiation. The present work will allow for new possibilities in studies of inter- and intracellular signaling networks.
