Over the last few years, sphingolipids have been identified as potent second messenger molecules modulating cell growth and activation. A newly emerging facet to this class of lipids suggests a picture where the balance between two counterregulatory lipids (as shown in the particular example of ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate in T lymphocyte apoptosis) determines the cell fate by setting the stage for various protein signaling cascades. Here, we provide a further example of such a decisive balance composed of the two lipids sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate that determines the allergic responsiveness of mast cells. High intracellular concentrations of sphingosine act as a potent inhibitor of the immunoglobulin (Ig)E plus antigen-mediated leukotriene synthesis and cytokine production by preventing activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In contrast, high intracellular levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate, also secreted by allergically stimulated mast cells, activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, resulting in hexosaminidase and leukotriene release, or in combination with ionomycin, give cytokine production. Equivalent high concentrations of sphingosine-1-phosphate are dominant over sphingosine as they counteract its inhibitory potential. Therefore, it might be inferred that sphingosine-kinase is pivotal to the activation of signaling cascades initiated at the Fc epsilon receptor I by modulating the balance of the counterregulatory lipids.
