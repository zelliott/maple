Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins play a critical role in the control of survival and cell death by regulating key signaling events such as caspase activation and NF-ÎºB signaling. Because aberrantly high expression of IAP proteins represents a frequent oncogenic event in human cancers, therapeutic targeting of IAP proteins is considered as a promising approach. Several small-molecule pharmacologic inhibitors of IAP proteins that mimic the binding domain of the endogenous IAP antagonist second mitochondrial activator of caspases (Smac) to IAP proteins have been developed over the past few years. IAP antagonists have been shown in various preclinical cancer models to either directly initiate cell death or, alternatively, to prime cancer cells for cytotoxic therapies by lowering the threshold for cell death induction. IAP antagonists (i.e., GDC-0917/CUDC-427, LCL161, AT-406, HGS1029, and TL32711) are currently under evaluation in early clinical trials alone or in combination regimens. Thus, the concept to therapeutically target IAP proteins in human cancer has in principle been successfully transferred into a clinical setting and warrants further evaluation as a treatment approach.
