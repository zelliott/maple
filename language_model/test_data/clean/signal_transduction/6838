Overcoming cellular mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance to drug therapy remains a central challenge in the clinical management of many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although much work has linked the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells to the emergence of drug resistance, it is less clear where tractable routes may exist to reverse or inhibit EMT as a strategy for drug sensitization. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/1, MAPK3/1) signaling plays a key role in directing the mesenchymal character of NSCLC cells and that blocking ERK signaling is sufficient to heighten therapeutic responses to EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. MEK1/2 (MAPKK1/2) inhibition promoted an epithelial phenotype in NSCLC cells, preventing induction of EMT by exogenous TGF-β. Moreover, in cells exhibiting de novo or acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, MEK inhibition enhanced the sensitivity to gefitinib and slowed cell migration. These effects only occurred, however, if MEK was inhibited for a period sufficient to trigger changes in EMT marker expression. Consistent with these findings, changes in EMT phenotypes and markers were also induced by the expression of mutant KRAS in a MEK-dependent manner. Our results suggest that prolonged exposure to MEK or ERK inhibitors may not only restrain EMT but also overcome naïve or acquired resistance of NSCLC to EGFR-targeted therapy in the clinic.
