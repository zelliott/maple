Influenza A virus (IAV) triggers a contagious respiratory disease that produces considerable lethality. Although this lethality is likely due to an excessive host inflammatory response, the negative feedback mechanisms aimed at regulating such a response are unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of the eight "suppressor of cytokine signaling" (SOCS) regulatory proteins in IAV-triggered cytokine expression in human respiratory epithelial cells. SOCS1 to SOCS7, but not cytokine-inducible Src homology 2-containing protein (CIS), are constitutively expressed in these cells and only SOCS1 and SOCS3 expressions are up-regulated upon IAV challenge. Using distinct approaches affecting the expression and/or the function of the IFNalphabeta receptor (IFNAR)1, the viral sensors TLR3 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) as well as the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, a RIG-I signaling intermediate), we demonstrated that SOCS1 and SOCS3 up-regulation requires a TLR3-independent, RIG-I/MAVS/IFNAR1-dependent pathway. Importantly, by using vectors overexpressing SOCS1 and SOCS3 we revealed that while both molecules inhibit antiviral responses, they differentially modulate inflammatory signaling pathways.
