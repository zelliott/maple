ASK1-interacting protein-1 (AIP1), a Ras GTPase-activating protein family member, is highly expressed in endothelial cells and vascular smooth musccells (VSMCs). The role of AIP1 in VSMCs and VSMC proliferative disease is not known.

We used mouse graft arteriosclerosis models characterized by VSMC accumulation and intimal expansion to determine the function of AIP1.

In a single minor histocompatibility antigen (male to female)-dependent aorta transplantation model, AIP1 deletion in the graft augmented neointima formation, an effect reversed in AIP1/interferon-γ receptor (IFN-γR) doubly-deficient aorta donors. In a syngeneic aortic transplantation model in which wild-type or AIP1-knockout mouse aortas were transplanted into IFN-γR-deficient recipients and in which neointima formation was induced by intravenous administration of an adenovirus that encoded a mouse IFN-γ transgene, donor grafts from AIP1-knockout mice enhanced IFN-γ-induced VSMC proliferation and neointima formation. Mechanistically, knockout or knockdown of AIP1 in VSMCs significantly enhanced IFN-γ-induced JAK-STAT signaling and IFN-γ-dependent VSMC migration and proliferation, 2 critical steps in neointima formation. Furthermore, AIP1 specifically bound to JAK2 and inhibited its activity.

AIP1 functions as a negative regulator in IFN-γ-induced intimal formation, in part by downregulating IFN-γ-JAK2-STAT1/3-dependent migratory and proliferative signaling in VSMCs.
