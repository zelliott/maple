The Shc adaptor protein transduces signals from transmembrane receptors to the Ras pathway of cell activation by providing binding sites for the recruitment to the submembrane compartment of the Grb2/Sos G-nucleotide exchange complex. The need for Shc in this process is however unclear since Grb2 can be recruited directly to phosphotyrosine containing membrane receptors through its src-homology-2 domain. Evidence from studies in lymphocytes indicates that Shc is multifunctional and is involved in the integration of independent signals to the Ras pathway. Furthermore, Shc may be a key control point at which signaling can be modulated both by interfering signals and by feedback mechanisms. Here we review recent literature to support these functions for Shc.
