The inositol-depletion hypothesis was suggested to explain the therapeutic mechanism of mood-stabilizing drugs. Focus was previously on the phosphatidylinositol signalling pathway and on the regulatory roles of Ins(3,4,5)P(3) and DAG (diacylglycerol). Recent findings indicate that inositol and inositol-containing molecules, including phosphoinositides and inositol phosphates, have signalling and regulatory roles in many cellular processes. This suggests that depleting inositol may lead to perturbation of a wide range of cellular functions, at least some of which may be associated with bipolar disorder.
