Neogenin is a multifunctional transmembrane receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It displays identical secondary structure to deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), a netrin receptor that is involved in axon guidance and cell survival. Like DCC, neogenin is able to transduce signals elicited by netrin. These neogenin-netrin interactions have been implicated in tissue morphogenesis, angiogenesis, myoblast differentiation and most recently in axon guidance. Neogenin is also a receptor for repulsive guidance molecule, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein involved in neuronal differentiation, apoptosis and repulsive axon guidance. Numerous studies have been started to elucidate the in vivo functions of neogenin, and its role in multiple aspects of development and homeostasis.
