To investigate the expression of nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB)/IkappaB in renal tissues of hepatitis B virus-associated nephritis (HBVGN) and to study its role in the pathogenesis of HBVGN.

The expression of NF-kappaB p65 and IkappaB-alpha in renal tissues was examined in biopsy specimens from 42 HBVGN patients, 20 patients with primary membranous nephropathy and 5 normal subjects by immunohistochemical staining.

The NF-kappaB p65 expression in glomerular and tubular of HBVGN tissues was notably higher than that in normal control tissues (P<0.05) and in primary membranous nephropathy tissues (P<0.01). The IkappaB-alpha expression in glomerular and tubular of HBVGN tissues was lower than that in primary membranous nephropathy tissues (P<0.05).

There might be protein degradation of IkappaB-alpha and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in renal tissues of HBVGN, which suggests that NF-kappaB/IkappaB signal pathway may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HBVGN.
