The recently discovered regulators of G-protein signaling proteins, termed the RGS family, have been shown to modulate the functioning of G-proteins by activating the intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of the alpha subunits. Here, we report the chromosomal location and tissue expression of the human regulator of RGS6 gene. The messenger RNA was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analysis with a human/rodent monochromosomal hybrid panel and a radiation hybrid panel indicated that the gene was mapped between genetic markers WI-5202 and D14S277 on chromosome 14q24.3 region.
