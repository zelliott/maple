The process of signal transmission to the cell interior is very complex. The cell reads external stimuli through the system of specific receptors, activating suitable pathways of secondary cell transmitters. Recent studies have yielded a number of essential data concerned with the complex functioning of the system of secondary cell transmitter pathways in the thyreocyte and their role in the molecular base of thyroid diseases. The causes of many endocrine diseases are now known to be associated with mutations of membrane and nuclear receptors and proteins of signal transmission systems in the cell. Moreover, species specific differences and thyroid pathology-dependent changes have been revealed in the regulation of main pathways of secondary cell transmitters and interaction between them. The present paper intends to characterize the main systems of secondary signal transmitters in the thyroid cell and their role in the pathogenesis of thyroid diseases.
