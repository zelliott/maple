Recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and bradykinin (BK) synergistically stimulate prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) formation in human gingival fibroblasts cultured for 24 h. Neither BK or IL-1 beta per se, nor their combinations, caused any acute stimulation of cellular cyclic AMP accumulation. BK, but not IL-1 beta, caused a rapid, transient rise of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), as assessed by recordings of fura-2 fluorescence in monolayers of prelabelled gingival fibroblasts. IL-1 beta did not change the effect of BK on [Ca2+]i. Ionomycin and A23187, two calcium ionophores, synergistically potentiated the stimulatory effect of IL-1 beta on PGE2 formation. Three different phorbol esters known to activate protein kinase C also synergistically potentiated the action of IL-1 beta on PGE2 formation. Exogenously added arachidonic acid significantly enhanced the basal formation of PGE2. In IL-1 beta treated cells, the enhancement of PGE2 formation seen after addition of arachidonic acid, was synergistically upregulated by IL-1 beta. These data show that i) the synergistic interaction between IL-1 beta and BK on PGE2 formation is not due to an effect linked to an upregulation of cyclic AMP or [Ca2+]i; ii) the signal transducing mechanism by which BK interacts with IL-1 beta, however, may be linked to a BK induced stimulation of [Ca2+]i and/or protein kinase C; iii) the mechanism involved in the action of IL-1 beta may, at least partly, be due to enhancement of the biosynthesis of prostanoids mediated by an upregulation of cyclooxygenase activity.
