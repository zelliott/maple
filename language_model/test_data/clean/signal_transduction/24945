Angiotensin II activates the Jak-STAT pathway via the AT(1) receptor. We studied two mutant AT(1) receptors, termed M5 and M6, that contain Y to F substitutions for the tyrosine residues naturally found in the third intracellular loop and the carboxyl terminus. After binding ligand, both the M5 and M6 AT(1) receptors trigger STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation equivalent to that observed with the wild type receptor, indicating that angiotensin II-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 is independent of these receptor tyrosine residues. In response to angiotensin II, Jak2 autophosphorylates on tyrosine, and Jak2 and STAT1 physically associate, a process that depends on the SH2 domain of STAT1 in vitro. Evaluation of the wild type, M5, and M6 AT(1) receptors showed that angiotensin II-dependent AT(1) receptor-Jak2-STAT1 complex formation is dependent on catalytically active Jak2, not on the receptor tyrosine residues in the third intracellular loop and carboxyl tail. Immunodepletion of Jak2 virtually eliminated the ligand-dependent binding of STAT1 to the AT(1) receptor. These data indicate that the association of STAT1 with the AT(1) receptor is not strictly bimolecular; it requires Jak2 as both a STAT1 kinase and as a molecular bridge linking STAT1 to the AT(1) receptor.
