Recent studies show that hyperactivated mTOR, the 'target of rapamycin' that senses nutrient availability in eukaryotic cells, inhibits signaling by insulin receptor substrates. This crosstalk reveals how hyperactivated mTOR may suppress metastasis locally, while causing systemic insulin resistance that can progress to diabetes.
