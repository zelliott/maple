Pathfinding of growing nerve processes is guided by extracellular guidance cues. Here we report growth cone collapse of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells in culture evoked by the neuropeptide bradykinin. The growth cone response is mediated by B2 bradykinin receptors. Two different effects were distinguished. (1) Disappearance of filopodia occurred together with a loss of fibrillar actin (F-actin) in the growth cones at picomolar concentrations of bradykinin. The relative F-actin content was measured by means of rhodamine-phalloidin fluorescence using confocal microscopy. (2) Bradykinin-induced Ca2+ release and retraction of the neurite occurred at nanomolar concentrations. Ca2+ responses at single growth cones were measured using a 1:1 mixture of fura-red and fluo-3 Ca2+-sensitive dyes. The [Ca2+]i rise is not a prerequisite for the observed effects, because F-actin loss and retraction occurred during inhibition of Ca2+ responses. In contrast, inhibition by genistein pointed to a tyrosine kinase activity in the bradykinin-evoked cellular events. Subsequent analysis of phosphotyrosine proteins revealed that bradykinin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeleton-associated protein paxillin and the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase pp60(c-src). Paxillin and pp60(c-src) co-precipitated after bradykinin treatment. Immunostaining experiments showed punctate distribution of paxillin along PC12 neurites and in growth cones. Taken together, our data suggest that pp60(c-src) and paxillin are putative components of the intracellular signaling pathway of bradykinin-mediated neurite retraction and provide evidence for a crosstalk between G-protein- and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways in these cellular events.
