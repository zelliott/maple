In brain, a brief ischemic episode induces protection against a subsequent severe ischemic insult. This phenomenon is known as preconditioning-induced neural ischemic tolerance. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to preconditioning helps in identifying potential therapeutic targets for preventing the post-stroke brain damage. The present study conducted the genomic and proteomic analysis of adult rat brain as a function of time following preconditioning induced by a 10-min transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. GeneChip analysis showed induction of 40 putative neuroprotective transcripts between 3 to 72 h after preconditioning. These included heat-shock proteins, heme oxygenases, metallothioneins, signal transduction mediators, transcription factors, ion channels and apoptosis/plasticity-related transcripts. Real-time PCR confirmed the GeneChip data for the transcripts up-regulated after preconditioning. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with MALDI-TOF analysis showed increased expression of HSP70, HSP27, HSP90, guanylyl cyclase, muskelin, platelet activating factor receptor and beta-actin at 24 h after preconditioning. HSP70 protein induction after preconditioning was localized in the cortical pyramidal neurons. The infarct volume induced by focal ischemia (1-h MCA occlusion) was significantly smaller (by 38 +/- 7%, p < 0.05) in rats subjected to preconditioning 3 days before the insult. Preconditioning also prevented several gene expression changes induced by focal ischemia.
