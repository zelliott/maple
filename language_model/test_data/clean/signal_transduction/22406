Remarkable advances have been made during the last few decades in defining the organizational principles of the secretory pathway. The Golgi complex in particular has attracted special attention due to its central position in the pathway, as well as for its fascinating and complex structure. Analytical studies of this organelle have produced significant advances in our understanding of its function, although some aspects still seem to elude our comprehension. In more recent years a level of complexity surrounding this organelle has emerged with the discovery that the Golgi complex is involved in cellular processes other than the 'classical' trafficking and biosynthetic pathways. The resulting picture is that the Golgi complex can be considered as a cellular headquarters where cargo sorting/processing, basic metabolism, signalling and cell-fate decisional processes converge.
