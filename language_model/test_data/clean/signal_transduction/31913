Calcineurin B-like (CBL) interacting protein kinase 15 (CIPK15) is a newly identified positive regulator which is critical to directing the O(2) deficiency signal to the sugar signaling cascade as part of Amy3D (representative Amy3 gene) regulation in rice. It is located upstream and probably contributes to reserve mobilization under anoxia. In isolated starving embryos, the temporal pattern of accumulation of CIPK15 transcripts and leaky suppression of this gene suggests that factors other than CIPK15 may also be involved in the regulation of Amy3D expression. Probing of a variety of sugars and sugar analogs has shown that hexokinase mediates the sugar regulation of CIPK15. For example, hexokinase substrates, such as mannose, 2-deoxyglucose, and other metabolizable sugars, repressed CIPK15 expression, whereas 3-O-methylglucose and 6-deoxyglucose did not. By using glucosamine, a hexokinase inhibitor, to release glucose-dependent CIPK15 suppression, we confirmed that hexokinase mediates regulation of this gene. Chemical inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transfer, proton separation or ATP synthase also effectively abolished sugar-induced repression of CIPK15. This type of interference, the release from glucose-induced repression of gene expression by inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, was previously identified for the Amy3D gene, which suggests that hexokinase-mediated sugar signaling may be coordinated with the cellular energy status. Analysis of a transgenic rice cell line harboring the GUS reporter gene under the control of the CIPK15 promoter, and transient expression assay for 3' UTR of the CIPK15 gene indicate that sugar regulation of the rice CIPK15 gene is likely mediated by 2548-bp 5'-flanking region, with no additional post-transcriptional control.
