The ryanodine receptor (RyR) and the dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor (L-channels) comprise the main elements of the functional feet of the triadic element in skeletal muscle. These two main elements have conformational states that are regulated by the membrane potential and the consequent electrical field. The pharmacological action of ryanodine on skeletal muscle depends upon the physiological functional state of the RyR. At a resting potential of -90 m V, ryanodine at very low concentrations, 10(-11) M, causes the RyR to have a low conductance state which allows calcium to leak from the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and to be recycled with ATP utilization, leading to a marked increase in oxygen consumption and aerobic metabolism. At concentrations greater than 10(-6) M, ryanodine can cause a slowly developing contracture of resting muscle, inhibit the muscle twitch when the RyR complex is formed during stimulation, and, if formed before stimulation, accelerate the development of contracture. Biochemical studies have revealed that the RyR has four binding sites in which the conductance state depends upon the number of sites occupied by ryanodine. Our present understanding of the RyR-operated calcium channel is the result of an interdisciplinary approach in which each discipline (anatomy, physiology, biophysics, and biochemistry) contributes to our knowledge of the pharmacological action of ryanodine.
