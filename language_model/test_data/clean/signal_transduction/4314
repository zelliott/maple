Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a naturally occurring growth factor produced by several cell types in response to a variety of stimuli. GM-CSF has potent stimulatory effects on the growth and maturation of hematopoietic cells and has profound effects on mature circulating effector cells. Clinical applications of GM-CSF include ameliorating chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and enhancing hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow transplantation. This review evaluates the effect of GM-CSF on myeloid cells and its clinical applications.
