Enterostatin is a peptide that regulates dietary fat intake in rodents and inhibits insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Microarray studies of the genomic response of both a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2 cells) and a mouse hypothalamic cell line (GT1-7 cells) to enterostatin suggested that it might regulate protein trafficking. Using semi-quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, we confirmed that enterostatin upregulated Scamp2 and down regulated Dynamin2 in these cell lines. The receptor for enterostatin is the F1-ATPase beta subunit. We transfected HepG2 cells with either a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged F1-ATPase beta subunit or a red fluorescent protein (RFP) tagged F1-ATPase alpha subunit to study the effects of enterostatin on translocation of its own receptor protein. Enterostatin induced movement of GFP-beta subunit to the cell periphery area but did not have any effect on the localization of RFP-alpha subunit protein in HepG2. As Scamp2 is involved in glucose uptake in mouse Beta-TC6 insulinoma cells we tested enterostatin's effect in Beta-TC6 cells. Glucose stimulated insulin release was inhibited by enterostatin as reported previously. Using siRNA to Scamp2 did not change glucose stimulated insulin release but siRNA to Dynamin2 and dominant negative Dynamin2 (Dyn K44A) inhibited glucose stimulated insulin release and abolished the response to enterostatin. This suggests enterostatin inhibits glucose stimulated insulin release in pancreatic beta cells through down regulation of Dynamin2. This study also suggests that enterostatin might have a more generalized effect on protein trafficking in various cells.
