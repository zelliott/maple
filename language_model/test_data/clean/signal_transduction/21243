Somatostatin (SRIF) was discovered as an inhibitor of GH secretion from pituitary somatotroph cells. SRIF analogs are very effective agents used to treat neuroendocrine tumors and are now being used with increasing frequency in clinical trials to treat more aggressive malignancies. However, the cellular components mediating SRIF signal transduction remain largely unknown. We have stably overexpressed the SRIF type 2 receptor (SST2) in GH4 rat somatomammotroph cells, establishing a physiologically relevant model system. In this model, the SRIF analog, BIM23014, inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation, protein kinase A activation, cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation, and Pit-1/GHF-1 promoter activation in an okadaic acid-insensitive manner. Pertussis toxin inhibited the effects of BIM23014, documenting that SST2 signaling was coupled to Gi. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of BIM23014 were reversed by overexpression of protein kinase A catalytic subunit, indicating that SRIF does not act via serine/threonine phosphatases, but, rather, by lowering protein kinase A activity. These data define the components of the SRIF/SST2 receptor signaling pathway and provide important mechanistic insights into how SRIF controls neuroendocrine tumors. As SRIF analogs are effective antitumor agents, and many other related compounds are in development, the knowledge gained here will further our understanding of their mechanism of action in other malignancies as well.
