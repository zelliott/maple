Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is a potent inducer of both transdifferentiation and contraction, which are regarded as critical processes that underpin tissue fibrosis. Consequently, transdifferentiation is believed to drive TGFbeta-mediated contraction. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between transdifferentiation of human lens epithelial cells and matrix contraction.

Real-time PCR was used to investigate gene expression of transdifferentiation markers in the human lens cell line FHL 124 and native lens epithelia. Contraction was assessed with a patch-contraction assay, whereby all areas covered by cells were measured with imaging techniques after fixation and cell staining with Coomassie blue. In addition, total protein content, determined by dye extractions was used to give an estimate of total cell population. To prevent fibronectin-fibronectin receptor interaction 100 microM RGDS peptide was used. Suppression of TGFbeta-induced alphaSMA expression was mediated by siRNA technology.

Real-time PCR analysis showed 10 ng/mL TGF-beta1 or -beta2 significantly increased expression of alphaSMA, fibronectin, and alpha5beta1 integrin (fibronectin receptor components) in FHL 124 cells and human lens epithelia. Cultures maintained in TGFbeta and RGDS showed a marked increase in the rate of contraction relative to TGF-beta alone. RGDS alone did not differ significantly from the control. Real-time PCR and Western blots showed reduced levels of message and alphaSMA protein when transfected with siRNA. alphaSMA knockdown did not prevent TGFbeta-induced contraction.

A targeted inhibition approach demonstrated that key elements associated with transdifferentiation are not critical for TGFbeta-induced matrix contraction.
