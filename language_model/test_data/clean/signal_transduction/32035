Arabidopsis RPS2 is a typical disease resistance (R) protein with nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeats (NB-LRR). Previously, we reported that RPS2 is physically associated with some Arabidopsis hypersensitive induced reaction (AtHIR) proteins, which are enriched in membrane microdomains. Biochemical and genetic analyses suggested that members of the AtHIR gene family have a function in RPS2-mediated immune signaling. Here, we provide evidence that the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) FLS2 is also physically associated with AtHIR2 in a N. benthamiana transient expression system. We thus speculate that PM microdomains provide a platform for both types of immune receptors, R proteins and PRRs, and that the activation of the receptors is facilitated by AtHIR proteins.
