Mounting evidence indicates that cigarette smoking not only promotes tumorigenesis but also may increase the spread of cancer cells in the body. However, the intracellular mechanism(s) by which cigarette smoking promotes metastasis of human lung cancer remains enigmatic. Nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is an important component in cigarette smoke and is formed by nitrosation of nicotine. mu- and m-calpain (calpain I and calpain II) are major members of the calpain family, which are ubiquitously expressed in both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer cells. Our findings indicated that NNK potently induces phosphorylation of both mu- and m-calpain in association with their activation and increased migration as well as invasion of lung cancer cells. Treatment of cells with PD98059 blocked phosphorylation of m- and mu-calpain and resulted in suppression of NNK-induced cell migration and invasion. p44 MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and p42 MAPK/ERK2 were activated by NNK, co-localized with mu- and m-calpain in cytoplasm, and directly phosphorylated mu- and m-calpain in vitro. These findings suggest a role for the ERK1/2 kinases as NNK-activated physiological calpain kinases. Specific knock-down of mu- and/or m-calpain expression by RNA interference blocked NNK-stimulated migration and invasion, suggesting that mu- and m-calpain may act as required targets in a NNK-induced metastatic signaling pathway. Furthermore, NNK promotes secretion of active mu- and m-calpain from lung cancer cells through vesicles, which may have the potential to cleave substrates in the extracellular matrix. Thus, NNK-induced cell migration and invasion may occur, at least in part, through a novel mechanism involving phosphorylation of calpains that leads to their activation and secretion, which may contribute to metastasis and/or progression of lung cancer.
