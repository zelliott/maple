Palmitoylation is unique among lipid modifications of proteins in that it is reversible and regulable. Recent advances in the study of palmitoylation include the following: the correlation of this modification with the localization of a signaling protein to specific membrane subdomains; the demonstration of a specific protein-protein interaction that is promoted by palmitoylation; and the identification, characterization, and purification of enzymes catalyzing this modification.
