The protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins, consisting of at least ten isoforms, has been shown to regulate major cellular functions, including the growth and differentiation in many cell types. Use of PKC activators and inhibitors in combination with molecular biology techniques, has permitted detailed exploration of their specific intracellular actions. Recently, studies have implicated PKC specifically in the regulation of growth and differentiated function in melanocytes. In particular, the beta-isoform of PKC was shown to regulate human melanogenesis through activation of tyrosinase, the rate limiting enzyme in melanogenesis. This article reviews the role of PKC in melanocyte biology.
