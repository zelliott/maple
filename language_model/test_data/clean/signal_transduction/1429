Human Il-1 alpha induces the synthesis of kappa Ig L chains by the pre-B cell line 7OZ/3, IL-2R alpha by the human NK cell line YT, and PGE2 by human rheumatoid synovial cells. Pertussis toxin (PT) markedly inhibited all three IL-1-induced activation events. The inhibition by PT was associated with a decrease in IL-1-mediated cAMP production. PT also inhibited IL-1-stimulated cAMP production in crude membrane fractions from 7OZ/3, YT, and 3T3 fibroblasts. In addition, IL-1 stimulated GTPase activity present in the membranes IL-1-responsive cells. Furthermore, the IL-1-induced GTPase activity was sensitive to PT. PT induced the ADP-ribosylation of a 46-kDa substrate in membrane preparations from IL-1-responsive cells. Cholera toxin also induced the ADP-ribosylation of a 46-kDa substrate in the same membrane preparations. The present findings indicate that the IL-1R is linked to a PT-sensitive G protein that stimulates the activity of adenylate cyclase.
