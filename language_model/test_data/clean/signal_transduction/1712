A study of the fundamental biology of the maternal-fetal interface reveals the complex interactions among multiple cell types and regulatory factors necessary to support a successful pregnancy. Cells of decidua and trophoblast lineages play central roles in creating the maternal-fetal interface and are sources of regulatory factors that can determine the quality and success of pregnancy. The regulatory factors considered here are major placental histocompatibility complex proteins, pregnancy-specific regulatory factors for uterine inflammatory cells, and hormone-controlled placental multidrug-resistant transport systems. Potential targets are discussed and presented as areas where researchers may identify novel pharmacological and immunological strategies that eventually will extend to the clinic to improve the quality and success of pregnancy.
