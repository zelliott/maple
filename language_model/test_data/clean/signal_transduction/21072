Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is one of the major substrates of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and mediates various insulin signals downstream. In this study, we have examined the impact of three natural IRS-1 mutations identified in NIDDM patients (G971R, P170R, and M209T) on insulin signaling. G971R is located near src homology 2 protein binding sites, and P170R and M209T are located in the phosphotyrosine binding domain of IRS-1. 32D-IR cells, stably overexpressing human insulin receptor, were transfected with wild-type human IRS-1 cDNA (WT) or three mutant IRS-1 cDNAs and analyzed. All the cell lines expressing mutant IRS-1 showed a significant reduction in [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with WT. Upon insulin stimulation, cells expressing G971R showed a 39% decrease (P < 0.005) in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity, a 43% decrease (P < 0.01) in binding of the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, and a 22% decrease (P < 0.05) in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity compared with those expressing WT. Cells expressing P170R and M209T showed slight but significant decreases in PI 3-kinase activity (17 and 14%, respectively; both P < 0.05) and in binding of p85 (22 and 16%, respectively; both P < 0.05) and a greater decrease in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (41 and 43%, respectively; both P < 0.005) compared with WT. After insulin stimulation, cells expressing P170R and M209T showed significant decreases in IRS-1 phosphorylation (37 and 42%, respectively; both P < 0.05) and in IRS-1 binding to the insulin receptor (48 and 53%, respectively; P < 0.01) compared with WT. G971R showed no changes in IRS-1 phosphorylation and in IRS-1 binding to the insulin receptor compared with WT. These data suggest that the impaired mitogenic response of P170R and M209T was mainly due to reduced binding to the insulin receptor, whereas the impaired response of G971R was mainly due to reduced association with PI 3-kinase p85.
