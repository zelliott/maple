Contact inhibition of cell movement was originally defined in the 1950s as a way of interpreting studies that were ethological and statistical in nature. Research done in succeeding decades provided a more detailed study of the initial contact and its consequences for the cell. The behavior called contact inhibition is characterized by the cessation of ruffling and forward movement in the lamellipodium of the cell making the contact. A new ruffling membrane then arises elsewhere on the cell perimeter. A comparison between the contact behavior described in the early literature and that of the nerve growth cone, described recently by Steketee and Tosney, suggests that filopodia mediate the sensing function in both cases. Since transformed cells have fewer filopodia than normal cells, the contact behavior may decline in direct response to the degraded function of filopodia. This new "filopodia focal signal transduction" hypothesis of contact inhibition elevates the filopodia sensing function and the cessation of lamellipodial advance to the highest importance as phenomena underlying the altered behavior of cancer cells.
