Prolactin is a hormone that is essential for normal reproduction and signals through two types of receptors. Not only is the classical long form of the prolactin receptor identified, but so are many short form receptors in rodents and human tissues. Mouse mutagenesis studies have offered insight into the biology of prolactin family, providing compelling evidence that the different isoforms have independent biological activity. The possibility that short forms mediate cell proliferation is important for a variety of tissues including mammary gland and ovarian follicles. This review summarizes our current knowledge about prolactin signaling and its role in reproduction through either long or short isoform receptors.
