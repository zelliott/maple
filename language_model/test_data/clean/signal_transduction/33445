The activation of the coagulation cascade in the tumor microenvironment is a key feature of advanced malignancies. On tumor cells, tissue factor (TF) plays a central role to initiate cross-talk through the release of procoagulant microparticles or through direct, protease-activated receptor (PAR)-mediated cell signaling that leads to the production of soluble cytokines and angiogenic growth factors. In addition, the hemostatic system in the host compartment sustains crucial circuits that promote metastasis and support tumor growth and angiogenesis. Experimental tumor and genetic models have defined specific pathways that are supported by tumor cell and host TF and have identified potential therapeutic modalities to specifically interrupt TF signaling in tumor biology without impairment of hemostatic functions.
