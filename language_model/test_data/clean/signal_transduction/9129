Specification of the intermediate mesoderm and the epithelial derivatives that will make the mammalian kidney depends on the concerted action of many transcription factors and signaling proteins. Among the earliest genes expressed in the nephric duct and surrounding mesenchyme is Pax2, whose function is essential for making and maintaining the epithelium. The Pax2 protein is subject to phosphorylation in response to signals that activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, including Wnts and BMPs. In cell culture systems, Pax2 is know to recruit components of a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase complex to specific DNA sites to alter the pattern of histone modifications and determine gene expression. This epigenetic function may underlie the ability of Pax2 and similar proteins to maintain cell lineages during development.
