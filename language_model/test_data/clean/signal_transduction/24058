Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) is increased in individuals with bronchial asthma. NO may have antiinflammatory and proinflammatory effects; however, its role in bronchial asthma is unclear. In the present study, to clarify this issue we examined the effect of NO in inducing activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) and a role of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase1 (ASK1), an upstream kinase kinase of c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in NO-mediated AP-1 activation. The results showed that (1) the reactive nitrogen generating species NOR-1(+/--(E)-methyl-2-[(E)-hydroxykmino]-5-nitro-6-methoxy-3-hexeneamide]) induced AP-1 activation determined by AP-1-dependent luciferase gene activity, and an NO scavenger, carboxyl-PTIO, attenuated NOR-1-induced AP-1 activation; (2) NOR-1 phosphorylated ASK1, JNK, and p38 MAPK; and (3) transient transfection of the dominant negative form of AKS1 attenuated NOR-1-induced AP-1 activation in BEC. To further characterize the role of ASK-1 cascade, the dominant negative form of ASK1-stable transfected porcine artery endothelial (PAE) cells were used. AP-1 activity and JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were depressed in the dominant-negative form of ASK1-stable transfected PAE cells. These results indicate that NO is capable of inducing AP-1 activation, and that ASK1-p38 MAPK/JNK cascade regulates AP-1 activation in NO-stimulated BEC.
