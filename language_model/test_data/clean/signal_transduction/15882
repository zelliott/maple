The molecular events occurring during myocardial infarction and cardioprotection are described with an emphasis on the changes of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)). The low ΔΨ(m) values of the normal beating heart (100-140 mV) are explained by the allosteric ATP-inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) through feedback inhibition by ATP at high [ATP]/[ADP] ratios. During ischemia the mechanism is reversibly switched off by signaling through reactive oxygen species (ROS). At reperfusion high ΔΨ(m) values cause a burst of ROS production leading to apoptosis and/or necrosis. Ischemic preconditioning is suggested to cause additional phosphorylation of CcO, protecting the enzyme from immediate dephosphorylation via ROS signaling.
