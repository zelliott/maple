Signaling between cells in the anterior (A) and posterior (P) compartments directs Drosophila wing disc development and is dependent on expression of the homeodomain transcription factor Engrailed (En) in P cells. Downstream of en, posteriorly expressed Hedgehog (Hh) protein signals across the A/P border to establish a developmental organizer that directs pattern formation and growth throughout the wing primordium. Here we extend investigations of the processes downstream of en by using expression array analysis to compare A and P cells. A total of 102 candidate genes were identified that express differentially in the A and P compartments; four were characterized: Stubble (Sb) expression is restricted to A cells due to repression by en. CG15905, CG16884; CG10200/hase und igel (hui) are expressed in A cells downstream of Hh signaling; and RNA interference for hui, Stubble, and CG16884 revealed that each is essential to wing development.
