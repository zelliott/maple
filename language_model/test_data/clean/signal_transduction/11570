Thioredoxin (TRX) is a small ubiquitous and multifunctional protein having a redox-active dithiol/disulfide within the conserved active site sequence -Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-. TRX is induced by a variety of oxidative stimuli, including UV irradiation, inflammatory cytokines and chemical carcinogens, and has been shown to play crucial roles in the regulation of cellular responses such as gene expression, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Overexpression of TRX protects cells from cytotoxicity elicited by oxidative stress in both in vitro and in vivo models. The regulatory mechanism of TRX expression and activity is also being elucidated. Recently, TRX binding protein-2 (TBP-2)/vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1 (VDUP1) was identified as a negative regulator of TRX. The analysis of TRX promoter region has revealed putative regulatory elements responsible for oxidative stress. Thus, the modulation of TRX functions may be a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of oxidative stress-mediated diseases.
