The endozepine triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN) induces intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) changes and is chemotactic for human neutrophils (PMNs). Because interleukin-8 (IL-8) production is Ca(2+) dependent and can be induced by chemotactic stimuli, we have investigated the ability of TTN to induce IL-8 production in PMNs, as well as the signal transduction mechanisms involved. Our results show that TTN increases IL-8 release and IL-8 mRNA expression in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion, and these effects are prevented by the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM. TTN-induced [Ca(2+)](i) changes and IL-8 mRNA expression are sensitive to pertussis toxin, to the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 (but not to its inactive analogue U73343) and to the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C. It is therefore suggested that TTN-induced IL-8 production in human PMNs results from a G protein-operated, PLC-activated [Ca(2+)](i) rise, and PKC contributes to this effect. These findings further support the possible role of TTN in the modulation of the inflammatory processes.
