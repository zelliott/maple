In recent years, there have been major advances in the understanding of both the cell biology of vesicle trafficking between intracellular compartments and the molecular targeting signals intrinsic to the trafficking proteins themselves. One system to which these advances have been profitably applied is the regulation of the trafficking of a glucose transporter, GLUT4, from intracellular compartment(s) to the cell surface in response to insulin. The unique nature of the trafficking of GLUT4 and its expression in highly differentiated cells makes this a question of considerable interest to cell biologists. Unraveling the tangled web of molecular events coordinating GLUT4 trafficking will eventually lead to a greater understanding of mammalian glucose metabolism, as well as fundamental cell biological principles related to organelle biogenesis and protein trafficking.
