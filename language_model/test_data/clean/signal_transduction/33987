8-Prenylkaempferol is a prenylflavonoid isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens, a Chinese herb with anti-inflammatory properties. However whether 8-prenylkaempferol itself displayed an anti-inflammatory activity remained unclear. In this study, we evaluated the effect of 8-prenylkaempferol on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW264.7 macrophages. 8-Prenylkaempferol inhibited significantly LPS-induced NO production through suppressing inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression at both protein and mRNA levels but failed to affect sodium nitroprusside-triggered NO production, iNOS enzyme activity, and cell viability. Further investigation of the mechanisms revealed that 8-prenylkaempferol inhibited LPS-induced c-Jun phosphorylation (a major component of activator protein-1, AP-1), but did not attenuate IkB-alpha degradation nor NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. Cellular signaling analysis using mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors including 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (PD98059, MEK1/2 inhibitor), 4-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-1H-imidazol-4-yl]pyridine (SB203580, p38 kinase inhibitor) and anthra[1-9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one (SP600125, c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor) demonstrated that extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 and JNK all participated in LPS-stimulated iNOS expression and NO production, but 8-prenylkaempferol interfered selectively with JNK phosphorylation. On the other hand, LPS-induced c-Jun phosphorylation was attenuated in the presence of SP600125. We suggested that interfering with JNK-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation and thus blocking AP-1 activation might contribute to the suppression effects of 8-prenylkaempferol on iNOS. These findings provided the first molecular basis that 8-prenylkaempferol is an effective agent for attenuating pro-inflammatory NO induction.
