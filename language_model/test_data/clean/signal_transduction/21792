The effect of surface topography and chemistry on cellular response is of fundamental importance, especially where living systems encounter device surfaces as in medical implants, tissue engineering, and cell-based sensors. To understand these biological processes on surfaces, there is a widespread interest in tailored surface-active materials produced by a combination of surface chemistry coupled to advanced patterning processes. We utilize self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as molecular templates with submicrometer-scale spatial resolution to engage and cluster IgE receptors on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells. Bioactive templates consisted of gold arrays on silicon with patterns from 1 mum down to 45 nm. These gold arrays served as molecular tethering sites, enabling covalent binding of functionalized self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiols. The free ends of the monolayers were functionalized with 2,4-dinitrophenyl(DNP)-caproate-based ligands which interact specifically with anti-DNP IgE bound to its high affinity cell surface receptor, FcepsilonRI on RBL mast cells. Present results on structures 1 mum down to 600 nm in size indicate that these ligand-immobilized patterned arrays can function as a powerful tool for visualization and systematic characterization of cell membrane involvement in IgE receptor-mediated immune cell signaling.
