WebCell is a web-based environment for managing quantitative and qualitative information on cellular networks and for interactively exploring their steady-state and dynamic behaviors in response to systemic perturbations. It is designed as a user-friendly web interface, allowing users to efficiently construct, visualize, analyze and store reaction network models, thereby facilitating kinetic modeling and in silico simulation of biological systems of interest. A collected model library is also available to provide comprehensive implications for cellular dynamics of the published models.
