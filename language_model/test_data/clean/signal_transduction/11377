During septic shock, circulating levels of anti-inflammatory mediators are increased relative to those of pro-inflammatory. The reduced capacity of septic shock blood leukocytes in expressing pro-inflammatory genes in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) may contribute to reductions in these mediators, but the reasons for persistent increases in circulating anti-inflammatory mediators are unknown. We determined whether septic shock leukocytes that have adapted to LPS induction of the IL-1beta gene could continue to express sIL-1RA in response to LPS. Septic shock whole-blood leukocytes and neutrophils (PMNs) selectively maintained production of sIL-1RA after treatment with LPS while limiting that of IL-1beta. Repressed transcription of IL-1beta and rapid decay of IL-1beta mRNA in septic shock neutrophils correlated with reductions in levels of IL-1beta after stimulation with LPS. Transcription of sIL-1RA mRNA was also suppressed, but the ability of LPS to stimulate events that lead to efficient translation of a stable sIL-1RA mRNA appeared responsible for maintaining sIL-1RA production. We conclude that LPS adaptation of septic shock leukocytes selectively influences signaling pathways that regulate transcription, mRNA processing, and translation, leading to changes in the balance of production of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.
