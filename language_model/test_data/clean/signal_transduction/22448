Metabolic reactions and gene regulation are two primary processes of cells. In response to environmental changes cells often adjust the regulatory programs and shift the metabolic states. An integrative investigation and modeling of these two processes would improve our understanding about the cellular systems and may generate substantial impacts in medicine, agriculture, environmental protection, and energy production. We review the studies of the various aspects of the crosstalk between metabolic reactions and gene regulation, including models, empirical evidence, and available databases.
