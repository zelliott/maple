In addition to acting as an essential nutrient for the immune system and overall body function, it is apparent that selenium also plays a critical role in the operation of the nervous system. Selenium itself is a constituent of selenoproteins, which are primarily involved in antioxidant function and redox status. However, apart from its covalent incorporation into these proteins, selenium also performs neuroprotective actions independent of translational processes. Furthermore, low selenium intake has detrimental effects on proper brain function, such as epileptic episodes and neuronal cell death, which have, in turn, been shown to be mitigated by higher selenium levels. Understanding the mechanisms of selenium action will be crucial to determining its potential as a preventive and therapeutic agent against excitatory brain damage.
