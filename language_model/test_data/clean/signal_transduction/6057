Tissue factor (TF) initiates the coagulation cascade but also plays a role in cancer and metastasis. This transmembrane protein is frequently upregulated on tumor cells and cells that show metastatic behavior. Furthermore, it is a significant risk factor for hepatic metastasis in patients suffering from colon cancer. Recently, it has been shown that TF, together with its natural ligand factor VIIa, induces intracellular changes, such as signal transduction cascades, gene transcription, and protein synthesis. Moreover, TF:factor VIIa interaction leads to survival of cells that have been stimulated to undergo apoptosis. Together with TF-dependent processes such as angiogenesis, these intracellular phenomena form a plausible explanation for the influence of TF on metastasis. In this review, we will discuss these phenomena in more detail and hypothesize on their role in TF-driven metastasis.
