We show that cells deleted for SNF3, HXT1, HXT2, HXT3, HXT4, HXT6, and HXT7 do not take up glucose and cannot grow on media containing glucose as a sole carbon source. The expression of Hxt1, Hxt2, Hxt3, Hxt6, or Gal2 in these cells resulted in glucose transport and allowed growth on glucose media. In contrast, the expression of Snf3 failed to confer glucose uptake or growth on glucose. HXT6 is highly expressed on raffinose, low glucose, or nonfermentable carbon sources but is repressed in the presence of high concentrations of glucose. The maintenance of HXT6 glucose repression is strictly dependent on Snf3 and not on intracellular glucose. In snf3 delta cells expression of HXT6 is constitutive even when the entire repertoire of HXT genes is present and glucose uptake is abundant. In addition, glucose repression of HXT6 does not require glucose uptake by HXT1, HXT2, HXT3 or HXT4. We show that a signal transduction pathway defined by the Snf3-dependent hexose regulation of HXT6 is distinct from but also overlaps with general glucose regulation pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Finally, glucose repression of ADH2 and SUC2 is intact in snf3 delta hxt1 delta hxt2 delta hxt3 delta hxt4 delta hxt6 delta hxt7 delta gal2 cells, suggesting that the sensing and signaling mechanism for general glucose repression is independent from glucose uptake.
