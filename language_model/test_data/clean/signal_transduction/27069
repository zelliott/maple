From current information, a brief review was made on the basic properties of a possible process of eosinophil activation and degranulation. The "activated" eosinophils show the following characteristics: diminished cell density, morphologic alterations, increased surface receptors, heightened parasite killing, increased metabolic activity and prolonged survival. Immune complexes (secretory IgA, IgG, IgE) are known as potent triggering stimuli of eosinophil degranulation as well as complement fragments (C3b, C3bi). Cytokines (IL-5, GM-CSF), PAF and peptides (substance P) act both as weak degranulation inducer and degranulation enhancer. Synergism between the two pathways, Ca2+ and protein kinase C, is now recognized as a common feature of control of secretion in eosinophils.
