MET is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth factor, a multifunctional cytokine controlling cell growth, morphogenesis, and motility. In our previous study, RanBPM/RanBP9, whose name originated from its ability to interact with Ran, was identified as a MET-interacting protein. RanBPM/RanBP9 activates the Ras/Erk signaling pathway by serving as an adaptor protein of MET to recruit Sos. In this study, we identify a protein sharing a high amino acid sequence identity with RanBPM/RanBP9, especially in its SPRY domain, the region responsible for MET binding. This protein lacks the N-terminal poly-proline and poly-glutamine (Poly-PQ) stretch present in RanBPM/RanBP9 and has less homology with RanBPM/RanBP9 in its mid-region. We subsequently named this protein RanBP10 after demonstrating its interaction with Ran. We show that, like RanBPM/RanBP9, RanBP10 interacts with the tyrosine kinase domain of MET via its SPRY domain and these two proteins can compete with each other to bind to MET. Interestingly, unlike RanBPM/RanBP9, overexpression of RanBP10 cannot induce Erk1/2 phosphorylation and serum response element-luciferase (SRE-LUC) reporter gene expression. More importantly, co-transfection of RanBPM/RanBP9 and RanBP10 significantly represses SRE-LUC reporter gene expression induced by overexpression of RanBPM/RanBP9. Additional binding assays demonstrate that RanBP10 fails to interact with Sos, which explains its inability to activate the Ras/Erk pathway. Furthermore, we show that the N-terminus of RanBPM/RanBP9 with the Poly-PQ stretch is required for recruiting Sos and a truncated RanBPM/RanBP9 lacking this region fails to recruit Sos, indicating that the functional difference between RanBP10 and RanBPM/RanBP9 lies in their sequence difference in their N-termini.
