The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is a multimeric complex composed of an antigen-binding clonotypic heterodimer and a signal transducing complex consisting of the CD3 dimers (CD3gammaepsilon and CD3deltaepsilon) and a TCR-zeta homodimer. In all jawed vertebrates there are two T cell lineages, alphabeta and gammadelta, distinguished by the clonotypic subunits contained within their TCRs (TCR-alpha and -beta or TCR-gamma and -delta, respectively). A third receptor complex, the preTCR, is only expressed on immature T cells. The preTCR, which contains the invariant pre-Talpha (pTalpha) chain in lieu of TCR-alpha, plays a critical role in the early development of alphabeta lineage cells. The subunit composition of the signal transducing complexes of the pre-, alphabeta- and gammadeltaTCRs was previously thought to be identical. However, recent data demonstrate that there are significant differences in the signal transducing complexes of these three TCRs. For example, alphabetaTCRs contain both CD3gammaepsilon and CD3deltaepsilon dimers, whereas gammadeltaTCRs contain only CD3gammaepsilon dimers. Moreover, preTCR function appears to be unaffected in the absence of CD3delta, suggesting that CD3deltaepsilon dimers are dispensable for pre-TCR assembly. In this review, we summarize current data relating to the subunit composition of the pre-, alphabeta- and gammadeltaTCRs and discuss how these structural differences may impact receptor signaling and alphabeta/gammadelta lineage determination.
