Sivelestat sodium hydrate (sivelestat) is a specific synthetic inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (NE). Various studies suggest that sivelestat treatment reduces inflammation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that sivelestat acts as an inhibitor of inflammatory mediators and prevents nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation.

In the presence and absence of sivelestat, the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the levels of inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)) and nitrite in the cell supernatant were measured, along with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression.

While LPS administration increased the secretion of inflammatory mediators and nitric oxide (NO), sivelestat decreased the secretion of these mediators. Cell signaling studies demonstrated that sivelestat decreased NF-kB activation by inhibiting IkB phosphorylation.

Sivelestat may inhibit the various inflammatory mediators through NF-kB inhibition.
