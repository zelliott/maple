3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), a widely used recreational drug with psychoactive properties, induces both serotonin and dopamine release in the brain. However, little is known about its intracellular effects. We previously showed that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine rewarding effects in mice were dependent upon extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and that dorsal striatum was a critical region for mediating extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent Egr1 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced transcription. Here, we extend these findings by showing that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine is indeed able to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase within this structure. To identify genes regulated by acute 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in the mice dorsal striatum, and selectively controlled by this kinase, we performed microarray experiments by using a selective inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation, SL327. Of the approximately 24,000 genes from the microarray, 27 showed altered expression after exposure to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and among these, 59% were partially or totally inhibited by SL327 pretreatment. Our results showed that the genes regulated by 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine encode proteins that belong to transcription factors family, signaling pathways (phosphatases, cytoskeleton regulation), and synaptic functions. These early changes, and especially those controlled by extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation might play significant roles in the expression of many of the behaviors that occur following 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine taking.
