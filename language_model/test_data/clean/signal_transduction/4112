A panel of human hematopoietic cell lines was genetically engineered to express recombinant complement receptor 2 (CR2 or CD21), which is also the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) receptor. The panel was composed of SupT1, J1.1, and U1.HIV cells. The latter is a promonocytic cell line, whereas the other two are T lymphocytic cell lines. J1.1 and U1.HIV cells are latently infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). These three cell lines were transduced with a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral vector system. CR2 was efficiently and consistently expressed on the cell membranes, conferring enhanced susceptibility to EBV infection. The efficient expression of recombinant CR2 in cell lines of hematopoietic origin allowed for study of the interaction between EBV infection and HIV-1 gene regulation in suitable cell-culture models. The effects of EBV and HIV-1 coinfection results were cell-type dependent. In the two T lymphocytic cell lines, HIV-1 expression was rapidly and persistently down-regulated by EBV. Conversely, in the promonocytic cell line U1.HIV-CR2, HIV-1 expression was transiently enhanced by EBV. The EBV and HIV-1 coinfection result in U1.HIV-CR2 cells is potentially important, as the activation of HIV-1 gene expression in monocyte-like cells may play a crucial role in the mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion by apoptosis. Therefore, the U1.HIV-CR2 cell line may represent a useful cell-culture system to study the synergism between EBV and HIV-1 in inducing apoptosis in primary CD4+ T cells.
