Intestinal adaptation occurs in response to injury or alteration in nutrient availability. It is both morphologic and physiologic in nature and can be mediated by growth factors and nutrients. Pathologic conditions such as short-bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease lead to derangements in nutrient absorption that may exceed the body's regenerative and adaptive capacity. Failure to fully adapt often results in long-term dependence on parenteral nutrition, leading to decreased quality of life and excessive medical expenses. The therapeutic use of appropriate growth factors may increase the adaptive capabilities of the gut.

Medline and current literature review.

The major known nutrient transporters present in the gut and the mechanisms by which growth factors alter transport activity during intestinal adaptation are summarized. Growth factors have the potential to improve nutrient absorption in some bowel diseases.
