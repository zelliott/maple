Overexpression of the Homo sapiens LYR motif containing 1 (LYRM1) causes mitochondrial dysfunction and induces insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. α-Lipoic acid (α-LA), a dithiol compound with antioxidant properties, improves glucose transport and utilization in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate the direct effects of α-LA on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and insulin sensitivity in LYRM1 overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes and to explore the underlying mechanism. Pretreatment with α-LA significantly increased both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, while intracellular ROS levels in LYRM1 overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes were decreased. These changes were accompanied by a marked upregulation in expression of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and serine phosphorylation of Akt following treatment with α-LA. These results indicated that α-LA protects 3T3-L1 adipocytes from LYRM1-induced insulin resistance partially via its capacity to restore mitochondrial function and/or increase phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt.
