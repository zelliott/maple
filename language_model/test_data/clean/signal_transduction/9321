The molecular mechanisms controlling sex determination and differentiation in zebrafish (Danio rerio) are largely unknown. A genome-wide analysis may provide comprehensive insights into the processes involved. The mRNA expression in zebrafish gonads has been fairly well studied, but much less data on the corresponding protein expression are available, although the proteins are considered to be more relevant markers of gene function. Because mRNA and protein abundances rarely correlate well, mRNA profiles need to be complemented with the information on protein expression. The work presented here analyzed the proteomes of adult zebrafish gonads by a multidimensional protein identification technology, generating the to-date most populated lists of proteins expressed in mature zebrafish gonads. The acquired proteomics data partially confirmed existing transcriptomics information for several genes, including several novel transcripts. However, disagreements between mRNA and protein abundances were often observed, further stressing the necessity to assess the expression on different levels before drawing conclusions on a certain gene's expression and function. Several gene groups expressed in a sexually dimorphic way in zebrafish gonads were identified. Their potential importance for gonad development and function is discussed. The data gained in the current study provide a basis for further work on elucidating processes occurring during zebrafish development with use of high-throughput proteomics.
