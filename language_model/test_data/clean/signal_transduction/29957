A study by Wan et al. in this issue of Cell demonstrates that the majority of oncogenic mutations in the B-Raf protein kinase result in increased catalytic activity, through disruption of the autoinhibited state of the kinase domain. Surprisingly, several mutations lead to impaired B-Raf kinase activity, yet these mutants are nevertheless capable of stimulating downstream signaling through transactivation of C-Raf.
