Steady-state numbers of peripheral lymphocyte are tightly controlled. For conventional T cells, signals delivered through the interaction of the T cell receptor (TCR) with antigen-loaded MHC molecules are required for the peripheral survival of naive T cells and for their homeostatic expansion in lymphopenic hosts. Cytokines, including IL-7, are also essential for survival of peripheral naive T cells. CD1d-restricted, V alpha 14(+) natural killer (NK)-T cells are a specialized autoreactive T subset with immunoregulatory activity. The relative roles of TCR engagement and cytokine signaling in the peripheral homeostasis of V alpha 14(+) NK-T cells were investigated. After adoptive transfer, the survival and expansion of peripheral V alpha 14(+) NK-T cells was independent of CD1d expression in the host. In contrast, IL-15 (but not IL-7) was required for maintenance of peripheral CD1d-reactive V alpha 14(+) T cells. Comparison of V alpha 14(+) T cell transfers into NK-proficient vs. deficient hosts suggests that NK-T cells and NK cells compete for peripheral resources. Our results indicate that IL-15 maintains the homeostasis of peripheral V alpha 14(+) NK-T cells. In contrast, TCR "tickling" of NK-T cells, if it occurs under steady-state conditions, does not by itself provide a sufficient signal for their peripheral survival.
