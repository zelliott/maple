Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins is critical for the Fc epsilon RI-induced signal transduction that leads to the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells. Here we report the isolation of a monoclonal antibody, mAb BD2, to a 72 kDa protein that becomes rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated after Fc epsilon RI aggregation. By immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting and/or protease digestion this 72 kDa protein was different from the previously identified 68-76 kDa tyrosine phosphorylated proteins Btk, paxillin, SLP-76 or Syk. The phosphorylation of this 72 kDa protein was detectable within 15 sec after receptor aggregation and was independent of Ca2+ influx or the activation of protein kinase C. By in vitro kinase reaction, the 72 kDa protein did not autophosphorylate, which suggests that it is not a kinase, but is associated with a 140 kDa protein that was strongly phosphorylated. Studies in Syk deficient and Syk transfected variants of the RBL-2H3 cells demonstrated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of this 72 kDa protein was downstream of Syk. These data indicate that the 72 kDa protein precipitated by mAb BD2 is a novel phosphoprotein involved in Fc epsilon RI signaling.
