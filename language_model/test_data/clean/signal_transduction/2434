This manuscript presents a brief overview of the physiology and cell biology of the endothelium, which is the basis for understanding the role of endothelial cells in pathological processes as diverse as atherosclerosis, tumour intravasation and multiple organ failure. Following consideration of general aspects of endothelial function in regulating haemostasis, vascular tone and growth, special emphasis will be placed on endothelial regulation of the inflammatory response, which centres on the microcirculation. A particular role in inflammation is played by cell adhesion molecules (CAM), expressed both on endothelial and blood cells. Cell and molecular biological methods to investigate the expression of CAM in endothelial cells in vitro will be presented, as well as novel data, indicating that cytokine-induced up-regulation of CAM in the endothelium may involve signal transduction pathways other than those culminating in the activation of NF-kappa B. Finally, the phenomenon of angiogenesis will be briefly reviewed as a characteristic of endothelial cell activity of central importance to both physiology and pathology and new experimental data presented from an in vitro model to study the ability of individual endothelial cells to form vessel-like structures. In comparative studies to investigate the roles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor, the dominant role of VEGF in the formation of capillary networks could be unequivocally demonstrated.
