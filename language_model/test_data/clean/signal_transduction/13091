The purpose of this work was to study whether exercise training induces changes in the lipid profile of rat aorta and nervous system and in the in vitro intrinsic responsiveness of these tissues to endothel in-1 (ET-1) treatment. The exercise program performed successfully produced the characteristic metabolic alterations of the trained state. Exercise training induced a large and significant increase in the levels of both aortic ethanolamine plasmalogens (PlasEtn) and glucosylceramides. In contrast, a decrease of aortic ceramide and cholesterol levels was evoked by exercise training. ET-1 increased PlasEtn content only in sedentary animals. An exercise-induced increase in cerebellum levels of ceramides and ceramide monohexosides was found. The cerebellum ceramide content was increased by ET-1 more noticeably in sedentary rats than in trained animals. In contrast, cerebral cortex was observed to be largely insensitive to both exercise training and ET-1 treatment. It was concluded that exercise training (i) induces changes in both vascular and cerebellar lipid profiles, the former being much more pronounced than the latter, and (ii) diminishes the aortic and cerebellar sensitivity to ET-1 action.
