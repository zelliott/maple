Identification of the first lysophospholipid receptor, LPA1/Vzg-1, cloned by way of neurobiological analyses on the embryonic cerebral cortex, has led to the realization and demonstration that there exist multiple, homologous LP receptors, including those encoded by a number of orphan receptor genes known as "Edg," all of which are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors interact with apparent high affinity for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P or SPP), and are referred to based upon their functional identity as lysophospholipid receptors: LPA and LPB receptors, respectively, with the expectation that additional subgroups will be identified (i.e., LPC, etc.). Here an update is provided on insights gained from analyses of these receptor genes as they relate to the nervous system, particularly the cerebral cortex, and myelinating cells (oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells).
