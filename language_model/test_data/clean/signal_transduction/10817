The role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in epithelial malignancy is complex, but it is becoming clear that, in the early stages of carcinogenesis, the protein acts as a potent tumor suppressor, while later, TGF-beta can function to advance tumor progression. We review the evidence to show that the pro-oncogenic functions of TGF-beta are associated with (1) a partial loss of response to the ligand, (2) defects of components of the TGF-beta signal transduction pathway, (3) over-expression and/or activation of the latent complex, (4) epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and (5) recruitment of signaling pathways which act in concert with TGF-beta to facilitate the metastatic phenotype. These changes are viewed in the context of what is known about the pathogenesis of oral cancer and whether this knowledge can be translated into the development of new therapeutic modalities.
