We have used a c-Src-GFP fusion protein to address the spatial control of Src activation and the nature of Src-associated intracellular structures during stimulus-induced transit to the membrane. Src is activated during transit, particularly in RhoB-containing cytoplasmic endosomes associated with the perinuclear recycling compartment. Knocking out RhoB or expressing a dominant-interfering Rab11 mutant suppresses both catalytic activation of Src and translocation of active kinase to peripheral membrane structures. In addition, the Src- and RhoB-containing endosomes harbor proteins involved in actin polymerization and filament assembly, for example Scar1, and newly polymerized actin can associate with these endosomes in a Src-dependent manner. This implies that Src may regulate an endosome-associated actin nucleation activity. In keeping with this, Src controls the actin dependence of RhoB endosome movement toward the plasma membrane. This work identifies RhoB as a component of "outside-in" signaling pathways that coordinate Src activation with translocation to transmembrane receptors.
