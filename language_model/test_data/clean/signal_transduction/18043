In liver and kidney, the terminal step in gluconeogenesis is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase. To examine the effect of the cAMP signal transduction pathway on transcription of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), G6Pase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion genes were transiently transfected into either the liver-derived HepG2 or kidney-derived LLC-PK cell line. Co-transfection of an expression vector encoding the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) markedly stimulated G6Pase-CAT fusion gene expression, and mutational analysis of the G6Pase promoter revealed that multiple regions are required for this PKA response in both the HepG2 and LLC-PK cell lines. A sequence in the G6Pase promoter that resembles a cAMP response element is required for the full PKA response in both HepG2 and LLC-PK cells. However, in LLC-PK cells, but not in HepG2 cells, a hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1) binding site was critical for the full induction of G6Pase-CAT expression by PKA. Changing this HNF-1 motif to that for the yeast transcription factor GAL4 reduces the PKA response in LLC-PK cells to the same degree as deleting the HNF-1 site. However, co-transfection of this mutated construct with chimeric proteins comprising the GAL4-DNA binding domain ligated to the coding sequence for HNF-1alpha, HNF-1beta, HNF-3, or HNF-4 completely restored the PKA response. Thus, we hypothesize that, in LLC-PK cells, HNF-1 is acting as an accessory factor to enhance PKA signaling through the cAMP response element by altering G6Pase promoter conformation or accessibility rather than specifically affecting some component of the PKA signal transduction pathway.
