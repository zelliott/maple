Myosin heads interacting with actin filaments, a process fueled by MgATP and regulated by calcium, powers the pump-like action of the human heart. Hydrolysis of MgATP, the competition between MgATP, its products of hydrolysis, and actin for binding to myosin, and the sequence of shifting affinities in that competition, constitute the central mechanism of muscular contraction. The force, work, and power produced during the cardiac cycle stems from an isomerization of the myosin head that is closely associated with strong binding of myosin to actin and release of phosphate. While fluctuations of intracellular [Ca2+] bound to troponin and related shifts in tropomyosin on the thin filaments regulate the number of crossbridges on a beat-to-beat basis, the oscillatory work produced is augmented by a delayed force response to stretch that develops during diastole. This stretch-activated myogenic response is facilitated by specialized myofilament structures, including actin-binding portions of the myosin essential light chain and myosin binding protein C, which are thought to guide and orient the myosin head or enhance thin filament activation. Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain, myosin binding protein C, and troponin T also assist in this regard. Animal models show isoform shifts in myosin and other myofibrillar proteins have major effects on power output, but isoform shifts in human myocardium are modest at best and are therefore likely to play only a minor role in modulating crossbridge kinetics compared to disease-related post-translational modifications of the contractile proteins and to changes in their chemical environment.
