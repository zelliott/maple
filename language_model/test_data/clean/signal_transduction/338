In the last few years, the role of reactive oxygen species as signaling molecules has emerged, and not only as damage-related roles. Here, we analyzed how root hydraulic properties were modified by different hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations applied exogenously to the root medium. Two different experimental setups were employed: Phaseolus vulgaris plants growing in hydroponic or in potted soils. In both experimental setups, we found an increase of root hydraulic conductance (L) in response to H2O2 application for the first time. Twenty millimolar was the threshold concentration of H2O2 for observing an effect on L in the soil experiment, while in the hydroponic experiment, a positive effect on L was observed at 0.25 mM H2O2. In the hydroponic experiment, a correlation between increased L and plasma membrane aquaporin amount and their root localization was observed. These findings provide new insights to study how several environmental factors modify L.
