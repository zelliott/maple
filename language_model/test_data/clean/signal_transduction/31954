To get more understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying gastric cancer, 25 paired samples were applied to gene expression microarray analysis. Here, expression microarray, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis indicated that GPRC5A was significantly elevated in gastric cancer tissues. The integrative network analysis of deregulated genes generated eight subnetworks. We also mapped copy number variations (CNVs) and associated mRNA expression changes into pathways and identified WNT, RTK-Ras-PI3K-AKT, NF-ÎºB, and PLAU-JAK-STAT pathways involved in proliferation, evading apoptosis and sustained angiogenesis, respectively. Taken together, our results reveal several interesting genes including GPRC5A as potential biomarkers for gastric cancer, and highlight more systematical insight of deregulated genes in genetic pathways of gastric carcinogenesis.
