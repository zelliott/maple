The collagen X gene is expressed exclusively by differentiated, hypertrophic chondrocytes. The mechanisms controlling collagen X expression remain largely unknown. Here we show that collagen X promoter activity can be induced by serum stimulation of chondrogenic MCT cells. The serum response is conferred by a 462 nucleotide promoter fragment. Both the c-Raf/MEK/ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways are required for this effect, whereas phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase A repress promoter activation. These data are the first to demonstrate serum inducibility of the collagen X promoter and to identify signal transduction pathways involved.
