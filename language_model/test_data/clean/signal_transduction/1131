A number of proteins produced by certain bacteria and plants are potently toxic to mammalian cells. This toxicity results from their ability to catalytically modify macromolecules that are required for essential cellular functions such as vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly, signalling or protein synthesis. To reach their targets, these proteins bind specific surface receptors before endocytosis and translocation across an internal membrane. The surface receptors exploited by different toxins include a range of proteins and lipids. Here we focus on specific glycosphingolipid receptors and two well-characterised subsets of toxins that exploit them for surface binding, intracellular trafficking, and signalling events.
