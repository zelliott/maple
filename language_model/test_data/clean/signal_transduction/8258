Management of pain by opioid analgesics is confounded by central adverse effects that limit clinical dosages. Consequently, there is considerable interest to understand peripheral analgesic effects of opioids. The actions of opioids on peripheral sensory neurons have been difficult to study because of a general lack of effect of opioid agonists on nociceptor function in culture despite documented presence of opioid receptors. In this study, the micro-opioid receptor agonist, [D-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin (DAMGO), did not alter guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)-triphosphate (GTPgamma[(35)S]) binding, adenylyl cyclase activity, or neuropeptide release in primary cultures of rat trigeminal ganglion (TG). However, after brief exposure to bradykinin (BK), DAMGO stimulated GTPgamma[(35)S] binding and inhibited both prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2))-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and BK/PGE(2)-stimulated neuropeptide release. The effect of BK was blocked by the B(2) antagonist HOE 140 [D-Arg[Hyp(3),Thi(5),D-Tic(7),Oic(8)]-bradykinin], but not by the B(1) antagonist, Lys-[Leu8]des-Arg9-BK, and was mimicked by the protease-activated receptor-2 agonist, Ser-Leu-Ile-Gly-Arg-Leu-NH(2), and by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or by administration of arachidonic acid (AA). The enhanced responsiveness of micro-opioid receptor signaling by BK priming was blocked by both cyclooxygenase and PKC inhibitors; however, the effect of AA was blocked only by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. The results indicate that micro-opioid receptor signaling in primary sensory TG neurons is enhanced by activation of phospholipase C-coupled receptors via a cyclooxygenase-dependent AA metabolite that is downstream of PKC.
