We previously reported that a deficiency in prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) transduction during the early last larval instar of Bombyx mori plays a role in leading to very low ecdysteroid levels in the hemolymph, inactivation of corpora allata, as well as larval-pupal transformation. In the present study, the role of juvenile hormone (JH) in the regulation of PTTH transduction was clarified. When JH analog (hydroprene) was applied to early last instar larvae, the development of larvae was greatly inhibited. It was found that it was not PTTH release, but prothoracic gland competency in both cAMP generation and ecdysteroidogenesis to the stimulation of PTTH which was developmentally inhibited by hydroprene application. Glands in hydroprene-treated larvae showed no response in ecdysteroidogenesis to either PTTH or 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (MIX) until day 7, 4 days later than those of control larvae. JH-I application showed the same effects as those of hydroprene. By contrast, allatectomy on day 0 of the last instar accelerated development, and glands showed the activation response to either PTTH or MIX in both cAMP generation and ecdysteroidogenesis 1 day after allatectomy. From these results, we conclude that the absence of JH is a prerequisite for successful PTTH transduction and for acquisition of the cAMP generating system of gland cells.
