M1 mouse leukemia cells differentiate to macrophages/monocytes by the stimulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). To identify new LIF-induced genes, we have performed representational difference analysis using M1 cells and cloned mouse interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor beta subunit gene. The mRNA expression of both IL-3 receptor (IL-3R) alpha and beta subunits is upregulated after 1 h stimulation of LIF and remains to be elevated along the differentiation of M1 cells. This induction is almost completely suppressed in M1 cells expressing a dominant negative form of Stat3. Furthermore, we show that IL-3-induced Stat5 phosphorylation increases in LIF-stimulated M1 cells. These results suggest that Stat3 may play a role in the differentiation of myeloid cells by regulating IL-3R expression.
