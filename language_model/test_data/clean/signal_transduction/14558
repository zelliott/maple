Non-T cell activation linker (NTAL)/linker for activation of B cells (LAB), now officially termed LAT2 (linker for activation of T cells 2) is a 25-30kDa transmembrane adaptor protein (TRAP) associated with glycolipid-enriched membrane fractions (GEMs; lipid rafts) in specific cell types of hematopoietic lineage. Tyrosine phosphorylation of NTAL/LAB/LAT2 is induced by FcvarepsilonRI aggregation and Kit dimerization in mast cells, FcgammaRI aggregation in monocytes, and BCR aggregation in B cells. NTAL/LAB/LAT2 is also expressed in resting NK cells but, unlike the related TRAP, LAT, not in resting T cells. As demonstrated in monocytes and B cells, phosphorylated NTAL/LAB/LAT2 recruits signaling molecules such as Grb2, Gab1 and c-Cbl into receptor-signaling complexes. Although gene knock out and knock down studies have indicated that NTAL/LAB/LAT2 may function as both a positive and negative regulator of mast cell activation, its precise role in the activation of these and other hematopoietic cells remains enigmatic.
