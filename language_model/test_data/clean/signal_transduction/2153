We analyzed the melatonin signal transduction in human blood lymphocytes. High affinity melatonin receptors were identified by specific binding of 2-[125I]melatonin ([125I]MEL) to human lymphocyte membranes. Scatchard analysis of [125I]MEL binding revealed high affinity receptors, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.45 nM and a binding capacity (Bmax) of 7.8 fmol/mg protein. Specific [125I]MEL binding was reduced markedly by GTP and its nonhydrolyzable analogues guanosine 5'-beta, gamma-imidotriphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) and guanosine 5'-O-(3-triphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S). Gpp(NH)p inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the [125I]MEL specifically bound to human lymphocyte membranes with a half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of 3.5 +/- 0.6 microM Gpp(NH)p. Treatment of human lymphocyte membranes with Gpp(NH)p increased the Kd value (Kd = 1.20 nM). Melatonin inhibited significantly and in a dose-dependent manner forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in intact human lymphocytes. Melatonin was able to stimulate diacylglycerol production in a dose-dependent manner in human lymphocyte membranes. Pertussis toxin treatment inhibited the specific [125I]MEL binding and blocked the ability of melatonin to both inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production and stimulate diacylglycerol production. Pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation and Western blot experiments demonstrated the protein expression of alpha i1/2, alpha i3/0, and beta gamma complexes of G proteins in human lymphocyte membranes. The results strongly suggest a pertussis toxin-sensitive melatonin signal transduction pathway in human lymphocytes that involves the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and the stimulation of phospholipase C.
