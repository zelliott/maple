Teaching the practical aspects of signal transduction to large undergraduate classes can be challenging when there is only a finite time frame in which to engage in laboratory activities. This teaching resource describes the use of bead-based ALPHAscreen technology for a class of 300 second-year biochemistry students, exposing the next generation of researchers to cutting-edge technology. Although in this case phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 were measured, this technology is applicable to the measurement of many different signaling components. This resource provides a practical guide for instructors and exemplifies how such traditionally high-throughput research technologies can be used as teaching tools.
