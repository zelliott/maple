Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the industrialised countries and display significant gender-based differences. Estrogen plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart disease and is able to modulate the progression of cardiovascular disease. The focus on the beneficial influence of estrogen is gradually shifting from the vascular system to the myocardium. The presence of functional estrogen receptors in the myocardium has been demonstrated. Estrogen is important for cardiovascular baseline physiology and modulates the myocardial response under pathological conditions. Here we summarise the current knowledge of the regulatory network of estrogenic action in the myocardium and its effects on cardiovascular function.
