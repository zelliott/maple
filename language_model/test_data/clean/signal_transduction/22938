Analysis of axon guidance mechanisms in vertebrates, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster has led to the identification of several signaling pathways, many of which are strikingly conserved in function. Recent studies indicate that several axon guidance mechanisms are highly conserved in all animals, whereas others, though still conserved in a general sense, show strong evolutionary divergence at a detailed mechanistic level.
