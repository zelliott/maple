Thymocyte maturation is governed by antigen-T cell receptor (TCR) affinity and the extent of TCR aggregation. Signals provided by coactivating molecules such as CD4 and CD28 also influence the fate of immature thymocytes. The mechanism by which differences in antigen-TCR avidity encode unique maturational responses of lymphocytes and the influence of coactivating molecules on these signaling processes is not fully understood. To better understand the role of a key second messenger, calcium, in governing thymocyte maturation, we measured the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) response to changes in TCR avidity and costimulation. We found that TCR stimulation initiates either amplitude- or frequency-encoded [Ca2+]i changes depending on (a) the maturation state of stimulated thymocytes, (b) the avidity of TCR interactions, and (c) the participation of specific coactivating molecules. Calcium signaling within immature but not mature thymocytes could be modulated by the avidity of CD3/CD4 engagement. Low avidity interactions induced biphasic calcium responses, whereas high avidity engagement initiated oscillatory calcium changes. Notably, CD28 participation converted the calcium response to low avidity receptor engagement from a biphasic to oscillatory pattern. These data suggest that calcium plays a central role in encoding the nature of the TCR signal received by thymocytes and, consequently, a role in thymic selection.
