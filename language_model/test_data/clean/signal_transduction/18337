The stoichiometry of the binding of GTP to ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) proteins, normally quite low at approximately 0.05 mol/mol protein, was found to increase to a maximum of 1 mol/mol in the presence of effectors. The mechanism of this action was found to result from the ability of these effectors to increase the affinity of ARF for activating guanine nucleotide triphosphates. The existence of a conformation of ARF with low affinity (>100 micrometer) for GTP is proposed. The actions of effectors to increase the equilibrium binding of GTP is interpreted as evidence that these same effectors interact with and modulate the affinity of the inactive ARF for GTP. A new model for these interactions among ARF, effectors, and GTP is proposed, and a preliminary test in cells is supportive of these observations with relevance to signaling in cells.
