Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) are tetracyclic diterpenoid plant hormones that promote important processes of plant growth and development, such as seed germination, growth through elongation, and floral transition. Thus, mutant plants that are affected in GA biosynthesis or signalling exhibit altered seed germination and, at the adult stage, are dwarf and dark green and also show delayed flowering. The components of the GA metabolism and signalling pathways are reviewed here and recent findings regarding the regulation and possible mode of action of DELLA proteins are discussed.
