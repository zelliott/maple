To understand the mechanism of the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediated by the adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)R).

Primary cultured rat cortical neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and HEK293/A(1)R cells were treated with the A(1)R-specific agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA). Phospho-EGFR, Akt, and ERK1/2 were observed by Western blot. An interaction between EGFR and A(1)R was detected using immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry.

The A(1)R agonist CPA causes protein kinase B (Akt) activation and protects primary cortical neurons from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) insult. A(1)R and EGFR co-localize in the membranes of neurons and form an immunocomplex. A(1)R stimulation induces significant EGFR phosphorylation via a PI3K and Src kinase signaling pathway; this stimulation provides a neuroprotective effect in cortical neurons. CPA leads to sustained phosphorylation of extracellularly regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in cortical neurons, but only to transient phosphorylation in HEK 293/A(1)R cells. The response to the A(1)R agonist is mediated primarily through EGFR transactivation that is dependent on pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G(i) protein and metalloproteases in HEK 293/A(1)R.

A(1)R-mediated EGFR transactivation confers a neuroprotective effect in primary cortical neurons. PI3 kinase and Src kinase play pivotal roles in this response.Acta Pharmacologica Sinica (2009) 30: 889-898; doi: 10.1038/aps.2009.80.
