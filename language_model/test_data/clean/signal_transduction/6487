NogoA, a myelin-associated component, inhibits neurite outgrowth. Nogo66, a portion of NogoA, binds to Nogo66 receptor (NgR) and induces the inhibitory signaling. LINGO-1 and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75), the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor, are also required for NogoA signaling. However, signaling mechanisms downstream to Nogo receptor remain poorly understood. Here, we observed that NgR and p75 were colocalized in low-density membrane raft fractions derived from forebrains and cerebella as well as from cerebellar granule cells. NgR interacted with p75 in lipid rafts. In addition, disruption of lipid rafts by beta-methylcyclodextrin, a cholesterol-binding reagent, reduced the Nogo66 signaling. Our results suggest an important role of lipid rafts in facilitating the interaction between NgRs and provide insight into mechanisms underlying the inhibition of neurite outgrowth by NogoA.
