The respiratory burst is a distinguishing property of phagocytes. It is induced by chemotactic stimulation or phagocytosis and reflects the activation of a membrane-bound enzyme system that transfers electrons from cytosolic NADPH to extracellular oxygen, producing superoxide. The products of the burst are essential for the killing of microorganisms, but are also a cause of tissue damage and inflammation. Studies aimed at a better understanding of the regulation of the respiratory burst should help in the search for new ways to treat infections and inflammation.
