Microarray data were analyzed using bioinformatic tools to screen marker genes of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) in response to bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6).

A total of 190 differentially expressed genes were identified. The interaction network was divided into three functional modules. These genes were connected with BMP signaling pathways and regulation of cell processes, while NOG and BMPR2 participated in the transforming growth factor-beta signal pathway. Besides, several related small molecules were acquired.

Marker genes in osteogenic responses to BMP6 treatment for hMSC were screened with microarray data along with elaborate function analysis by bioinformatics. NOG and BMPR2 showed potential to become indicators to monitor the directed differentiation of hMSC into osteoblasts, which can be used for bone disease treatment. Moreover, small molecules such as W-13 were retrieved and provided directions for future drug design.
