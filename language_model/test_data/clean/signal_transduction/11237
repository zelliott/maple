Heme and non-heme Fe-NO complexes were observed in regard to the growth of primary and secondary solid tumors and ascites of murine L5178Y lymphoma. The complexes were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at liquid nitrogen temperature. Primary solid tumors and secondary solid tumors or ascites were inoculated on the same day, or with a delay. The primary tumor inhibited growth of the secondary solid tumor only if the latter was inoculated with a delay, which did not correlate with the change of the types, nor with the increase in the level of Fe-NO complexes detected in the tissue, suggesting a "non-immunological" character of this inhibition. In some animals with solid tumors, spontaneous ascites developed. This process resulted in a marked decrease in the level of Fe-NO complexes in the solid tumor tissue. The primary solid tumor, however, did not influence the growth of secondary ascites, but intensified NO generation in the ascites of animals with partial removal of ascitic fluid. This experimental group survived 2.2 days longer than the control group without primary solid tumor. Our research revealed that the presence of Fe-NO complexes in the interaction between primary and secondary tumor strongly depends on the form of the tumor: solid or ascitic, and that murine L5178Y lymphoma may serve as a convenient model for the research on "concomitant immunity" against in vivo growing tumors. This is the first EPR study on "concomitant immunity" in regard to tumor-tumor and tumor-ascites interactions in vivo.
