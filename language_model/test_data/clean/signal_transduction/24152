Cytotoxic T lymphocytes release granzymes (Gzm) A and B to induce apoptosis or programmed cell death of virally infected or tumor cells. In this issue of Cell, Fan et al. identify the tumor metastasis suppressor NM23-H1 as a GzmA-activated, apoptosis-inducing DNase and the oncoprotein SET as its inhibitor. Work from the Lieberman and Wang groups indicates a surprising role for a group of acidic nucleo-cytoplasmic proteins in regulating apoptosis.
