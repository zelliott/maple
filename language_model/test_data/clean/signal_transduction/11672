We report the effect of heat shock on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin 12 (IL-12) expression. The augmentation of LPS-induced IL-12 p40 mRNA and p70 protein was significantly suppressed in both peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 cells after heat shock at 43 degrees C. The binding activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) was reduced by prior heat shock. LPS did not induce degradation of the inhibitory protein I-kappa B alpha in the shocked cells, which might be a potential mechanism to block NF-kappa B activation. Furthermore, transient transfection assay in RAW264.7 cells demonstrated that LPS-induced activation of DM703 and DM138 (contains NF-kappa B motif) was highly sensitive to heat shock. These data suggest that heat shock influences expression of IL-12 through the I-kappa B/NF-kappa B pathway.
