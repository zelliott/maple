We have studied biochemical changes occurring in brain cell mitochondria of white rats on the background of stress induced by 30-day isolation and disruption of circadian rhythms. It was ascertained that due to long-lasting stress, there occurs activation of oxidative processes in mitochondria as well as inhibition of anti-oxidant system activity, causing development of energy deficiency in brain cells. The above-mentioned biochemical processes become the reason for activation and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), which, in its turn, signals the start of neuroapoptosis and various neurodegenerative processes.
