Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is the most frequent glomerular disease in children. The mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology have been investigated by genetic, cellular and molecular approaches. While genetic analyses have provided new insights into disease pathogenesis through the discovery of several podocyte genes mutated in distinct forms of inherited nephrotic syndrome, the molecular bases of minimal change nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis with relapse remain unclear. The immune system seems to play a critical role in the active phase of this disease through disturbances involving several cell subsets, mainly T cells. The innate immune system may also contribute to the immune disorders. In this review, we discuss recent insights from the molecular and immunological findings and their significance in the context of the clinical course of the disease.
