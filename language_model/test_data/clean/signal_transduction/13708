Sepsis and sepsis-associated organ failure are devastating conditions. Understanding the detailed cellular/molecular mechanisms involved in sepsis should lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used as a polymicrobial sepsis model in vivo to determine mortality and end-organ damage. Macrophages were adopted as the cellular model in vitro for mechanistic studies.

PTRF+/- mice survived longer and suffered less organ damage after CLP. Reductions in nitric oxide (NO) and iNOS biosynthesis were observed in plasma, macrophages, and vital organs in the PTRF+/- mice. Using an acute sepsis model after CLP, we found that iNOS-/- mice had a comparable level of survival as the PTRF+/- mice. Similarly, polymerase I transcript release factor (PTRF) deficiency resulted in decreased iNOS and NO/ROS production in macrophages in vitro. Mechanistically, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced the co-localization and interaction between PTRF and TLR4 in lipid rafts. Deletion of PTRF blocked formation of the TLR4/Myd88 complex after LPS. Consistent with this, lack of PTRF impaired the TLR4 signaling, as shown by the decreased p-JNK, p-ERK, and p-p38, which are upstream factors involved in iNOS transcription.

PTRF is a crucial regulator of TLR4 signaling in the development of sepsis.
