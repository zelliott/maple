The Tec kinases are required for full Ca(2+) mobilization in lymphocytes. Recent data suggest that this process occurs via a multiprotein complex that includes LAT and SLP-76 in T cells and BLNK/SLP-65 in B cells. Mutational analyses have revealed critical roles for Tec kinases in lymphocyte development and function.
