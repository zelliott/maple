Signal-transducing GTP-binding Proteins of Mammalian Heart and Lungs. Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology (1989) 21 (Suppl I) 91-95. Three distinct G-proteins have been found in mammalian heart sarcolemma: Gi (alpha i = 40 kDa, beta = 36 kDa, and lambda less than 14 kDa), Gp (alpha p = 23 kDa, beta = 36 kDa, and lambda less than 14 kDa), and Gs (alpha s = 42 kDa). ADP-ribosylation of sarcolemmal alpha i by pertussis toxin (PT) or preincubation of sarcolemma with protein kinase C and PMA resulted in increased adenylate cyclase activity and blockade of GTP-dependent inhibition by carbachol whereas the GTP-dependent activating effect of isoproterenol on the adenylate cyclase was preserved. ADP-ribosylation of alpha i in sarcolemma by endogenous NADP-sensitive ADP-ribosyltransferase abolished the PT-induced ADP-ribosylation of alpha i. Gpp (NH)p attenuated the PT-induced ADP-ribosylation of alpha i and promoted the cholera toxin (CT)-induced ADP-ribosylation of alpha s. The CT-induced alpha s ADP-ribosylation was enhanced in the presence of heart cytosol. Soluble Gi- and Gs-proteins were identified in lung cytosol. The 40 kDa alpha i in membrane and soluble fractions was ADP-ribosylated by PT, while the soluble 42 kDa alpha s was ADP-ribosylated by CT in lung tissue. The ADP-ribosylation of soluble alpha i by PT-suppressed guanyl nucleotide binding to Gi. The apparent molecular mass of partially purified soluble Gi was 75 kDa.
