Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is involved in the autocrine growth stimulation of normal and malignant cells, the stimulation of angiogenesis, and the recruitment and regulation of tumor fibroblasts. PDGF has been shown to physically interact with glycosaminoglycans which are abundant in the extracellular microenvironment. The present review discusses the effects of glycosaminoglycans on the functions mediated by the PDGF on cells of mesenchymal origin. Recent studies have demonstrated that both soluble and surface bound glycosaminoglycan chains can modulate PDGF-BB isoform signaling depending on the cell type. These data demonstrated that the microenvironment rich in GAGs/PGs is able to significantly modify the cellular response to PDGF-BB signaling in a critical way for cell growth and differentiation.
