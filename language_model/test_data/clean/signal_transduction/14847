Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, is emerging as a key contributor for endothelial dysfunction associated with inflammation. Statins can inhibit vascular inflammatory reaction and improve endothelial function. The aim of this study was to investigate in human endothelial cells the signaling pathways of ADMA-induced inflammatory reaction and potential inhibitory effects of simvastatin. Endothelial cells were cultured and used for all of the studies. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) was assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK(1/2)), were characterized by Western blot analysis. Treatment with ADMA (3-30 micromol/L) increased the concentration of sICAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner. ADMA (30 micromol/L) significantly enhanced the concentrations of TNF-alpha and sICAM-1, the activity of NF-kappaB and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK(1/2). The increased secretion of TNF-alpha and sICAM-1 and the increased activity of NF-kappaB by ADMA were altered by SB203580 (5 micromol/L) or PD98059 (20 micromol/L), but not by LY294002 (20 micromol/L). Simvastatin (0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 micromol/L) markedly inhibited the elevated concentrations of TNF-alpha and sICAM-1, the activity of NF-kappaB, and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK(1/2) induced by ADMA. Simvastatin inhibited ADMA-induced inflammatory reaction by p38 MAPK and ERK(1/2) pathways in cultured endothelial cells.
