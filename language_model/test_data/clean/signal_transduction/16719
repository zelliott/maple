Synapses between taste receptor cells and primary sensory afferent fibers transmit the output signal from taste buds to the central nervous system. The synaptic vesicle cycle at the synapses involves vesicle docking, priming, fusion, endocytosis, and recycling. Many kinds of synaptic vesicle proteins participate in synaptic vesicle cycles. One of these, synaptotagmin 1, binds Ca(2+) phospholipids with high affinity and plays a role in Ca(2+) regulated neurotransmitter release in the central and peripheral nervous systems. However, the expression patterns of synaptotagmin 1 in rat taste tissues have not been determined. We therefore examined the expression patterns of synaptotagmin 1 and several cell specific markers of type II and III cells in rat taste buds. RT-PCR assay showed that synaptotagmin 1 mRNA was expressed in circumvallate papillae. In fungiform, foliate, and circumvallate papillae, the antibody against synaptotagmin 1 yielded the labeling of a subset of taste bud cells and intra- and subgemmal nerve processes. Double labeled experiments showed that synaptotagmin 1 positive cells co-expressed type III cell markers, PGP 9.5, and NCAM. Intragemmal nerve processes positive for synaptotagmin 1 co-expressed PGP 9.5. Conversely, all synaptotagmin 1 expressing cells did not co-expressed type II cell markers, PLCbeta2, or gustducin. These results show that synaptotagmin 1 may play some regulatory roles in vesicle membrane fusion events with the plasma membrane at the synapses of type III cells in rat taste buds.
