Pathological shear stress induces platelet aggregation that is dependent on von Willebrand factor (VWF) binding to glycoprotein (Gp)Ib-IX-V and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation. We tested the hypothesis that pathological shear stress stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) synthesis by directing the assembly of a molecular signaling complex that includes class IA phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-KIA).

Platelets were subjected to 120 dynes cm-2 shear stress in a cone-plate viscometer. Resting and sheared platelets were lyzed, immunoprecipitations of PI 3-KIA performed, or lipids extracted for PIP3 measurements. alpha-Actinin was incubated with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), immunoprecipitated, and used as a substrate for in vitro PI 3-KIA activity.

Pathological shear stress induces biphasic PIP3 production. In resting platelets, PI 3-KIA associates with alpha-actinin and PIP2. After exposure to shear stress, alpha-actinin and PIP2 rapidly disassociate from PI 3-KIA. PI 3-KIA then gradually re-associates with PIP2 and alpha-actinin, and this complex becomes linked to GpIb alpha through the cytoskeleton. PIP3 production and the observed changes in the association between alpha-actinin, PIP2, and PI 3-KIA are inhibited when VWF binding to GpIb alpha is blocked. In a cell-free system, alpha-actinin binds PIP2 and when the alpha-actinin-PIP2 complex is added to platelet PI 3-KIA, PIP3 production is stimulated.

These results suggest that pathological shear-induced VWF binding to GpIb-IX-V stimulates PIP3 production through the assembly of an alpha-actinin-based complex that colocalizes PI 3-KIA with substrate PIP2.
