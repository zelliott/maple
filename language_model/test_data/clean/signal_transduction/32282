In this study, we evaluated the effects of obesity and insulin resistance  induced by a high-fat diet on prostate morphophysiology, focusing on cell  proliferation, expression of androgen (AR) and estrogen receptors (ER) and  proteins of the insulin signaling pathway. Adult male Wistar rats were fed a  high-fat diet (20% fat) for 15 weeks, whereas control animals received a  balanced diet (4% fat). Both groups were then divided and treated for 2 weeks  with 1 mg/kg body weight/day of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole or vehicle  only. The ventral prostate was analyzed with immunohistochemical,  histopathological, stereological, and Western blotting methods. Obese rats  showed insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and reduced plasma testosterone  levels. The incidence of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) was 2.7  times higher in obese rats and affected 0.4% of the gland compared with 0.1%  PIN areas found in control rats. Obesity doubled cell proliferation in both  prostate epithelium and stroma. AR content decreased in the prostate of obese  rats and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) increased in this group. Protein  levels of insulin receptor substrate 1 and protein kinase B diminished in the  obese group, whereas phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) increased  significantly. Most structural changes observed in the prostate of obese rats  normalized after letrozole treatment, except for increased stromal cell  proliferation and ERβ expression, which might be associated with insulin  resistance. This experimental model of obesity and insulin resistance induced  by a high-fat diet increases cell proliferation in rat prostate. Such  alterations are associated with decreased levels of AR and increased ERβ  and PI3K proteins. This change can facilitate the establishment of  proliferative lesions in rat prostate.
