Fat-specific protein 27 (fsp27) was originally isolated by screening for genes specifically expressed in fully differentiated mouse adipocytes. Fsp27 and cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector (CIDE) C, the human homologue of fsp27, belong to the CIDE family. Fsp27, which is highly expressed in mouse white and brown adipose tissues, was recently reported to be a lipid droplet (LD)-binding protein that promotes lipid accumulation in adipocytes. In contrast, we showed that fsp27 was also expressed in the fatty liver of the ob/ob type II diabetes model mouse. The expression of fsp27 was markedly decreased in livers lacking the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ(PPARγ). A functional PPAR response element site was identified in the fsp27 promoter region. Forced expression of fsp27 in hepatocytes in vitro or in vivo led to increased LD through increased triglyceride levels. The current status of the physiological roles of the PPARγ-fsp27 signal in fatty liver are discussed along with its significance as a factor involved in the development of metabolic disorders.
