Many receptors on diverse cell types activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). The lipid products of PI3K, termed 3-phosphoinositides, regulate numerous cellular processes by recruiting specific proteins to membrane signaling complexes. In the B lymphocyte lineage, PI3K activation is a critical control point at various stages of development, proliferation and differentiation. PI3K signaling is promoted by stimulatory receptors such as surface immunoglobulin, CD40, Toll-like receptors and cytokine receptors, and opposed by the inhibitory receptor FcgammaRIIB1. Genetic dissection of the PI3K pathway in mice has indicated that certain B cell functions are regulated by a limited set of PI3K isoforms and downstream effectors. Here we review our current understanding of how signals are relayed to and from PI3K in B cells.
