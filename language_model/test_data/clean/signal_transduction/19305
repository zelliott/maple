To observe the effects of panax quinquefolius saponin (PQS) of stem and leaf on glucose-lipid metabolism and insulin signal transduction in the insulin resistant model of adipocytes.

The insulin resistant model of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes was established in vitro with free fatty acid. After induction of insulin resistance, cells were treated with metformin or PQS for 2 days. The glucose consumption in culture fluid was detected by glucose oxidase method; the effects of PQS on the lipolysis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) was observed using colorimetry; and the phospholation of signal proteins was detected by Western-blot.

The amount of glucose consumption (mmol/L) in the model group (5.250 +/- 2. 671) was significantly lower than that in the normal control group (14.133 +/- 1.305, P < 0.01), it increased in the meformin treated group (11.807 +/- 1.358), and the groups treated with high-, middle- and low-dose PQS dose-dependently (10.784 +/- 2.373, 10.217 +/- 1.237 and 9.984 +/- 2.006, respectively), significantly higher than that in the model group (P < 0.01). Upon TNF-alpha treatment, the concentration of free fatty acid (FFA) (nmol/ microg) in culture medium was 2.479 +/- 0.597, predominantly higher than that in the control group (1.320 +/- 0.538, P < 0.01), while it was 1.210 +/- 0.566 in the metformin group, 1.105 +/- 0.631 in high-dose PQS group, 1.108 +/- 0.260 in the middle-dose PQS group, 1.201 +/- 0.593 in the low-dose PQS group, all were lower than that in the TNF-alpha group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), and a dose-dependent tendency of PQS's action was seen. The tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor and IRS-1 as well as Ser473 phosphorylation of PKB were lower in the model group than in the control group; they were insignificantly changed in the low-dose PQS group, but did show significant difference in comparing with those in the high-and middle-dose PQS groups or metformin group.

PQS can accelerate the glucose utilization and depress the lipolysis in adipocytes induced by TNF-alpha, which may be correlated with its promoting insulin signal transduction and improving insulin resistance in adipocytes.
