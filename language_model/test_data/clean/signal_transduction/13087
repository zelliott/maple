The importance of Bax for induction of tumor apoptosis through death receptors remains unclear. Here we show that Bax can be essential for death receptor--mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. Bax-deficient human colon carcinoma cells were resistant to death-receptor ligands, whereas Bax-expressing sister clones were sensitive. Bax was dispensable for apical death-receptor signaling events including caspase-8 activation, but crucial for mitochondrial changes and downstream caspase activation. Treatment of colon tumor cells deficient in DNA mismatch repair with the death-receptor ligand apo2 ligand (Apo2L)/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) selected in vitro or in vivo for refractory subclones with Bax frameshift mutations including deletions at a novel site. Chemotherapeutic agents upregulated expression of the Apo2L/TRAIL receptor DR5 and the Bax homolog Bak in Baxminus sign/minus sign cells, and restored Apo2L/TRAIL sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, Bax mutation in mismatch repair--deficient tumors can cause resistance to death receptor--targeted therapy, but pre-exposure to chemotherapy rescues tumor sensitivity.
