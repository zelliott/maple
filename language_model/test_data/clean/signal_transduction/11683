Transmigration of monocytes to the subendothelial space is the initial step in atherosclerotic plaque formation and inflammation. Integrin activation and chemotaxis are two important functions in monocyte transmigration. To delineate the signaling cascades leading to integrin activation and chemotaxis by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), we investigated the roles of MAPK in THP-1 cells, a monocytic cell line. MCP-1 stimulated beta1 integrin-dependent, but not beta2 integrin-dependent cell adhesion in a time-dependent manner. MCP-1-mediated cell adhesion was inhibited by a MEK inhibitor, but not by a p38-MAPK inhibitor. By contrast, MCP-1-mediated chemotaxis was inhibited by the p38-MAPK inhibitor, but not by the MEK inhibitor. These data indicate that ERK is responsible for integrin activation and that p38-MAPK is responsible for chemotaxis mediated by MCP-1. This study demonstrates that two distinct MAPKs regulate two dependent signaling cascades, leading to integrin activation and chemotaxis induced by MCP-1 in THP-1 cells.
