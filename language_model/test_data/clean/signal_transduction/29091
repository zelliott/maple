The formation of a complex between Rac1 and the cytoplasmic domain of plexin-B1 is one of the first documented cases of a direct interaction between a small guanosine 5'-triphosphatase (GTPase) and a transmembrane receptor. Structural studies have begun to elucidate the role of this interaction for the signal transduction mechanism of plexins. Mapping of the Rac1 GTPase surface that contacts the Rho GTPase binding domain of plexin-B1 by solution NMR spectroscopy confirms the plexin domain as a GTPase effector protein. Regions neighboring the GTPase switch I and II regions are also involved in the interaction and there is considerable interest to examine the changes in protein dynamics that take place upon complex formation. Here we present main-chain nitrogen-15 relaxation measurements for the unbound proteins as well as for the Rho GTPase binding domain and Rac1 proteins in their complexed state. Derived order parameters, S2, show that considerable motions are maintained in the bound state of plexin. In fact, some of the changes in S2 on binding appear compensatory, exhibiting decreased as well as increased dynamics. Fluctuations in Rac1, already a largely rigid protein on the picosecond-nanosecond timescale, are overall diminished, but isomerization dynamics in the switch I and II regions of the GTPase are retained in the complex and appear to be propagated to the bound plexin domain. Remarkably, fluctuations in the GTPase are attenuated at sites, including helices alpha6 (the Rho-specific insert helix), alpha7 and alpha8, that are spatially distant from the interaction region with plexin. This effect of binding on long-range dynamics appears to be communicated by hinge sites and by subtle conformational changes in the protein. Similar to recent studies on other systems, we suggest that dynamical protein features are affected by allosteric mechanisms. Altered protein fluctuations are likely to prime the Rho GTPase-plexin complex for interactions with additional binding partners.
