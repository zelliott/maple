Cell adhesion and migration is largely dependent on integrin binding to extracellular matrix, and several signalling pathways involved in these processes have been shown to be modified by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In fact, integrin activation is linked to increased ROS production by NADPH-oxidases, 5-lipoxygenase, and release from mitochondria. Cell migration is intimately linked to degradation of the extracellular matrix, and activated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a prerequisite for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In this minireview, we focus on the interplay between integrin-mediated ROS production and MMP expression as well as its biological and pathobiological significance.
