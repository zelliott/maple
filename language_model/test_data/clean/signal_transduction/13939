Neurotrophic signaling is an important factor in the survival of developing neurons, and the expression of neurotrophic receptors correlates with prognosis in neuroblastoma. Kinase D-interacting substrate of 220â€‰kDa (Kidins220) associates with neurotrophic receptors and stabilizes them, but the expression and function of Kidins220 in neuroblastoma are unknown.

We study Kidins220 expression in human neuroblastoma cell lines and tumor samples by western blotting and microarray analyses. We determine the functional consequences of downregulation of Kidins220 for response of cell lines to oxidative stress, chemotherapeutic treatment, and neurotrophins using small interfering RNA silencing and by measuring cell survival, signaling, and migration.

Kidins220 is expressed in all neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines studied. Downregulation of Kidins220 leads to attenuation of nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced, but not brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced, MAPK signaling. However, downregulation of Kidins220 does not alter the response to chemotherapeutic drugs or oxidative stress or affect cellular motility.

Kidins220 is expressed in neuroblastoma tumors and stabilizes NGF-induced, but not BDNF-induced, survival signaling in neuroblastoma cell lines.
