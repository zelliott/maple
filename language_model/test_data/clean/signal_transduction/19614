The vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is considered as a potent chemotherapeutic drug for its capability of regulating cell growth and differentiation. We aimed to study the effect of ATRA on MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231, human breast cancer cells and the probable molecular mechanisms through which ATRA exerts its effect.

Our experimental findings demonstrate that ATRA enters into the nucleus and regulates various signaling pathways viz. Integrin, FAK, ERK, PI-3K, NF-ÎºB and also EGFR and down regulates pro-MMP-9 activity as well as its expression. As a result MDA-MB-231 cell migration on fibronectin medium gets retarded in presence of ATRA. ATRA up regulates TIMP-1 expression. Our study may help to understand the role of ATRA as a regulator of MMP-9 and the possible signaling pathways which are involved in this ATRA mediated down regulation of MMP-9.
