Angiotensins and kinins are endogenous peptides with diverse biological actions; as such, they represent current and future targets of therapeutic intervention. The field of angiotensin biology has changed significantly over the last 50 years. Our original understanding of the crucial role of angiotensin II in the regulation of vascular tone and electrolyte homeostasis has been expanded to include the discovery of new angiotensins, their important role in cardiovascular inflammation and the development of clinically useful synthesis inhibitors and receptor antagonists. While less applied progress has been achieved in the kinin field, there are continuous discoveries in bradykinin physiology and in the complexity of kinin interactions with other proteins. The present review focuses on mechanisms and interactions of angiotensins and kinins that deal specifically with vascular endothelium.
