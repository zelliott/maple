Bacterial chemotaxis is mediated by transmembrane receptors that bind attractant and repellent chemicals and control an intracellular protein kinase. Each cell contains thousands of receptor subunits that form a tightly packed array at one pole. Recent studies of bacterial behavior have begun to reveal the molecular logic of this sensory architecture.
