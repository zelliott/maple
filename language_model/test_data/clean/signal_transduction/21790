The durability of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in the mammalian lens makes this enzyme system a potential contributor to certain cataracts and posterior capsular opacification (PCO). The present study addresses proteasome involvement in TGF-beta induced, cataract-associated gene activation in human lens cells.

HLE B-3 cells were treated with TGF-beta, in combination with the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 or lactacystin. TGF-beta target gene expression was measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Annexin-FITC staining and flow cytometry were used to assess apoptosis levels. Western blot analyses were performed with anti-SnoN and anti-Smad2 antibodies.

TGF-beta induced the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, and TGF-beta-inducible gene mRNA in HLE B-3 cells and primary cultured human lens cells from donor tissues. TGF-beta also induced a time-dependent decrease in the level of the Smad repressor SnoN. Gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) mRNA levels decreased in the presence of TGF-beta. Proteasome inhibitor cotreatment blocked the induction of alpha-SMA mRNA, the loss of SnoN protein, the decrease in gamma-GCS mRNA, and TGF-beta-induced apoptosis.

The HLE B-3 cell line and primary cultured human lens cells respond similarly to TGF-beta treatments by activating cataract-related gene expression. This response in both of these model systems is blocked by inhibiting the proteasome. This suggests that the proteasome can mediate cataract and PCO-associated changes and therefore is a novel target of medical therapy.
