The mouse fibroblast cell line LZR-1 is a well-established test system used to characterize the intrinsic activity of dopamine D2-receptor ligands (Neve et al., Mol. Pharmac., 1989). This cell line is transfected with a eucaryotic expression vector containing the gene of the rat dopamine D2B-receptor (short isoform of the D2-receptor) (Bunzow et al., Nature, 1988). In addition to the expression of high levels of the rat dopamine D2-receptor, these mouse cells also express sigma binding sites. Binding affinities of BMY 14,802, DTG, haloperidol, (+)-pentazocine, (+)-3-PPP, and (+)-SKF 10,047 for the sigma binding sites as well as for the D2-dopamine receptor in membranes of LZR-1 cells were determined. Using intact LZR-1 cells, it was found that the influence of sigma ligands on signalling via the dopamine D2-receptor can be explained by their affinity for the latter receptor. Specific sigma ligands did not influence dopaminergic signal transduction in LZR-1 cells. It is therefore concluded that the LZR-1 cell is a suitable test model for determination of the intrinsic activity of dopamine D2-receptor ligands even if these compounds have affinity for sigma binding sites.
