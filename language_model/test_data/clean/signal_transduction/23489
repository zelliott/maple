The small Rho GTPase family of proteins, encompassing the three major G-protein classes Rho, Rac and cell division control protein 42, are key mitogenic signaling molecules that regulate multiple cancer-associated cellular phenotypes including cell proliferation and motility. These proteins are known for their role in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, which is achieved through modulating the activity of their downstream effector molecules. The Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 1 and 2 (ROCK1 and ROCK2) proteins were the first discovered Rho effectors that were primarily established as players in RhoA-mediated stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly. It has since been discovered that the ROCK kinases actively phosphorylate a large cohort of actin-binding proteins and intermediate filament proteins to modulate their functions. It is well established that global cellular morphology, as modulated by the three cytoskeletal networks: actin filaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules, is regulated by a variety of accessory proteins whose activities are dependent on their phosphorylation by the Rho-kinases. As a consequence, they regulate many key cellular functions associated with malignancy, including cell proliferation, motility and viability. In this current review, we focus on the role of the ROCK-signaling pathways in disease including cancer.
