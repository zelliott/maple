Changes in cellular gene transcription patterns induced by extracellular signals are thought to be important for many biological processes, including the control of cell growth. The transmission of gene regulatory signals through the cytoplasm is mediated by signaling pathways, of which protein kinases are important components, and recent evidence suggests that communication between the cytoplasm and nucleus relies on signal-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of transcription factors. This new information is reviewed and the implications for gene regulation and the control of cell growth are discussed.
