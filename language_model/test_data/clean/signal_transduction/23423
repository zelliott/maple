A prostacyclin analogue, ONO-1301, is reported to upregulate beneficial proteins, including stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1). We hypothesized that the sustained-release delivery of ONO-1301 would enhance SDF-1 expression in the acute myocardial infarction (MI) heart and induce bone marrow cells (BMCs) to home to the myocardium, leading to improved cardiac function in mice.

ONO-1301 significantly upregulated SDF-1 secretion by fibroblasts. BMC migration was greater to ONO-1301-stimulated than unstimulated conditioned medium. This increase was diminished by treating the BMCs with a CXCR4-neutralizing antibody or CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100). Atelocollagen sheets containing a sustained-release form of ONO-1301 (n = 33) or ONO-1301-free vehicle (n = 48) were implanted on the left ventricular (LV) anterior wall immediately after permanent left-anterior descending artery occlusion in C57BL6/N mice (male, 8-weeks-old). The SDF-1 expression in the infarct border zone was significantly elevated for 1 month in the ONO-1301-treated group. BMC accumulation in the infarcted hearts, detected by in vivo imaging after intravenous injection of labeled BMCs, was enhanced in the ONO-1301-treated hearts. This increase was inhibited by AMD3100. The accumulated BMCs differentiated into capillary structures. The survival rates and cardiac function were significantly improved in the ONO-1301-treated group (fractional area change 23±1%; n = 22) compared to the vehicle group (19±1%; n = 20; P = 0.004). LV anterior wall thinning, expansion of infarction, and fibrosis were lower in the ONO-1301-treated group.

Sustained-release delivery of ONO-1301 promoted BMC recruitment to the acute MI heart via SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling and restored cardiac performance, suggesting a novel mechanism for ONO-1301-mediated acute-MI heart repair.
