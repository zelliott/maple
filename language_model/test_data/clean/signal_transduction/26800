Reactive arthritis (ReA) is a sterile joint inflammation triggered by a remote infection and associated with human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B27. Its pathogenesis is unknown, but abnormal response to microbial structures or endogenous inflammatory mediators may be involved. We studied responses in leucocyte signalling profiles in patients with previous ReA after a full recovery.

The study comprised 10 HLA-B27-positive healthy subjects with a history of Yersinia enterocolitica-triggered ReA (B27+ReA+) and 20 healthy reference subjects, of whom 10 carried HLA-B27 (B27+ReA-) and 10 did not (B27-ReA-). Phosphospecific fluorescent monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry were used to determine activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) 1, 3, 5, and 6, and two mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, in monocytes, lymphocytes, lymphocyte subsets, and neutrophils. B27+ReA+ and B27-ReA- whole-blood samples were incubated with Yersinia with or without infliximab to study the role of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in lymphocyte subset activation. Samples of the three subject groups were studied using soluble bacterial or endogenous stimuli. Fluorescence levels were determined as relative fluorescence units (RFU) and the proportion of positively fluorescing cells.

The intracellular activation of circulating leucocytes in response to soluble stimuli was consistently comparable in B27+ReA+, B27+ReA-, and B27-ReA- subjects. Infliximab inhibited Yersinia-induced lymphocyte NF-κB phosphorylation similarly in B27+ReA+ and B27-ReA- groups.

ReA susceptibility is not reflected in leucocyte signalling profiles elicited by phlogistic stimuli. However, the possibility remains that aberrations occur in response to combinations of stimuli, such as those associated with leucocyte adhesion.
