Pollen tube growth is a key step in sexual reproduction of higher plants. The pollen tube is a typical example of tip-growing cells and shows a polarized cytoplasm. To develop and maintain polarized growth, pollen tubes need a carefully regulated actin cytoskeleton. It is well known that actin-binding proteins are responsible for the direct control of dynamic actin filaments and serve as a link between signal transduction pathways and dynamic actin changes in determining cellular architecture. Several of these classes have been identified in pollen tubes and their detailed characterisation is progressing rapidly. Here, we aim to survey what is known about the major actin-binding proteins that affect actin assembly and dynamics, and their higher-order organisation in pollen tube growth.
