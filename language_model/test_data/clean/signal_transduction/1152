The goal of this study was to elucidate the relationships between early ligand binding/receptor processing events and cellular responses for the N-formyl peptide receptor system on human neutrophils as a model of a GPCR system in a physiologically relevant context. Binding kinetics of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-phenylalanyl-lysine-fluorescein and N-formyl-valyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-lysine-fluorescein to the N-formyl peptide receptor on human neutrophils were characterized and combined with previously published binding data for four other ligands. Binding was best fit by an interconverting two-receptor state model that included a low affinity receptor state that converted to a high affinity state. Response behaviors elicited at 37 degrees C by the six different agonists for the N-formyl peptide receptor were measured. Dose response curves for oxidant production, actin polymerization, and G-protein activation were obtained for each ligand; whereas all ligands showed equal efficacy for all three responses, the ED(50) values varied as much as 7000-fold. The level of agonism and rank order of potencies of ligands for actin and oxidant responses were the same as for the G-protein activation assay, suggesting that the differences in abilities of ligands to mediate responses were determined upstream of G-protein activation at the level of ligand-receptor interactions. The rate constants governing ligand binding and receptor affinity conversion were ligand-dependent. Analysis of the forward and reverse rate constants governing binding to the proposed signaling receptor state showed that it was of a similar energy for all six ligands, suggesting the hypothesis that ligand efficacy is dictated by the energy state of this ligand-receptor complex. However, the interconverting two-receptor state model was not sufficient to predict response potency, suggesting the presence of receptor states not discriminated by the binding data.
