A better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern leukocyte trafficking is of major relevance for the clinics. Both normal and pathologic extravasation of lymphocytes are a fine-tuned spatio-temporal event of migratory path-finding likely regulated by molecular guidance cues underlying cell movements in other systems. We have recently reported that members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases, namely EphA2 and one of its ligands, ephrin-A4 (EFNA4) can mediate in the traffic of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and presumably of normal B cells between the blood and the tissues. The importance of EphA2-EFNA4 interactions at the endothelium-lymphocyte interface during TEM could rely on their attractive/repulsive properties. In the present work, we expand on those results by including additional insights and new suggestions for future studies that discuss the relevance of these molecules in overall cell adhesion dynamic events.
