To test the hypothesis that creatine supplementation would enhance the anabolic responses of muscle cell signaling and gene expression to exercise, we studied nine subjects who received either creatine or a placebo (maltodextrin) for 5 days in a double-blind fashion before undergoing muscle biopsies: at rest, immediately after exercise (10 x 10 repetitions of one-leg extension at 80% 1 repetition maximum), and 24 and 72 h later (all in the morning after fasting overnight). Creatine supplementation decreased the phosphorylation state of protein kinase B (PKB) on Thr308 at rest by 60% (P < 0.05) and that of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein on Thr37/46 (4E-BP1) by 30% 24 h postexercise (P < 0.05). Creatine increased mRNA for collagen 1 (alpha(1)), glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4), and myosin heavy chain I at rest by 250%, 45%, and 80%, respectively, and myosin heavy chain IIA (MHCIIA) mRNA immediately after exercise by 70% (all P < 0.05). Immediately after exercise, and independent of creatine, mRNA for muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx), MHCIIA, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha, and interleukin-6 were upregulated (60-350%; P < 0.05); the phosphorylation state of p38 both in the sarcoplasm and nucleus were increased (12- and 25-fold, respectively; both P < 0.05). Concurrently, the phosphorylation states of PKB (Thr308) and 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) were decreased by 50% and 75%, respectively (P < 0.05). Twenty-four hours postexercise, MAFbx, myostatin, and GLUT-4 mRNA expression decreased below preexercise values (-35 to -50%; P < 0.05); calpain 1 mRNA increased 70% 72 h postexercise (P < 0.05) and at no other time. In conclusion, 5 days of creatine supplementation do not enhance anabolic signaling but increase the expression of certain targeted genes.
