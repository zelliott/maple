A major goal of gene therapy is to improve target specificity by delivering vectors through alternative cellular receptors. We previously reported that adenoviral vector delivery through basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) receptors enhances both cellular transduction and in vivo efficacy. We now present studies addressing the cellular pathways and mechanisms underlying these events. Cellular receptors for adenoviruses are not required for transduction by FGF2-retargeted vectors. Moreover, alpha(V) integrins can antagonize FGF2 retargeting, in contrast to their obligatory role in non-retargeted vector delivery. By contrast, high-affinity FGF receptors, which are overexpressed on potential tumor targets, are required for FGF2-retargeted transduction. Low-affinity heparan sulfate proteoglycan interactions, however, are not a prerequisite, in marked contrast to their obligatory role in FGF2 mitogenic signaling. By comparing receptor expression and ligand binding with transgene expression, we also demonstrate that FGF2 retargeting enhances transduction by mechanisms other than increasing the number of targeted cells. Rather, the use of alternative targeting ligands supports the conclusion that specific receptor interactions and intracellular events serve to enhance transgene expression. Together, these studies highlight the unique delivery and transduction pathways used by FGF2-retargeted adenoviruses, and help define the basis for their enhanced in vivo efficacy.
