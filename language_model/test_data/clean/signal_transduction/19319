Functional comparative genomic analysis of the cellular immunological effects of different anti-inflammatory phytocompounds is considered as a helpful approach to distinguish the complex and specific bioactivities of candidate phytomedicines. Using LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocytes, we characterize here the immunomodulatory activities of three single phytocompounds (emodin, shikonin, and cytopiloyne) and a defined phytocompound mixture extracted from Echinacea plant (BF/S+L/Ep) by focused DNA microarray analysis of selected immune-related genes.

Shikonin and emodin significantly inhibited the early expression (within 0.5 h) of approximately 50 genes, notably cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-4, chemokines CCL4 and CCL8, and inflammatory modulators NFATC3 and PTGS2. In contrast, neither cytopiloyne nor BF/S+L/Ep inhibited the early expression of these 50 genes, but rather inhibited most late-stage expression (~12 h) of another immune gene subset. TRANSPATH database key node analysis identified the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation pathway as the putative target of BF/S+L/Ep and cytopiloyne. Western blot confirmed that delayed inactivation of the ERK pathway was indeed demonstrable for these two preparations during the mid-stage (1 to 4 h) of LPS stimulation. We further identified ubiquitin pathway regulators, E6-AP and Rad23A, as possible key regulators for emodin and shikonin, respectively.

The current focused DNA microarray approach rapidly identified important subgenomic differences in the pattern of immune cell-related gene expression in response to specific anti-inflammatory phytocompounds. These molecular targets and deduced networks may be employed as a guide for classifying, monitoring and manipulating the molecular and immunological specificities of different anti-inflammatory phytocompounds in key immune cell systems and for potential pharmacological application.
