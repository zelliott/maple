Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 contribute to the pathogenesis of polymicrobial sepsis. These TLRs signal via the common myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathways. TLR4 also signals through MyD88-independent but TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-Î²-mediated transcription factor (Trif)-dependent pathway. The role of the two signaling pathways in cardiac dysfunction during polymicrobial sepsis and endotoxin shock is unknown.

Sepsis was generated by cecum ligation and puncture. Mice were divided into sham and cecum ligation and puncture groups or subjected to saline or endotoxin. Left ventricular function was assessed in a Langendorff apparatus or by echocardiography. Cytokines were examined using a multiplex immunoassay. Neutrophil migratory and phagocytic functions were assessed using flow cytometry.

In comparison with wild-type mice, MyD88(-/-) but not Trif(-/-) mice had markedly improved cardiac function and survival after cecum ligation and puncture. In comparison, both MyD88(-/-) and Trif(-/-) mice were protected from cardiac depression and mortality during endotoxin shock. Septic MyD88(-/-) but not Trif(-/-) mice had diminished cytokine production in serum and in peritoneal space in comparison with wild-type mice after cecum ligation and puncture. In contrast, both MyD88(-/-) and Trif(-/-) mice had attenuated serum cytokines in comparison with wild-type mice after endotoxin challenge. Neither MyD88(-/-) nor Trif(-/-) signaling had any effect on neutrophil phagocytic function or bacterial clearance at 24 h of polymicrobial sepsis.

These studies establish that MyD88 but not Trif signaling plays a critical role in mediating cardiac dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and mortality during polymicrobial sepsis. Both MyD88 and Trif are essential for cardiac depression and mortality during endotoxin shock.
