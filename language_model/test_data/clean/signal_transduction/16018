H2O2 generation by dual oxidase (DUOX) at the apex of thyroid cells is the limiting factor in the oxidation of iodide and the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Its characteristics have been investigated using different in vitro models, from the most physiological thyroid slices to the particulate fraction isolated from transfected DUOX expressing CHO cells. Comparison of the models shows that some positive controls are thyroid specific (TSH) or require the substructure of the in vivo cells (MβCD). Other controls apply to all intact cell models such as the stimulation of the PIP(2) phospholipase C pathway by ATP acting on purinergic receptors, the activation of the Gq protein downstream (NaF), or surrogates of the intracellular signals generated by this cascade (phorbol esters for protein kinase C, Ca(++) ionophore for Ca(++)). Still, other controls, exerted by intracellular Ca(++) or its substitute Mn(++), the intracellular pH, or arachidonate bear directly on the enzyme. Iodide acts at the apical membrane of the cell through an oxidized form, presumably iodohexadecanal. Cooling of the cells to 22°C blocks the activation of the PIP(2) phospholipase C cascade. All these effects are reversible. Their kinetics and concentration-effect characteristics have been defined in the four models. A general scheme of the thyroid signaling pathways regulating this metabolism is proposed. The probes characterized could be applied to other H2O2 producing cells and to pathological material.
