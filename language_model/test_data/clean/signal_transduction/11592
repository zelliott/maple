The pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, contribute to the exacerbation of pathophysiological conditions in the lung. The regulation of cytokines involves the reduction-oxidation (redox)-sensitive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), the activation of which is mediated through an upstream kinase that regulates the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of inhibitory-kappaB (IkappaB)-alpha, the major cytosolic inhibitor of NF-kappaB. It was hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced biosynthesis of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in vitro is tightly regulated by redox equilibrium. Furthermore, the likely involvement of the IkappaB-alpha/NF-kappaB signalling transduction pathway in mediating redox-dependent regulation of LPS-induced cytokine biosynthesis was revealed. Using alveolar epithelial cells, the role of L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), a specific and irreversible inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH - an antioxidant thiol) biosynthesis, in regulating LPS-mediated TNF-alpha and IL-6 production and the IkappaB-alpha/NF-kappaB signalling pathway was investigated. Pre-treatment with BSO, prior to exposure to LPS augmented, in a dose-dependent manner, LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 biosynthesis, an effect associated with the induction of intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, BSO blocked the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha, reduced its degradation, thereby allowing its cytosolic accumulation, and subsequently inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB. These results indicate that there are ROS and redox-mediated effects regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, and that the IkappaB-alpha/NF-kappaB pathway is redox-sensitive and differentially involved in mediating redox-dependent regulation of cytokine signaling.
