A murine modification of the Matrigel chamber assay originally developed for use on rats is presented. This modified assay permits improved quantification due to subcutaneous Matrigel implants of constant shape and volume. We have quantitatively assessed the angiogenic potential of the growth factors basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), VEGF, and Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) with special emphasis on their mutual interactions. A reproducible dose-response relationship for bFGF was established for doses between 150 and 1000 ng per chamber, whereas VEGF did not display angiogenic activity on its own in the tested dose of up to 200 ng per chamber. Conversely, we found a strong synergistic action of bFGF and VEGF when combined in a 3:1 ratio. Two other combinations (ratios) with greater VEGF doses were also tested, but the synergistic effect was only observed when 50 ng of VEGF was added to 150 ng per chamber of bFGF. This synergistic effect of bFGF and VEGF was significantly reduced by further addition of 100 ng Angiopoietin-2. Inhibition of the response to bFGF and VEGF was confirmed by in vitro EC migration experiments, which, together with our in vivo results, indicates that Ang-2 may target chemotactic responses to bFGF and VEGF in vivo.
