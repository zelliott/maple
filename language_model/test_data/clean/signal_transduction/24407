Mature B cells are grouped into two major subsets, B-1 and B-2, believed to derive from separate lineages. We have recently shown that B-1 cells, which are characterized by CD5 surface expression, specifically exhibit significant levels of the tyrosine kinase Lck in man. Here we show that also in mice Lck expression is restricted to B-1 cells and address the potential role of Lck in B-1 cell development and activation. Using as a model an Lck-/- mouse, we show that, while dispensable for B-1 cell development, Lck is required for full and sustained activation of the tyrosine phosphorylation and MAP kinase cascades triggered by the BCR in CD5+, B-1 cells. The data suggest a potential role for Lck in the achievement of the higher activation threshold required for productive BCR signaling in B-1 as compared to B-2 cells.
