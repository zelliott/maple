Many Gram-negative pathogens use a type III secretion machine to translocate protein toxins across the bacterial cell envelope. Pathogenic Yersinia spp. export at least 14 Yop proteins via a type III machine, which recognizes secretion substrates by signals encoded in yop mRNA or chaperones bound to unfolded Yop proteins. During infection, substrate recognition appears to be regulated in a manner that allows the Yersinia type III pathway to direct Yops to the bacterial envelope, the extracellular medium or into the cytosol of host cells.
