Although inhibitors can implicate individual protein kinases in specific signal transduction pathways, simple reversible inhibitors are unable to define both the time of initiation and the duration of protein kinase activity. How long must a specific protein kinase remain active in a particular transduction cascade to ensure that the message results in the appropriate cellular response? What is the precise temporal assembly order of individual components of an intracellular signaling complex? What, if any, temporal crosstalk is there between individual members of bisecting signaling pathways? Caged protein kinase inhibitors, as well as caged protein kinases, should serve as useful tools for temporal studies of signal transduction. We have prepared both a caged cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and a caged inhibitor of this enzyme. Upon photolysis, the functional activities of both species are dramatically unleashed in vitro. We have also explored both the activation and the inhibition of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-driven signaling pathway in rat embryo fibroblasts with these caged species via microinjection, and have now demonstrated that the activity of signal transduction pathways can be controlled by light in living cells.
