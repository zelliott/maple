Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has a key role in regulation of innate and adaptive immunity and is implicated in sepsis, tumorigenesis, and autoimmune disease. MIF deficiency or immunoneutralization leads to protection against fatal endotoxic, exotoxic, and infective shock, and anti-inflammatory effects in other experimental models of inflammatory disease. We report a novel regulatory role of MIF in type 1 IL-1R and p55 TNFR expression and function. Compared with wild-type cells, MIF-deficient cells were hyporesponsive to IL-1- and TNF-induced MAPK activity, AP-1 activity, and cellular proliferation, while NF-kappaB function was preserved. Hyporesponsiveness of MIF-deficient cells was associated with down-regulation of cytokine receptor expression, which was restored by reconstitution of either an upstream kinase of MAPK, MAPK/ERK kinase, or MIF. These data suggest that endogenous MIF is required for cytokine activation of MAPK/AP-1 and cytokine receptor expression. This autocrine regulatory pathway defines an important amplifying role of endogenous MIF in cytokine-mediated immune and inflammatory diseases and provides further molecular evidence for the critical role of MIF in cellular activation.
