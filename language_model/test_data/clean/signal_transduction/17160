Energy homeostasis (balance) depends on the relationship between the amount of consumed feed energy and energy expenditure. Coordination of energy expenditure and feed intake (appetite) is necessary for the regulation of body composition. The hypothalamus integrates peripheral and central signals to generate satiety or hunger. Birds and mammals utilize common signaling molecules but some molecules possess different/opposite functions. If relevant, particular differences with the mammalian regulatory system are highlighted in this review. For example, obestatin had no significant effect on feed intake of chicks, but it was claimed to decrease food intake in mammalian species. Ghrelin displayed appetite-stimulating effects in mammals but appetite-decreasing effects in birds. Recently, the function of the hypothalamic AMPK signaling pathway on feed intake regulation has received considerable attention in poultry. Alpha-lipoic acid might exert its appetite-decreasing effect by the AMPK signaling pathway. This review discusses the central regulation of energy homeostasis, role of (an)orexigenic peptides, effect of feed deprivation on hypothalamic neuropeptide gene expression and provides a model for involvement of AMPK in the regulation of avian energy balance.
