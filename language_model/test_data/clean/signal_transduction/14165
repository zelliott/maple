The retention of p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), the prototype of protein-bound uremic toxins that is produced by the gut microbiota and normally excreted by the kidney, may contribute to the development of insulin resistance in patients with chronic kidney disease. In a recent study, we demonstrated in mice, as in cultured muscle cells, that PCS interferes with intracellular insulin signaling pathways and triggers insulin resistance. The treatment of CKD mice with a prebiotic that reduces the intestinal production and decreases blood levels of PCS prevented insulin resistance and lipid abnormalities, suggesting new opportunities to prevent metabolic disturbances in patients with CKD. This study highlights the uremic toxins as new actors in metabolic alterations associated with CKD and allows for the consideration of new therapeutic approaches (e.g., prebiotics, probiotics, adsorbents) to better prevent them.
