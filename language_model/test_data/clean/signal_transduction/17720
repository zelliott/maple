17alpha-E(2), a weak estrogen exhibited both agonistic and antagonistic effects, and caused a time- and dose-dependent induction of VEGF-A mRNA expression in GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells. This effect was unaffected by the presence of the pure estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 but was specifically blocked by a protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) activity by wortmannin decreased the effect of 17alpha-E(2) on VEGF-A mRNA expression. This inhibitor also blocked the increase in phosphorylation of Akt induced by exposure to 17alpha-E(2). In contrast, exposure to the MAP kinase inhibitor, U0126, had no impact on 17alpha-E(2)-induced VEGF-A mRNA expression. Taken together, these studies indicate that like potent estrogens 17alpha-E(2) up-regulates VEGF-A mRNA expression in estrogen responsive GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells, but this induction is not mediated through a classical estrogen receptor pathway. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is required for the induction of VEGF-A mRNA in GH3 cells by 17alpha-E(2).
