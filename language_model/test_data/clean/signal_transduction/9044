Recent evidence has unveiled the critical role of tumor cells with stem cell activities in tumorigenicity and drug resistance, but how tumor microenvironments regulate cancer stem/initiating cells (CSCs) remains unknown. We clarified the role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and their downstream factor milk-fat globule-epidermal growth factor-VIII (MFG-E8) in the regulation of CSC activities. Bone marrow chimeric systems and adoptive cell transfers elucidated the importance of MFG-E8 from TAMs in conferring to CSCs with the ability to promote tumorigenicity and anticancer drug resistance. MFG-E8 mainly activates signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) and Sonic Hedgehog pathways in CSCs and further amplifies their anticancer drug resistance in cooperation with IL-6. Thus, the pharmacological targeting of key factors derived from tumor-associated inflammation provides a unique strategy to eradicate therapy-resistant tumors by manipulating CSC activities.
