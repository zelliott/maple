The NADPH oxidase (Nox) enzyme family generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contribute to cell signaling, innate immune responses, proliferation, and transcription. The signaling mechanisms that regulate this important enzyme family are only beginning to be understood. Evidence is emerging which suggests that phosphorylation of Nox and/or their regulatory components may be important means of modulating their activity. We describe here the evidence for Nox regulation through the action of kinases, and speculate on how such regulatory mechanisms might contribute to the development of pathological disease states.
