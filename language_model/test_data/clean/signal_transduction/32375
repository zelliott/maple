We previously found that the enhanced activity to invade Matrigel upon stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was one of the major properties of a highly metastatic variant (L-10) of a human rectal adenocarcinoma cell line RCM-1. To clarify the mechanism of this enhancement, we examined the effect of TPA on 2 major biological factors involved in tumor cell invasion: cell motility and matrix-degrading metalloproteinase activity. The enhanced invasiveness was inhibited by protein-kinase-C inhibitors. TPA markedly enhanced both haptotactic response to type-IV collagen and motility on tissue-culture glass substrate of L-10 cells in a dose-response manner quite similar to that of TPA-enhanced invasion of Matrigel. On the other hand, TPA showed little enhancement of metalloproteinase production, which was assessed by gelatin- and casein-zymography, and of type-IV collagenolytic activity. Addition of TIMP (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase)-I inhibited TPA-enhanced invasion of Matrigel by only up to 13%. Thus, TPA treatment of L-10 cells enhanced invasion of Matrigel in association with augmentation of cell motility but did not enhance metalloproteinase activity.
