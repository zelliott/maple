The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) overexpression in androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells on their phenotype under an androgen-deprived condition.

We established IL-6-overexpressing LNCaP (LNCaP/IL-6) by introducing the expression vector containing IL-6 cDNA. Changes in the phenotype in LNCaP/IL-6 were compared with that in LNCaP transfected with control vector alone (LNCaP/Co).

In vitro, the growth of LNCaP/IL-6 was significantly inferior to that of LNCaP/Co under an androgen-deprived condition. Similarly, LNCaP/IL-6 tumour in nude mice rapidly regressed after castration; however, LNCaP/Co tumour growth was transiently inhibited after castration and then continuously accelerated. After androgen withdrawal, expression levels of phosphorylated p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt in LNCaP/IL-6 were markedly upregulated compared with those in LNCaP/Co; however, additional treatment with specific inhibitor of the MAPK or Akt signalling pathway significantly inhibited the growth of LNCaP/IL-6 compared with that of LNCaP/Co. Furthermore, gene microarray analyses showed that androgen deprivation resulted in differential expression of genes involved in growth, apoptotsis and tumorigenesis between LNCaP/Co and LNCaP/IL-6.

Excessive secretion of IL-6 by LNCaP cells in an autocrine manner may have a suppressive function in their growth and acquisition of androgen-independent phenotype under an androgen-deprived condition.
