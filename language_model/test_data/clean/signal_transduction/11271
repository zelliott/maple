Reversal of long term potentiation (LTP) may function to increase the flexibility and storage capacity of neuronal circuits; however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We show that depotentiation induced by low frequency stimulation (LFS) (2 Hz, 10 min, 1200 pulses) was input-specific and dependent on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation. The ability of LFS to reverse LTP was mimicked by a brief application of NMDA. This NMDA-induced depotentiation was blocked by adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist. However, the reversal of LTP by LFS was unaffected by metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonism. This LFS-induced depotentiation was specifically prevented by protein phosphatase (PP)1 inhibitors, okadaic acid, and calyculin A but not by the PP2A or PP2B inhibitors. Furthermore, by using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies, we found that LFS-induced depotentiation is associated with a persistent dephosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit of amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor at serine 831, a protein kinase C and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) substrate, but not at serine 845, a substrate of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This effect was mimicked by bath-applied adenosine or NMDA and was specifically prevented by okadaic acid. Also, the increased phosphorylation of CaMKII at threonine 286 and the decreased PP activity seen with LTP were overcome by LFS, adenosine, or NMDA application. These results suggest that LFS erases LTP through an NMDA receptor-mediated activation of PP1 to dephosphorylate amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors and CaMKII in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.
