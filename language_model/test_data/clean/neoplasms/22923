The flora isolated from cancer patients in cases of infectious complications has been found to consist of Gram-negative bacteria. Of 414 isolated Gram-negative bacteria strains, 369 strains belonged to the family Enterobacteriaceae, 38 strains to the family Pseudomonaceae, and 7 strains to other families. Enterobacteria were mainly represented by bacteria of the tribes Escherichieae, Klebsielleae, Proteeae. The prominence of individual species in different infectious complication has proved to depend on their localization. Thus, Kl. pneumoniae show a distinct prevalence in purulent septic complications of the respiratory organs, in most of other infections E. coli have been found to play the dominating role. This study demonstrates the etiological role of enterobacteria in hospital infections in patients with malignant tumors.
