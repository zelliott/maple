In all organisms with a metabolism of oxygen, radicals/reactive oxygen species appear. Normally a balance exists between formation and destruction of radicals. Many diseases show a disturbance of this balance with the destruction of biological structures. Results in patients with sepsis, terminal renal failure, bone marrow transplantation and cancer are given.

To avoid a possible pro-oxidative effect (vitamins C and E) and intoxications (selenium), before substitution a monitoring is necessary.
