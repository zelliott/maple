Monoclonal antibody Ki-67 is a useful and easy means for evaluating cell proliferative activity and malignancy of tumor cells. However, almost all studies for expression of Ki-67 reactive antigen on solid tumors have been performed only by microscopic observation of immunostained sections, and not by flow cytometry. The main reason for this is the difficulty associated with preparation of numerous suspended cells so as to be analyzable with FCM from small solid tissues. In this study, a simple and easy method for flow cytometric measurement of Ki-67 reactive antigen on small solid tissues was shown. The important steps in this method are cell dispersion with Triton X-100 and washless staining.
