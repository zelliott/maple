Major societal changes, including the changing demographics of US society and the genetics and communications revolutions, are providing new opportunities to control cancer both in the United States and around the world. This article examines the implications of these trends and other issues in the context of cancer control research. A seven-item strategy for cancer control research is proposed.

Epidemiology, statistics, genetics, and bio-behavioral research are central disciplines for cancer control research. The identification of particular at-risk populations is increasingly possible. Cancer control research must focus on increasing fundamental knowledge in order to accelerate improvements in cancer prevention and early detection. Cancer control research also must be used to conduct trials of new cancer detection methods, overcome differential participation in cancer screening, develop evidence-based strategies to improve decision-making, and develop evidence-based cancer communications. A comprehensive cancer surveillance system is the foundation for cancer control research. Cancer control research must aim to reduce cancer risk, incidence, and mortality, and improve quality of life. These are important challenges for the new millennium.
