PDGF and its receptors are involved in a variety of diseases: cancers, atherosclerosis, balloon injury induced restenosis, pulmonary fibrosis and more. In all cases enhanced signaling of the receptor is the hallmark. In some cases, like chronic monomyelocytic leukemia (CMML), the persistent PDGFR signaling is essential for the survival of the cancer cell. These findings induced the research community as well as the pharmaceutical industry to develop agents that block PDGFR signaling. The possible utilization of PDGFR kinase inhibitors as anti-restenosis agents is likely to move ahead of the utilization of these agents to treat human malignancies.
