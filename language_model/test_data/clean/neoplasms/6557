Cancer incidence data from the National Cancer Registry of the German Democratic Republic were analyzed over the period 1968-1981. A regression model of the form log y = a + bx was fitted to the annual age-standardized incidence rates. The average annual percentage change in rates was used to summarize the temporal trend in cancer incidence. The greatest increase in incidence occurred for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx. The greatest decrease was seen for stomach (females), small intestine (males) and cervical cancers.
