Eccrine squamous syringometaplasia is characterized by the metaplasia of cuboidal epithelial cells of the eccrine sweat ducts into squamous epithelial cells. It has been associated with several conditions including chemotherapy-related bilateral dermatitis, an entity that can take place in body areas rich in eccrine glands, as well as in acral erythema related to chemotherapy. Only a few cases because of cutaneous extravasation of chemotherapy have been previously reported. We report three cases of eccrine squamous syringometaplasia secondary to extravasation of docetaxel.
