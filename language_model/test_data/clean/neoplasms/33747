Monoclonal antibodies to different markers can facilitate the diagnosis of T and B cell lymphomas, histiocytic lymphomas, malignant histiocytosis, and Hodgkin's disease. The B-cell lymphomas can be identified specifically by monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are produced to defined markers like carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colon carcinomas and other antigens especially of breast and ovarian carcinomas. When conjugated with 123I, monoclonal antibodies can be used to detect tumors by emission computerized tomography. Chromogranins are markers for neuroendocrine tumors, and they can be identified by monoclonal antibodies. More recently monoclonal antibodies have been produced to ras gene product p21, present in breast and colon carcinoma cells.
