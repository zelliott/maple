Cancer therapy based on the delivery of enzymes to tumour sites has advanced in several directions since antibody-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy was first described. It has been shown that methoxypolyethylene glycol (MPEG) can be used to deliver enzyme to a variety of solid tumours. MPEG-enzyme conjugates show reduced immunogenicity and may allow repeated treatment with enzymes of bacterial origin. Enzyme delivery to tumours by polymers can be used to convert a low toxicity prodrug to a potent cytotoxic agent. An example of such a prodrug is CB1954, which can be activated by a human enzyme in the presence of a cosubstrate. Tumour-located enzymes can also be used in conjunction with a combination of antimetabolites and rescue agents. The rescue agent protects normal tissue but is degraded at cancer sites by the enzyme, thus deprotecting the tumour and allowing prolonged antimetabolite action.
