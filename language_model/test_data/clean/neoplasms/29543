Nanoparticle approaches to drug delivery for cancer offer exciting and potentially "game-changing" ways to improve patient care and quality of life in numerous ways, such as reducing off-target toxicities by more selectively directing drug molecules to intracellular targets of cancer cells. Here, we focus on technologies being investigated clinically and discuss numerous types of therapeutic molecules that have been incorporated within nanostructured entities such as nanoparticles. The impacts of nanostructured therapeutics on efficacy and safety, including parameters like pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, are described for several drug molecules. Additionally, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of ligand-based targeting of nanoparticles, such as on receptor avidity and selectivity.
