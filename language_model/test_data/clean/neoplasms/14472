Hemostatic analyses were carried out on 43 patients with small and non-small cell lung cancer, malignant lymphomas and plasmacytomas prior to, 4 h and 24 h after application of chemotherapy. The fibrinopeptide A (FPA) level and the FPA in vitro generation rate (delta FPA) increased significantly only in the small cell lung cancer and malignant lymphomas after 4 h. This supports the thesis of the clotting activation after cytostatic-induced exposition of the tumour cell thromboplastins. An increase in the FPA was observed in those tumor patients, where a high therapy-induced cell destruction was expected. An increase in the activity of factor VIII, as was seen in acute phase reactions, also led to hypercoagulability. Fibrinogen and plasminogen decreased significantly after chemotherapy. Evidence of relevant contact activation was not found in the missing deviation of the C1 inhibitor. The increase in protein C may possibly be attributed to the high-dose corticoid therapy.
