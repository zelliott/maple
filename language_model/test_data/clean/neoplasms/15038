Although medication of malignancies made a considerable progress and the rates of apparent response grew markedly, those of survival among patients with disseminated solid tumors increased insignificantly. Metronomic therapy with cytostatics is a new modality of treatment via tumor vessels. Dose-dense regimen uses low dosage administration of drugs at regular short intervals (hours, days, weeks). Cumulative dose may be much lower than that used in standard therapy, thus reducing toxicity as well as amount of therapeutic support. A pre-clinical study established decrease in size of tumors which initially showed resistance to treatment. However, further research in randomized investigation is needed in view of certain inconstinence of our data.
