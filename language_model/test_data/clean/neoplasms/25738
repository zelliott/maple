Among the many carotenoids present in nature, lycopene has been of special interest and has received attention in recent times due to its suggestive association in reducing risk for cancer at many sites including breast, prostate and pancreas. Several studies have attempted to determine the bioactive levels of this carotenoid in human tissues and the influence of plant food and cancer on carotenoid levels. Experimental studies have also implicated the protective role of lycopene during carcinogenesis. These observations should justify further exploration and evaluation of the biological function of lycopene alone or in combination with other chemical compounds present in tomato fruit for their use in cancer prevention.
