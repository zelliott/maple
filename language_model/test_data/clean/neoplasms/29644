Different schemes of prospidin administration to 54 patients were evaluated. Stage IV paresthesia or renal derangements are limitations of prospidin treatment due to its toxicity. Rheovasographic studies established that disorders in vascular tension are responsible for paresthesia development. The best results were obtained with the administration of 300-400 mg every other day for 2-3 weeks. Schemes of combined administration of prospidin and cyclophosphamide and bleomycin were worked out (58 cases). Therapeutic effect was recorded in the treatment of melanoma, carcinoma of the lip, tongue, nasopharynx, salivary gland and skin. Prospidin, cyclophosphamide and radiation therapy were successfully used in the management of small cell carcinoma of the lung.
