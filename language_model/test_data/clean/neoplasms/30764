For a period of more than a year children with incurable diseases and their families we observed at home during the final stage of the children's illness. The psychological assistance and the necessary medical care were guaranteed by the staff of the district attending clinic, the family doctors and the district home nurses. The results of this project show that the concept which takes into account the child's welfare at home, was practicable in all cases even in very serious disease right up to death.
