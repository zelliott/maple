From a fundamental point of view, chemotherapy is the most widely used treatment for cancers despite its side effects on normal cells and tissues. Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is a method for increasing the permeability of cancer cells to drugs and, hence, decreasing their dosage. It apparently creates electropores on the cell membrane using electric pulses. ECT can decrease tumor volume; but this effect is not permanent, and partial regrowth has been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of magnetic fields in preventing the regrowth of tumors after ECT. Tumoral Balb/c mice were exposed to a magnetic field (15 mT, 50 Hz) for 12 days after treating additionally with 70 V/cm electric pulses and bleomycin at the first day. The magnetic field caused a significant reduction in tumor volumes, while there was no significant difference between the ECT and the electroporation with ECT and magnetic field groups. The exploited magnetic field (15 mT, 50 Hz) could decrease the tumor growth rate significantly, without any effect on ECT efficiency.
