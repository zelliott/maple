The potential relationships between aging and cancer have received considerable attention in the scientific literature in recent years. While it is clear that the rates of most types of cancer increase with advancing age and that both the processes of aging and those of cancer are time dependent, an unequivocal relationship between the etiology of cancers and the mechanistic processes of aging has yet to be established. This article discusses the potential causal relationships between the processes of aging and the etiologies of most cancers.
