To determine the feasibility of administration, safety, toxicity, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose, and biodistribution of ING-1, a high-affinity, Human-Engineered monoclonal antibody (heMAb) to the Mr 40,000 epithelial cell adhesion molecule Ep-CAM, in patients with advanced adenocarcinomas.

ING-1 was initially administered to patients as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Toxicity and pharmacokinetic data led to the evaluation of a weekly schedule. The distribution of iodine-131 (131I)-labeled ING-1 was studied.

Twenty-five patients received 82 courses of ING-1. Minimal toxicity was initially observed at the 0.03-, 0.10-, and 0.30-mg/kg dose levels. A patient dosed at 1.0 mg/kg developed acute pancreatitis with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A patient dosed at 0.3 mg/kg had an asymptomatic amylase and lipase elevation to 502 units/L and 1,627 units/L, respectively. Both patients made uncomplicated recoveries. No other dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Regardless of dose, the volume of distribution (mean +/- SEM) was 46.6 +/- 1.6 mL/kg. ING-1 clearance decreased with increasing dose. To minimize toxicity and increase dose intensity, we then administered ING-1 weekly. No significant toxicity was observed in 7 patients dosed at 0.1 mg/kg. Studies of 131I-labeled ING-1 biodistribution showed radiolocalization to colorectal and prostate cancers. A patient with colorectal cancer had an 80% decrement in the levels of carcinoembryonic antigen.

The recommended dose for ING-1 is 0.10 mg/kg by intravenous infusion weekly. The absence of severe toxicity at this dose, low immunogenicity, and preliminary evidence of ING-1 tumor localization and antitumor efficacy support the further clinical development of this antibody to treat Ep-CAM-positive malignant diseases.
