Melatonin, acting through melatonin receptors, is involved in numerous physiological processes including circadian entrainment, blood pressure regulation, oncogenesis, retinal physiology, seasonal reproduction, ovarian physiology, immune function and most recently in inducing osteoblast differentiation. Moreover, melatonin was proved to be a potent-free radical scavenger and a broad-spectrum antioxidant. More research is required into the effects of therapeutically modulating the melatoninergic system on circadian haemodynamics and rhythm under varying physiopathological conditions and the possible impact on morbidity and mortality in humans.
