Cancer is a complex disease caused by multiple factors including genetic             mutations, and environmental factors. Cancer-associated proteins are potential             biomarkers or targets for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in cancer.             The Universal Protein Resourse (UniPort) is a well-annotated comprehensive resourse             for protein sequence records. In the present study, we performed data mining of             Uniprot proteins as a proteomic resource. we generated a catalog of 1653 cancer-associated             proteins including 344 secretory proteins and 300 cell surface proteins. Integrated             bioinformatic analysis including ontological classification, functional enrichment             and pathway construction were performed. These proteins could serve as a reference             for further studies to discover cancer targets, and the enriched bioinformatic             analysis provides new insights into cancer proteomics research.
