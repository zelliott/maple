Following the discovery of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) in 1993, its pivotal role in disorders of calcium homeostasis such as Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH) was quickly demonstrated. Since then, it has become clear that the CaSR has immense functional versatility largely through its ability to activate many different signaling pathways in a ligand- and tissue-specific manner. This allows the receptor to play diverse and crucial roles in human physiology and pathophysiology, both in calcium homeostasis and in tissues and biological processes unrelated to calcium balance. This review covers current knowledge of the role of the CaSR in disorders of calcium homeostasis (FHH, neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia of malignancy) as well as unrelated diseases such as breast and colorectal cancer (where the receptor appears to play a tumor suppressor role), Alzheimer's disease, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and bone and gastrointestinal disorders. In addition, it examines the use or potential use of CaSR agonists or antagonists (calcimimetics and calcilytics) and other drugs mediated through the CaSR, in the management of disorders as diverse as hyperparathyroidism, osteoporosis and gastrointestinal disease.
