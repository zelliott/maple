A simple, rapid histone agglutination test (HAT) is described. It consists of incubation in microplates or in microtubes of blood lymphocytes isolated from cancer patients and patients with non-malignant diseases with microquantities of histone fraction F2A1. Positive reaction is shown by massive agglutination of lymphocytes of the patients tested (126 subjects): this test was positive in 76% of cases. All controls (59 subjects) were negative.
