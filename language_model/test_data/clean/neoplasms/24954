The AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR) is a cooperative agreement among the United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) (Office of the Director, Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM)) and regional US consortia, University of California, San Francisco (West Coast), George Washington University (East Coast), and The Ohio State University (Mid-Region). The ACSR's main objective is to collect, preserve, and disperse HIV-related tissues and biologic fluids along with clinical data to qualified investigators with a focus on HIV/AIDS-related malignancies. The ACSR biorepository has more than 265,000 human HIV-positive and control samples available from 39 processing types, 16 specimen types, and 52 anatomical site types. These HIV-infected biological fluids and tissues are made available to funded approved investigators at no fee. Technical support such as HIV DNA identification in tissues and tissue microarray (TMA) blocks are available to assist approved investigators. Research needs may be filled through ACSR cooperative arrangements when not met by currently banked material. Those participating with the ACSR are expected to share their research findings with the scientific community. Some 117 abstract/poster and podium reports at national and international scientific meetings and 94 publications have been contributed to the scientific literature (as of 2010). Investigators can browse the ACSR Internet site at http://acsr.ucsf.edu for biospecimens to support their scientific initiatives, including basic, translational, biomarker discovery, and molecular epidemiology studies.
