We investigated coexisting autoantibodies in sera of 553 patients with a neurological presentation and one or more paraneoplastic neuronal nuclear or cytoplasmic autoantibodies: antineuronal nuclear autoantibody type 1 (ANNA-1), ANNA-2, ANNA-3; Purkinje cell cytoplasmic autoantibody type 1 (PCA-1), PCA-2; and CRMP-5-immunoglobulin G or amphiphysin-immunoglobulin G. Except for PCA-1, which occurred alone, 31% of sera had more than one of these autoantibodies. In addition, 25% of sera had neuronal calcium channel (P/Q-type or N-type), potassium channel, ganglionic acetylcholine receptor, muscle acetylcholine receptor, or striational antibodies. The autoantibody profiles observed in patients with paraneoplastic disorders imply the targeting of multiple onconeural antigens and predict the patient's neoplasm, but not a specific neurological syndrome.
