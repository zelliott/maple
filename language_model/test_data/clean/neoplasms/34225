Two techniques for growing colonies of human tumour cells in soft agar have been applied to cell suspensions derived from fresh tumour tissue from 48 patients. Colonies were obtained in 31 cases, with plating efficiencies between 0.01 and 15%. In 11 cases the plating efficiencies were 1% or above. There was evidence that some categories of tumour grew more readily than others under these conditions. The potential applications of the methods to clinical and experimental oncology are discussed.
