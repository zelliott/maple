In recent years, JM-216/satraplatin (GPC Biotech, Inc.) has emerged as a novel oral platinum analogue with a better toxicity profile than cisplatin. Since satraplatin is more hydrophobic than cisplatin or oxaliplatin, it appears to demonstrate efficacy in cisplatin-resistant cell lines. The preclinical and clinical evaluation of satraplatin stimulated this review of the pharmacology and clinical trial data of this agent.

A literature review was conducted in the MEDLINE database from 1985 to present using the keywords 'satraplatin' or 'JM-216'. The abstracts regarding satraplatin reported at the 2007 - 2009 American Society of Clinical Oncology meetings were also reviewed.

Satraplatin has a favorable toxicity profile, and appears to have clinical activity against a variety of malignancies such as breast, prostate and lung cancer. The oral route of administration and the intermittent schedule makes it very convenient for clinical use. Despite this, a FDA-approved indication has not yet been achieved. The only Phase III trial with satraplatin was conducted in pretreated metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), revealing an improvement in progression-free survival but no overall survival benefit. Future development would have to include designing trials in docetaxel-refractory metastatic CRPC, or in other malignancies where cisplatin is of benefit.
