Pain is one of the most frequent and deleterious symptoms in cancer patients. This study was carried out to investigate the adequacy of pain management at the National Cancer Center Hospital East, Japan.

The available data were obtained from 138 ambulatory cancer patients with pain. The data included pain severity, which patients reported using the Japanese version of the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory, along with such medical information as cancer and treatment information and currently prescribed analgesics. Adequacy of pain management was assessed using the Pain Management Index, which revealed whether prescribed analgesic drugs were congruent with pain severity.

Physicians undertreated pain in 70% of patients. Patients with non-advanced cancer (local cancer or no evidence of any recurrent cancer) were more likely to receive inadequate treatment than those with advanced cancer [P = 0.009, odds ratio = 0.18, Exp (95% CI) lower = 0.05, higher = 0.64] in the exploratory logistic regression analysis. Additionally, we found significant differences among physicians in ability to manage cancer pain, unrelated to a physician's years of experience as an oncologist.

This study suggests that cancer pain management is insufficient at the investigated institute. Remedial action should be taken, including increasing awareness of symptom management in medical staff and incorporating existing knowledge into routine clinical practice.
