The discovery of the CpG motif in 1995 led to a change in the perception of the immune stimulatory effects of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) from an unwanted nonspecific effect to a highly evolved immune defense that can be selectively triggered for a wide range of therapeutic applications. Over the last decade dozens of human clinical trials have been conducted with different CpG ODN in thousands of humans for applications ranging from vaccine adjuvant to immunotherapies for allergy, cancer, and infectious diseases. Along with many positive results have come some failures showing the limitations of several therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes these results to provide an overview of the clinical development of CpG ODN.
