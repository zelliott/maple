A study of some aspects of granulocyte function was carried out before, during, and after cyclic chemotherapy in 9 patients surgically treated for carcinoma and in 6 patients with very advanced and inoperable cancer. In most patients, total leukocyte mobilization, Candida-stimulated nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction, and phagocytosis increased after chemotherapy. Furthermore, delayed hypersensitivity skin reactions to PPD and above all to Varidase increased in the same cases. A significant correlation between accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into skin chambers and skin tests was found in both groups of patients (p less than 0.001). In some instances, fluctuations in the levels of circulating immune complexes without a distinct correlation between these complexes and granulocyte function were found. The data support the hypothesis that depressed granulocyte function may contribute to an increased susceptibility to infections and may be considered an additional factor that favors tumor dissemination. Chemotherapy seems to restore polymorphonuclear function and delayed hypersensitivity skin reactions.
