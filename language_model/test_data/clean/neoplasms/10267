CDK inhibitors CDKN1B (p27) and CDKN2A (p16) inhibit cell cycle progression. A lower expression level of only p27 has been correlated with poorer prognosis in various types of clinical cancers. The difference may be the result of distinct genes downstream of these CDK inhibitors. Here, we report that NF-Y transcription factor-targeted genes specifically down-regulated by p27 correlate with poor prognosis in multiple tumor types. We performed mRNA expression profiling in HCT116 cells over-expressing either p16 or p27 and identified their regulatory genes. In silico transcription factor prediction indicated that most of the genes specifically down-regulated by p27 are controlled by NF-Y. Under the hypothesis that NF-Y-targeted genes are responsible for poor prognosis, we predicted prognosis in four types of cancer based on genes with the NF-Y motif, and found a significant association between the expression of NF-Y-targeted genes and poor prognosis.
