In contrast to the established relation between known cancer and subsequent venous thromboembolism, the question of whether an association exists between venous thrombosis and the risk of subsequent overt cancer has remained without a convincing answer until 1992. A recent publication has provided a firm demonstration of this connection. Although this study has demonstrated a highly significant association between idiopathic vein thrombosis and subsequent overt malignant disease, firm recommendations for an extensive screening of cancer in all such patients cannot be made on the basis of these results.
