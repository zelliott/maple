The success of a transfusion of thrombocytes is influenced by numerous factors concerning both the preparation of the platelet concentrate and the recipient. In a long-term substitution of thrombocytes on account of the appearance of immunological and unspecific consumption processes the control of the effectiveness is indicated. The determination of the thrombocyte increment and the resonance thrombography are suitable for this purpose. Fever, sepsis, splenomegaly and haemorrhage cause a diminution of the increase of thrombocytes after transfusion. Isoantibodies have the greatest influence on the shortening of the survival time of transfused thrombocytes. The corrected increase of thrombocytes (CI) 1 hour after the transfusion is lowered under 5.0 Gpt/l (m2). Directives are given for the transfusion and statement of the success of thrombocyte concentrate in patients with leukaemia and malignant tumours.
