The mortality experience of 8,146 male employees of a research, engineering, and metal fabrication facility in Tonawanda, New York state was examined from 1946 to 1981. Potential workplace exposures included welding fumes, cutting oils, asbestos, organic solvents, and environmental ionizing radiation, as the result of disposal of wastes during the Manhattan Project of World War II. External comparisons with the US male population were supplemented by regional comparisons. For the total cohort, deficits were observed for all causes of death (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 87) and most non-cancer causes. The observed number of cancer deaths was close to expected (SMR = 99). There was an excess of connective and soft tissue cancer deaths, most notably in hourly employees hired prior to 1946. Among all hourly employees, there was an excess of respiratory cancer, which did not appear to be associated with length of employment. Mesothelioma was recorded as the cause of death for three decedents, two of whom were hourly employees who worked in production areas with high potential for asbestos exposure. The standardized mortality ratio for cirrhosis of the liver was elevated among long-term hourly employees hired prior to 1946. The roles of carbon tetrachloride exposure in the 1940s and alcohol consumption are discussed as possible contributory risk factors for the cirrhosis findings. The data do not provide evidence of radiation-induced cancers within this employee population.
