The cancer cell appears to contain two non phosphorylating glycolytic pathways in addition to phosphorylating glycolysis and the aerobic citric acid and phosphogluconate cycles. It is hypothesised that these pathways are all interconnected and in the static adult cell non phosphorylating glycolysis is in a state of controlled inactivity. Cancer occurs when one or both non phosphorylating glycolytic pathways escape from control thereby producing an autonomous flow of energy and mitosis. Both pathways appear dependent upon glutathione to convert glucose to lactic acid. The pathways can be differentiated by their responses to ionising and 434MHz non ionising radiation, hyperthermia and biochemical environmental changes in vivo.
