In pediatric oncology, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is applied with the aim of shortening neutropenic periods after chemotherapy and for mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells for apheresis procedures. G-CSF is administered, subcutaneously or intravenously, on a daily basis. An insuflon device for the administration of G-CSF was used in 29 patients for 93 G-CSF periods. Retrospective evaluation shows that this administration route is feasible, safe and preferred by young children rather than by teenagers with cancer.
