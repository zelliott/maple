Shock is a syndrome in which multiple etiologies converge on a pathway of response which, although preservative and compensatory early on, rapidly becomes irreversible and fatal. The mechanisms of this response are under intense investigation, though little therapeutic improvement has accompanied our understanding. The patient with malignancy is at risk for developing shock both as a result of his disease and therapy for his disease, yet he is by no means alone in his vulnerability. Technologic advances may still bring more effective support to the shock patient, while immunologic advances may ultimately provide support to the shock patient, while immunologic advances may ultimately provide answers and cure.
