Heat distribution structures are given with application of the interstitial method of heating with the 1.7 MHz frequency, 8 implanted needles arranged in 2 rows were used as electrodes. Heat distribution structures are obtained on the basis of the mathematical model which was constructed in the electrostatic approximation and with the investigation of the spatial distribution of temperatures in the tissue-equivalent phantom. The results obtained in the both cases coincide.
