The aim of the present study is to evaluate the clinical social work in oncology. We present a series of 137 men and 63 women treated for cancer (mean age: 57 y; 20-90) who were addressed (65%) or came spontaneously (35%) for a first social consultation; 45 consultations concerned the family at the day of death of the patient. The collected data (expressed requests, evaluated real difficulties, orientations of the social work, necessity of network) are correlated with the medical data and the time between diagnosis and social consultation. The social intervention is often brief (95%) and focused (66%). A medical and social network is used in 70% of cases. The administrative and psychosocial problems predominate with an important discordance between the requests and the evaluated difficulties. The metastatic status increases psychosocial, legal difficulties and problems of the organisation of home-care. The delay of the social consultation has great influence upon the legal difficulties. The family's difficulties, after the patient's death are administrative (93.3%), psychosocial (84.4%) and legal (68.9%). Clinical social work is part of the global management of patients and their families; its quality has direct implication on their daily life during and after treatment.
