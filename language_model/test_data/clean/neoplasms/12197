Adolescence can be an extremely stressful time for all concerned. When this period is then compounded by the development of cancer, formidable and seemingly insurmountable problems may be perceived. Cancer in adolescence is relatively uncommon, with an annual incidence rate in western populations of approximately 150-200 per million. Five-year survival of patients diagnosed around 1990 exceeded 70% in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (USA), and adolescents with cancer are likely to remain fertile. Further advances in therapeutic modalities are creating a generation of adolescents and young adults with cancer who can now aspire to the same sexual and reproductive activities as their healthy peers. This then raises the issue of avoidance of undesired pregnancy during and after treatment. This article aims to address the contraceptive needs of adolescents and young adults undergoing treatment for cancer.
