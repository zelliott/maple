Site directed drug delivery with high efficacy is the biggest challenge in the area of current pharmaceuticals. Biodegradable polymer-based controlled release nanoparticle platforms could be beneficial for targeted delivery of therapeutics and contrast agents for a myriad of important human diseases. Biodegradable nanoparticles, which can be engineered to load multiple drugs with varied physicochemical properties, contrast agents, and cellular or intracellular component targeting moieties, have emerged as potential alternatives for tracking and treating human diseases. In this review, we will highlight the current advances in the design and execution of such platforms for their potential application in the diagnosis and treatment of variety of diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer's and we will provide a critical analysis of the associated challenges for their possible clinical translation.
