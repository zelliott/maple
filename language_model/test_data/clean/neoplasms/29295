Wnt/β-catenin signaling is an evolutionarily conserved signaling cascade with imperative roles during development and in adult stem cell maintenance. Hyperactivation of Wnt/β-catenin drives various cancers, whereas hypoactivation underlies bone malformations and neurodegenerative disorders. Although several small molecule modulators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling have been identified, none have progressed into clinical trials yet. Recent studies employing genomics and proteomics approaches have yielded more druggable targets, such as kinases and seven-transmembrane receptors. In addition, new assay methods enable a more targeted approach for high-throughput screening of this pathway and are expected to deliver clinical candidates in the coming decade.
