Two hundred different mendelian genes can have a cancerogenic effect in man, but it is difficult to make out between the genetic and the environmental part. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is an example that the actual cancerogenic factor can be environmental and not genetic. Genetically controlled tumors can result from two successive mutations, the first being in some cases prezygotic. The first genetic accident can be a birth defect or a chromosomic fragility syndrome. The histocompatibility major system can play a role in the frequence and in the evolutive type of some cancers. The most frequent hereditary syndromes which can be associated with cancers are quoted here.
