The effect of a tumour angiogenesis factor on proliferation of various kinds of cells was examined in vitro. The factor (TAF) a polypeptide of 14000 molecular weight, was extracted and purified from the conditioned medium of ovarian clear cell carcinoma cell line (HUOCA-II). TAF at concentrations of 10 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml promoted proliferation of the endothelial cells and induced tube formation. However, it had no stimulatory effect on the proliferation of fibroblasts, endometrial columnar cells, squamous epithelial cells or cancer cells.
