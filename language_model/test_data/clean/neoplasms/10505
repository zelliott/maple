YKL-40, a 40-kDa secreted glycoprotein, with its gene located on chromosome 1q32.1, is produced by cancer cells and inflammatory cells and has a role in inflammation, cell proliferation, differentiation, protection against apoptosis, stimulation of angiogenesis and regulation of extracellular tissue remodeling. Plasma levels of YKL-40 are elevated in a subgroup of patients with primary or advanced cancer compared with age-matched healthy subjects, but also in patients with many different diseases characterized by inflammation. Elevated plasma YKL-40 levels are an independent prognostic biomarker of short survival. There is still insufficient evidence to support its value outside of clinical trials as a screening tool, prognosticator of survival, predictor of treatment response and as a monitoring tool in the routine management of individual patients with cancer or diseases characterized by inflammation. Large prospective, longitudinal clinical cancer studies are needed to determine if plasma YKL-40 is a new cancer biomarker, or is mainly a biomarker of inflammation.
