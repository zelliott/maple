This study aimed to characterize the strategies and psychosocial conditions that influence how resilient people live in the face of advanced cancer.

Grounded theory interviews and a survey of 10 resilient people with advanced cancer were collected and analyzed.

Personal assets - including positive relationships, purpose in life, faith, and mastery--contributed to living fully in mortal time. Strategies included embracing paradox, reframing time, deepening connections, and aligning actions with priorities. Open-ended interviews yielded rich illness and life stories; many participants requested a copy of the transcript.

Resilient people use a range of strategies to thrive in the face of advanced cancer.
