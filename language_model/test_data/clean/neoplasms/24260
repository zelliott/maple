The treatment of viral hepatitis or malignomas with interferon (IFN) can increase the incidence of autoimmune disease. This paper reviews published case and study reports. The incidence of overt autoimmune diseases under IFN treatment is about 3%. Autoantibodies can be detected in 23% of the patients. Autoimmune thyroid diseases are the most frequent ones, but nearly all autoimmune diseases can occur. Beside benign and reversible courses chronic developments and lethal outcomes are possible. Actual concepts concerning the pathogenesis of IFN-associated autoimmunity include induction of MHC and other molecules as well as the modulation of lymphocyte functions. Clinical and paraclinical controls are necessary under treatment with IFN and during follow-up.
