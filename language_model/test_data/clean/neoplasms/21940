Although numerous immunotherapeutic strategies have been studied in patients with cancer, consistent induction of clinical responses remains a formidable challenge. Cancer vaccines are often successful at generating elevated numbers of tumor-specific T lymphocytes in peripheral blood, however, despite this, tumors usually continue to grow unabated. Recent evidence suggests that endogenous regulatory cells, known to play a major role in the induction of immune tolerance to self and prevention of autoimmunity, as well as suppressive myeloid cells invoked in the tumor-bearing state, may be largely responsible for preventing effective antitumor immune responses. This review will focus on the major regulatory cell subtypes, including CD4(+)CD25(+) T-regulatory cells, type 1 regulatory T cells, natural killer T cells, and immature myeloid cells. Studies in humans and in animal models have shown a role for all of these cells in tumor progression, although the mechanisms by which they act to suppress immunity remain largely undefined. Elucidation of the dominant molecular mechanisms mediating immune suppression in vivo will allow more precise targeting of the relevant regulatory cell populations, as well as the development of novel strategies and clinical reagents that will directly block molecules that induce the suppression of antitumor immunity.
