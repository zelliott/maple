Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and its complications are major dose-limiting toxicities of cancer chemotherapy. The myeloid growth factors have been shown to reduce the risk of neutropenic events across malignancies, regimens, and associated risk categories often enabling the delivery of greater chemotherapy dose intensity. Three different practice guidelines for the myeloid growth factors have recently been published by major professional organizations. A comprehensive review and comparison of the guidelines using a priori structured content criteria and a previously validated quality appraisal tool are reported. Consistency in the final recommendations from these guidelines is observed for primary prophylaxis with the colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) when the risk of febrile neutropenia is in the range of 20% or greater. There is also consistency in the recommendation that patients receiving regimens associated with lower risk should have CSF use guided by individual risk assessment. Critical quality appraisal indicates that the scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, and applicability of the guidelines differ little. There is more emphasis on comprehensive literature reviews in the ASCO and EORTC guidelines while the NCCN guidelines are more current based on systematic annual updates. The clarity of presentation also favors the NCCN guidelines with recommendations generally presented as both text and algorithmic diagram. All three new or updated guidelines recommend prophylactic use of the myeloid growth factors in patients at greater than a 20% risk of febrile neutropenia and in those with important factors increasing individual risk of neutropenic complications.
