Polyphenolic compounds in fruits and vegetables have been associated with lower risk of some diseases, including cancer. Recent research has shown that the polyphenolic antioxidants in green tea possess cancer chemopreventive effects. This review discusses the cancer chemopreventive effects associated with green tea and the molecular mechanisms that underlie the broad anticarcinogenic effect of polyphenols in green tea.
