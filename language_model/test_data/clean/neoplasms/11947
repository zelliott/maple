Plasma esterase changes are apparent in BALB/c mice within 3 weeks after feeding them laboratory chow with 0.75% of the antioxidant BHT added. Other esterase changes, different from those in BHT-treated animals, are also apparent in plasma of mice during exposure to the carcinogen DENA. Interference with these DENA esterase alterations is apparent in plasma of mice treated concomitantly with both DENA and BHT. Esterase changes resulting from either the carcinogen or antioxidant exposure precede the overt histologically detected changes induced by these compounds. The early esterase changes and subsequent tumorigenesis resulting from DENA exposure are more severe in female mice. Some of the esterases altered by DENA or BHT exposure are testosterone-related.
