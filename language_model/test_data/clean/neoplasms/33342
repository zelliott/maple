In recent years, several probes have been developed to allow for the intraoperative detection of tumour tissue using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Detector designs include high-energy gamma and beta probes, as well as combination devices with background rejection capabilities. Some laboratory prototypes and commercialized systems have demonstrated reasonable sensitivities for 511 keV photons and /or b particles emitted from 18F for in vivo use. This review focuses on the ability of these devices to detect tumour deposits in the low-contrast environment of the operating room . Important technical and biological factors that influence tumour-to-background contrast are discussed and potential future applications and developments are highlighted. In addition, we evaluate the limited data on absorbed doses resulting from [18F] FDG administration immediately prior to surgery that indicate acceptable levels of radiation exposure to operating room personnel.
