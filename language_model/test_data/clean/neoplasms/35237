Lately, the prevention, treatment and research of cancer have developed rapidly. Antineoplastic drugs have become one of the major measures for cancer therapy. Many new antineoplastic drugs have been discovered and prepared, and used to treat tumors. Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University is one of the biggest cancer hospitals in South China. The use of antineoplastic drugs of this center can reflect changes in this area. This study was to analyze and evaluate the situation and trend of antineoplastic drugs used in Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University from 1996 and 2005, in order to provide references for the rational use of drugs in clinical application.

Consumption of antineoplastic drugs was analyzed by sum and defined daily dose (DDDs) ranking.

The costs of antineoplastic drugs occupied 31.0%-48.8% of all drugs from 1996 to 2005; and the average increasing ratio is 21.5%. The cost rate of anti-cancer vegetable drugs and other genus increased the quickest, while the total costs of alkylate increased the slowest during the ten years. Some new monoantibodies and gene drugs were continuously applied in clinical use.

The direction of the research and development of antineoplastic drugs is towards high efficiency, low toxicity and individualized use.
