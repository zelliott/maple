Recently, we showed that E2F7 and E2F8 (E2F7/8) are critical regulators of angiogenesis through transcriptional control of VEGFA in cooperation with HIF. (1) Here we investigate the existence of other novel putative angiogenic E2F7/8-HIF targets, and discuss the role of the RB-E2F pathway in regulating angiogenesis during embryonic and tumor development.
