With two compounds on the market (Gleevec and Iressa), and a number of drug candidates in late-stage clinical trials, small-molecule kinase inhibitors hold great potential as novel therapies for cancer and inflammatory disorders. Inhibitors from the urea class were first reported in 1996 and have emerged as an important compound class for medicinal chemists due to their unique binding mode and kinase inhibition profile. Currently, five members of this class are undergoing clinical trials, BIRB-796 (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc), BAY-43-9006 (Bayer AG/Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc), CP-547632 (Pfizer Inc), MLN-518 (Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc) and KRN-951 (Kirin Brewery Co Ltd). This review focuses on the most recent developments in the discovery of urea-based protein kinase inhibitors.
