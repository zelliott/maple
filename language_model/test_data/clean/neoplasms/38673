The results of granting temporary disability payments for longer periods were followed in 549 patients with malignant tumors at various sites. It was found that 76-82% of stage I-IIa (T1-2N0M0) cancer patients resume working; working ability is limited in 14-18%. Two-thirds of them need another 2-3 months to complete treatment. To allow such patients to stay out of work is essential for prevention of disability from malignant tumors.
