Technological advancements in the field of biomaterials, polymer chemistry and drug-delivery techniques have aided the development of a number of new drug-delivery systems for targeting to solid tumors. Numerous research groups have explored the possibility of utilizing tumor-specific drug-delivery systems using nanoparticles. In this review we have attempted to highlight the achievements of some research groups actively involved in nanoparticulate drug delivery systems. The manuscript presents an in-depth discussion for nanoparticle systems such as micelles, liposomes, dendrimers, nanoemulsion, solid lipid nanoparticles and carbon fullerenes as chemotherapeutic options. The review reiterates the importance of the basic fundamentals of targeted drug delivery using nanoparticles and the influence of physiological parameters on their efficacy.
