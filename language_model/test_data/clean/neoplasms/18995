This review gives a brief summary on clinical applications of MMPs and their determination. Primarily, the activity of MMPs in cancer formation, development and metastasis is discussed. Further, survey on methods including fluorimetric methods, zymographies, Western-blotting, immunocapture assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry, phage display, multiple-enzyme/multiple-reagent system, activity profiling, chronopotentiometric stripping analysis and imaging methods for detection and determination of MMPs follows (Fig. 3, Ref. 100).
