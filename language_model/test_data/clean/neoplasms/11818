An overview of the interferon program at Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI), is presented. This program encompasses three interrelated areas of research and new drug development: (a) basic research on purification and characterization of animal and human interferons (leukocyte, fibroblast, and immune); (b) large scale manufacture and preclinical testing of human fibroblast interferon (HFIF); and (c) clinical trials with HFIF to determine its safety of administration as well as antiviral, antitumor, and immunomodulatory activities in patients with neoplastic or viral disease. The antitumor effect of HFIF produced at RPMI as assessed by intralesional injection of various metastatic nodules resulted in an overall 71% local response. Phase I studies in 13 patients demonstrated that HFIF can be administered safely by the subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous routes in doses up to 25 million units per day without any serious untoward effects. Intrathecal administration of HFIF into patients with CNS leukemia was also well tolerated. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated significant levels of HFIF in serum and cerebrospinal fluid after intravenous and intrathecal administration, respectively. Coincidental with the HFIF systemic administration during the Phase I trials, favorable responses in several laboratory, immune, and clinical parameters were observed. These results provide the rationale for conducting phase II and phase III clinical trials with HFIF produced at RPMI.
