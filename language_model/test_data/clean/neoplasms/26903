Human blood group antigens are glycoproteins and glycolipids expressed on the surface of red blood cells and a variety of human tissues, including the epithelium, sensory neurons, platelets and the vascular endothelium. Accumulating evidence indicate that ABO blood type is implicated in the development of a number of human diseases, including cardiovascular and neoplastic disorders. In this review, beside its physiologic role in immunohematology and transfusion medicine, we summarize the current knowledge on the association between the ABO blood group and the risk of developing thrombotic events and cancers.
