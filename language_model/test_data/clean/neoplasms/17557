The proportional mortality experience (1952-1978) of 969 deceased white male granite workers was compared with that of United States white males. Industrial hygiene information was combined with work histories to develop an estimate of lifetime granite dust exposure for each individual. Subjects were grouped into four cumulative exposure categories, and exposure-response relationships were examined. Trends of increasing silicosis and tuberculosis with increasing lifetime exposure were observed. These are consistent with earlier findings. With the exception of excess suicide among granite workers dying before 1970, there was little evidence of association between other causes of death and employment in the granite industry.
