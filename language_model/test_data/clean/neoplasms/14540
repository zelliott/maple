The belief that a neoplastic cell develops from a normal progenitor due to structural changes in DNA has been a fundamental basis of the study of the molecular biology of cancer. Recent technical advances in this field will give rise to conceptual advances and there is every reason to believe that a new field of cancer genetics is emerging, named here "Oncogenetics": a branch of genetics describing the cause of effects of genes causing neoplasia.
