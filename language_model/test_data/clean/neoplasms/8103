To assess the accuracy of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) when staging different malignant diseases.

This was a retrospective, blinded, investigator-initiated study of 260 patients with various oncological diseases who underwent fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose PET/CT for tumor staging. CT images alone, PET images alone, PET + CT data viewed side by side, and fused PET/CT images were evaluated separately according to the tumor-node-metastasis system. One hundred forty patients with tumors not staged according to the tumor-node-metastasis system or a lack of reference standard were excluded from data analysis; 260 patients were included. Diagnostic accuracies were determined for each of the four image sets. Histopathology and a clinical follow-up of 311 (+/- 125) days served as standards of reference.

PET/CT proved significantly more accurate in assessing tumor-node-metastasis system stage compared with CT alone, PET alone, and side-by-side PET + CT (P &lt; .0001). Of 260 patients, 218 (84%; 95% CI, 79% to 88%) were correctly staged with PET/CT, 197 (76%; 95% CI, 70% to 81%) with side-by-side PET + CT, 163 (63%; 95% CI, 57% to 69%) with CT alone, and 166 (64%; 95% CI, 58% to 70%) with PET alone. Combined PET/CT had an impact on the treatment plan in 16, 39, and 43 patients when compared with PET + CT, CT alone, and PET alone, respectively.

Tumor staging with PET/CT is significantly more accurate than CT alone, PET alone, and side-by-side PET + CT. This diagnostic advantage translates into treatment plan changes in a substantial number of patients.
