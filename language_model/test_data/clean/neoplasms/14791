Mucositis assessment in children has primarily relied on assessment tools that have been developed for an adult population. A mucositis assessment scale for use in children has previously been developed from expert opinion, namely Children's International Mucositis Evaluation Scale (ChIMES). After the development of ChIMES, we aimed to evaluate the user perspective of the scale by testing the understandability, content validity, and overall acceptability of ChIMES working with parents, children, and teenagers as content experts. Overall acceptability of the scale was satisfactory; however, comments provided by the participants questioned several aspects of the initial version of ChIMES. After discussion of the results, a refined version of ChIMES was produced that accounts for the views of the target population.
