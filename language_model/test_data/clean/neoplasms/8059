RecQ helicases are evolutionarily conserved enzymes required for the maintenance of genome stability. Mutations in three of the five known human RecQ helicase genes cause distinct clinical disorders that are characterized by genome instability and cancer predisposition. Recent studies have begun to reveal the cellular roles of RecQ helicases and how these enzymes may prevent tumorigenesis at the molecular level.
