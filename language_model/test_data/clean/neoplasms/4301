E2F transcription factors regulate expression of a panel of cellular genes that control cellular DNA synthesis and proliferation, either by activating or repressing their transcription, largely in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The ability of E2F proteins to regulate expression of these target genes is, in turn, regulated by other cellular proteins that are important for normal control of cell cycle progression. Together, E2F proteins, their target genes, and the proteins that regulate E2F activity comprise a genetic pathway that is probably the most, frequently altered pathway in human cancer. This review examines this genetic pathway and focuses on the role of E2F proteins in its function. Specifically, the target genes regulated by E2F, the likely mechanisms by which activation and repression of target gene transcription is achieved, and the regulation of E2F activity by other proteins in the cell, are discussed.
