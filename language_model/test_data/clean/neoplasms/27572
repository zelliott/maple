The nuclei of the cells of most solid tumours in histopathologic preparations vary in size, shape and chromatin pattern, both from normal nuclei and from each other. These features have not been explained in terms of conventional concepts of nuclear structure and theories of carcinogenesis. In recent years, the unfolded chromosomes have been shown to occupy "domains" in the nucleus during interphase, providing a relatively uniform density of fine chromatin fibres throughout the nucleus in the living state. This is in contrast to the appearances of interphase chromatin existing as coarse clumps and fibres (heterochromatin and euchromatin respectively) as are seen in histologic preparations. Additionally, the binding of chromatin to nuclear membrane, the possible existence of a nuclear matrix, the functions of nuclear pores, and the attachments of cytoskeletal structures to the outer nuclear membrane are now recognised. Studies of genetic instability of cancer cells (many random mutations are present in the genome, which vary from nucleus-to-nucleus in individual tumours) have shown that this phenomenon occurs early in tumour formation, can be present in morphologically-normal cells adjacent to tumours, and can result in thousands of genomic events per tumour cell. These observations form the basis for the mutator phenotype/clonal selection theory of carcinogenesis, which proposes that genetic instability is an essential early part of carcinogenesis. Genetic instability has been used to explain significant cell-to-cell variability of behaviour (tumour cell heterogeneity) among cells of individual tumours. This paper proposes that a high incidence of nucleus-to-nucleus-variable mutation of the genes for factors controlling nuclear morphology in tumours can explain nucleus-to-nucleus variations of histopathologic appearance of these nuclei when some additional effects of histological processing are taken into account.
