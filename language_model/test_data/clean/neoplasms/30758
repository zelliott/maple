An important trend in cancer treatment is an increasing emphasis on the overall outcome, not just on survival or disease-free interval, but also on the functional status and the quality of life of the survivor. Measuring the quality of life as a part of a clinical protocol is not enough. Measures must be aimed at facilitating optimal function and life satisfaction for the patient treated for cancer. The rehabilitation techniques used to enhance the life of the survivor need to be subjected to the same sort of scientific rigor required for other kinds of treatment. To develop data on rehabilitation parameters, we must create and utilize standardized and reliable evaluation techniques and instruments. These evaluation practices can then be utilized in clinical trials, both to assess the effectiveness of the rehabilitation techniques themselves and also to determine the effect of specific antitumor treatments on the patient's physical and psychosocial function. An organized multidisciplinary cancer rehabilitation program as a part of clinical and research facilities may be helpful. The important concept for all of us involved with the care of cancer patients is that of conveying our concern, not only for their survival, but for their function--physical, emotional, social, and vocational.
