Cells sense and respond to a shortage of oxygen by activating the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 and evoking adaptive responses.

Mitochondria are at the center of a hypoxia sensing and responding relay system.

Under normoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) are HIF activators. As their individual flux rates determine their diffusion-controlled interaction, predictions how these radicals affect HIF appear context-dependent. Considering that the oxygen requirement for NO formation limits its role in activating HIF to conditions of ambient oxygen tension. Given the central role of mitochondrial complex IV as a NO target, especially under hypoxia, allows inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by NO to spare oxygen thus, raising the threshold for HIF activation. HIF targets seem to configure a feedback-signaling circuit aimed at gradually adjusting mitochondrial function. In hypoxic cancer cells, mitochondria redirect Krebs cycle intermediates to preserve their biosynthetic ability. Persistent HIF activation lowers the entry of electron-delivering compounds into mitochondria to reduce Krebs cycle fueling and Î²-oxidation, attenuates the expression of electron transport chain components, limits mitochondria biosynthesis, and provokes their removal by autophagy.

Mitochondria can be placed central in a hypoxia sensing-hypoxia responding circuit. We need to determine to which extent and how mitochondria contribute to sense hypoxia, explore whether modulating their oxygen-consuming capacity redirects hypoxic responses in in vivo relevant disease conditions, and elucidate how the multiple HIF targets in mitochondria shape conditions of acute versus chronic hypoxia.
