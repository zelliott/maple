In this work, a nanoscale reduced graphene oxide-iron oxide nanoparticle (RGO-IONP) complex is noncovalently functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), obtaining a RGO-IONP-PEG nanocomposite with excellent physiological stability, strong NIR optical absorbance, and superparamagnetic properties. Using this theranostic nanoprobe, in-vivo triple modal fluorescence, photoacoustic, and magnetic resonance imaging are carried out, uncovering high passive tumor targeting, which is further used for effective photothermal ablation of tumors in mice.
