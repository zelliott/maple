A human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, releases a factor which activates human cytotoxic (killer) T lymphocytes (CTL) against autologous tumor in vitro. The factor, named cytotoxic (killer) T cell activating factor (KAF), is an acidic protein of 70,000 to 100,000 dalton molecular size. Peripheral blood leukocytes from two patients, bearing epithelioid sarcoma or malignant schwannoma, were cultured for 7 days with individual autologous tumor to induce CTL directed to the corresponding tumor. Monocyte-depleted peripheral leukocytes generated lesser CTL activity than the monocyte-containing leukocyte population. However, the KAF was able to replace the monocyte function. The KAF acted at the CTL generation phase as well as the effector phase. The KAF-activated killer cells possessed CD4-8+ surface phenotype. The CTL killed autologous tumor or other unrelated tumor cell lines only when they shared some of the HLA class I antigens. It was also demonstrated that the KAF does not activate killer cells without proper antigenic stimuli, because the KAF-augmented CTL possess specificity against autologous tumor or other HLA-A or -B matched tumor cell lines. The therapeutic applicability of human KAF for anti-tumor CTL therapy against autologous tumor is discussed.
