Steroid hormone receptors (SHR) are crucial regulators of disease and the basis for clinical intervention in cancers. Recent evidence confirms that microRNAs (miRNAs) impact the pathobiology of hormone-regulated malignancies. Therefore, elucidating miRNA regulation of SHR expression and modulation of miRNAs by SHRs may provide diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

Estrogen receptor status has been established as a key factor in breast cancer prognosis and treatment. Recent studies detail the interactions between estrogen receptor and miRNAs in cancers. New evidence indicates involvement of miRNAs in the regulation of androgen receptor, progesterone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor in hormone responsive cancers. Several miRNAs regulate the expression of the SHRs, while other miRNAs are themselves regulated by SHR signaling in cancer.

Cancers have distinct miRNA expression profiles that contribute to the pathobiology of the disease. In hormone-responsive cancers, the regulatory interactions between the SHR and miRNA may contribute to disease progression. The miRNA regulation of estrogen receptor in cancer has been established in estrogen-dependent cancers. The role of miRNAs in regulating progesterone receptor, androgen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor is under investigation with new insights emerging. These interactions can provide prognostic utility as well as the potential for therapeutic intervention in the future.
