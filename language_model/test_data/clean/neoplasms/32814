The immunology and immunotherapy of malignant tumours in man are still at the experimental stages. Practical use is now made of immunodiagnosis as well as immunological evaluation of tumour patients. Current research is focused on the interrelationship between immunological and neuroendocrinological mechanisms. Illustrations are provided to show how cancer chemotherapeutic agents may act by interfering with tumour-specific immune reactions.
