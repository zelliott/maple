Hypnophilin (HNP) is a sesquiterpene that is isolated from Lentinus cf. strigosus and has cytotoxic activities. Here, we studied the calcium signaling and cytotoxic effects of HNP in UACC-62 cells, a human skin melanoma cell line. HNP was able to increase the intracellular calcium concentration in UACC-62 cells, which was blocked in cells stimulated in Ca(2+) -free media. HNP treatment with BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator, caused an increase in calcium signals. HNP showed cytotoxicity against UACC-62 cells in which it induced DNA fragmentation and morphological alterations, including changes in the nuclear chromatin profile and increased cytoplasmatic vacuolization, but it had no effect on the plasma membrane integrity. These data suggest that cytotoxicity in UACC-62 cells, after treatment with HNP, is associated with Ca(2+) influx. Together, these findings suggest that HNP is a relevant tool for the further investigation of new anticancer approaches.
