The coordinated control of extracellular matrix degradation on the cell surface involves three crucial elements: secreted proteases and their inhibitors, surface protease receptors and integral membrane proteases. The roles that each of these elements play in cell surface proteolysis are described. The localization of proteases to the cell surface, protease activation, and regulation of cell surface proteolysis by protease inhibitors are key issues for elucidating the role of membrane proteases in tissue remodeling and tumour invasion.
