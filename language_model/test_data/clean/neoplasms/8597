We relate about our direct clinical experience on 8 cases of osteoid osteoma localized in the bones of the foot. Some atypical appearances, clinical and roentgenographic, of the osteoid osteoma in this bony district may sometimes cause problems in diagnosis and localization, which are exposed and discussed in this paper. Particularly, we underline the importance of bone scan in the detection of the lesion.
