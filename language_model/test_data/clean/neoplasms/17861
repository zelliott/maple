Since at least the 18th century doctors have drawn connections between cancer and heredity in the hope of making progress in diagnosis, treatment and opportunities for prevention. From 1910 to 1980, the relationship between cancer and heredity was hardly discussed publicly in the Netherlands. This facilitated the development of models of public prevention and individual predisposition for certain cancers, such as retinoblastoma, after the Second World War. Historical experience shows that the perception of the relationship between cancer and heredity is influenced by more than just rational factors. The fear of creating 'cancerphobia' has hindered this perception in the past; fatalism ('it makes no difference anyway') and stigmatisation (familial and societal pressure) may negatively influence participation in early detection and prevention. This remains a problematic issue today.
