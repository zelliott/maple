Biomarkers of exposure and biological effects have frequently been used to monitor populations for their exposure to toxic substances and for the prediction of disease risk, such as cancer. Current interest is focused on improving the use of biomarkers to better understand biological mechanisms for improved risk assessment. Such improvements involve the understanding of inter-individual variations in response to exposure, integration of genomic and proteomic technologies into biomarker studies, development of functional biomarkers, and the use of high tech procedures like biosensors and lab-on-a-chip approaches. The latter two approaches can provide unique contributions by providing specific and real-time reporting of excessive exposure. Based on the generation of more reliable information regarding exposure-specific effects, biological mechanisms, and health risk, more realistic prevention and intervention protocols have been implemented. The usefulness and application of these biomarkers and technologies will be presented.
