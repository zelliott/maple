An increase of the radiosensitivity can be obtained by means of microwave use in combination with sparsely ionizing radiation. Comparing the therapeutic effect on the model of an euoxic tumor (mice testicles) with a tumor that contains important parts of hypoxic cells (solid tumor of Ehrlich) it appears that the sensitization evidentely is seen in the hypoxic tumor first of all. No sensitization can be obtained on the euoxic profileration tissue on the testicles. The temperature enhancement ratio (equal TER) does not increase linearly with increasing temperature, but is the greatest within the scope of 41 degrees C. The mere heat effect appears in the foreground with high temperatures (43 degrees C and more). The high frequency application lets hope a solution of the oxygen problem in radiotherapy and could substitute the use of heavy particles (high LET) in the combination with sparsely ionizing radiation as far as a concentration of high frequency and heat on the tumor succeeds in.
