Alterations in the rate and pattern of cell movement are prominent features of many human diseases, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease and cancer. The ability to regulate the interactions of cells with each other and with adhesion factors in extracellular matrices therefore offers a novel approach to the treatment of these diseases. The intention of this article is to provide an overview of the role of the adhesive glycoprotein fibronectin and its receptors in the adhesive behavior of tumors, to review ongoing work that is aimed at developing agents with the ability to regulate adhesion to fibronectin, and to highlight aspects of the malignant phenotype that are potential targets for intervention with such agents.
