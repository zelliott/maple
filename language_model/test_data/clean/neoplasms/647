The antimumor effect of antioxidant vitamins (C, E and beta-carotene) as well as of the vitamins B1 up to B6 and B11 under the action of oxidizing (OH, O(2)(*-)) and reducing free radicals (e(aq)(-), H) is discussed. In addition, the synergistic action of vitamins on cytostatic agents under the influence of free radicals and the involved reaction mechanisms are briefly discussed. The very fast kinetics of electron transfer taking place within a biological molecule (vitamin B11) is shown for demonstration of the complicated free radical processes in the organism.
