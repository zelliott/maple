Since July 1984, 12 heart transplants have been performed at the University of Kansas Medical Center During this period, all recipients were screened for any dermatologic problems that may have been present, either before surgery or that may have resulted postoperatively as a consequence of immunotherapy used to suppress heart rejection. This report describes the most common cutaneous findings that in our experience include hypertrichosis, herpes simplex, warts, tinea, and steroid acne. Although these are usually not life-threatening problems, careful attention to the skin and mucous membranes may prevent serious infectious complications, improve personal hygiene, and bolster the patient's self-image.
