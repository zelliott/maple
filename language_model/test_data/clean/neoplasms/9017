The role of emergent palliative surgery in the setting of advanced malignancy remains a subject of controversy.

The purpose of this study was to identify clinical predictors of outcome in patients with cancer who undergo nonelective abdominal surgery.

Individuals who underwent urgent and emergent abdominal operations between 2006 and 2010 at a tertiary cancer center were identified.

Analyses were performed to identify predictors of 30-day morbidity and mortality as well as overall survival (OS). A risk score was derived from predictors of OS.

Of 143 patients, 93 (65%) had active disease (AD; defined as evidence of malignancy at time of surgery). Thirty-day morbidity and mortality were 36.4% and 9.8%, respectively. Independent predictors of 30-day mortality included ASA score &gt;3 (p=0.009) and albumin &lt;2.8 (p=0.040). Median OS was 5.4 months in patients with AD and was not reached in patients without AD (p&lt;0.001). Independent predictors of decreased OS included AD; ASA &gt;3; creatinine &gt;1.3; and a tumor-related indication (i.e., bleeding, obstructing, or perforating tumor). A risk or palliative index (PI) score stratified patients into groups with discreet outcomes.

Although AD did not predict 30-day morbidity, it was the dominant independent predictor of postoperative OS. In cancer patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery, outcome is anticipated by disease status and other independent predictors of OS.
