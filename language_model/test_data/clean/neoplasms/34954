Vimentin-typing was carried out on various normal and neoplastic tissues using four anti-vimentin antibodies in order to evaluate the effect of different fixation treatments on tissue reactivity in comparison to the results obtained on frozen sections. All antisera were reactive on frozen material; on paraffin embedded material staining of tissues depended on the type of fixation method applied (formalin, methacarn or absolute alcohol) and each antibody behaved differently in relation to the fixative used. Only mesenchymal normal structures were revealed on frozen material whilst on paraffin embedded material three of the four antibodies reacted also with non-mesenchymal normal structures (epithelia, central and peripheral nervous system cells). All four antibodies decorated, regardless of treatment, neoplastic cells of mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal derivation, but not germ cells or germ cell tumors. The reactivity of vimentin to its specific antibodies depends on the fixative used: therefore, in routine pathology more than one antiserum should be available for testing. Furthermore, given the variety of non-mesenchymal structures stained by the anti-vimentin antibodies, the differential diagnosis of undifferentiated tumors must not be based on vimentin positivity alone. The expression of vimentin by non-mesenchymal neoplastic cells seems to parallel that of normal tissues during embryogenesis; therefore, this intermediate filament appears to be not only a marker of mesenchymal cells but also of many immature elements.
