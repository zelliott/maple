Antibodies are a central factor in the immunity against invading pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, as well as against malignantly transformed cells. Natural antibody responses are polyclonal, comprising antibodies against several epitopes, thus increasing the probability of eliminating the invading pathogen or malignant cell. The pharmacological advantage of polyclonality is exploited in the plasma-derived immunoglobulin products used at present to treat a number of infectious diseases. However, the use of plasma-derived products is limited by their cost, inconvenience of use and potential for transferring diseases from the donor to the patient. Symphogen has developed technologies to capture the advantages of antibody polyclonality while eliminating the potential safety risk associated with the sourcing of human material. Hence, the Symplex technology has been developed to identify diverse repertoires of target-specific, fully human antibodies. For the controlled manufacture of recombinant polyclonal antibody drugs, Symphogen has developed the Sympress technology. Combined, these two technologies allow the identification and industrial manufacturing of recombinant human polyclonal antibodies for medical use in humans. The authors believe that this new class of therapeutic antibodies will be advantageous in the treatment of complex human diseases, such as cancer and infection, as it allows the combination of several treatment modalities in one drug.
