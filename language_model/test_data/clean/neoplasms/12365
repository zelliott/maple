This study elicited the views of parents of children with cancer on siblings' needs and on support offered. A questionnaire obtained views from parents in 86 families (159 well siblings, mean age 10.5 years). Parents felt that current support was inadequate. Parents were willing for siblings to be involved in most therapeutic interventions; however, practicalities presented an obstacle to allowing their child's attendance. Parents who believed that their well child was likely to have problems as a result of the diagnosis were more willing (p &lt; 0.004) and more able (p &lt; 0.01) to take their child to therapeutic interventions. The weekend interventions and leaflets developed as a result of this study are described.
