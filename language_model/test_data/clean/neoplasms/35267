Hypoxia has long been recognized as a common feature of solid tumors and a negative prognostic factor for response to treatment and survival of cancer patients. The discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a molecular determinant of the response of mammalian cells to hypoxia, has led to the identification of a "molecular target" of hypoxia suitable for the development of cancer therapeutics. Early controversy about whether or not HIF-1 is a good target for therapy has not discouraged academic groups and pharmaceutical companies from actively engaging in the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of HIF. However, what is the best strategy to inhibit HIF and how HIF inhibitors should be developed for treatment of human cancers is still poorly defined. In this review, aspects related to the identification and early development of novel HIF inhibitors are discussed. Identification and validation of pharmacodynamic end points relevant to the HIF-1 pathway is essential for a rational development of HIF inhibitors. Integration of these biomarkers in early clinical trials may provide valuable information to determine the contribution of HIF inhibitors to response to therapy. Finally, HIF inhibitors should be incorporated in combination strategies to effectively target multiple cellular components of the tumor microenvironment and redundant signaling pathways frequently deregulated in human cancer.
