Invasive fungal infections have emerged as important causes of morbidity and mortality in profoundly immunocompromised patients with cancer. Current treatment strategies for these infections are limited by antifungal resistance, toxicity, drug interactions, and expense. In order to overcome these limitations, new antifungal compounds are being developed, which may improve our therapeutic armamentarium for prevention and treatment of invasive mycoses in high-risk patients with neoplastic diseases.
