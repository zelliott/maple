Modern combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens have a substantial negative impact on reproduction. Premature ovarian failure and other poor reproductive outcomes subsequent to cancer therapies are being recognized. Furthermore, beside malignancies, treatment of certain precancerous and benign conditions such as myelodysplasia, aplastic anemia, and systemic lupus erythematosus may necessitate administration of high-dose chemotherapeutics with and without stem cell transplantation. Therefore, preservation of gonadal function and fertility has become one of the major quality of life issues for cancer survivors at reproductive ages. In this review, premature ovarian failure and other adverse reproductive outcomes in female patients who receive chemotherapy and radiation will be discussed and the options to preserve their fertility will be delineated. After completion of the educational activity, the reader will be better able to distinguish the experimental approaches to minimizing gonadotoxic therapy, and use the most effective treatment options.
