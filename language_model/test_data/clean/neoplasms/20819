To discuss and describe the role of relaxation and imagery in the care of patients with cancer, including suggestions for enhancing assessment and brief instructions for implementing basic interventions.

Relaxation and imagery are commonly used to treat various side effects of cancer and its treatment. The nursing literature often has encouraged nurses to use relaxation and imagery to assist patients in managing pain, nausea, vomiting, and anxiety. Frequently, the literature has presented these techniques as being simple, harmless interventions requiring little assessment, planning, or individualization.

Simplistic, generalized approaches may result in suboptimal treatment or deleterious responses.

Clinicians must assess and collaborate with patients in developing an appropriate strategy that fits the individual's preferences and beliefs.
