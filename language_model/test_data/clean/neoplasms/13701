Recombinant immunoglobulin libraries of single chain molecules (sc) from the variable domains of antibody light and heavy chains (Fv), have great promise for new approaches to radioimmunotherapy (RIT). However, creating and evaluating scFv from diverse sources is time consuming and differences in molecular format can influence in vitro and in vivo characteristics. Furthermore, scFv do not have optimal characteristics for targeting therapy to tumor because of their small size and univalent binding. Diabody molecules at least twice the size of scFv are better for RIT because bivalent and bispecific molecules can be constructed. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based primer system was created to easily convert scFv genes into a diabody gene format, once they have been placed into pCANTAB 5E, a readily available vector. The primer system for this diabody gene platform was developed and tested by constructing an anti-lymphoma/anti-chelate, bispecific diabody (anti-HLA-DR/anti-DOTA). Two mouse scFv libraries were screened for reactive clones using recombinant phage display techniques. Selected mouse anti-HLA-DR and anti-DOTA scFv genes were combined, ligated into the pCANTAB 5E vector that co-expressed these self-assembling scFv in E. coli as two mismatched nonlinked pairs (VHA-link-VLB; VHB-link-VLA). The diabody protein that was purified from periplasm had the expected molecular characteristics when analyzed by sequencing, chromatography, electrophoresis and Western blot. This modular gene design platform provides methodology for easy and rapid creation of diabody molecules from diverse scFv libraries. Diabodies from various scFv can easily be produced, thereby facilitating comparative preclinical studies en route to development of new tumor targeting molecules.
