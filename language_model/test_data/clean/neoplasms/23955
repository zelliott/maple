The aim of this paper is to compare ondansetron to other antiemetic products used in cancerology. Twenty randomised trials studying ondansetron, and published in international reviews, were analyzed and synthesized. The conclusion is that ondansetron is of demonstrated short term efficiency. It seems to be slightly more efficient than metoclopramide, and its association with dexamethasone increases its efficiency. Doses of 8 mg or 24 mg do not differ from doses of 32 mg, and bolus administration from infusion administration. There are no data on the duration of the protection after the first course of chemotherapy.
