Metastatic cancer cells degrade extracellular matrix containing collagen. In this study, a variety of different polymer prodrugs have been synthesized and embedded in collagen gels for application in a metastasis-associated drug delivery system (DDS). Dendrimer-doxorubicin (Dox) prodrugs were prepared with different surfaces, including collagen peptides and polyethylene glycol. Furthermore, Dox was conjugated to linear poly(glutamic acid) (poly-Glu) instead of the dendrimer. The cytotoxicities of each of these polymer prodrug systems against the poorly invasive MCF-7 and highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells were similar. The highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells, however, were more sensitive than the MCF-7 cells to the polymer prodrugs-embedded collagen gels, suggesting that these polymer prodrugs/collagen hybrid gels would be useful for the development of metastasis-associated DDSs. The cytotoxicities of the polymer prodrugs were dependent on their chemical compositions. The collagen peptide-conjugated dendrimer prodrug/collagen hybrid gel demonstrated in vivo anticancer effects in an orthotopic metastatic mouse model.
