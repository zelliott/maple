Our experience with 168 consecutive implantable chamber catheters over a one year period led us to establish the criteria for this implantation technique. Implantation should be carried out under local anaesthesia and be well tolerated and comfortable for the patient who is often weak. It should be a first indication technique in order to save the venous capital. Based on our experience, subclavian implantation corresponds best to these criteria.
