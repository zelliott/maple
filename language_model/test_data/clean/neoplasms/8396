The biological basis for DNA-cytometric assistance in the diagnostic evaluation of dysplasias and borderline lesions is "chromosomal aneuploidy" as a marker for neoplasia. The detection of its equivalent in DNA-cytometry ("DNA-aneuploidy") may be taken as a marker for neoplastic transformation. Examples for the DNA-cytometric detection of prospective malignancy are reported for cervical dysplasias, myelodysplasias and borderline cystadenomas of the ovary. Further examples are given for diagnostic assistance in the cytological detection of malignant cells in touch preparations from soft tissue and bone tumours and in urine samples. The basis for "DNA-grading" of malignancy is the fact that the modal chromosomal aneuploidy and its variability in many tumours correlate with the patients prognosis. The prognostic validity of their DNA-cytometric equivalents (modal DNA-ploidy = stemline-ploidy and 2c Deviation Index resp.) are demonstrated for chronic myelogenous leukemias and urinary bladder cancers. Other DNA-cytometric parameters may also be prognostically valid. Data, concerning the prognostic relevance of DNA-cytometry are known for at least 18 different tumour sites. The reproducibility of "DNA-grading" of malignancy is high as compared with subjective morphological grading systems. Modern technological equipment for Feulgen-staining and interactive DNA-measurements for diagnostic purposes is described.
