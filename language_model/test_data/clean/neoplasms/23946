We selected the data from performance status, disease state, skin tests, circulating lymphocytes and relative subsets, serum immunoglobulin classes to evaluate the immune response in 29 neoplastic patients treated with surgery and undergoing Thymostimulin administration during long term follow-up. Moderate drug intolerance was observed in 3 patients. After treatment lymphocyte count increase (41% mean increase) in 61.5% of cases; CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16 respectively 95-74-87-82% of cases; immunoglobulin classes in about 90% of cases. A clear-cut improvement of Karnofsky's index was observed in 34.6% of cases, worsening in 11.5%. A manifest improvement in the delayed hypersensitivity skin test resulted in 36% of cases. Most patients (85%) have shown signs of complete disease remission. Disease progression was observed only in 3 patients. There were no infections during this study.
