A study was carried out on the cause of death of 100 lower limb amputees who had been admitted to the Dundee Limb Fitting Centre, Tayside, Scotland for prosthetic management or wheelchair training. A comprehensive database has been established in the Centre for 25 years and the database is updated regularly. The date of death was collected and recorded. One hundred sequential deaths were investigated to review the cause of their death and compare this with the recorded causes of death for the Tayside population for the year of study. Ninety three per cent had an amputation for vascular related causes, with 73% having a below-knee amputation and 17% above-knee. Heart disease was the most frequent recorded cause of death (51%) of the amputee whereas only 28.1% of the Tayside group died from this pathology (p less than 0.01). Carcinomatosis was reported as a cause of death in 14% of the amputees and 23.5% of the Tayside group. Cerebrovascular disease caused death in 6% of the amputees and in 12.3% of the Tayside group (both p less than 0.01). These findings confirm earlier suggestions that vascular amputees die from heart disease more often than the general population.
