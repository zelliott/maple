The past few years have seen a tremendous interest in the potential of proteomics to address unmet needs in biomedicine. Such unmet needs include more effective strategies for early disease detection and monitoring and more effective therapies, in addition to developing a better understanding of disease pathogenesis. Proteomics is particularly suited for investigating biological fluids to identify disease-related alterations and to develop molecular signatures for disease processes. However, much of the effort undertaken in clinical proteomics to date represents either demonstrations of principles or relatively small-scale studies when compared with genomics effort and accomplishments or more pertinently when contrasted with the tremendous untapped potential of clinical proteomics. Clearly, we are in the early stages. What seems to be urgently needed is an organized effort to build a solid foundation for proteomics that includes developing a much needed infrastructure with adequate resources. The Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) is fostering an organized international effort in proteomics that includes initiatives around organ systems and biological fluids that have disease relevance as well as development of proteomics resources.
