The patients with nephrotic syndrome frequently associate with solid tumors as well as hematologic malignancies, although the presence of nephrotic syndrome in patients with malignancy is rare. The association cannot be explained by chance alone, because it occurs at a rate. Theoretically, malignancy-associated glomerulopathy should be explained by at least two clinical criteria. First, a remission of proteinuria achieves after surgical removal of tumor or disappearance of tumor by chemotherapy. Second, relapse of proteinuria occurs after recurrence of malignancy. However, pathophysiologic link which is the third important criteria has not been established between the two diseases.
