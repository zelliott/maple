Cigarette smokers have high carboxyhaemoglobin levels which can promote tumour radioresistance. Inhalation of carbogen gas shortens the half-life of carboxyhaemoglobin, increasing tumour radiosensitivity in animal models. Breathing 2.5% carbogen for 30 min results in a greater reduction in venous blood COHb levels than breathing 5% carbogen for 7 min.
