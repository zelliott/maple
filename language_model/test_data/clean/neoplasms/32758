By differentiation of creatine kinase isoenzyme activities in sera using immunological methods the published data about occurrence of creatine kinase BB activities in patients with different diseases or after surgical treatment, respectively, cannot be verified in general. With a frequency in the order of magnitude of 1 : 1000 in the serum of old patients (age 57 to 85 years with one exception), however, creatine kinase BB activities can be measured. The range of activities is 15 to 234 U/1, or 19 to 94% of total creatine kinase activities, respectively. At the present time there is no possibility to correlate this phenomenon to any specific disease. These cases are detected by abnormally high results of CK-MB activity measurements with the immunoinhibition test (range 60 to 202% of total creatine kinase activities) which lead to a repeated analysis using immunoprecipitation. The results of all CK-BB patients investigated till now are presented and discussed.
