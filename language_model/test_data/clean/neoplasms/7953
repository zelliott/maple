The benefits of pharmacokinetics can be considered from two points of view, the impact on the average patient and that on the individual patient. For the average patient, pharmacokinetic studies answer basic questions about dose, schedule, and route of administration. For the individual patient, benefits are derived from the ability of pharmacokinetic studies to define parameters of toxicity and suggest possible dose modifications.
