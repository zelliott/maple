A detailed procedure of a new photometric assay for total diamines and polyamines in human urine using soybean seedling amine oxidase (SSAO) as an enzyme reagent is described. It is based on the unique substrate specificity of SSAO that the enzyme is active toward all diamines and polyamines. The amines were purified from urine by cation-exchange chromatography and incubated with SSAO. Hydrogen peroxide formed in the oxidase reaction was measured photometrically by coupling 4-aminoantipyrine with phenol in the presence of peroxidase. For its simplicity and sensitivity, our method seems useful for routine clinical investigation. The data obtained from normal subjects and patients of various cancers are presented to validate the present method.
