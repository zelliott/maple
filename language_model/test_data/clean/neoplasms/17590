Sera from 120 children and young adults with acute leukaemia (59), various other tumours (53) and histiocytosis X (eight) were studied for the presence and characteristics of circulating immune complexes (CIC). Serial and parallel testing was performed using: C1q binding (solid phase), Raji cell radioimmunoassay and anti-C3 (solid phase). CIC were detected in 36 of 56 (64%) patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and in 62% of other tumour subjects. In the ALL sera, the mean positive C1q binding was 5.4 s.d., Raji cell 4.2 s.d. and anti-C3 4.4 s.d. In 12 ALL sera CIC were characterized for molecular size by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Most samples showed high molecular weight (19S) complexes but intermediate (11-14S) and smaller (8-9S) complexes were also detected. There was no apparent relationship between the presence, amount or physical size of the detectable CICs and clinical course of the patients studied; 12 patients with ALL in long term remission showed presence of CIC at some time during their course. Immune complexes precipitated from leukaemic sera were also examined for the presence of common ALL antigen (cALL) and Ia(DR) antigens utilizing rabbit antisera and mouse monoclonal antibodies. Experiments with isolated immune complexes from ALL sera provided no positive evidence for the presence of cALL antigen or Ia antigen within immune complex materials from ALL patients.
