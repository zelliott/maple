Advances in the treatment of childhood cancer have produced dramatic changes in survival. Unfortunately, many of the advances associated with this improvement have been accompanied by delayed sequelae induced by treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. This article reviews published reports of treatment sequelae and examines their impact on the design of current forms of treatment. Recognition of the delayed effects of these treatment modalities has resulted in alterations in established therapies. This alteration is an ongoing process and demonstrates the concern of physicians with improving quality of life for long-term survivors of childhood cancer.
