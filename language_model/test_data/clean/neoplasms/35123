The primary care physician must be able to recognize potentially life threatening or permanently disabling oncologic complications that may be prevented or reversed by foresight or prompt action. The physician must be able to assist the patient in treatment decisions and recognize those situations in which palliation is possible. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of oncologic emergencies and paraneoplastic syndromes may both improve the quality of life and increase the length of survival in the patient with cancer.
