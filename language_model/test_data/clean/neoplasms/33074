In recent years, anti-angiogenic treatments have been shown to synergize with traditional chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic regimens. Combining anti-angiogenesis with targeted anti-proliferative agents might also be synergistic. Several lines of evidence point to the validity of this approach, and preliminary results of ongoing and recent studies support it.

The background and current status of anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative treatments will be summarized, as well as the evidence supporting and antagonizing their combined use in the clinic.

Relevant literature was reviewed using PubMed search, and recent major conference proceedings and other relevant data were searched through internet publications.

Combining anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative treatments seems a promising approach, although not in all clinical circumstances.
