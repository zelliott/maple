Bronchi, pancreatic ducts, and colons from adult human were maintained as xenografts in congenitally athymic nude N:NIH(S) mice for 715, 145, and 89 days, respectively. After an ischemic crisis and revascularization of the human tissue, the epithelium regenerated to a normal differentiated morphology. The long-term survival of normal adult human epithelial tissues as xenografts provides model systems for the study of the interactions of chemical and/or physical carcinogens with human tissues.
