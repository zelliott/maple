Given the important role tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) antagonists play in managing rheumatoid arthritis and the concern for safety during longterm therapy, we reviewed the latest evidence regarding longterm risk of infection and malignancy with TNF-α antagonists. Our objective was to provide clinicians with information that can be used to counsel and monitor patients who may be candidates for biologic therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Risk is examined in the context of background infection and malignancy rates in RA. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) data and observational studies summarizing the risk of infection and/or malignancy in RA and specific risks associated with the use of anti-TNF-α biologic agents (adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept) were identified through a PubMed search. Overall, patients with RA appear to have an approximately 2-fold increased risk of serious infection compared to the general population and non-RA controls, irrespective of TNF-α antagonist use. Although data on infection rates with TNF-α antagonist use are contradictory, caution is merited. Recent analyses suggest that the risk of infection is highest within the first year. Regarding malignancy risk, RCT and observational data are also conflicting; how ever, caution is warranted regarding lymphoproliferative cancers in children and adolescents.
