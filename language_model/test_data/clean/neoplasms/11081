Transfer factor (TF) consists of messenger peptides produced by activated T lymphocytes as part of cellular immunity, and it acts in virgin lymphocytes through TF inducers, suppressors and specific antigens. TF is not immunogenic because it is not species-specific, since it contains a consensus sequence of amino acids LLYAQDL/VEDN. TF extracted from leukocytes can transfer immunity from a human to another species. TF extracts are complex, containing more than 200 molecules with molecular weights ranging from 1 to 20 kDa. The antigen specific transfer factors (STF) have molecular weights between 3,5 and 5 kDa. TF is easy to prepare and well tolerated. It does not contain HL-A antigens against potential receptors and it can used as adjuvant therapy in several diseases.
