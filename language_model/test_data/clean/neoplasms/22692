All class I PI3K enzymes are obligate heterodimers, consisting of a catalytic subunit tightly bound to a regulatory subunit. The regulatory subunit influences the subcellular location, binding partners, and activity of the catalytic subunit. Regulatory subunits also possess adaptor functions in cellular signaling, which are largely independent of their role in regulating PI3K activity. This chapter reviews the structure and function of PI3K regulatory subunits, focusing on the class IA subgroup.
