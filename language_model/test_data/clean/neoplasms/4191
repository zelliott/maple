In this paper a fast autofocus unit is introduced for fluorescence microscopy based on image content information. The module, an electronic board with several differentiators and integrators, is designed for high-speed autofocusing and is directly coupled to the output of the video camera. A Leitz MPV II fluorescence microscope with x, y, z stepping motors was used as basic equipment. The microscope images were focused by using an intensified target camera with a following analogue-digital converter and a PC. Thus one obtains a focus value for the current image within one video cycle. Furthermore, it is possible to process three different focus functions (weighted intensity, first derivative and second derivative) simultaneously. The flexibility to select a certain focus function or a combination of these functions allows the use of the analogue detector for various cell types and fluorescent dyes. In order to test the experimental set-up we use three different kinds of biological specimen (lymphocytes, fibroblasts and comet cells) which are distinguished by large differences in their morphological structure. Successful focusing is carried out in more than 95% of cases (investigation of several hundred different cells). The focusing procedure is almost finished after 1-2 s.
