Acquisition of new blood vessels is a required step in malignant transformation, tumor growth, and metastasis. Inhibition of angiogenesis is one of the most promising new strategies for the treatment of malignant neoplasms. In recent years, several antiangiogenic compounds, including TNP-470, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, carboxyamidotriazole, and tecogalan sodium, have entered clinical trials. In this we review, we look at the results of early clinical trials of these agents and discuss the new angiogenesis inhibitors in preclinical development.
