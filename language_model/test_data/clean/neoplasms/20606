Both flow and image cytometry have routine, reliable methods for ploidy analysis, each with its dbacks. LSC offers a non-destructive and non-consumptive method of analysis that allows repeated sample analysis as well as storage for later re-evaluation. Owing to the extremely small sample requirement, specimens can be obtained through minimally invasive procedures such as fine-needle aspirate biopsies or simple swabs. Tumors located at sites unsuitable for routine biopsy can be analyzed even on an out-patient basis.
