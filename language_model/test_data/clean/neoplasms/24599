In the nucleus, DNA is wrapped around octamers of histone proteins. Histones, like other proteins, are posttranslationally modified by the addition of an array of chemical groups that affect their interactions with surrounding structures. Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are the enzymes involved in the addition and removal, respectively, of acetyl groups from the aminoterminal tails of histones. A number of structurally diverse compounds are capable of inhibiting HDACs and exert a variety of biologic effects on cancer cells in preclinical models. Early clinical trials with the first generation of HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) have demonstrated promising therapeutic activity, and HDACs have become one of the hottest targets in drug development today.
