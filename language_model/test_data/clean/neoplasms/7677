Eighteen adult patients with solid tumors were treated with oral menogaril, a new anthracycline antibiotic active against human breast cancer after intravenous administration. The drug was given orally on 3 consecutive days every 4 weeks at doses ranging from 50 to 175 mg/m2/day. Reversible and dose-related leukopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. At doses from 50 to 150 mg/m2/day, non-hematologic side effects of oral menogaril were unfrequent and mild and consisted of nausea and vomiting (1 patient), alopecia (2 patients), mucositis (2 patients) and liver function test abnormalities (3 patients). The only patient treated at a daily dose of 175 mg/m2 developed grade IV leukothrombocytopenia, with fever and gastrointestinal bleeding. This was followed by heart insufficiency and the patient died from multisystem organ failure. A dose of 150 mg/m2/day for 3 consecutive days is recommended for phase II trials with oral menogaril.
