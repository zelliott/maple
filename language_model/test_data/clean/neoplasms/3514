Studies suggest that the mass media is a common source of cancer information for the public. However, the quality of cancer information through various print outlets has not been extensively investigated.

To assess the accuracy of cancer information in a retrospective sample of Ontario daily newspapers as well as to determine the amount of mobilizing (enabling) information about community resources for cancer.

Of 1,027 articles on cancer for 1991, drawn from the 5 highest and 5 lowest circulating newspapers, a random 30% sample (306 articles) was obtained. Only 40 articles had traceable citations (journal name, name of researcher, name of educational institution, or direct quotes from identifiable sources). Of these, 47.5% had misleading titles and 55% included erroneous information or omitted important study results. Only 13 (6.9%) included mobilizing information regarding prevention, diagnosis, treatment or support.

Cancer information in newspapers contain frequent inaccuracies and fail to provide mobilizing information. Inaccurate newspaper information about cancer is of concern if the public relies on this channel for at least part of their health knowledge.
