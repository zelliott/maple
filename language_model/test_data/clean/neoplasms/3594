To investigate the blood fibrinogen (FIB) content before and after chemotherapy or radiotherapy in 43 malignant tumor patients.

COULTER ACL-200 automated coagulation analyzer was used in monitoring FIB in the patients.

The FIB content was significantly higher in malignant tumor patients than that in benign disease patients. Significant reduction was observed after treatment which became elevated again when there was recurrence or metastasis.

Assessment of FIB not only helps to diagnose cancers but evaluate the therapeutic effect and prognosis also.
