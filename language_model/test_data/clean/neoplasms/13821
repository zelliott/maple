The literature suggests that healthcare provision for ethnic minority groups is poorer than for the majority population. The intention of this paper is to review the literature available on healthcare provision for ethnic minority groups to see if this is the case for those with cancer. The introduction in the UK of monitoring of ethnic origins in the general population and healthcare service is recent and means that there are few data available. At present, cancer mortality is lower among ethnic minority groups than the majority population in the UK, which may partly be explained by a younger than average age within the ethnic minority groups and the fact that some members of ethnic groups retire to their country of origin. However, the mortality rates are expected to increase as the population ages. Breast and lung cancers are the most common cancers among ethnic minority groups in the UK. Traditional intervention strategies have been aimed at the majority white population and have not taken into account the needs identified by the ethnic communities themselves. Intervention strategies include advice on stopping smoking and chewing tobacco, increasing use of screening services by ethnic minority groups, targeted health promotion messages and education on cancer specifically for these groups. More data are required on cancer among ethnic minority groups in the UK. There are many similarities in the use of cancer services between ethnic minority groups and individuals with lower socioeconomic status in the UK.
