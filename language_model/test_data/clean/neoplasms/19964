Investigation of the constituents of the whole plant of Hyptis suaveolens led to the isolation of three new abietane diterpenes, isosuaveolic acid (1), 8α,9α-epoxysuaveolic acid (2), and 14-O-methylsuaveolic acid (3), together with eleven known compounds. The structures of 1-3 were established by spectroscopic methods and chemical correlations. Some isolates were tested for their antimycobacterial and cytotoxic activities.
