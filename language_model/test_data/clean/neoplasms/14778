Antitumor agents can inhibit tumor growth by 4 major cellular mechanisms; suppressing proliferation, inducing differentiation, killing the cells or forcing them to senescence. Senescent cells (CS) are in permanent paralysis because they are unable to divide, penetrate the surrounding tissues, metastasize, and respond to treatment. In this short review, we will focus on cellular senescence (CS) induced by retinoids in mammary pre-malignant and tumor cells and its potential clinical implication. Novel information is provided about the role of retinoic acid receptor beta 5 (RARbeta5) in mediating the retinoid-induced senescent program.
