Post-transcriptional modifications in RNA give rise to free modified ribonucleosides circulating in the blood stream and excreted in urine. Due to their abnormal levels in conjunction with several tumor diseases, they have been suggested as possible tumor markers. The developed RP-HPLC method has been applied to analyze the urinary nucleosides in 34 urinary samples from 15 kinds of cancer patients. The statistical analyses showed the urinary nucleoside excretion, especially modified nucleoside levels, in cancer patients were significantly higher than those in normal healthy volunteers. Factor analysis was used to classify the patients with cancer and normal healthy humans. It was found that using 15 urinary nucleoside levels or only five modified nucleoside levels as data vectors the factor analysis plot displayed two almost separate clusters representing each group.
