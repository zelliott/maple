In Shanghai a population-based Cancer Registry has been in operation since 1963 covering the urban area, with total population of about 5.6 million. In this report methods of collecting cancer deaths and population data are described in detail, and cancer mortality data for the period 1963-77 presented. The main fatal cancers were those of stomach, lung, liver, oesophagus and colon-rectum; among females, in addition there were cancers of uterus and breast. During the 15-year period a rapid increase in cancer-mortality rate was seen for lung, colon-rectum, pancreas in both sexes, and for bladder in males. A notable decrease in mortality rate for cancer of the uterus (mainly for cancer of cervix uteri) occurred.
