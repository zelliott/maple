Concentrations of the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits of enolase in surgically resected tumors and serum obtained from patients with various endocrine tumors were measured by a sensitive enzyme immunoassay system. Tissue concentrations of the gamma-subunit were significantly elevated in patients with neuroendocrine tumors concurrent with high concentrations of the gamma-subunit in their serum, which fell to normal in 90% of those who underwent tumor resection. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that considerable amounts of the gamma-subunit were contained specifically in these tumors. These results indicate that the gamma-subunit of enolase is a useful marker for diagnosing and monitoring patients with neuroendocrine tumors.
