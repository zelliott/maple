To explore in vitro anticancer potential of Aerva lanata L. (flowering aerial part). The study was performed with 5 different human cell lines for the study of lung, leukaemia, prostate, colon and cervix cancer by using Sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assay. There were three doses of 10, 30 and 100 microg mL(-1) of each Aerva lanata L. Chloroform fraction (ALCF) and Aerva lanata L. Ethyl Acetate Fraction (ALEAF) used in this study. ALCF showed significant % inhibitory effect for leukaemia, lung and colon cancer at maximum concentration of 100 microg mL(-1) as compared to standard drug mitomycin. On the other hand ALEAF showed the significant % inhibitory effect for lung and cervix cancer at maximum concentration of 100 microg mL(-1) as compared to standard drug 5-fluoro Uracil (5-FU). From the above studies it is concluded that, the ethyl acetate fraction and chloroform fraction of Aerva lanata L. provide enough experimental evidence for anticancer activity and these fractions could be useful in medical care.
