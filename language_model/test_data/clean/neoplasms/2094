It is admitted that the risk of developing an uro-colonic tumor in patients operated by an ureterosigmoidostomy (USS) is several hundred times higher more than in the normal population. However, the evolution of these tumors and the mechanisms of this particular type of carcinogenesis are not yet totally cleared. The analysis of the observations described in the literature and the recent datas on experimental models contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of these tumors. In this review, we have on one hand defined the clinical profile and the biological behaviour of these tumors with their practical approach and on the other hand discussed the different elements and hypothesis involved in this carcinogenesis after USS.
