Tumor imaging by radiopharmaceuticals classified into two modalities; The one is a negative imaging, whereby a tumor is depicted as a non-functional cold spot. The other is a positive imaging on the use of tumor seeking agents. The detectability of the tumor as a cold spot has enhanced by introducing the emission computed tomography. A variety of effort to develop specific tumor seeking agents are in progress, by radio-labeling tumor specific antigen and its abnormal metabolic conditions using cyclotron produced radioactive metabolites as well as radiometal compounds.
