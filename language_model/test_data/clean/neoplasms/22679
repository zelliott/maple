To determine colorectal and overall cancer incidence as part of a three-pronged investigation in response to the concerns of a First Nations community in Alberta, Canada, located close to sulfur-rich natural gas installations, and to determine whether the incidence of cancers observed in this reserve was higher than expected.

A population dataset with information identifying First Nations status and band affiliation was linked to the Alberta Cancer Registry to determine cancer incidence cases between 1995 and 2006 for on- and off-reserve study populations. Using indirect standardized incidence ratios, observed cancer incidence cases for the study populations were compared with cases expected based on three separate reference populations.

Observed colorectal and overall cancer incidence cases within the First Nations community were not higher than expected. Cervical cancer incidence cases, however, were higher than expected for on- and off-reserve populations; public health measures designed to address this risk have been implemented and on-going surveillance of cancer incidence in the community will be maintained.
