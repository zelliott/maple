Simulation with lifelike mannequins is used in schools of nursing and hospital-based education as a method of teaching clinical content, enhancing clinical skills, applying theory to practice, and validating competency. It provides a safe learning environment to enhance nurses' clinical judgment and critical thinking skills in an increasingly complex care environment. Simulation can be used in the practice setting with experienced nurses to teach or reinforce complex information and allow the learner to practice without devastating consequences. Medical-surgical units in some institutions have dedicated beds for patients with cancer but may not be a full oncology unit. Evaluating chemotherapy and biotherapy competency is difficult when extensive time periods exist between chemotherapy administrations. One method for assessing annual chemotherapy competency is to use simulation.
