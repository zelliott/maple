To determine the primary sites, clinical features, treatment, and outcome of 20 patients with cancer metastatic to the eyelids.

Retrospective review of medical records.

The primary tumors included skin melanoma (4 [20%]), uveal melanoma (4 [20%]), breast carcinoma and conjunctival melanoma (3 [15%] each), renal cell carcinoma (2 [10%]), and medullary thyroid carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, lung carcinoma, and salivary gland carcinoma (1 [5%] each). Eyelid metastasis was the first sign of systemic cancer in 3 patients (15%). The most common clinical finding at the initial examination was a solitary nodule in 12 patients (60%), a flat pigmented lesion and diffuse eyelid swelling in 3 patients each (15%), and multiple nodules and epiphora in 1 patient (5%) each. Ten patients (50%) had concomitant ocular site metastasis. Primary treatment included excision alone in 6 patients (30%), external beam radiotherapy in 7 (35%), systemic chemotherapy in 4 (20%), and observation in 3 (15%). The metastatic tumors regressed in 10 patients (50%), remained stable in 7 (35%), and showed progression in 3 (15%). After a mean follow-up of 16 months, 9 patients (45%) were alive and 11 (55%) had died of systemic metastatic disease.

Eyelid metastasis can display a variety of clinical features and should be considered in patients with known systemic cancer. These patients usually have multiple metastatic sites, ocular and nonocular. The systemic prognosis is poor.
