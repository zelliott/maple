Ever since a gradual but significant reduction in the estrogenic and progestogenic components of oral contraceptives (OCs) was made, there has been a corresponding decrease in adverse effects associated with the pill.  The beneficial effects include prevention of pregnancy, reduction in pelvic inflammatory disease, protection against ovarian/endometrial cancer and benign breast tumors and ovarian cysts, reduction in the occurrence of rheumatoid arthritis among OC users, and regulation of the menstrual cycle.  The adverse effects include diseases of the circulatory system (myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypertension), possible carcinogenicity (breast, cervix, melanoma), pituitary adenomas, liver disorders, glucose metabolix effects (diabetes), vitamin status alteration, delay in return of menstruation and fertility, and a number of minor side effects (nausea, vomiting).  Contraindications to OC use include history of malignancy of the breast or genital tract, venous thromboembolism, cerebrovascular accident, undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding, focal migraine, or familial hyperlipidemia.  The following situations require medical assessment before OCs are prescribed, and medical supervision if OCs are prescribed:  age 40+, smoking and age over 35, mild hypertension or a history of hypertensive disease of pregnancy (toxemia), epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, history of bouts of depression, history of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea in nulliparous women, and gallbladder disease.  Problems could occur with OC use in the following situations:  1) lactation (ideally, OCs should be withheld until the child is weaned but if not possible, OCs should not be given until lactation is established); 2) drug interaction (other contraceptive form should be used when the patient is taking antibiotics or anticonvulsants); 3) tropical diseases (studies are still underway); 4) adolescence (very young girls should use other contraceptive method until regular menstruation is established); 5) postcoital contraception (limited use of steroids in emergency situation); and 6) hormonal pregnancy tests (use of oral steroids for pregnancy testing is not recommended).  The 3 main types of OCs currently used are the combined estrogen and progestagen, the progestagen-only OC, and the triphasic OC.  The lowest effective dose of a compound should be used, and healthy women may continue to use OCs for many years.
