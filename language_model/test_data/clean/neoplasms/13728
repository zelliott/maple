The level of serum erythropoietin (EPO) is inappropriately decreased in cancer patients and has been advocated as the main cause of their anemia. In cancer patients, chemotherapy results in a cumulative anemia severe enough to require transfusion. We investigated the changes in serum EPO, hemoglobin, ceruloplasmin, and copper levels in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. There was a weak but significant inverse relationship between hemoglobin and log[EPO] (r = -0.41; P &lt; .001). Observed/expected serum EPO ratios decline with repeated chemotherapy indicating inadequate EPO response for the degree of anemia. There was no difference in the severity of anemia and in the degree of EPO response between platinum- and non-platinum-treated patients. Ceruloplasmin, copper, and ferritin levels did not change during chemotherapy. Our results suggest that the EPO response is inadequate for the degree of anemia and justifies the use of recombinant human EPO in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.
