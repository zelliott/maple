Protein S-nitrosylation is a covalent post-translational modification through coupling of a nitric oxide (NO) moiety with the reactive thiol group of a protein cysteine residue to form an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). S-nitrosylation is a key mechanism in the transmission of NO-based cellular signals in the vital cellular processes, including transcription regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Contemporary research has implicated dysregulation of S-nitrosylation in severe pathological events, including cancer onset, progression, and treatment resistance. The S-nitrosylation status may be directly linked to many cancer therapy outcomes as well as therapeutic-resistance, emphasizing the need to develop S-nitrosylation-related anti-cancer therapeutics. The role of S-nitrosylated proteins in the development and progression of cancer are varied, generating a critical need for a thorough review of the current dynamic research in this area.
