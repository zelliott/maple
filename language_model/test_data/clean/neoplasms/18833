In an effort to prevent or reduce anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, liposomal anthracyclines have been developed. The objective of this systematic review was to summarise all available evidence on the benefits and risks of liposomal anthracyclines in children with cancer. We searched databases (MEDLINE (1966-September 2009), EMBASE (1980-September 2009) and CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, issue 3 2009)), reference lists of relevant articles and ongoing trial databases for relevant studies. Two reviewers independently performed study selection, data extraction and quality assessment of included studies. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) were found. Fifteen observational studies described the use of liposomal anthracyclines in children with cancer. Most patients had been treated extensively in the past. Some patients developed cardiotoxicity, serious allergic reactions, mucositis, infections, hematotoxicities and/or hepatotoxicity after single agent treatment. However, due to the low quality of the currently available research, it is unclear what the exact risks are. In conclusion, there is no evidence available from RCTs or CCTs about the benefits and risks of liposomal anthracyclines in children with cancer. Limited data from observational studies suggest that children treated with liposomal anthracyclines are at risk for developing cardiotoxicity and other serious toxicities. There is an urgent need for results of well-designed studies which accurately evaluate the benefits and risks of liposomal anthracyclines in children with cancer. Until high quality evidence is available, we recommend monitoring of cardiac function in childhood cancer patients treated with a liposomal anthracycline and awareness of other serious toxicities.
