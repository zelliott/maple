Dietary intake of lycopene is inversely associated with the risk of many cancers. Preclinical studies show that lycopene has potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects, suggesting potential preventive and therapeutic roles for the compound. However, clinical trials with lycopene have only recently been started, and available clinical data preclude firm conclusions with regard to its use in cancer prevention and treatment. Further mechanistic studies and randomized controlled clinical intervention trials with lycopene involving cancer patients are warranted.
