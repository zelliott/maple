The two-stage initiation-progression model of cancer is widely accepted. Initiation appears to result most often from accumulation of damage to the DNA expressed as multiple mutations in the phenotype. Unsymmetrical chromosome segregation during mitosis of normal or mutated cells produces aneuploid cells and also contributes to the evolution of neoplasia. However, it has been pointed out (Parris GE. Med Hypotheses 2005;65:993-4 and 2006;66:76-83) that DNA damage and loss of chromosomes are much more likely to lead the mutant clones of cells to extinction than to successful expansion (e.g., an example of Muller's Ratchet). It was argued that aneuploid neoplasia represent new parasite species that successfully evolve to devour their hosts by incorporating sex-like redistribution of chromosomes through spontaneous or virus-catalyzed cell-cell fusion into their life-cycle. Spontaneous cell-cell fusion is generally blocked by the intercellular matrix to which the cells are bound via surface adhesion molecules (frequently glycoproteins, e.g., CD44). In order for progression of matrix-contained neoplasia toward clinically significant cancer to occur, the parasite cells must escape from the matrix and fuse. Release from the matrix also allows the parasite cells to invade adjacent tissues and metastasize to remote locations. Both invasion and metastasis likely involve fusion of the migrating parasite cells with fusion-prone blast cells. There are at least three pathways through which parasite cells can be liberated from the confining matrix: (i) Their adhesion molecules may be modified (e.g., by hyper-glycosylation) so that they can no longer grip the matrix. (ii) Their adhesion molecules or matrix may be saturated with other ligands (e.g., polyamines). (iii) Their adhesion molecules may be cleaved from the cell surface or the matrix itself may be cleaved (e.g., by MMPs or ADAMs). It is hypothesized that mobilization of parasite cells and cell-cell fusion go hand-in-hand in the progression of neoplasia to clinically significant cancer through invasion and metastasis. The latency between tumor recognition and exposure to mutagens and the increased incidence of cancer with age can probably be related to slow breakdown of the intercellular matrix that provides a barrier to cell-cell fusion.
