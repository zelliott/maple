Complementary therapies are frequently used by cancer patients, yet the area is a minefield of hazards and hopes. A distinction between cure and care seems helpful. There are no effective complementary cures and most options that are promoted carry a distinct and, in certain cases, fatal risk. Complementary cancer care is more acceptable and there are options that can be shown to ease suffering. Vis a vis the popularity of complementary cancer treatments, the lack of scientific evidence for most therapies seems unacceptable. The call for more rigorous research is loud and clear.
