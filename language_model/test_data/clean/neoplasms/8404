The ability of bacteria and bacterial products to modulate the immune response to unrelated antigens is well documented. Propionibacteria are amongst the most potent immunomodulators stimulating cell populations involved in nonspecific resistance. Generally, the activated immune system provides protection from infectious pathogens and malignancies via mechanisms of recognition and elimination. Accordingly, administration of propionibacteria could be shown to be of benefit in the treatment of neoplastic and infectious diseases. Thus, it can be recommended for further clinical investigations.
