The present study investigated that a cancer chemotherapy protocol registration system was a safe management of cancer chemotherapy for outpatients. A protocol database was made with a personal computer and 122 protocols for 15 diseases were registered until the end of April 2005. As a result, it was easy to check injection prescriptions. Sixty-one errors including 13 dosage errors for 2409 prescriptions were corrected. The time to check prescriptions were shortened, preparation and dosage mistakes were prevented, and stocking drug decreased by dissolution liquids being made with a standardization of using the same bottle (the cost of stocking drug: 40,418 yen). Therefore, the system and database are effective in raising safety of treatments and an increase in efficiency.
