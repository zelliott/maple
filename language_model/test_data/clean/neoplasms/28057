Adenoviral vectors, which have targeting ligands for tumor cells on the capsid, no natural tropism, and carry a therapeutic payload should be constructed soon and tested in pre-clinical models. Nevertheless, there are still important considerations for the design and therapeutic use of targetable vectors. Perhaps the single greatest challenge in the future, as it was in the past, will be finding ligands that have a higher apparent affinity for tumor and/or tumor endothelial cells then normal cells. However, the advent of many rapidly advancing technologies and information including the sequencing of the human genome, in vivo and in vitro phage display, rapid analysis of gene and protein expression in any context, and new cellular targets such as angiogenic endothelial cells, may provide many opportunities for the discovery of novel and useful ligands. In addition, the interests in targeting vectors are rapidly growing with new journals and meetings solely devoted to this subject increasing annually. Within the next 5 years, we should have meaningful clinical data on targetable vectors to reassess our progress.
