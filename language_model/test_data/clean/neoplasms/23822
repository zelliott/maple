Following clinical observations showing that opiates are sometimes not consistently administered for chronic cancer pain, a survey was conducted among 1200 physicians in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Their opium-prescribing habits were assessed by means of a postal questionnaire. The results indicate that, among the majority of physicians completing the questionnaire, established guidelines and basic principles of pain control with opiates in cancer patients are largely understood. Oral morphine is chosen by 89% to initiate treatment of chronic cancer pain, and the correct use of slow-release morphine is known to 87% of the responding physicians. Unfortunately, an important minority of physicians does not follow established guidelines in the treatment of cancer pain, and up to 20% still feel that the danger of addiction, respiratory depression and other side-effects are important reasons for withholding opiates in this patient population. The results and their implications are discussed and compared with the current literature on cancer pain management.
