The aim of this study was to know the clinical characteristics of osteoarticular infection by Salmonella non typhi (SNT) in Spain.

The medical records of 14 patients with osteoarticular infection by SNT from January 1970 to December 1992 were reviewed.

Over the above mentioned 23 years, 1334 patients had been diagnosed with one or more SNT isolations, with 14 (1%) having osteoarticular infection. Seven patients had septic arthritis, 3 osteomyelitis and 4 mixed infection (arthritis and osteomyelitis). Thirteen patients (93%) presented with underlying systemic disease (immunosuppression 12 cases [86%] and hemoglobinopathy 1 case [7%]) and 5 (36%) had predisposing osteoarticular disease. The most commonly affected joint was the knee (9.58%). Involvement was monoarticular in 8 episodes (73%). Out of the 7 cases with osteomyelitis, 4 (57%) were secondary to an articular foci and 3 (43%) were of hematogenic origin. The femur (4 cases, 44%) and the tibia (4 cases, 44%) were the most frequent localizations. On nine occasions (64%) the cultures remained positive 7 days after initiation of antibiotic treatment. Only one patient died as a consequence of the articular infection.

Osteoarticular infection by Salmonella non typhi should take the existence of immune disorders into account.
