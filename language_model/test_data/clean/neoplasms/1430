The onset of cancer anorexia and the accompanying neurological symptoms and signs involve the general influence of cytokines on the brain. Using methylcholanthrene to induce tumors in Fischer 344 rats, we measured various specific components of the cytokine-induced anorectic reaction, including: (1) IL-1beta system components (ligand, signaling receptor, receptor accessory proteins, and receptor antagonist); (2) TNF-alpha; (3) TGF-beta1; and (4) IFN-gamma in the tumor tissue, the liver and the brain.

The data show that IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma messenger RNA were detected in the tumor tissue of anorectic tumor-bearing rats. In brain regions, anorexia is associated with the upregulation of IL-1beta and its receptor mRNA. All other mRNA remained unchanged in the brain regions examined.

This suggests that IL-1beta and its receptor may play a significant role in this model of cancer-associated anorexia. In vivo, the characterization of cytokine components in the brain may provide data for potential pharmacological interventions to ameliorate the anorexia of disease.
