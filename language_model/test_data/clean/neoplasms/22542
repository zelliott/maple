The purpose of this review is to update the reader on the impact of cancer treatment on fertility, the options of fertility preservation, and the new markers to assess ovarian function.

The impact of chemotherapy and radiotherapy on fertility depends on the drugs and the doses used. It often affects ovarian reserve significantly, and the presence of menstruation is not a reliable reflection of it. Fertility preservation techniques, such as ovarian protection, and preferably cryopreservation combined with assisted reproductive medicine, should be individually discussed and possibly proposed to the patients. The use of new markers for ovarian reserve assessment will help to evaluate infraclinic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy-induced effects on ovarian reserve, prior to clinical effects.
