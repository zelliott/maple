Focusing on the literature of the past 15 years, we evaluate the evidence that neurotensin and neurotensin receptors participate in cancer growth and we describe possible mechanisms. In addition, we review the progress achieved in the use of neurotensin analogs to image tumors in animals and humans. These exciting advances encourage us to pursue further research and stimulate us to consider novel ideas regarding the multiple inputs to cancer growth that neurotensin might influence.
