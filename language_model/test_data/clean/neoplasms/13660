To evaluate the long-term therapeutic effects of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT) on the treatment of hematological and solid tumors.

Fifty-one patients were recruited in this auto-PBSCT study, in which several potentially important parameters were studied including the optimal time for stem cell collection, the dose of stem cell reinfusion, the time of hematopoietic reconstitution, the disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), complications related to transplantation, and maintenance chemotherapy after auto-PBSCT.

After APBSCT, 3-year and 5-year survival rates of NHL were 83.3%; those of AML were 74.7%; those of MM were 37.9% and 19%; those of ALL were 40% and 0% respectively. Hematopoietic reconstitution was greatly promoted by granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The mean time for patients' neutrophil to recover up to &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L after APBSCT was 11.14 days in the group of the patients receiving G-CSF in contrast to 17.6 days in the group receiving no G-CSF. The most common complications of transplantation were fever, liver dysfunction and hypokalaemia, which were curable. No death was due to transplantation related complications.

Comparing with conventional chemotherapy, our study suggests that auto-PBSCT is a very important therapeutic option that can significantly improve the prognosis in the patients with hematological and solid tumors, especially in the patients with AML and NHL.
