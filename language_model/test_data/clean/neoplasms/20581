This study assessed bereavement aspects among 69 widowed spouses (mean age = 61.1; 36.2% men) of deceased cancer patients. They completed questionnaires related to psychological distress as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory (L. R. Derogatis, 1975a), psychosocial adjustment as measured by the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (L. R. Derogatis, 1975b), grief as measured by the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief (T. Faschingbauer, S. Zisook, & R. Devaul, 1987), and communication with spouse (D. H. Olson, D. G. Fournier, & T. M. Druckman, 1982). The findings indicated that women, older people, and past grief were variables that contributed to levels of current distress and grief. The widowed sample as a group showed high levels of distress, suggesting marked vulnerability and the need for planned intervention.
