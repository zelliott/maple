Here we review the role of angiogenesis as it pertains to the interactions between the epithelium and the mesenchyme, especially during tumor growth and metastasis. We illustrate and discuss several models of angiogenesis including endothelial tube formation on Matrigel. Finally, we examine angiogenic factors using the Matrigel model and investigate several other matrix molecules for their importance in angiogenesis and epithelial/stromal interactions.
