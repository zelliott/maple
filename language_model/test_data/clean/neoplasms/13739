The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and related regulations (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) give FDA staff the legal authority and responsibility to review the safety and effectiveness of drugs and biological products (including products used in cancer treatment), from preclinical testing through all phases of clinical research and marketing. FDA review activities in the oncology arena can be divided into five major categories: (1) initial review of investigational new drug (IND) applications; (2) ongoing review of premarketing research (including new research protocols submitted to existing INDs and IND safety reports describing adverse events with the new drug); (3) discussions with commercial sponsors regarding their clinical development plans, including the design and conduct of key studies that are intended to support initial marketing approval for a new product or to support the addition of new indications to the prescribing information for currently marketed products; (4) review of submitted new drug applications (NDAs) or biological licensing applications (BLAs); and (5) continuing review of the safety and effectiveness of marketed products. Through these review activities, FDA staff work to ensure that products approved for marketing for cancer treatment are effective and adequately safe for their intended uses and to ensure that the quality, effectiveness, and safety of products on the market are preserved or enhanced, so patients and physicians may use these products with confidence and with adequate safety. Because these review activities generally fall into a chronologic sequence, the following discussion parallels the development course of a typical new drug.
