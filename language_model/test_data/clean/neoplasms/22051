Obesity is a state of leptin resistance in which the membrane leptin receptor and the JAK-STAT pathway are blocked. This leads to increased intracellular concentrations of lipid metabolites, increased non-oxidative metabolism by adipocytes, and stimulation of the cell estrogen cycle. These factors are potentially oncogenic via the shared mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cellular pathways.
