Receptor-mediated tumor targeting has received major attention in the field of cancer drug delivery in the past few years. Receptors, as molecular target has opened new opportunities for cellular or intracellular targeting of drug loaded delivery systems conjugated with targeting moieties i.e. ligand. This receptor mediated targeting of cancer drug through nano carrier systems to cancerous tissue offer protection and improves the pharmacokinetics of various drugs and help to overcome the systemic toxicity and adverse effects that result from the non-selective nature of most current cancer therapeutic agents. The article reviews the scope of receptor mediated targeting of anticancer drug loaded in various nanocarriers and also summarize recent perspective and challenges in the field of nanocarrier-aided drug delivery and drug targeting for cancer therapy.
