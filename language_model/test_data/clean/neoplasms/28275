High-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy rescued by autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells is being increasingly used for the treatment of haematological and solid malignancies. While few centres in India use this modality of therapy, the worldwide experience is encouraging. We, therefore, analysed the results of our initial experience with this therapeutic modality.

Forty-two patients [multiple myeloma (17), Hodgkin's disease (4), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (3), chronic myeloid leukaemia (2), acute myeloid leukaemia (2), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (2), epithelial ovarian cancer (6), breast cancer (4), primitive neuroectodermal tumour and testicular germ cell tumour (1 each)] underwent high-dose chemotherapy followed by either autologous bone marrow transplant (n = 9), peripheral blood stem cell transplant (n = 30) or both (n = 3). The indications for transplant included either advanced stage at diagnosis, other adverse prognostic indicators during the course of their disease, or relapse. The data were analysed retrospectively in December 1998 using hospital records. Follow up data of all the patients were available.

Thirty-four of the 42 patients (81%) showed stable engraftment. Eight patients (19%) died in the early post-transplant period (day 5 to day 52 post-transplant). Seven patients died due to neutropenic infections and one due to acute renal failure. Of the 34 surviving patients, 20 were alive at the time of analysis and 14 had died. All but one death in this group were due to progressive primary malignancy. The median overall survival for all patients was 17 months and for the 34 engrafted patients it was 27 months. An analysis of factors affecting survival revealed that patients with chemosensitive disease had a longer overall survival (20.9 v. 6.1 months, p = 0.04) compared to those with chemoresistant disease.

Autologous bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation is a feasible procedure in India with an acceptable morbidity and mortality. It should be offered more frequently to properly selected patients.
