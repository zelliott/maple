CD59 is a complement regulatory protein known to prevent the membrane attack complex (MAC) from assembling. To investigate the role of CD59 molecules in human T cell activation in response to exogenous antigens, gene silencing via small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) was carried out. Subsequent T cell activation in response to both autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with tumor lysate and beads coated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and anti-CD59 antibodies was investigated. The findings demonstrated that decreased CD59 expression on T cells significantly enhanced activation and proliferation of CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells while the expansion of CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) was not affected, and CD59 mediated inhibition of T cell activation requires the binding of CD59 with its ligand on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The data support that CD59 down-regulates antigen-specific activation of human T lymphocytes in a ligand-dependent manner.
