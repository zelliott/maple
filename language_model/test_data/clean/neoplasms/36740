The efficacy of granisetron hydrochloride 20 microg/kg and 40 microg/kg were compared using a cross-over method to determine the optimal dose in children with solid tumors receiving high-dose chemotherapy. Granisetron controlled the onset of vomiting in 17 of 23 patients (73.9%) who were given 40 microg/kg of granisetron, while 8 of 21 patients (38.1%) were free of vomiting in the 20 microg/kg group. The average frequency of vomiting was 7.22 times in the 20 microg/kg dose versus 4.44 times in the 40 microg/kg dose. No safety problems were associated with either dose. The 40 microg/kg dose of granisetron appears to be more optimal.
