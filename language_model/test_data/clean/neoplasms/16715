As part of a large collaborative study, the authors administered a pretested questionnaire to 62 childhood and adolescent cancer survivors and 62 same-sex sibling controls. The authors requested information regarding attained adult height on the questionnaire. Mean adult height of survivors (172.2 cm) was less than that of controls (174.1 cm), at a borderline significant difference of p = 0.0757. Multivariate analysis examined four potential, independent variables as possible predictors of this difference. The presence of brain tumor (vs. nonbrain tumor) (p less than .0001) and diagnosis at an early age (less than or equal to 8 years vs. 9-15 years) (p = .05) were factors significantly related to the differential; sex of patient and type of therapy were not. Our findings thus identify malignancy site and age at diagnosis as important predictors of adult height in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.
