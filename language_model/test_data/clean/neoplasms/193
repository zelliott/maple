It has been a popular belief that U.S. consumers ingest approximately 40% of their calories as fat and that a high percentage is from animal sources. In fact, animal fat consumption has declined 23% in the past 20 years and the increase in fat consumption has been solely due to vegetable (plant) sources. The decline in animal fat production probably explains why the estimates discussed in this presentation fall below earlier literature references. The validity of the estimates presented here will be determined as part of an in depth study undertaken by the National Academy of Sciences' Board of Agriculture. If this comprehensive study substantiates the values presented in this paper and other recent publications, a reconsideration of the impact of animal source fats on caloric intake and diet related diseases is indicated. The U.S. livestock and meat industry is extremely aware of and responsive to the role of meat and meat products in the nutrition, health and well-being of the nation. Research programs are designed with these factors as a guide and producers continue to adjust product characteristics to meet the changing needs.
