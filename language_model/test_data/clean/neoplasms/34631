It is widely accepted that the development of carcinoma is not only due to somatic mutations in epithelial cells but also is influenced by the tumor microenvironment ie the stroma. The different stroma components produced growth factors, cytokines, the extra cellular matrix and also participated to the recruitment of the endothelial cells necessary for the tumor neovascularisation. The stroma favored the oncogenesis through synergistic reciprocal paracrine signals with the tumor cells. The stroma is determinant for the tumor progression and therefore is an important therapeutic target.
