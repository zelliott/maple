Cancer screening programs, including tests for early detection and programs aimed at identifying people with carcinogenic occupational exposure, may have psychological and behavioral sequelae. An abnormal screening result can lead to distress and anxiety that may continue even after further workup rules out cancer. Such psychological distress can affect subsequent health behavior. When testing or counseling indicates risk factors for cancer, the individual generally tries to adhere to the recommended preventive guidelines. A moderate amount of anxiety about the results may even be a motivating factor in getting subsequent check-ups. However, in some cases such knowledge leads to extreme levels of distress that can actually interfere with adherence behavior. Intervention studies now suggest that simple strategies can successfully reduce screening-related anxiety. Such interventions are particularly important to assure that people with positive tests do not drop out of the system for future screening.
