Alizapride, a new antiemetic of the benzotriazole-line, enterally given, has been used in a randomized double blind trial including 40 patients suffering from radiogenic gastro-intestinal syndrome. Compared to metoclopramide, alizapride caused a faster regression of inappetence and of the frequency of daily vomiting. Drug-induced side-effects could not be seen.
