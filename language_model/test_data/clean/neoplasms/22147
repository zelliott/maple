The survival and growth of tumor cells within the microenvironment of a solid tumor necessitates the adaptation of these cells to ER stress. Hypoxia, in the context of the tumor microenvironment, is a critical ER stress that activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). This review focuses on the role of the IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR and its role in mediating cell survival and tumor growth. Inhibition of this pathway will be discussed as a therapeutic strategy.
