The practical value of cytologic examination in the clinical management of children with cancer was determined by analyzing 2,363 cytologic specimens collected during a two year period. The specimens included cerebrospinal fluid, pleural and peritoneal effusions, urine and tracheal aspirates from 347 children with cancer. Malignant tumor cells were detected in 266 specimens obtained from 106 children with the following malignant neoplasms: leukemia 44/133, malignant lymphoma 13/64, soft tissue sarcoma 13/48, neuroblastoma 13/26, Wilms' tumor 4/18, malignant teratoma 4/13, osteogenic sarcoma 7/11, Ewing's sarcoma 2/10, brain tumor 5/6 and retinoblastoma 1/1. No malignant cells were detected in fluids from 18 patients with other tumors. The malignant cells were identified most ofter in spinal fluid, pleural and peritoneal effusions. Cytologic examination appears to be of value in the clinical management of children with cancer.
