Cardiovascular disease and cancer account for the majority of adult disease in the developed world. This review focuses on current concepts in the study of angiogenesis (new vessel formation) as related to these conditions and highlights the role of vascular endothelial growth factor. Developments in therapeutic angiogenesis have raised the possibility that pharmacologic or gene-directed interventions, based on the ability of vascular endothelial growth factor to promote new vessel formation, may soon gain clinical application for the treatment of occlusive vascular disease. Similarly, the future treatment of malignant disease is likely to involve antiangiogenic agents that, in preliminary animal work, have demonstrated an efficacy that is not limited by adverse affects. Aside from these potential applications, current investigations have enhanced our understanding of mechanisms involved in the development of atherosclerotic and malignant disease.
