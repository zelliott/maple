A major impact in diagnosis and treatment of cancer with peptide based radiopharmaceuticals is expected. Among others neurotensin is considered to be a promising candidate. However, most neurotensin analogues, which bind to the neurotensin receptor have a too short biological half live due to catabolism. Therefore, stabilized fragments have been prepared and labeled with the newly developed [Tc(CO)3](+)-moiety. A single histidine or a (N alpha-His)-Ac group coupled to the N-terminus of the neurotensin fragments were used as a bidentate or a tridentate ligand respectively, which coordinate the metal carbonyl efficiently. Affinity and binding studies of the 99mTc(I) radiolabeled neurotensin fragments revealed a behavior influenced by catabolism and properties of the metal complex.
