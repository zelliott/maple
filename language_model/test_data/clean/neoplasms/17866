This chapter addresses the impact of the disease and disease status on the outcome of stem-cell transplantation. In consideration of the other topics addressed within this volume we have elected to focus on allogeneic rather than autologous transplantation. Furthermore we have not tried to be comprehensive and discuss the role of disease status in all conditions amenable to allografting, but rather to review the evidence that exists for selected haematological malignancies. Where possible we have made some clear recommendations, but where evidence is less clear we have indicated the ongoing controversies.
