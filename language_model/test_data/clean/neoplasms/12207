The RAS-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway has long been viewed as an attractive pathway for anticancer therapies, based on its central role in regulating the growth and survival of cells from a broad spectrum of human tumours. Small-molecule inhibitors designed to target various steps of this pathway have entered clinical trials. What have we recently learned about their safety and effectiveness? Will the MAPK pathway prove amenable to therapeutic intervention?
