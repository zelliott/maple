The papers in this symposium were presented at the 1996 Annual Meeting of the Biological Stain Commission. The authors hope that the discussion of biomarkers in the papers included in this issue and the literature reviewed in them will be useful to diagnostic pathologists as well as to investigators studying neoplastic processes in general.
