The Instituto Nacional de Pediatr√≠a (National Institute of Pediatrics) is a referral, non-profit, teaching hospital. This government-funded institution is dedicated only and exclusively for clinical and research in pediatrics. In their 29 years, it has dictated the norms for patient care through a multitude of research projects in all fields of pediatrics. The purpose of our institution is to continue developing human professional resources in order to improve patient care across the country, especially in pediatric oncology, in which there is a tremendous shortage of professionals. We believe that all Mexican children with this disease have the right to have as good treatment and prognosis as the children from developed countries.
