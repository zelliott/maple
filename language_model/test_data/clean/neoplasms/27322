Having a family member with cancer has been associated with symptoms of distress. While studies have reported distress in adolescents with a parent with cancer, few have included control groups of adolescents with healthy parents. Adolescents who had at least one parent diagnosed with cancer (n=27) and controls (n=23) completed questionnaires on PTSD, anxiety, depression, cancer risk perceptions, and family environment. Groups did not differ on anxiety and depression, but adolescents with an ill parent perceived their own risk for developing cancer as significantly higher than controls. Controls reported significantly higher levels of intrusive thoughts and avoidance regarding other stressful life events. A positive family environment was correlated with higher anxiety and depression, and expressiveness mediated the relations between family cohesion and anxiety. These preliminary findings suggest that distress reported in previous studies of adolescents with parents with cancer may be due to this transitional period of life.
