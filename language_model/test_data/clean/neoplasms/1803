Phototherapy (PHOT) is a therapeutic option whose effectiveness is determined by its capability to destroy cells, with the benefit of discrimination between healthy and diseased tissue. It is based on the previous administration of a drug acting as a photosensitizing agent, and subsequent laser radiation, which brings about cellular destruction. The objective of this study is to review the principles and methods on which this therapeutic modality is based, as well as its use in the cancer field. To this end, we reviewed the MEDLINE database from 2000 to March 2003. Results show a limited effectiveness in small-sized tumours alone, and as a palliative measure, rather than as a healing therapy.
