The orphan nuclear receptors (ONRs) are a vital class of transcriptional regulators belonging to the larger nuclear receptors (NRs) superfamily in higher eukaryotes. As a result of non-identification of endogenous physiological ligands for this class of NRs, they are designated as "orphans". The ONRs on receiving appropriate signals translate into specific gene regulation. Elaborate studies on the ONRs in the past two decades have revealed crucial biological functions controlled by them relating to general metabolism, immunity, organogenesis, angiogenesis, growth and development, and numerous other tissue physiologies. Over the years, many of the ONRs have been studied for their participatory role in human health and disease. Results obtained are encouraging and interesting and shows a number of ONRs does modulate several patho-physiological conditions such as cancer and diabetes. This review discusses the current status about the interplay between select ONRs in cancer and diabetes.
