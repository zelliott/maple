Currently there are over 1,000,000 human expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences available on the public database, representing perhaps 50-90% of all human genes. The cDNA microarray technique is a recently developed tool that exploits this wealth of information for the analysis of gene expression. In this method, DNA probes representing cDNA clones are arrayed onto a glass slide and interrogated with fluorescently labeled cDNA targets. The power of the technology is the ability to perform a genome-wide expression profile of thousands of genes in one experiment. In our review we describe the principles of the microarray technology as applied to cancer research, summarize the literature on its use so far, and speculate on the future application of this powerful technique.
