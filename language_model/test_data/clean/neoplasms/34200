Shortly before his death in 1995, Kenneth B. Schwartz, a cancer patient at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), founded The Kenneth B. Schwartz Center at MGH. The Schwartz Center is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and advancing compassionate health care delivery that provides hope to the patient, support to caregivers, and encourages the healing process. The Center sponsors the Schwartz Center Rounds, a monthly multidisciplinary forum where caregivers reflect on important psychosocial issues faced by patients, their families, and their caregivers, and gain insight and support from fellow staff members. Three invited patients attended rounds and told their compelling stories; these each effectively demonstrated their fight as cancer survivors. Much of the strength that they displayed came from the different types of support they each received, and the invaluable role of the medical team. Each shared a very positive experience with 'The Wellness Community,' in Boston. The article discusses issues of support and the role of formal support groups. Types of support intervention, the impact they have on quality of life and survival are reviewed.
