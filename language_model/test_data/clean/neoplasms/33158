With improved survival rates among cancer patients, attention to fertility preservation is of paramount importance. An open-ended survey was used to question oncology and reproductive health nurses regarding their interactions with male adolescents and young adults with cancer about sperm banking. Four main areas of interest were identified: (a) key staff need to be identified to initiate discussions about sperm banking, (b) most staff felt unprepared for these discussions, (c) staff education was needed, and (d) provision of educational materials would benefit both staff and patients. The use of sperm banking, as part of the treatment protocol for adolescent and young adult males with cancer, requires the expertise and cooperation of a multidisciplinary team of experts from both oncology and fertility. Because nurses are the primary contacts with patients, nurses' role in promoting the discussion around sperm banking is crucial.
