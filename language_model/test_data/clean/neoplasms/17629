Spleen cells from eight patients with abdominal carcinoma and six patients undergoing major surgery for a variety of disease entities were assayed for natural cytotoxicity towards 51Cr-labelled K 562 target cells. Patients with abdominal cancer were shown to have relatively weak splenic natural cytotoxicity compared with the reactivity of effector cells from non-carcinoma patients. Nylon wool non-adherent spleen effector cells from cancer patients showed reduced cytolytic capacity compared with effector cells prepared from the spleens of other patients or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy individuals, whereas the splenic reactivity of non-cancer patients showed the same nylon wool separation profile as PBMC, high cytolytic activity being associated with nylon wool non-adherent effector cells. Splenic effector cell cytotoxicity from cancer and non-cancer patients was enhanced following exposure to human interferon, and inhibited by treatment with cholera toxin and simple sugars. Furthermore, fractionation of spleen cells on Percoll discontinuous density gradients demonstrated natural cytotoxic activity to reside predominantly in the low density cell fractions, similar to that found with NK cells from peripheral blood. Thus the properties described here for human cytotoxic spleen cells are similar to those described for peripheral blood NK cells, suggesting these two effector cell populations to be closely related, if not identical.
