The serum levels of total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol of patients receiving intravenous infusion of interleukin-2 as part of adoptive cellular immunotherapy were analyzed. The total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol significantly decreased to about one-half of the pretreatment levels after 5 days of infusion (183 +/- 34 to 110 +/- 19, 112 +/- 40 to 48 +/- 24, and 41 +/- 10 to 16 +/- 7 mg/dl, respectively). The decrease was gradual during each day of the treatment. Lymphocyte concentration increased markedly during treatment (4.0 +/- 0.52 to 12.3 +/- 2.95 million cells/ml) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor levels in the lymphocytes also increased significantly (1188 +/- 240 to 1442 +/- 276 ng of bound LDL/million cells). The decrease in cholesterol levels may be related to the cholesterol needed for membrane synthesis during lymphocyte proliferation.
