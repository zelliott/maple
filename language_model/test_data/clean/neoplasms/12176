We have a randomized trial to compare the operability and safety of ten 24-gauge intravenous catheters in the infusion room. In the present study, we used 3 intravenous catheters without safety covers (Jelco plus, Surflo flash, Intima) and 7 intravenous catheters with safety covers (Supercath, Introcan safety, Surshield surflo II, Insyte autoguard, Safetouch cath, Protective plus, Acuvance plus). All catheters were used 40 times. The detainment rate of the first time puncture and the incidence of needle accidents with Jelco plus and Insyte autoguard were 98% and 0%, respectively, against 100% and 0%, respectively, for all other catheters. There was no difference in the incidence of these two events in all groups (ANOVA; p &gt; 0.05). On the other hand, all intravenous catheters with safety covers revealed that 1) an in situ needle has a resistance to the catheter (i.e., a resistance during catheter release), and/or 2) blood exposure can not be sufficiently avoided.
