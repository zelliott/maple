Scintigraphy of the bone marrow was tested as a noninvasive procedure of hemopoiesis evaluation in 79 cancer patients. Scintigraphy and trepanobiopsy of the marrow of iliac bones were carried out in all patients. The results matched in 88.6% (70 out of 79) pointing to a significant correlation (p &lt; 0.01). A similar correlation (p &lt; 0.05) (80% matching) was observed in cases of irradiation of ilioinguinal nodes. Besides, the coefficient of correlation of the data of quantitative and semiquantitative analysis of marrow scintigraphs was 0.7725 (p &lt; 0.01). To summarize, the significant correlation between the findings of scintigraphic and morphological examination pointed to the potential of the former as an noninvasive procedure for evaluation of hemopoiesis.
