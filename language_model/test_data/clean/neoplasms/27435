Two studies investigating nurses' involvement in supporting cancer patients with sexuality and fertility concerns were carried out after listening to the experiences of patients living with cancer. Findings from the studies revealed that while nurses recognised their role in supporting patients with sexual and fertility concerns, they avoided the subject, citing reasons such as lack of knowledge, experience and resources. The findings of one of the studies are reported here, together with the subsequent clinical practice developments that were initiated.
