This chapter provides an overview of the application of electroporation to areas other than gene delivery. These areas include the delivery of drugs and vaccines to tissues and tumors as well as into and through the skin. Achievements and limitations of electroporation in these areas are presented. Alternative physical methods for gene and drug delivery besides electroporation are described. The advantages and drawbacks of electroporation, compared with these methods, are also discussed.
