The relatively recent introduction of CyberKnifeÂ® in the field of radiotherapy has prompted the question of accessibility and usefulness of this technique for seniors. From June 2007 to June 2009, we treated 345 patients of all ages with CyberKnife as part of a single-center study. Median age was 61 years (range, 8-86 years). Ninety-eight patients were over 70 and 17 were older than 80. The treatment could not be completed with 2% (2/98) patients over 70 vs. 3.6% (9/247) among the younger (ns). Physiologic or psychologic problems in maintaining position for a long time were not more frequent among those over 70. The same was true with those over 80. Patients over 70 years old are able to tolerate CyberKnife treatment as efficiently as their younger counterparts. Elderly patients should not be restricted from access to CyberKnife radiosurgery with curative intent.
