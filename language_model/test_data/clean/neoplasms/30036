Given the central role of T cells in the alloimmune response, anti-T-cell antibodies retain a prominent place in the treatment of renal allograft rejection. During the past decades, many anti-T-cell antibodies have emerged and subsequently left the field of solid organ transplantation, but rabbit-antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and the humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal rat antibody alemtuzumab have remained.

This article reviews the literature about the use of ATG and alemtuzumab for the treatment of acute rejection after renal transplantation. Furthermore, it discusses possible side effects, including infusion reactions. A literature search using PubMed and Embase databases was undertaken using search words alemtuzumab, antithymocyte globulin, rejection, kidney and renal transplantation.

Treatment of severe or steroid-resistant renal allograft rejections with ATG is very effective, but is also associated with frequent infusion reactions and an increased incidence of infections and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. Alemtuzumab may prove to be an attractive alternative. It can be administered easily, is relatively cheap and nearly devoid of acute side effects, but the long-term efficacy and safety as anti-rejection treatment are currently difficult to judge. The increasing knowledge about lymphocyte subsets and their plasticity will drive the development of new, specific immunosuppression that lacks side effects of ATG and alemtuzumab. TOL101, a monoclonal antibody specifically directed against the human αβ T cell receptor, might be of potential value.
