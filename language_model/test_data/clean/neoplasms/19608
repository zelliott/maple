Minority groups are underrepresented in research, making it difficult to apply medical advances with confidence. In this study, we explored whether community-based cancer education sites and educators serving the African American community could be used to recruit minority participants to research.

We invited Individuals at community education sites to provide buccal scrapings, saliva samples, psychometric data, and personal information anonymously.

Culturally aligned community sites (100%) collaborated in the research recruitment, as did 83% of the individuals at those sites.

Community-based education sites offer exceptional promise for teaching about research benefits and recruiting members of minority groups to research studies.
