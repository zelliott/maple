Delivering the goods: Multifunctional, self-assembled, polymeric nanoparticles for the simultaneous delivery of small-molecule drugs and siRNA have been synthesized. The nanoparticles are composed of biodegradable hyaluronic acid, for tumor targeting and cellular delivery, and a high siRNA binding affinity is provided by a Zn(II)-dipicolylamine analogue as an artificial phosphate-binding receptor (see scheme).
