Since 1990, a wide range of palliative care services has been implemented throughout the Catalan Health Care System. In 2005, 21,400 patients received palliative care; 59% had cancer (79.4% of all cancer patients) and 41% had other noncancer diagnoses (25.0%-56.5% of all noncancer patients). Today, more than 95% of Catalonia is covered by palliative care services. Fourteen districts have comprehensive palliative care networks. A total of 140 full-time physicians work in 183 specialty programs, including 63 palliative care units (with a total of 552 beds), 34 hospital consult teams, 70 home care teams, 16 outpatient clinics, and specialized pediatric and HIV/AIDS consult teams. Opioid consumption increased from 3.5mg per capita in 1989 to 21 mg per capita population in 2004. The cost of the specialist palliative care network is more than 40 million Euros annually. However, the cost efficiency is striking. Due to the radical change in the use of acute and emergency beds, the project saves the Catalan Health Care System an estimated 48 million Euros annually, a net savings of 8 million Euros annually. Additional preliminary data suggest that symptom control and patient/family satisfaction are both improved by these services.
