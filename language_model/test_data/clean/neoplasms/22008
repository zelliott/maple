Antagonists for the Histamine H(1) receptor have been on the market for decades and continue to be successfully used in the treatment of a variety of allergic conditions. The recently discovered histamine H(4) receptor subtype is emerging as a new and complementary target for treating inflammatory conditions. In this review, we describe the receptor protein, its putative role in (patho)physiology and the latest ligands that are being developed to explore the feasibility of the H(4) receptor as a drug target.
