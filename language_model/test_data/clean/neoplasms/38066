The goal of this phenomenological study was to explore what within the lived experiences of exemplary oncology nurses facilitates the avoidance of compassion fatigue. A purposive sample of seven oncology nurses (RNs) who were identified by their colleagues as exemplary caregivers was recruited. Data were collected through semi-structured conversations that were subsequently transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed for recurring themes using three points of reference: recurrence of ideas, repetition of ideas, and forcefulness with which ideas were expressed (Owen, 1984). Findings focus on three themes: moments of connection, making moments matter, and energizing moments. Discussion highlights practical implications for clinical nurses, nurse educators, and health care administrators.
