It has been demonstrated that restriction fragment length polymorphisms of X-chromosome genes can be used in conjunction with methylation patterns to determine the clonal composition of human tumors. In this report, we show that several X-chromosome probes can be used for such analyses. In particular, probes derived from the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene and the phosphoglycerate kinase gene could be used for clonal analysis in over 50% of American females. The X-inactivation patterns observed with these probes were found to accurately reflect clonality in more than 95% of 92 tumors tested.
