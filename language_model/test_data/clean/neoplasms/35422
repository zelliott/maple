A novel folate conjugate of desacetylvinblastine monohydrazide (DAVLBH), herein referred to as EC140, was designed and evaluated for biological activity against folate receptor (FR)-positive cells and tumors. EC140 was produced by coupling a peptidic analogue of the vitamin folic acid to DAVLBH via an acylhydrazone bond. This water-soluble conjugate was found to retain high affinity for FR-positive cells, and it produced specific, dose-responsive activity in vitro. Initial in vivo tests confirmed EC140's activity in both syngeneic and xenograft models. Hence, enduring complete responses were observed in animals bearing established, subcutaneous tumors prior to therapy using regimens that produced minor toxicity. In contrast, treatment with the unconjugated DAVLBH drug produced nominal efficacy when dosed at its MTD. Overall, EC140's performance in vitro and in vivo warrants further preclinical study before this novel targeted chemotherapeutic is considered for clinical investigation.
