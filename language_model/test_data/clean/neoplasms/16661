The successful management of cancer-related nausea and vomiting is dependent upon many factors. An understanding of the various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions serve as the foundation for symptom control. The most important variable, however, is the nurse's commitment to alleviate these symptoms. Such commitment requires flexibility, tenacity, and a willingness to serve as a patient advocate. Regardless of the care setting, the nurse remains in a pivotal position to facilitate the optimal management of symptoms. Tremendous opportunities exist for nurses to collaborate across a variety of settings in order to ensure continuity. Such continuity enhances patient care but most important assures individuals (and their significant others) that their history is known and that they do not have to fear poor emetic control because of caregiver ignorance. The ability to initiate or support behavioral interventions demonstrates the nurse's commitment to holistic care. Such holism is the foundation and reward of cancer nursing practice.
