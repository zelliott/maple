The field of cytogenetics has already entered the molecular era and a rapid expansion of its contribution is seen in genomic disease management. Among the evolving advanced molecular techniques, with an impeccable balance of high specificity, sensitivity and assay rapidity, fluorescence in situ hybridization has made its home in routine clinical laboratory. Today, its clinical application is vivid in every phase of disease management of a number of malignancies. The rapid growth in the knowledge of specific associations between distinct chromosomal abnormalities and different types of cancers will necessitate simultaneous detection of multiple abnormalities using multicolor/multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization tests more often in the near future. Also, as the human genome sequence is ascertained, genome-wide screening with microarray technology will gain eminence in the clinical scenario, yield better solutions and bring the concept of personalized medicine in cancer closer to reality than ever before.
