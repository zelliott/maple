Non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) is the major pathway for the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human cells. Proteins involved in NHEJ pathway can become molecular targets in the treatment of cancer. Inhibition of this pathway leads to radio- and chemosensitization of cancer cells. This review will focus on the new therapeutic strategies for NHEJ pathway inhibition and their application in anticancer therapy.
