The CD4+ CD8- inducer helper cell and the CD4- CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor cell absolute numbers were measured in the peripheral blood of patients with various pathological conditions: with leukemia-lymphomas or solid tumors, patients with bone marrow grafts suffering from GvH, HIV-1 asymptomatic carriers, ARC and AIDS patients. The study was carried out during observation periods when they were not suffering from opportunistic infections and were untreated. In all the groups a decrease of the CD4+ CD8- cell absolute number was observed. In the leukemia-lymphoma and solid tumor bearing patients the CD4- CD8+ absolute value was lower than normal, while in the GvH- and HIV-infected patients, it was significantly higher. The clinical follow-up of each group indicates that GvH, ARC and AIDS patients developed infection in 40-68% of the cases, ie the only groups at risk of infection are those in which the CD4- CD8+ absolute values are high: we suggest that the balance CD4+ versus CD8+ should be considered rather the absolute CD4+ when discussing appropriate use of immuno-regulators.
