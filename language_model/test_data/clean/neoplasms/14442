Peridural morphine analgesia is a well tested method of pain relief for patients with gynecological tumors which are in an advanced stage. Traditional methods of fixation can slightly inconvenience the patient when cleaning and dressing procedures are being carried out, and the cannula can be displaced or damaged. Fifty patients were treated with subcutaneously tunnelled peridural cannula. The procedure and its favorable results are described.
