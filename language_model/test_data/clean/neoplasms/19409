The process of formation of new vessels from pre-existing capillaries is called angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a complex process which involves distinct cells, soluble components and factors related to the extra-cellular matrix and which is highly important in a large variety of physiological and pathological processes in the body. Angiogenesis regulation takes place through a perfect equilibrium between the production and release of different stimulatory and inhibitory factors which vary in relation to needs and tissue types. A large number of diseases are characterized by alterations in the angiogenic process, either by an insufficiency or by excessive angiogenesis. The requirement of blood vessel proliferation for tumor growth was observed more than a century ago. Angiogenic treatment would have an indirect antitumoral action, inhibiting tumor vascularization and impairing the supply of essential nutrients for tumoral growth and development.
