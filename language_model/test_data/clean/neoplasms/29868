A phase I clinical study of cyclophosphamide administered by 72-hour continuous intravenous infusion was conducted in 13 patients with various types of advanced solid tumors to evaluate the drug's toxicity and efficacy. The initial dosage of 300 mg/m2/day X 3 days repeated at 3-week intervals was progressively increased by 150 mg/m2/day-increments to a maximum dosage of 750 mg/m2/day. The dose-limiting toxicities were hematologic and gastrointestinal. Neutropenia was more severe than was thrombocytopenia. The lowest granulocyte count less than 500/mm3 occurred during more than half of the treatment courses at doses of 600 mg/m2 and higher. Severe nausea and vomiting were observed in patients during three of four treatment courses at the 750 mg/m2 dose level. None of the patients had microscopic hematuria or symptoms suggestive of cystitis. Partial response occurred in a patient with parotid cancer metastatic to the lung. Disease stabilization occurred in four patients, while six patients had progression of disease. The recommended starting dosage of cyclophosphamide by continuous intravenous infusion for phase II trials is 600 mg/m2/day X 3 every 3 weeks for patients with good bone marrow reserve.
