We examined usability (completion time, acceptability, and completeness of information) of a computerized format for pain assessment, PAINReportIt. PAINReportIt is the first interactive software extension of the 1970 McGill Pain Questionnaire. Two hundred thirteen patients experiencing pain were recruited for this descriptive, comparative study. Subjects used a Microsoft Windows 95/98 personal computer with a touch-screen to complete 1) PAINReportIt, 2) demographic, and 3) acceptability questions. Qualitative and quantitative data from the study support PAINReportIt as a feasible method for patients to self-report their pain. Patients completed the tool in less than 18 minutes on average, answered all sections, and scored it high regarding acceptability. Improved directions and practice screens would likely improve patients' independence in completing PAINReportIt, which would free clinicians to focus direct communication on more complex pain issues.
