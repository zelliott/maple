Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signalling molecule that acts in many tissues to regulate different physiological and pathological processes. We have contributed to demonstrate that NO stimulates angiogenesis and mediates the effect of different angiogenic molecules. In human tumors NOS expression and activity correlate with tumor growth and aggressiveness, through angiogenesis stimulation and regulation of angiogenic factor expression. Drugs affecting the NOS pathway appear promising antitumor strategies by reducing edema, inhibiting angiogenesis and facilitating the delivery of chemotherapeutical agents.
