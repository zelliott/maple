In spite of the recent epidemiological study indicating a positive decrease in cancer trends, cancer remains to be one of the major causes of deaths and there is an anticipated increase in the number of new cancer cases to be recorded in the following years to come. It is important for researchers to improve the current therapeutic agents involved against cancer, particularly targeting to inhibit tumor cell growth, survival, and metastasis. Many researchers investigate the crucial role of a proangiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the process of tumor angiogenesis, where the formation of new blood vessels carrying essential nutrients to the tumor cell becomes a critical factor for tumor growth. Since the establishment of VEGF's integral role in mediating tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell survival, current efforts are dedicated to developing therapeutic agents against VEGF and one of the emerging candidate under this category is pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF).
