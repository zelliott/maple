Eighty-four cancer patients at risk of infection because of neutropenia were randomized to receive nalidixic acid as an alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for infection prophylaxis. Infections were documented significantly earlier and more often among patients who entered the trial with neutrophil counts of less than 0.1 X 10(9)/liter. TMP-SMX recipients experienced fewer microbiologically documented infections and bacteremias and were free of infection for a higher proportion of days with severe neutropenia (less than 0.1 X 10(9)/liter) than nalidixic acid recipients. Gram-negative bacillary and Staphylococcus aureus infections accounted for the major differences. Although the majority of aerobic gram-negative bacilli were eliminated from the feces after 1 week of prophylaxis with either agent, TMP-SMX was proved superior to nalidixic acid in this regard and was associated with acquired drug resistance by gram-negative bacilli less frequently. Both agents selected for colonization and subsequent infection by gram-positive cocci. Our data suggest that prophylaxis is most likely to be effective if administered to patients for at least 1 week before they become severely neutropenic. Nalidixic acid used as a single agent in doses of 4 g daily, however, cannot be recommended as an alternative to TMP-SMX for infection prophylaxis in neutropenic cancer patients.
