Functional role of nuclear receptors and numerous coregulators have been studied in terms of regulating transcriptional control of genes that play critical roles in various pathways. There is growing evidence that nuclear receptors and their coregulators control inflammatory programs of gene expression and progression of hormone-dependent cancer. This review provides a general overview of the interrelationship between nuclear receptor signalling, inflammation and cancer. These insights provide inflammatory genes as attractive targets for the development of cancer therapeutics.
