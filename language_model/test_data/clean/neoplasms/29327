Aminopeptidase N (APN) is a ubiquitous enzyme overexpressed on tumor cells and plays an important role in angiogenesis and metastasis of tumor. Bestatin as an effective inhibitor of aminopeptidase N is used for complementary treatment of cancer with other drugs. In this work, we reformed the structure of bestatin to a new derivative LYP3 to improve the water solubility and effectiveness. The inhibitory activity of LYP3 against APN was evaluated in vitro.
