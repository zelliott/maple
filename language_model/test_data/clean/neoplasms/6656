Nafazatrom (Bay g 6575) has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of tumor metastasis in preclinical models. It is believed to work by stimulating endogenous prostacyclin production. The drug has also been shown to inhibit the growth of certain experimental tumors, to be cytostatic for certain cell lines in tissue culture, and to induce differentiation in HL-60, neuroblastoma, and Friend erythroleukemia cell lines. Furthermore, no toxicity has been seen in animals or human volunteers. We report here a clinical trial of oral nafazatrom at five dose levels in patients with advanced cancer. Thirty patients with a wide variety of advanced malignancies were treated for 26-638+ days (median 82 days). No tumor responses were seen. Toxicity included two cases with mild skin rashes, one case with nausea and vomiting, and one case with diarrhea. Nafazatrom is a safe and well-tolerated agent. Maximum activity would be predicted to occur in the adjuvant treatment of cancer and we feel that further efforts should proceed to identify the appropriate dose for such a trial.
