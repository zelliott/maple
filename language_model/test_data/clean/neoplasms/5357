In 1976-1989, 90, 128 patients with malignancies were recorded at the Regional Cancer Center in Lódź. Two different tumors have been diagnosed in 294 of these patients (0.31%), and the second pathologic growth corresponding to the secondary cancer criteria (occurrence within at least 6 months following radio- and/or chemotherapy) only in 148 of patients. Most frequently second tumors have been diagnosed in patients with: lip, skin, uterus and laryngeal cancers (2.8-0.8%). Relatively rare have been second tumors in patients with Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (0.73%). The incidence of each type of the second tumors have been different than the types of neoplasma in all registered patients. Second tumors most frequently diagnosed in the same patient have been: skin cancer of different histological structure (two cases), breast cancer and tumors of the reproductive tract as well as laryngeal or lip cancer, and carcinoma of the lungs. A risk of the secondary malignancy in patients treated with radio- and chemotherapy in comparison with the risk of the second cancer in patients treated with chemotherapy only have been 2.71% and 1.36%, respectively.
