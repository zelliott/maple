The empiric administration of anti-microbial therapy significantly reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with febrile neutropenic episodes in oncology patients. Outpatient empiric antibiotic therapy can be safely administered to a subset of febrile neutropenic patients at low risk for clinical complications.

Pediatric cancer patients presenting with febrile neutropenia after non-myeloablative chemotherapy and who met institutional criteria for early hospital discharge following a minimum of 48-hr inpatient empiric intravenous ceftazidime were eligible for the study. The feasibility and efficacy of an outpatient continuation therapy of oral ciprofloxacin (CPR) 25-30 mg/kg/day divided BID and amoxicillin (AMX) 30-50 mg/kg/day divided TID was assessed.

Thirty febrile neutropenic episodes in 26 patients were treated with outpatient oral CPR/AMX therapy. Oral CPR/AMX therapy was feasible in 28 (93%) and efficacious in 26 (87%) of treatment episodes. CPR/AMX was discontinued due to abdominal pain and diarrhea (n = 2), recurrent fever (n = 3), or gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 1). No patient developed new bacteremia or cardiopulmonary decompensation. Bone/joint pain or gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 27% of treatment episodes. Duration of neutropenia, lower absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (&lt; 100/mm(3)) at start of oral antibiotic therapy and active malignant disease were associated with failure of oral antibiotic therapy.

It is feasible to administer oral CPR/AMX as continuation antibiotic therapy for a selected subgroup of febrile neutropenic episodes defined after initial hospitalization and empiric antibiotic therapy. Prospectively randomized trials will be required to analyze adequately the efficacy of an oral CPR/AMX outpatient antibiotic regimen for treatment of febrile neutropenia in pediatric oncology patients.
