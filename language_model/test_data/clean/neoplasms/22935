It has been speculated that obstetricians and gynecologists may have relatively more problems in dealing with death and dying than do some other physicians. A questionnaire was sent to 3,229 Board-eligible or Board-certified obstetrician-gynecologists in rural and urban areas in the Southeast. Only 11% of those who responded had had any emphasis placed on the care of dying patients during their training. Only 6% had not seen any new cases of invasive cancer of the female genital tract in a 5-year period. Sixty-two percent hospitalized their terminally ill patients; 21% managed their terminal patients at home; and only 1% indicated that they used a hospice. Our data support the concept that, despite the increase in hospices and dying teams (available to 19% of respondents), gynecologists will continue to be asked to care for the dying. Suggestions for improving the training of residents in caring for the dying are presented.
