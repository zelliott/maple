A soluble complement-fixing antigen prepared from the Gross virus-induced rat lymphoma (C58NT)D reacted in complement-fixation with the sera of some patients with different malignancies (particularly acute leukemia) and with the sera of some healthy individuals. Results of gel filtration of crude (C58NT)D antigen on Sephadex G 200 indicate that the antigenic activity is eluted with the void volume of the column, i. e. in fractions corresponding to proteins of low molecular weight. Gel filtration of some positive patient sera indicate that complement-fixing activity of tested sera is associated with fractions corresponding to IgM and/or IgG.
