A new diagnostic blood test for cancer, the Structuredness of Cytoplasmic Matrix (SCM) test, has been widely claimed to distinguish between normal healthy controls and patients with malignant disease. It has also been claimed that the test distinguishes between patients with nonmalignant conditions and patients with cancer. Furthermore, it has been stated that the test makes it possible to identify the specific type of tumor in each case. In view of the importance of these claims, the study was repeated under identical laboratory conditions. Six hundred and twenty-one blood samples from controls and various groups of patients were processed in an exhaustive investigation. Four objectives were set: (1) to apply the test to a group of normal healthy individuals; (2) to apply the test to a group of patients with nonmalignant disease; (3) to apply the test to a group of cancer patients; and (4) to attempt to relate the degree of positivity of the test, if any, to the extent or stage of the tumor. Using the results described, confirmation of any of the above claims was not achieved. From this study, it is concluded that the test is of no clinical value.
