To examine the relationship between mutual spousal support and psychological health status of patients and their spouses.

Cross-sectional, descriptive.

Outpatient oncology clinics (physician, hospital, state cancer center) in the southwestern United States.

A convenience sample of 73 predominantly Caucasian couples with one dyad member receiving treatment for cancer. The mean age of the husbands and wives was 60.7 years and 57.1 years, respectively.

Questionnaires (Interpersonal Relationships Inventory; Disease Course Graphic Scale; Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale; Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Instrument; demographic form) completed by patients and spouses.

Marital reciprocal support, interpersonal support, severity of illness, interpersonal conflict, self-esteem, and depression as perceived by the patients and spouses; performance status as assessed by the patients.

The patients perceived more interpersonal support than the spouses. Both experienced more self-esteem when marital reciprocal support was balanced and high rather than unbalanced or balanced but low. A similar pattern was found for the spouses for self-esteem and depression regarding interpersonal support. Marital and interpersonal support decreased and depression increased as interpersonal conflict increased.

Mutual spouse support is significantly related to patient and spouse self-esteem and depression. Marital reciprocal support is negatively related to interpersonal conflict. More attention must be given to family-oriented oncology nursing care.

Include the patients' and spouses perceptions of balance in the exchange of marital support in family assessments. Intervene directly or through referral to enable couples to understand the benefit and obligation to support each other when faced with a life-threatening illness.
