Cancer is a disease that doctors will have to face for many years to come. Our Department of Surgical Oncology is particularly interested in altering undergraduate students' and junior doctors' performance with respect to cancer and cancer patients' care. We believe that a solid base of knowledge gained during the undergraduate period with appropriate guidance will equip doctors with the necessary discipline towards cancer and its prevention. Cancer education must be ongoing and supported by all specialists, since cancer is a disease requiring multidisciplinary attention. This survey was conducted to evaluate the oncologic aspects of the undergraduate curriculum of our medical school.
