In developing countries, implementation of effective pediatric cancer programs can reduce the overall rate of childhood mortality. To promote this objective, Monzas International School of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology (MISPHO)--for 14 countries with limited resources in Latin America--was launched in 1996.

A survey was conducted to evaluate the possible impact of MISPHO on the following areas: research, educational, and clinical activities, diagnostic services, transfusion medicine, supportive care, ancillary staffing complement, and parents' associations--before and after 1996.

No institution lost resources or activities after 1996 and there were overall gains, in particular in educational activities, diagnostic capabilities, creation of single and multiple institutional treatment protocols.

Although notable improvements have occurred, there are still important needs that have to be satisfied.
