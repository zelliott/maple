Sirtuins are the mammalian homologs of the yeast histone deacetylase Sir2. In recent years, an ever-expanding picture has emerged indicating that these proteins (SIRT1-7) play broad functions in cellular stress resistance, genomic stability, energy metabolism, aging and tumorigenesis. Among members of this family, SIRT6 appears to have particular significance in regulating metabolism, DNA repair and lifespan. In this context, new research from our lab has established SIRT6 as a key regulator of glucose homeostasis. In this Point of View article, we will first highlight our recent findings, and then provide an in-depth discussion of their implications in cancer and aging.
