Millions of dollars are presently being spent on both laboratory and epidemiological studies to determine if an association exists between the exposure of humans to 50/60 Hz electromagnetic fields and cancer incidence. This review discusses findings from both of these areas of study and focuses attention on their relevance to the electromagnetic field-cancer debate. So far, the conflicting results from epidemiology have succeeded only in raising the concerns of both occupationally exposed groups and the general public. A few hypotheses have suggested possible mechanisms by which fields could exert biological effects. However the studies on which these hypotheses are based require substantiation and further, there is insufficient evidence to indicate if the biological effects observed in these studies have any relevance to human health. It will be at least another three to five years before there are results from large scale human studies presently being designed or undertaken. From an objective review of existing scientific data it can only be concluded that exposure to 50/60 Hz electric and magnetic fields at levels occurring in our environment have not been established to lead to cancer in humans. Sufficient gaps in our knowledge exist however to recommend that research continue, especially in areas identified in the text. To assist the casual reader of this subject the complex issues of cancer initiation and promotion are considered.
