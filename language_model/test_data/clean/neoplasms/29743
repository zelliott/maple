Ninety-seven patients with cancer, undergoing radiation treatment, were studied. Forty-two were given special dietary counseling and supplements of Sustagen or Isocal; 42 controls received no special advice or supplements. Thirteen patients were excluded because of poor prognoses and the ethical need for food supplements. Nutrient intake of all groups was assessed by 3-d diet records in household measures in the first and the last week of treatment. Intake was significantly higher in the adjunctive than the control group. The excluded group, despite supplementation, had intakes similar to the control group. No difference was observed between the control and adjunctive groups in clinical status at the end of treatment or in long-term outcome.
