The antiemetic effect of alizapride was evaluated in 50 patients with advanced cancer undergoing chemotherapy with cis-platinum. Our results suggest that alizapride, in a dose of 800 or 900 mg, significantly alleviates nausea and emesis. In a preliminary study, we had established that, without antiemetic therapy, the same patients all suffered from emesis. On the whole, alizapride was well tolerated ; no major side-effects were recorded.
