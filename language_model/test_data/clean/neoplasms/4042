The taxanes represent a new class of clinical chemotherapeutic agents. A series of in vitro studies were independently of each other initiated in two different institutes (Amsterdam and Madison) to test the hypothesis that hyperthermia might enhance the cytotoxicity of taxanes. Clonogenic capacity experiments (Amsterdam) included the exposure of R1- and SW 1573-cells to 1, 4, or 24 h of paclitaxel with heat 43 degrees C x 60 min in the last hour of drug treatment or at 24, 48 as well as 72 h post drug treatment. Survival assay experiments (Madison) included the exposure of L-929-cells to paclitaxel and docetaxel for 24 h with heat 41.8 degrees C x 60 min the first or last hour of drug treatment as well as 24 and 48 h post treatment. No thermal enhancement of cytotoxicity for the taxanes was observed in these human and murine cell lines, with congruent data in both institutes. In addition, high performance liquid chromatography studies at 41.8 degrees C and 43 degrees C demonstrated paclitaxel and docetaxel were heat stable.
