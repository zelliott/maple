This is a summary of some of the points in the August 1969 report of the United States Food and Drug Administration on oral contraceptives as prepared by its Advisory Committee on Obstetrics and Gynecology, chaired by L. M.  Hellman of New York.  The benefit-to-risk ratio is sufficiently high to justify the designation of "safe."  Voluntary reporting of adverse reactions is said to be capricious and may be misleading.  Large clinics with identical record systems and good follow-up are recommended.  Also, an international conference is recommended to promote rapid transmission of information about adverse effects.  Risk of thromboembolism was estimated to be increased 4.4 times and was greater in those using sequential than in those using the combined pills.  This risk subsided when the pill was stopped.  Long use did not increase it.  The mortality rate of 3 per 100,000 pill users was accepted as applicable to the women of the U.S. Theoretical pregnancy rate was .1 per 100 women years with combined pills and .5 with sequentials.  Actual use-effectiveness rates were higher, making the pill more effective than any other method.  IUD users have pregnancy rates 2-4 times higher and all other methods are much higher.  It was estimated that in 1969 in the U.S. using it in the rest of the world.  Carcinogenicity from use has not been shown.  Metabolic alterations do not pose serious hazard to health.
