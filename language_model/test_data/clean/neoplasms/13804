ISIS-2503, a 20-mer antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits Ha-Ras expression, is being developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc as a potential treatmentfor cancer, particularly tumors that commonly have abnormalities of Ras function. It is in phase II trials. According to an April 2001 report by Bear Stearns & Co, Elan Corp plc had an unspecified collaboration with Isis for the development of ISIS-2503 [419357], but Isis later clarified that there was no agreement between the two companies and that ISIS-2503 had merely been used for the 'OraSense' joint venture that explores the use of antisense oligonucleotidesfor oral administration [419673].
