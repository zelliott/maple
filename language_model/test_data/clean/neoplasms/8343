An anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy can already appear at a total cumulative dose of less then 550 mg/m2. Noninvasive cardiological methods have been used in order to detect these fatal side effects early. For cardiological control we applied echo-cardiography with measurements of ventricular size and left ventricular function. 5 out of 39 children who were off anthracycline therapy for 3 months to 8 years showed a decline in left ventricular function, but no clinical symptoms. At present 16 children with anthracycline therapy are controlled by echocardiography. In 2 patients a transient myocardial dysfunction was diagnosed. After stopping anthracycline therapy the left ventricular function improved within 2 to 3 months without specific cardiac treatment.
