Twenty-two cytoblocks from serous effusions very rich in activated mesothelial cells were immunohistochemically tested to indicate about the presence of synthesis of Secretory Component and transport of IgA Antibodies across mesothelium; the tests were positive for S.C., while failed in order to demonstrate intracytoplasmic IgA. Authors hypothesize that association between Secretory Component synthesis and IgA transport may be not necessary absolute and that Secretory Component may play another unknown role related to glandular epithelial specialisation.
