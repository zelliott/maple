The effects of combinations of antifungal and antineoplastic drugs on inhibition of the growth of yeasts which commonly infect cancer patients have been analyzed. It was shown that (i) inhibitory drug combinations could be selected in which all drugs were at levels far below their individual MICs; (ii) interactive effects among antineoplastic and antifungal drugs may be very large; (iii) optimum combinations of drugs for inhibition of yeast growth depended upon both the relative and absolute concentrations of the drugs in the mixture; (iv) drug combinations which were effective at low levels in inhibiting one test yeast were also generally effective against other species, but the levels of susceptibilities and, to a lesser extent, the best ratios of drugs in the test combinations varied with species; and (v) to quantitatively evaluate drug interactions, it is necessary to carefully define and control all experimental conditions, absolute and relative concentrations of drugs used, and the organisms tested.
