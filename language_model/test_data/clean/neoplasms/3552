Similar changes in chromatin organization take place during development and carcinogenesis. The size of chromatin loop domains fixed on the nuclear skeleton (matrix) increased from 20 to approximately 200 kbp. These changes are accompanied by an increased size of replicons and altered specificity of loop attachment to the nuclear matrix. During carcinogenesis, inverse changes in the chromatin structure are observed, neoplastic cells are dedifferentiated and return to the initial state. In this review, we consider new experimental data on organization of the DFNA loops and nuclear matrix in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis.
