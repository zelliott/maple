The delivery of cancer chemotherapy is often non-optimal because of dose reductions and delays related to various toxic effects. These result in a decrease of the dose intensity as well as of the relative dose intensity of a given regimen compared to a reference protocol. In retrospective studies, such modifications have been shown to negatively influence the therapeutic results in many clinical situations. The ability of haematopoietic growth factors to reduce chemotherapy-related neutropenia and its associated infectious complications allows better dose-on-time delivery of the chemotherapeutic drugs. The potential therapeutic impact of this effect remains to be determined in prospective studies.
