Transgenic mice are a suitable model for studying problems of modern biology on the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. It is shown that some transgenic mice with integrated c-myc, v-myc, T-ag SV40, BPV have spontaneous tumours and may be used to study the role of oncogenes in the tumour development.
