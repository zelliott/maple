Administration of cisplatin requires hyperhydration of the patient to prevent nephrotoxic effects of this molecule.

A survey done in different hospitals - university hospitals, general hospitals and cancer institutes--has shown a large variability in the hydration protocols. A multidisciplinary group was set up in our university hospital comprising oncologists, nephrologists and pharmacists. This group has developed a consensual local protocol from a bibliographic analysis (Medline) and from the personal experience of each member.

This protocol was approved by our hospital's Committee of Drugs and Medical Devices.
