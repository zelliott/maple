Local and drug-free solid tumor ablation by large nanosecond pulsed electric fields leads to supra-electroporation of all cellular membranes and has been observed to trigger nonthermal cell death by apoptosis. To establish pore-based effects as the underlying mechanism to inducing _apoptosis, we use a multicellular system model (spatial scale 100 microm) that has irregularly shaped liver cells and a multiscale liver tissue model (spatial scale 200 mm). Pore histograms for the multicellular model demonstrate the presence of only nanometer-sized pores due to nanosecond electric field pulses. The number of pores in the plasma membrane is such that the average tissue conductance during nanosecond electric field pulses is even higher than for longer irreversible electroporation pulses. It is shown, however, that these nanometer-sized pores, although numerous, only significantly change the permeability of the cellular membranes to small ions, but not to larger molecules. Tumor ablation by nanosecond pulsed electric fields causes small to moderate temperature increases. Thus, the underlying mechanism(s) that trigger cell death by apoptosis must be non-thermal electrical interactions, presumably leading to different ionic and molecular transport than for much longer irreversible electroporation pulses.
