To test its diagnostic potential and sensitivity in paediatric malignancy, serum NSE was measured at diagnosis in 191 children with solid tumours and 25 with acute leukaemia. In stages I + II, III + IV and IVs neuroblastoma median levels were 18.0, 91.0 and 24.0 ng ml-1 respectively. For Wilms' patients, median values for stages I, II, III and IV disease were 16.6, 18.0, 29.0 and 47.0 ng ml-1 respectively. High levels of NSE were also found in patients with other types of tumour. Children in clinical remission after treatment for neuroblastoma invariably had normal NSE levels (mean +/- s.d. = 9.2 +/- 3.0 ng ml-1) even though the majority had radiologically identifiable residual disease. The values rose when relapse was radiologically or clinically obvious. We conclude (a) that, though levels of greater than 100 ng ml-1 are highly suggestive of advanced neuroblastoma, caution should be exercised in using serum NSE as a diagnostic test in children with cancer and (b) that serum NSE levels are not a sensitive index of residual neuroblastoma in patients, with initially elevated levels, that are receiving treatment.
