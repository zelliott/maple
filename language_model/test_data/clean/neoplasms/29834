The catabolism of nucleic acids, particularly tRNA, produces a variety of modified nucleosides which are not reutilized by mammalian cells. Investigation of these compounds in body fluids, mainly urine, has recently provided evidence of altered metabolic situations in tumor-bearing patients. The factors involved in the alterations of modified nucleosides formation are connected with altered tRNA-modifying enzymes and/or altered turnover of subpopulations of tRNA. A common pattern in tumor cells or tissues is the presence of isoaccepting tRNA species containing aberrant nucleoside modifications. Several modified nucleosides have been detected and quantitated by HPLC analysis of the urine of normal subjects and cancer patients. Results obtained, in the authors' laboratory, among others, indicate a possible correlation between urinary excretion of these compounds and the course of the disease, with implications for the follow-up of therapeutic treatment. Particular reference should be made to psi, which appears to be a suitable marker for monitoring these subjects. The data from the authors' laboratory also show that the analysis of modified nucleosides in blood may be considered a useful tool in the search for proper markers associated with the cancer status. In this respect psi is suggested as a biochemical indicator for cancer patients.
