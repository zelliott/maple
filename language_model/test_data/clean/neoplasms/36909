This guidance on the creation of evidence-linked guidelines was issued to the COIN Specially Working Groups charged in 1995 with producing clinical guidelines for breast, colorectral, lung, prostate and testicular cancer and generic guidelines for the delivery of radio- and chemotherapy on behalf of the Faculty of Clinical Oncology of The Royal College of Radiologists and the Joint Council for Clinical Oncology. The first of these guidelines, for lung cancer, is published elsewhere in this issue.
