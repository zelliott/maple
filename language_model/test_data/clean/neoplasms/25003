A combination cancer therapy was investigated via co-delivery of therapeutic gene encoding human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (pORF-hTRAIL) and doxorubicin (DOX) using a tumor-targeting carrier, peptide HAIYPRH (T7)-conjugated polyethylene glycol-modified polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM-PEG-T7). T7, a transferrin receptor-specific peptide, was chosen as the ligand to target the co-delivery system to the tumor cells expressing transferrin receptors. The result of fluorescence scanning showed that about 375 DOX molecules were bound to one pORF-hTRAIL molecule. The co-delivery system was constructed based on the electrostatic interactions between pORF-hTRAIL-DOX complex and cationic PAMAM-PEG-T7. T7-modified co-delivery system showed higher efficiency in cellular uptake and gene expression than unmodified co-delivery system in human liver cancer Bel-7402 cells, and accumulated in tumor more efficiently in vivo. In comparison with single DOX or pORF-hTRAIL delivery system, co-delivery system induced apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo more efficiently. In mice bearing Bel-7402 xenografts, lower doses of co-delivery system (4 Î¼g DOX/mouse, about 0.16 mg/kg) effectively inhibited tumor growth comparable to high doses (5 mg/kg) of free doxorubicin (77% versus 69%). These results suggested that T7-mediated co-delivery system of DOX and pORF-hTRAIL was a simply prepared, combined delivery platform which can significantly improve the anti-tumor effect. This co-delivery system might widen the therapeutic window and allow for the selective destruction of cancer cells.
