Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a new treatment for solid tumors utilizing the combined action of light and a photosensitizing drug. Laser-fiber optic delivery systems make it practical to treat superficial and interstitial cancers, including malignancies of the skin, head and neck, esophagus, endobronchial tract, stomach, urinary bladder, female genital tract, and other sites. The putative action mechanism in PDT involves photochemical destruction of tumor tissue membranes mediated by singlet molecular oxygen. Light dosimetry modeling based on tissue optics is applicable for treatment planning. Related research areas include non-invasive optical diagnosis and imaging, development of new PDT drugs and light sources, and the extension of PDT methods to treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease and blood detoxification.
