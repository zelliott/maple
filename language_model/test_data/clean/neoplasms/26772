Bone is the third most common site of cancer metastasis resulting in pain and other serious morbidities that can affect one's quality of life. The orthopaedic patient with bone metastasis faces many challenges and has complex nursing care needs. Managing care involves astute assessment skills, knowledge of treatments including medication, surgery, and radiation therapy, and recognition of serious complications such as fracture, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. Nurses play a vital role in the patient treatment plan by implementing interventions that promote positive outcomes and prevent injuries.
