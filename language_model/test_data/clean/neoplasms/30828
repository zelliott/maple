This presentation will focus on the issues of access to care, insurance, and personpower in pediatric oncology. The invitation to participate in this workshop was addressed to me as former Chairman of the Section of Hematology/Oncology of the American Academy of Pediatrics and current Chairman of the sub-board of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology of the American Board of Pediatrics. I am particularly indebted to my colleagues in these two organizations for supplying me with much of the information included in this report.
