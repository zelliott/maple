This review examines the role of advances in biochip and microarray technologies in the development of personalized medicine. Biochips (eg, GeneChip, CYP450, electrochemical biochips, protein biochips, microfluidic biochips and nanotechnology-based biochips) are assuming an important role in molecular diagnostics, and their application in point-of-care diagnosis is expected to facilitate the development of personalized medicine. Gene expression profiling by microarrays should advance the progress of personalized cancer treatment based on the molecular classification of subtypes. Refinements in biochip miniaturization with the advent of nanotechnology will further contribute to molecular diagnostics and the development of personalized medicine.
