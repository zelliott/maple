Genomics (the study of the human genome) and Proteomics (analysis of the protein complement of the genome) are increasingly useful in e.g. diagnosis, early cancer detection, prognostication, therapy response prediction, and others. To avoid recent disappointments, -omic tests should always be carefully confirmed in independent prospective validation studies. Unfortunately, molecular oncology services often run without pathologists, although unique pathobiologic knowledge often can be essential to get the best information. Strategic choices should be made which diseases/organ sites be analyzed and techniques used. Pathologists should quickly familiarize themselves with both -omic techniques and applications, thereby going beyond the usual pathology boundaries.
