The relationship between inflammation and tumorigenesis has been established. Recently, inflammation is also reported to be a drive force for cancer metastasis. Further evidences show that various stimuli directly induced-injury in a specific organ can also promote metastasis in this organ, which include epidemiological reports, clinical series and experimental studies. Each type of cancer has preferential sites for metastasis, which is also due to inflammatory factors that are released by primary cancer to act on these sites and indirectly induce injuries on them. Host factors such as stress,fever can also influence distant metastasis in a specific site through stimulation of immune and inflammatory effects. The five aspects support an idea that specific-organ injury directly induced by various stimuli or indirectly induced by primary tumor or host factors activation of proinflammatory modulators can promote metastasis in this organ through a spatiotemporal regulation, which has important implications for personalized prediction, prevention and management of cancer metastasis.
