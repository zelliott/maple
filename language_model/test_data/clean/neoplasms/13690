We present here how medical practice is managed at the patients home. Medical care at home is conducted in conjunction with a variety of professionals who provide health care in the community. The use of computers allows us to easily download information, and transfer it from the clinic to community services. Fluid replacement, total parenteral nutrition, palliative treatment of pain in cancer patients, management of urethral catheters, and other skills that are carried out at home would be stated.
