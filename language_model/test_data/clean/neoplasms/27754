Thirty cancer patients, clinical group IV, have been examined. It has been established that a persistent pain syndrome leads to lowering in beta-endorphin liquor level. Morphine analgesia is followed by beta-endorphin level elevation which directly depends on pain intensity and analgesia efficacy. Determination of changes in beta-endorphin liquor level may serve as a criterion of analgesia efficacy.
