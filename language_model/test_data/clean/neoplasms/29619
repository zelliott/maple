Sporadic duodenal polyps are uncommon, being found in up to 5% of patients referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. They are often discovered incidentally and are usually asymptomatic. The histological subtype of polyps cannot always be determined on endoscopic appearance alone, and biopsy is advocated. The need for further imaging, endoscopic procedures, surgical resection, and surveillance is determined by the histological features, neoplastic potential and associated symptoms. This review describes the different subtypes of sporadic duodenal polyp: adenomas, hamartomas, gastric metaplasia, inflammatory fibroids, lipomas, leiomyomas, carcinoids, stromal tumors, solitary Peutz-Jeghers polyps, lymphomas, and other rare benign and malignant lesions. It describes the epidemiology, clinical presentation, investigation, management options, and screening and surveillance strategies for each, based on current evidence.
