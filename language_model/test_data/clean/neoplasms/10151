Temozolomide pharmacokinetics were evaluated in children receiving concurrent O(6)-benzylguanine (O(6)BG), which enhanced the hematological toxicity of temozolomide.

Temozolomide was administered orally, daily for 5 days starting at 28 mg/m(2) per day with escalations to 40, 55, 75 and 100 mg/m(2) per day with O(6)BG intravenously daily for 5 days at doses of 60, 90 or 120 mg/m(2) per day. Plasma samples were drawn over 48 h after the day 5 dose. Temozolomide was quantified with a validated HPLC/tandem mass spectroscopic assay.

Temozolomide was rapidly absorbed (mean T (max), 2.1 h). The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) (96 mL/min/m(2)) was similar to the CL/F for temozolomide alone and was not age- or gender-dependent. There was minimal inter-patient variability.

The enhanced hematologic toxicity resulting from combining O(6)BG with temozolomide does not appear to be the result of a pharmacokinetic interaction between the agents.
