Ascites complicates many advanced malignancies, resulting in abdominal pain, discomfort, anorexia, nausea, and dyspnea. Percutaneous drainage relieves symptoms in the vast majority of patients. The aim of this study was to determine the course and outcomes in a consecutive series of patients with recurrent ascites managed with permanent peritoneal ports.

A prospective longitudinal descriptive study from 2006 to 2011, involving patients treated at the Sydney Cancer Center (New South Wales, Australia).

A total of 155 drainages were performed in 24 patients; 26% of drainages (n=40) in the patient's home and the remainder in the ambulatory care clinic. Grade 3 or higher adverse events occured in less than 25% of all draining procedures. An improvement in symptoms was demonstrated in almost half of all individual drainage procedures. Our findings suggest that peritoneal ports are efficacious, safe, and are associated with symptomatic relief in most patients.
