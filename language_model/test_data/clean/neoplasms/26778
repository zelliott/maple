Self-assembled nanoparticles were synthesized from water-soluble fructose-chitosan, substituted by succinyl linkages with phytosterols as hydrophobic moieties for self-assembly. The physicochemical properties of the prepared self-assembled nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Doxorubicin (DOX), as a model anticancer drug, was physically entrapped inside prepared self-assembled nanoparticles by the dialysis method. With increasing initial levels of the drug, the drug loading content increased, but the encapsulation efficiency decreased. The release profiles in vitro demonstrated that the DOX showed slow sustained released over 48 h, and the release rate in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4) was much slower than in PBS solution (pH 5.5 and pH 6.5), indicating the prepared self-assembled nanoparticles had the potential to be used as a carrier for targeted delivery of hydrophobic anticancer drugs with declined cytotoxicity to normal tissues.
