The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in terms of content and medium, the ability of a videotaped information series to increase the general public's knowledge of cancer.

In the first phase of the intervention, the videotapes were screened by focus groups, who rated them for length, design, style, and content. In phase two of the study, the videotapes were shown to three random samples of the general population. A portion of each sample was asked to complete a knowledge-survey instrument without viewing the videotapes; a portion was asked to view the tapes before completing the survey instrument.

Survey results showed that those who viewed the videotapes had higher knowledge-of-cancer scores than those who did not.

Community focus groups are inclined to accept cancer information from mediated sources other than those traditionally cited such as physicians and other health professionals.
