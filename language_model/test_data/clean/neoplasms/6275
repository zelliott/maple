Ovarian cancer is associated with the highest mortality rate of all gynecological malignancies, due in part to inadequate treatment strategies and the asymptomatic nature of the disease. Current standard of care includes surgery and systemic chemotherapy. However, this approach can result in toxicities and eventual disease relapse, due to the emergence of multidrug resistance. Drug delivery systems (DDS) have shown promise in overcoming many of the limitations facing conventional treatment regimens.

This review provides an overview of recent advances in DDS strategies for the treatment ovarian cancers. Nano-sized systems, including nanoparticles, micelles, liposomes and drug conjugates; microspheres; implants and injectable depots are discussed. The advantages, limitations and clinical potential of these strategies are also outlined.

Nano-sized DDS enable passive targeting to tumors due to their size, and further improvements in tumor localization can be made using targeting moieties. Microspheres, implants and injectable depots have been investigated for peritoneal localized and sustained therapy. Overall, the benefits of using DDS for ovarian cancer therapy include higher drug levels at the diseased site, circumvention of drug resistance mechanisms, minimization of non-specific toxicities, improvements in solubility of poorly soluble drugs and elimination of toxicities associated with conventionally used pharmaceutical excipients.
