Since 1945, artificial fluoridation of water supplies has been used with success to reduce the incidence of dental caries in many areas where the natural fluoride content of the water is low. However, since 1975, it has been maintained that such artificial fluoridation is followed by an increased risk of cancer. These allegations originate from a single source. The present review, which covers re-examinations of the same data as well as evidence from scientific and governmental bodies in many countries, shows these assertions to be erroneous.
