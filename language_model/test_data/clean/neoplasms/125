Coefficients Kv and Ks for determination of the influence of a volume and area of irradiated tissues in the assessment of DMF factors were presented. The above coefficients were derived on the basis of calculations and a retrospective analysis of the authors' clinical data on radiation complications in the subcutaneous fatty tissue in teleradiotherapy of malignant tumors. The use of the coefficients will make it possible to predict with greater reliability the probability of radiation complications in designing radiation therapy.
