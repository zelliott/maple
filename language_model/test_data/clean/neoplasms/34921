Defining cure for a child with cancer is not simple. Such terms as "long-term disease-free survival" or "no evident disease" are expressions of our current clinical inadequacies. An equally important problem, however, is that the disease and its treatment are frequently associated with sequelae that prevent complete restoration of baseline health status or that alter subsequent growth and developmental patterns. This article describes the nature of cures that have been achieved for childhood cancer and reassesses current treatment goals, taking into consideration altered realities of survival. Tasks remaining include the construction of medical treatment regimens that minimize acute and late effects, the design of intervention strategies to reduce the psychological and social impact of the disease on children and families, and the modification of society's attitudes so that cancer survivors are more accepted in the community.
