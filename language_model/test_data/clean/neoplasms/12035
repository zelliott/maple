Eleven patients each received gentamicin sulfate, tobramycin, and sisomicin by continuous intravenous infusion after an initial loading dose. Subsequent doses of antibiotic were adjusted in an attempt to maintain constant serum concentrations. There was considerable variation in the serum concentration from patient to patient and in the same patient from day to day with each drug. Although the dosages of gentamicin sulfate and tobramycin were similar, the serum concentrations of the latter drug were consistently lower. Despite the daily administration of doses of at least 300 mg of gentamicin and tobramycin per m(2) and 160 mg of sisomicin per m(2), nephrotoxicity occurred in only three patients. This is a low frequency of nephrotoxicity, considering the dosages of drug administered. Although therapeutic efficacy was not an objective of this study, 8 of 11 documented infections were cured. This approach to the administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics deserves therapeutic trials.
