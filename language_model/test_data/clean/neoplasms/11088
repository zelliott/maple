Osteomata of the frontal and ethmoid sinuses have traditionally been surgically removed via external approaches. However, endoscopic techniques have increasingly been used for the surgical management of selected cases. Advances in visualization and instrumentation, as well as the excellent access provided by the Draf type 3 procedure, expanded the reach of endoscopes. We describe current limits of endoscopic approaches in the removal of osteomata from the frontal sinus and our algorithms for their management. We believe that the vast majority of frontal sinus osteomata can be managed endoscopically, and that only significant anterior or extreme infero-lateral extension constitute major limiting factors.
