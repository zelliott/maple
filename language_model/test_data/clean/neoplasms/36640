The morphological investigation of corneal endothelium was carried out in 205 human eyes of patients with malignant tumors of different localization including the eye, and also with diabetes mellitus. The investigation was performed in flat specimens by electron microscopy. In all types of pathology mitotic figures were found in endothelial population, most frequently in cases of diabetes of moderate and severe degree. Simultaneously the endothelial cell density increased significantly comprising in case of choroidal melanoma 2416 cell/mm2, in cancer of different localization 2916 cell/mm2; in the control group in 40-60-year-old patients 2160 cell/mm2; in diabetes mellitus of moderate and severe degree 2770 cell/mm2, in the control group in 60-80-year-old patients 1975 cell/mm. Simultaneously the endothelial cell area decreased significantly, the number of small unchanged cells of mitosis product increased and that of large cells diminished. Therefore, it growth factors in the host are more active, mitotic division of corneal endothelial cells will become more active as well.
