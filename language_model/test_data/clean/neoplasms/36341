The new practice guideline 'Malnutrition in patients with cancer' provides a good framework for the practical treatment of patients with impending cancer cachexia. Because the pathophysiology of cancer cachexia is multifactorial, its treatment requires a multimodal approach. Such multimodal treatment should probably consist of nutritional support in combination with physical exercise, anti-inflammatory medication and an anabolic or anticatabolic intervention. The aim is to control undesired loss of muscle and fat mass. Unfortunately, the data currently available are limited and do not allow evidence-based advice beyond the paradigm of treating malnutrition by feeding patients appropriately.
