The DC Bead is fast becoming the product of choice for use in the treatment of intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. It is a drug-eluting embolization system that is delivered intra-arterially and combines the effects of physical occlusion of the blood supply to a tumor with the local controlled delivery of a chemotherapeutic agent. While not suitable for use with all drugs, the components of this device enable rapid loading and sustained elution of therapeutic amounts of a range of clinically relevant anticancer compounds. Extensive preclinical testing has demonstrated the reproducibility and reliability of the device, together with reduced systemic drug exposure and sustained local drug delivery. Moreover, these attributes are translating into the clinic as significant benefits to patients with many types of liver tumors.
