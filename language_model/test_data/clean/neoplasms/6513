Serum levels of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) as well as lipids were determined in patients during total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The mean CoQ10 levels (M +/- SD) were 0.77 +/- 0.30 microgram/ml for 108 normal subjects and 0.59 +/- 0.35 microgram/ml for 95 patients before TPN. The mean CoQ10 level of the patients decreased significantly to 0.35 +/- 0.23 microgram/ml one week after the start of TPN, and then remained almost unchanged during TPN for up to 6 weeks. When the patients receiving TPN (TPN patients) were grouped according to their clinical diagnoses, the mean CoQ10 level of patients with cancer was significantly lower than that of the other patients without cancer in 4 week therapy, but there was no difference in the levels between the patients with and without diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Serum levels of total cholesterol (T-Chol) and esterified cholesterol in TPN patients also declined below their respective normal ranges, but not to the same extent in comparison to CoQ10. The levels of triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL), non-esterified fatty acids, low density lipoproteins, very low density lipoproteins, chylomicrons, and cholesterol in the high density lipoprotein fraction in serum of TPN patients were within their normal ranges. The levels of CoQ10 in TPN patients were correlative to those of T-Chol, TG, and PL, and decreased rapidly prior to the latter levels.
