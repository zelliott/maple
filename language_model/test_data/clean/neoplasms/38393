The use of monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic purposes and diagnostic imaging has become an important pillar of internal medicine in recent years. Currently, the application of antibodies against cell surface receptors and cytokines makes specific therapies possible, in particular against chronic and malignant diseases. The production of antibody preparations increasingly involves gene and biotechnological processes while continuing to adhere to the basic principle of specific antigen-antibody binding. Despite the complex antigen structure of antibodies, severe treatment side effects remain the exception. This is all the more remarkable considering the increased use of human or humanized and functionally optimized antibodies. In the coming years, numerous new monoclonal antibodies will extend the therapeutic and diagnostic possibilities for diverse clinical applications.
