In this work, a novel, biocompatible conjugates of gelatin and oleic acid (GOC) were synthesized by a novel aqueous solvent-based method that overcame challenges of completely contrary solubility between gelatin and oleic acid (OA). The GO nanoparticles (GONs) and Paclitaxel encapsulated nanoparticles (PTX-GON) were prepared by self-assembly in water. These nanoparticles (NPs) were then conjugated with folic acid (FA) for targeting cervical cancer cells (Hela cells) and were characterized for their various physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and 1H NMR studies indicated the successful synthesis of GOC which showed low critical aggregation concentration in water (0.015 mg/ml). All NPs were stable in human blood serum and their mean diameters were below 300 nm suitable for passive targeting. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) diffractograms showed the reduction in drug crystallinity and hence, leading to the solubility enhancement of PTX. The release of PTX from both PTX-GON and FA conjugated PTX-GON (PTX-FA-GON) was controlled for a long time. The cytotoxicity results demonstrated great advantages of PTX-FA-GON and PTX-GON over the conventional dosage form of pacliaxel (Taxol). These results, therefore, indicate that GOC is a promising material to prepare drug encapsulated NP as a controlled delivery system and PTX-FA-GON is a potential targeted delivery system for cancer therapy.
