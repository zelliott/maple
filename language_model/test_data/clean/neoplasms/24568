Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common problem in patients with cancer that complicates management and predicts for a worse prognosis. Hence, effective methods to prevent and treat VTE can reduce morbidity and mortality. Low molecular weight heparins have simplified and improved management of VTE and recent studies suggest these agents may improve survival in cancer patients. This review will provide an update on the primary prevention and treatment of VTE, as well as prophylaxis for central venous catheters, in patients with malignancy.
