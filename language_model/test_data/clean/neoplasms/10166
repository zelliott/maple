The capacity to sense and adapt to changes in environmental cues is of paramount importance for every living organism. From yeast to man, cells must be able to match cellular activities to growth environment and nutrient availability. Key to this process is the development of membrane-bound systems that can detect modifications in the extracellular environment and to translate these into biological responses. Evidence gathered over the last 15 years has demonstrated that many of these cell surface "sensors" belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Crucial to our understanding of nutrient sensing in mammalian species has been the identification of the extracellular Ca(2+)/cation-sensing receptor, CaR. CaR was the first ion-sensing molecule identified in man and genetic studies in humans have revealed the importance of the CaR in mineral ion metabolism. Latter, it has become apparent that the CaR also plays an important role outside the Ca(2+) homeostatic system, as an integrator of multiple environmental signals for the regulation of many vital cellular processes, from cell-to-cell communication to secretion and cell survival/cell death. Recently, novel aspects of receptor function reveal an unexpected role for the CaR in the regulation of growth and development in utero.
