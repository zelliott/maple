Direct intraperitoneal instillation of many chemotherapeutic agents can markedly increase total peritoneal drug exposure and may be useful for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma and mesothelioma. The use of a totally implanted access system (Port-a-CathTM) reduces the risk of inadvertent bowel damage, and infection associated with repeated intraperitoneal instillation of drugs. In addition, patient acceptance is better in comparison to catheters that protrude through the skin. Catheter failure due to the formation of adhesions around the outside of the catheter remains a major problem.
