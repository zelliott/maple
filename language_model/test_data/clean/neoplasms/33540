We have developed a highly sensitive, two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) for human parathyrin (PTH) that is specific for the intact, secreted, biologically active 84-amino-acid peptide. This assay has several technical advantages: it does not detect even high concentrations of inactive carboxyl-terminal fragments, results are available within 24 h, and the detection limit for intact hormone is low (1 ng/L). The assay readily measures concentrations of PTH in all healthy subjects and distinguishes these values from low or undetectable PTH values observed in clinical situations in which PTH secretion is expected to be suppressed. We found complete separation of results from 37 patients with surgically proven hyperparathyroidism and those from 23 patients with hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, the latter having PTH values at or below the lower limits of normal for this assay. The sensitivity, specificity, and rapid turnaround time of this two-site IRMA should advance the laboratory evaluation of patients with disorders of calcium metabolism.
