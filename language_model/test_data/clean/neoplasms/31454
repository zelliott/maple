Probiotics are specific products of microorganisms, and by being biologically active positively act on stabilizing the bacteriological flora of the gastrointestinal tract. They are live or lyophilized bacterial cultures, especially those derived from lactic fermentation (Lactobacillacea and Streptococcacea). The first to use the term probiotics were Lilly and Stillwell in 1965 when referring to substances produced by protozoa, which in turn stimulated the growth of other organisms. Probiotics are devoid of side affects and do not cause accumulation of toxic substances in the body. They are administered for therapeutic, prophylactic and nutritional purposes both in humans and in animals. Interest into probiotics has been spurred on by the growing abundance of civilization disorders such as neoplasms, atherosclerosis, heart disease, hypertension and HIV infection. Probiotics are potentially capable of annihilating these disorders. Starter cultures are pure mixed bacterial, fungal or mold cultures which by transformation of their metabolism faciliate favourable changes in apperance, aroma, consistency, and durability of foodstuffs. Contemporary knowledge concerning probiotics and their action is derived from many years of tradition in consumption of fermented milk products and the documentation of much research into strains of lactic bacteria, their harmless action on health and overall beneficial effect.
