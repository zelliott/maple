Antithrombin (AT), prekallikrein (PK), and fibronectin (FN) levels were measured in the plasma of 290 patients. The mean (+/- SD) lowest AT level measured in 287 patients was 70% +/- 18% (normal, 75% to 120% of control). The mean lowest AT level in 81 septic patients (49% +/- 17%) was significantly lower than in the 206 patients without sepsis (78% +/- 22%). The mean AT level in 60 patients who died (42% +/- 22%) was significantly lower than in 227 patients who lived (78% +/- 19%). The mean lowest PK level measured in 71 patients was 42% +/- 17% (normal, 80% to 120%). The mean PK level in 32 septic patients (26% +/- 12%) was significantly lower than in 39 patients who were not septic (54% +/- 19%). The mean lowest FN level measured in 45 patients was 193 +/- 86 micrograms/mL (normal, 160 to 240 micrograms/mL). The mean FN level in 15 septic patients (128 +/- 72 micrograms/mL) was significantly lower than in the 30 nonseptic patients (266 +/- 84 micrograms/mL). Following AT, PK, and FN levels in critically ill surgical patients may allow earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment of sepsis.
