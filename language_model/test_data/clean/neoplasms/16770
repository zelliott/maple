The role of mucositis in infectious complications in the patient with cancer is poorly understood. Consequently, neither the presence nor the severity of mucositis is routinely considered in the selection of specific antibacterial agents for the initial empirical therapy of the febrile cancer patient. In a study of children receiving remission induction chemotherapy for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, the number of febrile days correlated more closely with the degree of mucositis than with the number of days of neutropenia. Oral mucositis appears to predispose cancer patients to systemic infections with alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Capnocytophaga, and Candida species. Overall, studies of single-drug versus combination therapy for the initial empirical therapy of febrile, neutropenic cancer patients indicate that monotherapy approaches the efficacy of combination therapy, although combination therapy may be preferred for certain cohorts of cancer patients. A concern that is closely related to the issue of combination therapy versus monotherapy is the need for vancomycin in the initial empirical regimen. Vancomycin appears to be the consensus drug of choice for patients with known gram-positive bacterial infections pending antibiotic susceptibility testing; however, there is disagreement as to whether the increased activity of vancomycin against gram-positive bacteria outweighs its expense and potential toxicity for inclusion in the initial empirical regimen. There is an explicit need for continued support of basic and clinical research to address these concerns.
