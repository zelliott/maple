Immunohistochemistry is an essential tool for clinical and translational research laboratories. It is mostly used as a qualitative measure of morphology and cell types within tissue. We have developed a high-resolution multispectral imaging method to expand the uses of immunohistochemistry by making it quantitative. In this chapter we describe the technology, both hardware and software, that we use for this method and give examples of applications.
