One vaccine designed to prevent cancer by preventing a precursor infection is already in common use, and at least one more is in the latter stages of clinical development. These vaccines are part of a new era of cancer immunoprophylaxis. Several further vaccines are in preclinical and clinical development, targeted at preventing cancer precursor infections, and these should add to our ability to prevent this common human disorder. However, vaccines to prevent cancers not triggered by infection are a more remote prospect, for a variety of reasons.
