The worry for falling ill has been described as a key element in the change of preventive attitudes. Levels of cancer worry not well fitted have been associated with inadequate adherence to preventive strategies. There is not a Spanish validated scale to evaluate the degree of worry for the cancer in our population. The aim of the present study was to perform the cross cultural adaptation and validation of the Cancer Worry Scale described by Lerman.

A translation, re-translation of the Cancer Worry Scale to Spanish was done. Validation of the Spanish scale was performed by means of the factorial analysis of principal components with the rotation varimax test in a sample of 200 healthy women with family history of breast cancer.

The Escala de Preocupación por el Cáncer (EPC) is the Spanish version of the Cancer Worry Scale and it contains 6 items with a total value ranging from 6 (minimal worry) to 24 (maximum worry). The analysis of content validity demonstrated that the EPC is conceptually equivalent to the original scale. The factorial analysis showed a unique factor that explains 53.07% of the variance confirming the unique dimension. The EPC presented good reliability test - re-test with an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.777. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.835 for the complete of the scale.

The EPC is a validated Spanish scale to measure the cancer worry in healthy individuals, which shows a correct content validity and reliability.
