Pediatric cancer treatment may imply an increased risk of hypogonadism, leading to metabolic disorders and osteoporosis. Such complications are potentially preventable.

The aim of this study was to assess diagnosis- and treatment-dependent risk of hypogonadism in male childhood cancer survivors (CCS).

Male CCS who were treated during the period 1970-2002 and who in 2004 were 18-45 yr of age were eligible.

The study was conducted in a university hospital clinic.

A consecutive group of CCS treated at Lund University Hospital was selected for the study, of whom 151 (38%) agreed to participate. Furthermore, 141 healthy fertile men served as controls.

We measured serum levels of free and total testosterone, SHBG, and LH.

Odds ratios (OR) for biochemical hypogonadism, defined as total testosterone less than 10 nmol/liter and/or LH above 10 IU/liter, were calculated and related to type of cancer, treatment received, as well as testicular volume.

Hypogonadism was more commonly detected in CCS than in controls (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 2.7, 17). The increased presence of hypogonadism was noted in the following treatment groups: brain surgery, chemotherapy (with and without radiotherapy), and testicular irradiation. Low total testicular volume (&lt;or=24 ml) was associated with a high risk of hypogonadism (OR, 31; 95% CI, 11, 92).

Adult male survivors of childhood cancer are at risk of hypogonadism, which should be acknowledged in the long-term follow-up of these men.
