Penclomedine is a synthetic alpha-picoline derivative that has shown antitumor activity both in preclinical development and in Phase I work using an i.v. preparation. The main toxicities seen in those studies were dose dependent and mainly neurocerebellar, with hematological toxicity being far less severe. This Phase I trial of p.o. penclomedine was conducted to potentially alter the toxicity profile and to avoid the neurological side effects seen with i.v. penclomedine. Eligibility criteria included microscopic confirmation of a solid malignancy or lymphoma with a lack of effective anticancer therapy. Twenty patients were enrolled. The median age was 60.5 years, and the median performance status was one. All but one patient had received prior systemic therapy. The starting dose of penclomedine was 200 mg/m(2) p.o. for 5 days, and was escalated according to a traditional Fibonacci sequence until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was observed. No treatment-related deaths were observed during the study. The MTD was determined to be 800 mg/m(2) p.o. for 5 days. Dose-limiting toxicities included mainly neurocerebellar symptoms such as ataxia and dysmetria, but neurocortical symptoms, such as confusion, were seen as well. Myelosuppression was less common and resulted in the discontinuation of therapy in only two patients. Pharmacokinetics show that the observed MTD is consistent with the i.v. preparations, and that the bioavailability of p.o. penclomedine is 49 +/- 18%. This regimen can be considered for additional studies in patients with intracranial neoplasms, because good central nervous system penetration is evident. Further development of penclomedine metabolites, such as 4-O-demethylpenclomedine, should be considered to minimize dose-limiting neurotoxicity.
