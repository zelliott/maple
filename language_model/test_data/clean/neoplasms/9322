The antibody J591 targets the external domain of prostate-specific membrane antigen, which is expressed in the neovasculature of nonprostate solid tumors. This phase I trial tested the hypothesis that J591 could be used as a vascular targeting platform for patients with nonprostate solid tumors.

Patients with progressive solid tumors were eligible. Twenty patients, divided into six dosage cohorts of 3 to 6 patients each, were treated every 3 weeks to a maximum of four doses using either 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, or 100 mg of J591 antibody. Two milligrams of antibody were labeled with 10 mCi of indium-111.

Patients with a wide variety of solid tumors were tested; all had good tumor localization. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The serum clearance rate decreased with increasing antibody mass, likely a result of early hepatic uptake of antibody. Half-life for each successive cohort was 0.71, 0.84, 1.86, 1.83, 3.32, and 3.56 days. Hepatic saturation seemed to occur by 60 mg. Seventeen of 18 (94%) patients with soft tissue disease on standard scans showed uptake in the soft tissues on antibody scans as did 6 of 6 patients with bone disease.

The tumoral neovasculature of a variety of solid tumors can be selectively and safely targeted using J591. In planning for future studies using J591 as a radiation delivery platform, an antibody mass of 60 mg should be considered, as it would seem to minimize the radiation delivered to the liver while minimizing the radiation dose to bone.
