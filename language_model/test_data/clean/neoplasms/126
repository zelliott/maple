Diagnostic potentialities of the use of a new radiopharmaceutical 111In-citrin were studied to assess the hemopoietic status on the basis of examination of 47 cancer patients after chemotherapy. Bone marrow function was assessed on the basis of the visual RP distribution in the bone marrow and a study of quantitative indices of the agent accumulation in various anatomical regions. The results of the study showed that a decrease in the agent accumulation in the flat pelvic bones was determined in patients with stable hemocytopenia. Hyperfixation of the agent was undetectable in the long tubular bones. Raised accumulation of the indicator in the metaepiphyses of the long tubular bones was observed in parallel with lowered accumulation of the agent in the flat bones in the group of patients without hemocytopenia nearly in half of the cases. The accumulation of RP in the rest of the cases did not differ from that in the control group. The results obtained showed that 111In-citrin accumulation in the bone marrow of the long tubular bones indicating its functional rearrangement and the normal level of the indicator accumulation in the main zones of bone marrow hemopoiesis in cancer patients could serve as a favorable prognostic sign for the assessment of hemopoiesis in subsequent courses of cytostatic therapy.
