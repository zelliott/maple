Published research, books, and journal articles; theory; practice; and personal experience.

Oncology nurses benefit from programs designed to bolster the development of coping skills to reduce stress, foster supportive relationships in the workplace, facilitate work-related grief and bereavement, and reduce burnout.

Fostering psychosocial wellness in the workplace potentially can increase oncology nurse retention.

A renewed recognition of the stressful nature of oncology nursing should give rise to programs that address the psychological well-being of oncology nurses. Oncology nursing leadership, recognizing the potential for stress and burnout inherent in this profession, should research and develop programs to enhance staff coping skills and mutual support.
