A single highly-polymorphic autosomal gene locus PUM codes for a family of mucin-type glycoproteins, separable by SDS-gel electrophoresis, which we first identified in human urine. The locus also codes for glycoproteins which are abundant in several other normal epithelial tissues and body fluids, including milk, and in tumours of epithelial origin. These mucin-type glycoproteins seem to be very immunogenic in rodents and, in a search for epithelial specific or tumour-associated antigens, a large number of related antibodies have been isolated which bind to the PUM-coded mucins. Many of the antibodies show a pronounced tumour specificity on immunohistology and are being used widely in cancer diagnosis in vitro and in vivo and even in cancer therapy. To investigate the expression of these antigens in normal and malignant cells complementary DNA coding for the mammary mucin has been isolated. Here we present evidence obtained using this cDNA that the PUM locus is a hypervariable 'minisatellite' region of human DNA similar to those described by several groups, but which is novel in that it is transcribed and translated, and that the same polymorphism is demonstrable in the expressed gene product.
