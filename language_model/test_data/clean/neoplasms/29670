The relation between clinical evidence of and histologic signs of anthracycline cardiotoxicity was evaluated by reviewing the clinical and morphologic findings in 64 patients studied at necropsy, all of whom had received doxorubicin or daunorubicin chemotherapy during life. Of the 64 patients, 20 (31%) had documented clinical toxicity consisting of impaired left ventricular systolic performance; in 7 (35%) of these 20 patients, histologic signs of toxicity were absent. In the remaining 13 patients with clinical toxicity, histologic signs of toxicity ranged from mild to severe. Of the 44 (69%) patients without clinical signs of drug toxicity, 21 (48%) had no histologic sign of cardiotoxicity; in 23 (52%) of the patients without clinical toxicity, however, morphologic signs of cardiotoxicity were nevertheless present--mild in most patients, but extensive in 4. Signs of extensive histologic toxicity (19 [30%] of 64 patients) were associated with large doses (greater than 450 mg/m2) of the drug, mediastinal irradiation, and age greater than 70 years. This study suggests that attempts to monitor cardiotoxicity by serial evaluation of cardiac histology in patients undergoing anthracycline chemotherapy may be seriously limited by the fact that clinical evidence of toxicity may be present without histologic signs of toxicity; likewise, histologic signs of anthracycline toxicity may be present without clinical evidence of toxicity.
