A simplified TLD technique characterized by high precision and reproducibility of dose measurement is presented. One hundred eighty LiF TLD rods 1 mm diam x 3 mm length as obtained from the manufacturer were annealed for 1 h at 400 degrees C followed immediately by 2 h at 105 degrees C. After exposure to a dose of 1 Gy of 4 MV x rays, TLDs were annealed for 15 min at 105 degrees C, then read out. TLDs were then sorted into five groups, ranging from 26 to 50 rods each with approximately equal sensitivity after correcting for the drift in the sensitivity of the TLD reader during the readout session. Maintaining group identity, the TLDs were again annealed, irradiated and read out. Fewer than 10% of the TLDs were removed from each group because the corrected readings differed from the respective group mean by more than 3.5%. The standard deviation of the readout was approximately 1.5% within each group. The planchet heater was not flushed with nitrogen gas. Various tests were performed to assess the stability of the group sorting technique and the linearity of TLD dose response. After reannealing, five TLDs were randomly drawn from one of the presorted groups, and subjected to various dose of 4 MV radiation over the range from 0.5 to 1000 cGy. This resulted in an average readout standard deviation of 1.2%. Response per unit dose was almost flat over the range from 0.5 cGy to 100 cGy, and increased by 15% over the range from 100 cGy to 1000 cGy. TLD sensitivity was affected by the duration of the anneal, but was virtually independent of the various time delays between irradiation, prereadout anneal, and readout. The group annealing and sorting (GAS) procedure provides a simple, reliable, precise, convenient, and accurate method for TLD measurements.
