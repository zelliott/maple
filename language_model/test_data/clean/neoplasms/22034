Providing quality written information in a consistent manner to all patients in a large cancer center presents a challenge.

A new chemotherapy guide was developed, piloted, and distributed institution-wide. Patients and nurses were surveyed during each of these steps.

During the pilot and after its distribution, patients found the guide easy to use and helpful. Nurses found its format and content helpful during patient teaching. Efforts to improve distribution were addressed.

The guide provides an excellent resource for patients, a standard for patient teaching, and is now the basis for future chemotherapy program planning.
