Anti-tumour therapies based on the use pro-apoptotic receptor agonists, including TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or monoclonal antibodies targeting TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2, have been disappointing so far, despite clear evidence of clinical activity and lack of adverse events for the vast majority of these compounds, whether combined or not with conventional or targeted anti-cancer therapies. This brief review aims at discussing the possible reasons for the lack of apparent success of these therapeutic approaches and at providing hints in order to rationally design optimal protocols based on our current understanding of TRAIL signalling regulation or resistance for future clinical trials.
