Cancer is an acquired disease in which it is possible to identify a variety of abnormalities at a genetic level. This holds a promise that genetic manipulation of tumour cells will lead to novel therapies. As yet these approaches are constrained by available methods for obtaining gene transfer and subsequent genetic control. However, a number of strategies are already reaching the clinic, including attempts at immunotherapy, prodrug activation and improving host defence against conventional chemotherapy. Further clinical opportunities will occur with improved vector development.
