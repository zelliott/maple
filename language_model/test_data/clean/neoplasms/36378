Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important in regulating normal cellular processes, but deregulated ROS contribute to the development of various human diseases including cancers. Autophagy is one of the first lines of defense against oxidative stress damage. The autophagy pathway can be induced and upregulated in response to intracellular ROS or extracellular oxidative stress. This leads to selective lysosomal self-digestion of intracellular components to maintain cellular homeostasis. Hence, autophagy is the survival pathway, conferring stress adaptation and promoting viability under oxidative stress. However, increasing evidence has demonstrated that autophagy can also lead to cell death under oxidative stress conditions. In addition, altered autophagic signaling pathways that lead to decreased autophagy are frequently found in many human cancers. This review discusses the advances in understanding of the mechanisms of ROS-induced autophagy and how this process relates to tumorigenesis and cancer therapy.
