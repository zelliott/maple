Recent clinical trials have indicated that addition of tamoxifen (TAM) to a combination of cisplatin (DDP), carmustine and dacarbazine markedly increases the overall objective response rate of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. Previous studies have determined that there is remarkable synergy between TAM and DDP in a human melanoma cell line T-289. Using the technique of median effect analysis, in clonogenic assay, we observed a highly synergistic interaction between TAM and DDP. To determine whether or not this synergistic interaction was unique to human melanomas, or is generally observed in other types of malignancy, we examined the nature of this interaction using a human ovarian carcinoma and small cell lung cancer cell line. Synergy was observed in both cell lines. In the case of all 3 types of malignancy, synergy was observed at concentrations of both TAM and DDP that can be achieved in patients. Our results demonstrate that cytotoxic synergy between the DDP and TAM is observed in cell lines established from multiple types of human malignancies. It is important to note that the synergy between TAM and DDP is not dependent on the presence of estrogen or progesterone receptors. Since TAM is well tolerated by patients, it is particularly attractive as a potential agent with which to sensitize human tumors to DDP.
