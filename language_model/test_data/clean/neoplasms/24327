The author deals with the effects of environmental chemical-, and physical carcinogens playing predominant role in nearly 90% of the cancer development. Different steps of chemical carcinogenesis, classification and evaluation of carcinogens according to the criteria of International Agency for Research on Cancer, and the most important biological markers of genotoxic exposures are presented. Among physical agents the carcinogenic effects of ionizing and nonionizing radiations are demonstrated, including limited, inadequate or proved carcinogenic action of UV, microwave, static and low-frequency electric and magnetic fields.
