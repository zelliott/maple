The communication with the patient suffering cancer is attracting an increasing attention. The change of attitudes towards death in our society, the poor training of physicians in this field and other factors have raised this new problem. In addition to the patient and the physician, the relatives and the nursing staff are also involved in the communication process. From the studies already performed, it can be derived that the "bearable truth" has to be supplied to the patient. The application of this concept needs time and dedication to the patient.
