Although no absolute certainty exists about the role of nutrition in the etiology of cancer, many facts in favor of the relationship became available during the last decades. Correlation studies, experimental work and to a lesser extent case-control studies made it possible to clarify the role of certain nutrients and foods in carcinogenesis. The most important cancer sites where nutrition could play a role are esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, prostate and breast. Esophageal cancer is of a very complex etiology, in which alcohol intake plays an important role, at least in western countries. The cancer-promoting properties of alcohol intake are enhanced by smoking. Three factors from nutrition are probably related to stomach cancer, namely salt, nitrate/nitrite and vitamin C. Salt is caustic to the stomach mucosa, resulting in atrophic gastritis. Salt is also co-carcinogenic and stomach cancer-promoting in experimental animals. Nitrate is probably important at the stage of atrophic gastritis, where bacterial overgrowth, due to the high pH, converts nitrates in nitrites, making the loco synthesis possible of potent nitrosocarcinogens. Vitamin C inhibits the latter step. The epidemiological evidence for the role of those factors is provided. The most important among them is the strong and consistent association of stomach cancer mortality with stroke. Rectum, colon, prostate and breast cancer are related in some way to fat intake. They all seem positively related to saturated fat intake, whereas breast cancer is probably also promoted by polyunsaturated fat intake. However, polyunsaturated fat seems to be without effect on rectum cancer. Colon and prostate cancer are probably also influenced by polyunsaturated fat but to a lesser degree than breast cancer. An important argument for this are the positive ecological correlations between changes in rectum, colon and breast cancer mortality from 1968 on, and changes occurring in coronary heart diseases, stroke and diabetes mortality. Those six types of mortality are decreasing, or only slightly increasing in the USA, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, etc. They are strongly increasing in East European countries. The intake of saturated fat has generally decreased in the first group of countries, and has markedly increased in the second group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
