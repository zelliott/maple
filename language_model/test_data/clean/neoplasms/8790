Met is a tyrosine kinase that has hepatocyte growth factor as its ligand. Met plays a major role in cell growth, migration and morphological changes. Overexpression of hepatocyte growth factor and Met and mutations and amplification of MET have been noted in many forms of cancer and are reportedly correlated with cancer progression and a poor prognosis. Over the past few years, these molecules have attracted attention as targets of molecularly targeted therapies. This article describes the association relationship between hepatocyte growth factor/Met and cancer and it describes the latest findings regarding inhibitors to target hepatocyte growth factor/Met that are currently being developed.
