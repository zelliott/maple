In the study of cancer genomics, a series of purification methods have been invented to collect homogenous cells from heterogeneous cancerated tissue. Tissue microdissection methods, such as manual microdissection, mechanical microdissection, and laser technology, accelerated cancer genomics research. Each method holds both advantage and disadvantage, the selection of methods depends on the demands of study, and the instruments used in study.
