This study investigated the occurrence of chronic sorrow in individuals diagnosed with cancer and explored factors perceived as helpful to those experiencing grief-related feelings. Using the Burke/NCRCS Chronic Sorrow Questionnaire (Affected Individual Version), interviews were conducted with 10 individuals with cancer at least one year postdiagnosis. Interviews were transcribed and coding categories were developed. Data then were sorted into categories and recurring themes were identified. Nine of the subjects demonstrated evidence of chronic sorrow. Subjects most often used cognitive or action-oriented coping strategies to deal with their grief-related feelings. Nursing roles identified as particularly helpful to subjects experiencing chronic sorrow were providing an empathetic presence and being a teacher/expert. Nurses need to be aware that individuals living with cancer may experience chronic sorrow, and they need to be prepared to intervene in ways deemed helpful.
