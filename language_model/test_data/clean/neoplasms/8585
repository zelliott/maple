The use of luminescence detection as the endpoint for enzyme immunoassays offers the sensitivity and performance that had previously been obtained only with radioactive immunoassays. For systems that are optimized to give a continuous output of light, simple and convenient processing of tests can be achieved without the need for accurate timing of the signal generation. The applicability of these techniques for the analysis of a wide range of substances should lead to their establishment in cancer diagnosis as well as in other fields.
