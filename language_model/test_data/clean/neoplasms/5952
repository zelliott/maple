This paper describes a system for characterizing th electric field patterns of microwave radiators in lossy media, in particular, of those used in hyperthermia treatments for cancer therapy. We discuss the design, fabrication and testing of small, minimally-perturbing electric field probes which are capable of measuring both amplitude and phase. An appropriate test configuration for mapping field patterns radiating from hyperthermia applicators (antennae) also is described. The system was developed specifically for the evaluation of applicators centered at 434 MHz and 915 MHz.
