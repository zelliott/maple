The more common paraneoplastic skin changes associated with internal malignancies (acanthosis nigricans, dermatomyositis, secondary ichthyosis) are discussed. The rare glucagonoma syndrome, consisting of alpha cell tumor of the pancreas, migratory necrolytic erythema, and diabetes mellitus, is described. The importance of recognition of these skin lesions may lead to early detection of the underlying cancer with possible cure.
