It has been a long time since ultrasound hyperthermia began to be used in the clinical management of cancers and benign diseases. Numerous biological and clinical investigations have demonstrated that: hyperthermia in the range of 41-45 degrees C can significantly enhance clinical response to radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and high-temperature hyperthermia (greater than 65 degrees C) alone is now being used as an alternative to conventional invasive surgery for selective tissue destruction, causing tumor coagulation and necrosis. As a promising noninvasive and effective local therapy, HIFU has attracted great attention. China is advanced in the clinical applications of HIFU. This article gives an introduction of the development and applications of ultrasound hyperthermia technology, and also provides a general review of a selection of ultrasound hyperthermia systems both in clinical use and under development.
