Recently, discovery and identification of critical molecules responsible for cancer progression lead to development of specific target-directed therapies, including monoclonal antibodies and small molecular compounds. For the past 15 years, the advent of target-specific therapeutics has remarkably improved the clinical outcomes of certain patients with various malignancies, and it was followed by the understanding of mechanism of the drug resistance. Moreover, useful biomarkers were developed to further increase the power of patient selection for molecular-targeted therapy. From the historical point of view, we review the progress in developing new molecular-targeted drugs for personalized medicine.
