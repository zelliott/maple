We evaluated the analgesic efficacy of EMLA cream after repeated bone marrow aspirations or lumbar punctures (LPs) in children with cancer, and compared the ratings among patients, their parents, physicians, and nurses. Data from LPs were analyzed at the last procedure without EMLA (T1) and the first and last procedures with EMLA (T2 and T3). Friedman's nonparametric analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. A total of 272 procedures in 29 children were analyzed. For 179 procedures without EMLA, physicians rated pain lower than other raters, and for the 93 with EMLA physicians rated pain less than the children. Children rated pain at T2 lower than at T1 or T3. Physicians rated pain at T2 less than at T3. Both children and physicians rated pain at T3 as not different from that at T1. No differences were noted at these time points for other raters in LP distress ratings, or in bone marrow aspiration pain or distress ratings. Thus EMLA was associated with decreased pain ratings for LPs, but this effect was not sustainable with repeated procedures. The cream alone should not be relied on to control pain of bone marrow aspiration or repeated LPs in children. Physicians underestimated pain, which may have implications for undertreatment in this patient population.
