In about 5 years of clinical and immunological research, 39 cases of cryoplasmopathies (5 with cryoglobulinaemia and 34 with cryohaemoagglutinaemia) were identified on the basis of immunological typing studies (immunoelectrophoresis, immunodiffusion, identification and isolation of cryoantibodies, cryocrit, titration, identificcation of antibody specificity). Discussion and physiopathological interpretation of possibly associated cases and diseases are conducted on the basis of personal immunological data and the most recent literature on matters of clinical immunohaematology.
