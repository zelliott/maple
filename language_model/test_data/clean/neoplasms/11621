Three types of "fire" are used today against cancer: diathermocoagulation, hyperthermia and radiotherapy. Their selective (HT, RT) and non selective (DTC) cytotoxic action are briefly discussed. Hyperthermia, of which the Author summarizes the biological basis, the means of production and the clinical results, is particularly to be considered as an optimal integration of radiotherapy.
