A phase I study of whole body hyperthermia (WBH) (52 treatments/12 patients) utilizing a radiant heat device has been completed. This study incorporated a temperature escalation scheme from 39.5 to 41.8 degrees C for up to 150 min. Pain relief or a sense of well being was observed post-WBH in the first three patients entered in this study. We postulated that WBH might result in increases in the opiate peptide beta-endorphin. Therefore we elected to study prospectively the next six patients entered in this study to test the hypothesis that WBH stimulates the neuroendocrine axis. Results are reported which show thermal-induced increases in plasma levels of beta-endorphin as well as prolactin, ACTH and cortisol.
