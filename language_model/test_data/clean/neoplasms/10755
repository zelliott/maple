The aim of the present review is to discuss the cumulative evidence that suggests that pomegranate consumption possesses a diverse array of biological actions and may be helpful in the prevention of some inflammatory-mediated diseases including cancer. The pomegranate fruit can be divided into at least three parts-seeds, peel, and juice. All these components have been studied for their antioxidant properties in a chemoprevention approach. Pomegranate exerts antiproliferative, anti-invasive, and antimetastatic effects, induces apoptosis through modulation of Bcl-2 proteins, increases p21 and p27, and downregulates cyclin-cdk network. In addition, pomegranate inhibits the activation of inflammatory pathways including, but not limited to, the NFÎº-B pathway. Anti-cancer effects with the most impressive data have been demonstrated so far in prostate cancer.
