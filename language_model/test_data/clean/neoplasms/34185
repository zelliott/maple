Quality of life (QOL) is a generic principle applicable to all people with or without disabilities. The measurement of QOL has grown to become a standard endpoint in many randomised controlled trials (RCT) and other clinical studies. QOL is recognised as an important factor in assessing treatment outcome. The aim of this article is to present useful information for evaluating the situations of people with head and neck cancer. We introduce the EORTC's cancer specific core questionnaire (QLQ-C30 version 3.0) together with the specific QLQ-H&N35 module for the QOL measurement of Japanese patients with head and neck cancer, which has been forward-backward translated into Japanese and undergone a coordinated Pilot-test and cross-cultural adaptation. It has been accepted by the EORTC Quality of Life Group as a Japanese version of the QLQ-H&N35 module.
