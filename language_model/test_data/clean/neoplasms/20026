Alternative polyadenylation and microRNA regulation are both mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Alternative polyadenylation often results in mRNA isoforms with the same coding sequence but different lengths of 3' UTRs, while microRNAs regulate gene expression by binding to specific mRNA 3' UTRs. In this sense, different isoforms of an mRNA may be differentially regulated by microRNAs, sometimes resulting in cellular proliferation and this mechanism is being speculated on as a potential cause for cancer development.
