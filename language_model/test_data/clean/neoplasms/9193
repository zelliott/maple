In this work we investigate a mathematical model describing tumour growth under a treatment by chemotherapy that incorporates time-delay related to the conversion from resting to hunting cells. We study the model using values for the parameters according to experimental results and vary some parameters relevant to the treatment of cancer. We find that our model exhibits a dynamical behaviour associated with the suppression of cancer cells, when either continuous or pulsed chemotherapy is applied according to clinical protocols, for a large range of relevant parameters. When the chemotherapy is successful, the predation coefficient of the chemotherapic agent acting on cancer cells varies with the infusion rate of chemotherapy according to an inverse relation. Finally, our model was able to reproduce the experimental results obtained by Michor and collaborators [Nature 435 (2005) 1267] about the exponential decline of cancer cells when patients are treated with the drug glivec.
