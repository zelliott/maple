Seven patients who had been receiving capecitabine+oxaliplatin±bevacizumab(CapeOX±BV)therapy at our hospital between February 2010 and March 2011, had complained of angialgia during oxaliplatin(L-OHP)administration. Therefore, 3. 3 mg of dexamethasone(DEX)was added to their infusion solution. The patients were then asked to rate their angialgia severity using a numerical rating scale(NRS), when L-OHP in a 5% dextrose solution was administered with or without DEX. By changing the L-OHP in 5% dextrose solution without DEX to the solution containing 3. 3 mg of DEX, the mean NRS was improved to 2. 4 from 7. 1. These findings indicate that L-OHP in 5% dextrose solution mixed with 3. 3 mg of DEX seems to be useful in reducing angialgia during peripheral administration of L-OHP.
