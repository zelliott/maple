The purpose of this study was to partially replicate the 1984 ONS Research Priorities Survey. The educational standards of ONS were used as a conceptual framework. Surveys were mailed to 700 ONS members involved in research, with a response rate of 30% (n = 213). Respondents identified Prevention and Early Detection, Symptom Management, Pain Control and Management, Patient or Health Education, and Coping and Stress Management as their top five research priorities. The results were submitted to the National Center for Nursing Research as ONS's 1988 research priorities.
