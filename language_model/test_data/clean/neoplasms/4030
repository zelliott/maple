Somatic cell mutations arising in vivo in reporter genes and in cancer-associated genes may now be measured in humans. Background mutation levels and mutational responses following various mutagen exposures are reviewed in this chapter. The detection methods are compared for similarities and differences based on the underlying biology of the systems. Currently available data on molecular mutational spectra are reviewed and the utility of such information is discussed in terms of mutagen exposure characterization and for defining the mutagenic basis of carcinogenesis. In addition to the reporter gene assays, recently developed assays for mutation in cancer-associated genes are considered. The strengths and limitations of using somatic cell mutations for cancer epidemiology and areas for future research are discussed.
