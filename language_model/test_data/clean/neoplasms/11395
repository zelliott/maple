Eighteen pedicled anterolateral thigh perforator island flaps were used for complex perineal reconstructions between May 2003 and May 2005. The patients' average age was 48.6 years (range, 32 to 64 years), and the average follow-up period was 8 months (range, 2 to 13). In 7 cases, the perforator was septocutaneous and in 11 it was intramuscular. The application of the pedicled anterolateral thigh fasciocutaneous flap is described perineum reconstruction. The size of the perineum defects ranged from 6 x 9 cm to 16 x 17 cm, and the size of the transferred flap ranged from 8 x 11 cm to 18 x 20 cm. All flaps survived. One patient developed minor wound dehiscence in the posterior aspect of the perineal wound because of fecal contamination and skin maceration. The esthetic appearance of the reconstructed perineum was good. Despite a variable vascular anatomy that can give rise to some surgical challenge in raising the flap, the authors conclude that this is a safe and reliable flap for perineal reconstruction.
