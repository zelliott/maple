The follow up of patients after primary therapy of cancer is being made difficult by the large number of sometimes contradictory recommendations, but also by a lack of evidence in many diseases. A chance for cure or a longer life expectancy with earlier diagnosis of an asymptomatic recurrence exists in only a few diseases. For far more diseases, a symptom oriented follow-up with an emphasis on quality of life, treatment associated complications, evaluation of symptoms, and psychological support is recommended. In patients with a dislike of regular visits or in diseases without options for further treatment it will be sufficient if the patient returns in the case of complaints. Recommendations for follow-up in selected frequent cancers will be given, based mainly on the latest recommendations by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO).
