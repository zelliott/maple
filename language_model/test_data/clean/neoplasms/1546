AMD473 (previously ZD0473) is a new-generation platinum compound with activity against a wide range of human tumour cell lines and xenografts, including carboplatin- and cisplatin-resistant lines. To assess its potential combined with a taxane, a phase I study of AMD473 and docetaxel in advanced cancer was initiated by the National Cancer Institute of Canada-Clinical Trials Group.

Patients with advanced cancer, measurable disease, performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-2, no major organ dysfunction, and one or no previous taxane regimen received escalating doses of AMD473 and docetaxel every 3 weeks, with a starting dose of AMD473 80 mg/m(2) and docetaxel 60 mg/m(2).

Thirty-three patients enrolled on four dose levels were evaluable for toxicity and 25 patients were evaluable for response. The maximum tolerated dose was dose level 4 (AMD473 120 mg/m(2) and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2)), with grade 4 neutropenia in both minimally and heavily pretreated patients causing dose-limiting toxicity. As well at dose level 4, one patient had grade 3 vomiting despite premedication. Dose level three was expanded for both groups of patients and was defined as the recommended phase II dose at AMD473 100 mg/m(2) and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2). Non-hematologic toxicities included fatigue, diarrhoea and other mild toxicities. There was one partial response in a patient with prostate cancer and stable disease in 15 patients. No apparent pharmacokinetic interaction was noted.

AMD473 and docetaxel can be combined with a recommended phase II dose level of 100 mg/m(2) and 75 mg/m(2), respectively, given intravenously every 3 weeks. The combination has activity and should be explored in responsive tumour types.
