Plasmatic fibronectin has been studied in tumor patients on the basis of the role that unspecific opsonin may play in tumor growth and spreading. Alterations in fibronectin levels might be used as a biological marker and our purpose has been to evaluate the significance of this test in the biological diagnosis of cancer. When comparing the levels found in the control group (22.86 +/- 1.40 mg/dl) and in tumor patients (23.80 +/- 1.90 mg/dl), we observed no difference in the overall group. However, in relation to the localization of tumors, a significant increase was found in breast cancer (31.83 +/- 3.83 mg/dl) and a significant decrease in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (9.56 +/- 1.68 mg/dl). These results suggest that plasmatic fibronectin could be useful as a biomarker in some types of tumors. Our conclusion was confirmed by analysis of ROC curves related to every one of the studied tumors.
