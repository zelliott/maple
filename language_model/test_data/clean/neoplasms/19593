One way in which the psychosocial needs of cancer patients can be addressed is through support groups, which are often recommended to patients by healthcare professionals. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of Gilda's Club in meeting the needs of cancer patients during their first year of membership and whether their experience with this organization was a positive one. Thirty Gilda's Club members with cancer completed a semi-structured quantitative and qualitative questionnaire. Findings revealed over half of the sample participated in some type of support group and the majority of participants reported that the supports groups were helpful, with only 10% of participants reporting that they did not receive help from the support group. Qualitative data revealed that the most common sources of support outside of Gilda's Club were family, friends, and church. Since their initial contact with Gilda's Club one year ago, 60% reported no change in their level of depression, 20% reported more depression, and 20% reported less depression. Most participants (57%) had received no counseling for depression, and only 20% were still receiving counseling for depression. Qualitative data also revealed the majority of participants had overall positive impressions of Gilda's club.
