This phase I study investigated the maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of a 3-weekly administration of BMS-188797, a paclitaxel derivate, at three dose levels (DLs) (80, 110 and 150 mg m(-2) DL), combined with cisplatin (standard dose 75 mg m(-2)). In 16 patients with advanced malignancies treated, one patient experienced dose-limiting febrile neutropenia, sepsis and severe colitis at the 150 mg m(-2) DL; at the 110 mg m(-2) DL one episode of dose-limiting grade 3 diarrhoea/nausea occurred. Grade 3/4 haematological toxicities were leucopenia/neutropenia; grade 3 nonhaematological toxicities were neuropathy, nausea, diarrhoea and stomatits. Objective response was seen in four patients, with three complete remissions in ovarian and cervical cancer patients. Pharmacokinetics of BMS-188797 appeared linear through the 110 mg m(-2), but not through the 150 mg m(-2) DL. The mean+/-SD values for clearance, distribution volume at steady state and terminal half-life during cycle 1 were 317+/-60 ml min(-1) m(-2), 258+/-96 l m(-2) and 30.8+/-7.7 h, respectively. The maximum tolerated and recommended phase II dose for BMS-188797 was 110 mg m(-2) (1-h infusion, every 3 weeks) combined with cisplatin 75 mg m(-2).
