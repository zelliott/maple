A real-time transducer for ultrasonically guided puncture was used for percutaneous contrast medium injection and aspiration biopsy in 160 patients with various diseases of the abdomen. Opacification of the bile ducts, pancreatic duct and the portal vein was accomplished in 157 patients. Percutaneous aspiration biopsy provided cytological proof of malignancy in 56 of 64 patients with suspected carcinoma. Ducts or vessels less than 10 mm wide on ultrasound images were successfully opacified, and biopsy confirmed at 2 X 2.5-cm carcinoma.
