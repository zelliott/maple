Six selected diketopiperazines, cyclo(Gly-Val), cyclo(Gly-D-Val), cyclo(Gly-Leu), cyclo(Gly-Ile), cyclo(Phe-Cys) and cyclo(Tyr-Cys), were synthesized via various synthetic routes. Their potential to inhibit cancer cell growth in HT-29, HeLa and MCF-7 cells was determined. Cyclo(Tyr-Cys) caused the greatest inhibition in cervical carcinoma cells with near equivalent activity against HT-29 and MCF-7 cells. The other cyclic dipeptides tested were effective in the inhibition of colon, cervical and breast carcinoma cells, respectively, but the percentage inhibition was lower than for cyclo(Tyr-Cys).
