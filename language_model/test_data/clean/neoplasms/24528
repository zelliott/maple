Nine patients with advanced cancer suffering from idiopathic severe sweating were treated with gabapentin (600-1,800 mg/day). All patients responded to the treatment; five patients experienced transient drowsiness. Gabapentin seems to be a safe and effective treatment for idiopathic sweating in advanced cancer patients. Further studies are warranted to confirm or refute these results.
