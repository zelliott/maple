An oncology nursing team at the Freiburg University Hospital have developed a detection and prevention plan for respiratory complications. The plan was originally applied only to oncology patients, but due to its positive results it has since been put in practice in other parts of the hospital. Each patient that enters the hospital fills out a medical survey that is used as a baseline to decide what level of risk the patient presents in acquiring a respiratory infection during their hospitalization. A point system obtained from the survey is evaluated on a scale that allows the nursing care to be adjusted accordingly.
