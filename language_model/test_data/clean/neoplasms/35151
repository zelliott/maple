Plasminogen activator(PA)-tissue and urokinase type-and PA-inhibition in plasma were investigated in 52 consecutive cancer patients with a variety of tumors. At first patients were analyzed as one group. Secondly patients were subdivided into two groups, one with (n = 42) and one without (n = 10) metastasis. Our results show that tissue-type-PA antigen (t-PA-antigen) and PA-inhibition were both significantly increased irrespective of the presence or absence of tumor metastasis (p less than 0.001 compared to age matched healthy controls. In the group without metastasis a significantly decreased level of t-PA activity was found (p less than 0.001) but in the group with metastasis t-PA activity was normal. These data seem to reject the hypothesis that decreased plasma fibrinolytic activity is one of the prerequisites for tumor metastasis.
