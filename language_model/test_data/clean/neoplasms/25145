Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has gained widespread acceptance over recent years as a mechanism by which normally sessile epithelial tumour cells can move away from the primary tumour and metastasize. This review article examines the role of a number of growth factors in inducing EMT, and the reverse process mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Unique and common intracellular signalling pathways are highlighted. A comprehensive understanding of the regulation of EMT will be critical in manipulating this process to develop novel anti-metastasis therapies.
