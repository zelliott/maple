Twenty patients were treated with chemotherapy to mobilize progenitors into the blood. Peripheral blood stem cells were quantitated in peripheral blood or leukapheresis products using colony assays and flow cytometric measurement of CD34+ cells. In four patients where complete sets of serial samples were obtained, the appearance of CD34+ cells preceded the increase in CFU-GM by 24-48 h. Peak levels of CD34+ cells ranged from 0.6-5% and coincided with the peak increase in CFU-GM. Mobilized CD34+ cells contained subsets expressing CD33, CD13, CD45RA, CD38, HLA-DR, CD61 and CD41. Subsets of CD34+ cells expressing CD33, CD13, or CD45RA represent committed myeloid progenitors. In contrast to bone marrow CD34+ cells, few mobilized CD34+ cells expressed CD71, CD7, CD19 or CD10. Prompt engraftment of granulocytes greater than 500 x 10(6)/l at a median of 13 days and platelets greater than 50 x 10(9)/l at a median of 15 days was observed in patients reconstituted with mobilized cells. These data indicate that CD34+ cells mobilized during recovery from chemotherapy are predominantly myeloid in phenotype and contain few actively proliferating cells or cells with lymphoid phenotypes.
