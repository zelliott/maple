Interstitial sources of radiation are a useful and sometimes essential modality for achieving optimal dose distribution in radiotherapy. This paper presents examples of various applications of this technic. The essential advantage is not that survival statistics can be improved, but rather that whatever can be accomplished by ionizing radiation may be accomplished at a lesser cost in time, effort, and morbidity by judicious use of an interstitial radiation component.
