Prostanoids regulate angiogenesis in carcinoma and chronic inflammatory disease progression. Although prostanoid biosynthetic enzymes and signaling have been extensively analyzed in inflammation, little is known about how prostanoids mediate tumor-induced angiogenesis. Targeted cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibition in tumor, stromal and endothelial cells is an attractive antiangiogenic strategy; however, the associated cardiovascular side effects have led to the development of a new generation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) acting downstream of COX. These agents target terminal prostanoid synthases and prostanoid receptors, which may also include several peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Here, we discuss the role of prostanoids as modulators of tumor angiogenesis and how prostanoid metabolism reflects complex cell-cell crosstalk that determines tumor growth. Finally, we discuss the potential of new NSAIDs for the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent tumor development.
