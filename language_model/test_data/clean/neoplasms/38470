We have identified and quantitated a tumor protein complex, TSP-180, on murine carcinomas with two monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) (Cancer Res., 46: 707-712, 1986). One of the two MoAbs, 135-13C, recognizes a TSP-180-like protein complex on several human carcinomas in culture. MoAb 135-13C has been used to purify the human TSP-180 complex from A431 cells and the purified material used to immunize F344 rats to produce another MoAb, 439-9B, to the human TSP-180 complex. This MoAb does not precipitate the murine TSP-180 or bind to murine cells. Both MoAb 135-13C and 439-9B precipitated the same proteins from A431 cells but did not compete with each other for binding sites, indicating that they recognize different epitopes on the same protein. The two MoAbs have been used in a two-site assay to quantitate TSP-180 proteins on human cells and tissues. Carcinoma cell lines A431, SW948, and A549 all give high values (46 to 443 ng/mg of protein) while murine tumors, a human melanoma, and human fibroblasts are negative (less than 10 ng/mg of protein). Most tissues from autopsy of 2 normal individuals are negative for human TSP-180 at the levels tested (less than 10 ng/mg of protein). Some organs have intermediate range expression: spleen, 5 to 111 ng/ml of protein; colon, 24 to 111; and small intestine, 39 to 99. One primary colon and one larynx tumor were positive (144 to 372 ng/mg of protein) while 5 breast carcinomas, a stomach tumor, a metastatic melanoma, and a kidney tumor were negative. These data indicate that human TSP-180 may be preferentially expressed in certain malignant carcinomas of diverse origin. The potential for TSP-180 as a tumor marker requires further study.
