Although most solid tumors are treated surgically, determining the genetic changes present in the tumor of an individual patient is becoming increasingly important for managing the oncology patient. Our knowledge of the genetic alterations that characterize and predispose to solid tumors continues to expand. Concurrently, the advent of newer technologies such as DNA chips has the potential to enable a more rapid and comprehensive assessment of these changes. The ultimate goal of this new information and technology is to provide sensitive and specific tests that reduce unnecessary procedures and optimize therapy. This review addresses the utility of molecular testing in evaluating cancer. A review of the current technology and hereditary cancer syndromes is also presented.
