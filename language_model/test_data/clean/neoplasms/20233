Explaining the ultimate expression of life with fundamental physical law is the proposition dealt with in this paper. Normal cell division, as well as cancer, are analyzed and scrutinized in terms of Jacobson resonance, cyclotron resonance, the quantum Hall effect and the piezoelectric effect. The underpinning concept is based in the unification and connection of gravity to biological systems.
