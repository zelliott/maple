Palliative care is a treatment model that aims to relieve patient suffering and improve quality of life, and is essential for those living with chronic cancer. However, most palliative care referrals are made as a last resort when all other treatment options have failed. This article argues that social workers have an important role in early palliative care discussions because of their unique skill set. Techniques for early introduction of palliative care are addressed, as are ways for empowering patient advocacy. A case narrative of a young woman with chronic cancer is included as an example of the need for ongoing palliative care conversations.
