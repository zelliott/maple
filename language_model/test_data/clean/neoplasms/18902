The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between needs, expectations, and attendance patterns among users of a cancer wellness centre to better access future programming and improve attendance.

We interviewed staff from 18 cancer wellness centers in Canada and the United States to assess if our attendance expectations were realistic. Then, from a total sample of non-users in 2008 (n  =  67) and infrequent users (n  =  67) at the Hope & Cope Wellness Centre in Montreal, we randomly selected individuals from each group who registered and never returned (n  =  16), and those who registered and returned 1-3 times (n  =  17). Telephone interviews were conducted using a brief questionnaire. We used a phenomenological approach to assess the meaning of attendance for the registrants.

Both groups of participants described similar reasons for not attending such as health complications, scheduling conflicts, child care, language issues, and parking restrictions. However, non-users focused specifically on functional aspects such as administrative issues and scheduling, and distance from the centre, while infrequent users expressed more emotional disappointments such as feeling more depressed and inability to engage with others.

Strategies are suggested to optimize service delivery for short-term attendees, including home-exercise programming, virtual support, outreach systems, and caregiving support. Information from other wellness centers in Canada and the United States revealed similar trends in attendance but also revealed a wide range of programs and systems of data recording.

The results of this study have implications for cancer survivors, for health care providers, for the development of strategies to address participation barriers, and for future research on understanding optimal use of wellness centers.
