A wide spectrum of fetal antigens is found not only in fetal cells but also in tumor cells. These substances are termed onco-fetal antigens. One group out of these antigens has developed special diagnostic interest and importance, first of all the carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) in adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract. Another class of fetal antigens consists of tumor-assoicated membrane-antigens against these the organism may develop a cytotoxic reaction and in the long run, may repulse the tumor like an incompatible graft. The verification of this second group was possible by means of various cross reactions. These latter fetal antigens eventually may be utilized for purposes of immunological prophylaxis and therapy.
