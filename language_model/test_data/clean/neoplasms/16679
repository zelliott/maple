One hundred sixty-four sera samples of patients with malignant diseases were analyzed for the presence of autoantibodies to ssDNA, dsDNA, poly(I), Poly(G), cardiolipin, histones, RNP, Sm, Ro(SSA), and La (SSB). No distinction could be made between these patients and a comparative group composed of age-adjusted healthy subjects when measuring antibody levels to these autoantigens by the ELISA technique. This finding remained valid after further subgrouping of the patients according to age, sex, and histologic origin of the tumor. The authors conclude that in contrast to the known clinical coexistence of neoplasia in autoimmune states, there is no increased incidence of antinuclear autoantibodies in malignant conditions.
