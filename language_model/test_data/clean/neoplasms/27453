Cancer arises as a result of complex and interacting abnormalities. However, over the past 20-25 yr numerous technological advances in molecular biology have led to a dramatic increase in the identification of the molecular processes involved in the development of cancers. The analysis of these molecular changes can be done on different levels: at the DNA or RNA level, or by assessment of posttranscriptional events. This overview discusses the merits of different methods for the analysis of DNA such as SSCP or DGCE. The exciting methods of RNA expression analysis using oligo or cDNA gene chips are also discussed. The importance of methods to analyze posttranscriptional or the effect that altered telomerase activity or methylation status contributes to the phenotype of the cancer cell is emphasized. These techniques will contribute to a better understanding of cancer initiation and progression and will eventually lead toward the development of new molecular-targeted drug therapies.
