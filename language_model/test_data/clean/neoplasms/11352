Recent evidence continues to support a central role for TGFbeta in tumor maintenance and progression. Although this may involve TGFbeta-mediated paracrine effects that modulate the tumor microenvironment and the host immune system, some studies causally implicate autocrine TGFbeta in cancer cell motility and survival. Other recent evidence indicates synergy between oncogene and TGFbeta signaling in epithelial cell transformation. This suggests opportunities for dissecting molecular mechanisms of cross-talk as well as providing insights into possible combinatorial molecular anticancer therapies that will include TGFbeta inhibitors.
