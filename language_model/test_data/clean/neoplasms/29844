Recent trials with interferon, in particular those using pure, recombinant interferon, have provided us with improved data (compared with those obtained in early studies) and show that interferon does hold some promise as a therapeutic agent. When used in the treatment of viral disease, interferon has shown itself to be quite effective in reducing viral titres. While not as effective against cancer, interferon has limited tumour growth, reduced the appearance of metastases and led to a general improvement in patient condition in many cases. This article discusses some of the recent results obtained with interferon in the treatment of viral disease and cancer.
