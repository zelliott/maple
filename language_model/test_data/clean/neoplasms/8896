The present review aims at providing an assessment of the clinical significance of Biphosphonates (BPs) in the treatment of patients with cancer.

A systematic literature review was performed based on database search in PubMed/Medline and included articles up to August 2013.

BPs can reduce, delay, and prevent complications related to bone metastases. They improve mobility, functionality, pain, and quality of life. They limit survival of any inactive cancer cells in the microenvironment of the bone marrow, contributing to their death from anti-neoplastic treatments. Moreover, they limit and delay bone morbidity due to osteoporosis related to hormonotherapy in breast and prostate cancer. Finally, benefits can be derived from the combination of BPs with radiotherapy in bone density, recalcification, opioid use, and patient's quality of life and performance status.

The contribution of BPs in the course of certain neoplasms is preventive and synergistic to other treatments.
