Recent studies of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis alterations in PTSD have demonstrated a specific type of hyperresponsivity of this stress hormonal system characterized by a greater negative feedback inhibition of cortisol, which may paradoxically serve to lower cortisol levels. The occurrence of cancer has been recently described by many investigators as an event that fulfills the DSM-IV criteria for a "traumatic event" that has been demonstrated in some cases to be linked with the subsequent development of PTSD. This review considers the extent to which neuroendocrine alterations observed in PTSD may be useful in understanding cortisol alterations involved in cancer.
