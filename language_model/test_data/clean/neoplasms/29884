A mathematical model of morphogenesis of tumor nodes has been developed on the basis of the physical theory of elasticity. According to the model, one of the important morphogenetic factors of tumors consists of their internal elastic forces determining the structure of tumor nodes and intermittent phase-wise pattern of their development. The existence of a certain "critical point" in the morphogenesis of nodes (determined by the size of the tumor and its histological structure) was established the passing of which lead to a sharp decrease in the tissue pressure in node centers. The gradient of tissue pressure in tumor nodes is the leading pathogenetic factor of secondary changes and results in the appearance of a typical zonal histotopographic structure of tumors. On the basis of the rate of tumor growth alone, the model allows the intensity of their cell division to be determined and also shows the process of cell proliferation in tumor nodes to be subject to the regularities of Fibonacci number series.
