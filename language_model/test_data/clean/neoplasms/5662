The optimal protocol for the mobilisation of PBSC remains unknown. We present data on 42 patients mobilised with cyclophosphamide (3 or 4 g/m2) and the delayed addition of a standard 300 micrograms dose of G-CSF (Filgrastim) from day +5. The patients had received a median of 2 previous chemotherapy regimes, 38% had received prior radiotherapy and 38/42 had active disease at the time of mobilisation. The protocol was well tolerated and 38 patients proceeded to transplantation. The median number of CD34+ cells reinfused was 4.3 x 10(6)/kg (range 0.5-30) and CFU-GM 15.8 x 10(4)/kg (range 0-148). The total number of CD34+ cells harvested correlated with the total number of CFU-GM available for reinfusion (P = 0.008). Overall engraftment occurred within median days to neutrophils &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)f/l or platelets &gt; 20 x 10(9)/l of 14 and 13 days, respectively. Patients receiving more than 2.5 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells had even more rapid haemopoietic reconstitution with significant reductions in hospital stay and transfusion requirements. Those below this threshold had significantly delayed platelet engraftment. The mobilising dose of cyclophosphamide did not influence the achievement of the threshold CD34+ cell yield for optimal engraftment. The delayed addition of a standard 300 micrograms G-CSF dose after priming chemotherapy resulted in the use of a median 9 days hence 9 vials of G-CSF. This protocol presents the potential for cost saving without compromising the quality or success of PBSC mobilisation.
