Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a powerful drug for treating cancer. However, it is only powerful if it is properly applied. That is, IL-2 should be applied at the tumor site, because at the transition of normal and malignant tissue are the tumor infiltrating cells. These should be activated by IL-2. Local application implies that IL-2 can be used in relatively low doses. It is becoming clear that even a single injection of IL-2 can cure cancer. IL-2 can also enhance the therapeutic effects of irradiation and Cisplatin. Locally applied IL-2 therapy is virtually non-toxic.
