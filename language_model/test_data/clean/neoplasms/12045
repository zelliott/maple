In 1000 patients with monoclonal gammapathies, heavy and light chains typing of the monoclonal Ig was performed. Class distribution of the heavy chains showed the following percentages : IgG = 56.60%; IgA = 17.0%; IgM = 14.5%; IgD = 0.3%; Light chain gammapathies (including Bence-Jones proteinuria without serum M-component) = 11.6%. The chi/lambda ratio was 663/337. Such results agree with figures from most statistical studies. Beside the well-known linkage between IgM and chi types in pathological macroglobulinemia, the quite high incidence of lambda chain type of light chain components is to be noticed. The frequency of gamma G type of M-component is significantly higher in patients demonstrating no symptoms of myeloma or lymphoma. chi/lambda ratio seems to be slightly affected by aetiological features.
