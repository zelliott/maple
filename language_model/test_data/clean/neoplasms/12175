There are multiple molecular mechanisms involved in human cancers with many genes involved, complex interactions and a variety of ways to examine them. Some events are already emerging as clinically important; others will turn out to be bystanders. By focussing on key genes, such as p53, the clinical implications of genetic changes and the pathways they link into are becoming apparent. Using the complex methodologies now available allied to disciplines such as mathematics we are improving our understanding of malignancy. This is beginning to impact on the management of patients with cancer; meanwhile, a good surgical operation performed timeously is still the best chance a patient has of a cure for most types of solid cancers.
