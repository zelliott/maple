Based on a lipid-absorbing ability of lymphatic capillaries, a fat emulsion containing anticancer agents was applied to selectively deliver more increasing amounts of anticancer agents into regional lymph nodes. The emulsions, in which the drug solution is contained as the innermost phase or as oily soluble drug, yield high drug concentrations in the lymphatic system. Clinical trial of the emulsion method was carried out preoperatively for 180 patients with stomach cancer. As a result, the emulsion enhanced the chemotherapeutic effect of the anticancer agent on lymph node metastasis. About a 20 m mu-sized activated charcoal, in which anticancer agents were absorbed, selectively delivered the anticancer agents to the lymphatic system. The activated charcoal was also excellent carrier material for the lymphatic system, and we have applied it to patients with lymphatic metastasis.
