Subjective global assessment (SGA) is a simple and reliable malnutrition-screening tool. The SGA has not been evaluated in India or in populations where chronic energy deficiency (CED) is rampant. We evaluated the value of preoperative nutrition, determined using the SGA, in predicting postoperative adverse outcomes in cancer patients.

Two hundred and ninety-four cancer patients undergoing elective surgery were screened for malnutrition using a modified version of the SGA, and 266 patients (aged 14-73 years [median 50]; 165 male) were eligible. All patients were followed up till discharge, and number of days on antibiotics, length of postoperative stay, occurrence of major adverse events, and death within 30 days were recorded. The association of preoperative SGA scores (A, B, or C) and BMI groups (&lt; 18.5, 18.5-20 or&gt; 20 Kg/m2) and four outcome variables were tested for statistical significance.

The cancer sites included head and neck region in 112, gastrointestinal tract in 53, thoracic organs in 28, and other sites in 73 patients. The SGA scores were A in 152, B in 98, and C in 16 patients. The BMI was &lt; 18.5 in 110 (41.8%) patients. The length of postoperative stay and the number of antibiotic days revealed a significant trend from SGA-A to SGA-C (p=0.000). Pre-defined adverse events occurred in 7.9%, 17.3% and 25% of SGA groups A, B, and C, respectively (p=0.025). The risk for adverse events was significantly higher in SGA-C group (OR 5.27, 95% CI 1.35-20.51, p&lt; 0.016) compared to SGA-A group. Three patients in SGA-B group and one in SGA-C group died within 30 days (p=0.04). No significant association was detected between the three BMI groups and duration of antibiotic use, length of postoperative stay, adverse events or mortality.

SGA is a simple and inexpensive way to identify clinically relevant malnutrition in Indian patients undergoing cancer surgery. Low BMI was not associated with postoperative adverse outcomes, and its use for nutritional screening is likely to overestimate severe malnutrition in Indian patients.
