Patients with cancer represent the largest group of hospice users, making this population critically important in hospice research studies. Despite the potential benefits of hospice, many studies have noted lower levels of utilization among African Americans. The goal of this literature review was to determine whether this disparity exists within this population of patients with cancer. The largest studies focusing on multiple cancers found lower hospice use among African American patients with cancer. Disparities also existed after entry into hospice. Age, gender, geographic location, preference for aggressive care, and knowledge of hospice influenced hospice use by these patients. Since African American patients with cancer evidently use hospice at a lower rate, future studies should explore potential barriers to participation by this patient population and methods to remove these obstacles.
