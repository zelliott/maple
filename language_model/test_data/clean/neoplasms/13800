The purpose of this study was to examine the nature and contribution of the nurse practitioner (NP) role in an oncology palliative clinic. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from the practice of one NP. Data were obtained on the performance of the NP role functions. the characteristics of the patients seen by the NP, the interventions delivered by the NP, and the outcomes of care. Descriptive and content analyses were used to analyze the data. The results indicate that the NP in an oncology palliative care clinic engages primarily in the clinical component of the role. The emphasis is on symptom management, patient and family education and counseling, coordination of care, and maintaining continuity of care. The method followed in this case study to examine the contribution of the NP role could be used by other NPs to demonstrate the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of their care.
