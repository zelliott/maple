The MDM2 proto-oncogene encodes a 90-kDa protein that binds to and inactivates the tumor suppressor p53. Several reports describe the presence of different alternatively, as well as, aberrantly spliced transcripts of the MDM2 mRNA in a variety of human cancers that have lost the ability to bind p53. Due to the transforming ability of at least some of the isoforms it has been suggested that they might contribute to tumorigenesis. Here we show that shorter MDM2 transcripts are also widely expressed in normal tissues, including lung and renal tissue, and in lymphocytes. Alteration in MDM2 RNA transcripts were found in the majority of the samples. Although we cannot exclude that alterations in MDM2 preferentially occur during cancer development, our data rather indicate that in this context the commonly observed transcript variants may also possess a normal physiological function.
