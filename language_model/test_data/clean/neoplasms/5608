A seven-county, predominantly black, rural-poor population in Alabama is targeted for a program aimed at improving access to state-of-the-art cancer care. This paper presents combined age-adjusted cancer incidence rates for predominantly black, rural counties in North Carolina and Georgia similar to the Alabama counties and compares these rates with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) incidence rates.

Cancer incidence data from 1990 to 1993 were obtained from the Georgia Center for Cancer Statistics for 10 rural counties with predominantly black populations. Likewise, cancer incidence data from 1990 to 1993 were obtained for seven rural-poor counties in North Carolina from the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry. SEER incidence rates from 1990 to 1992 were obtained for nine SEER sites.

The overall cancer incidence rate from North Carolina and Georgia is lower by 22% than the SEER rate. Cancer incidence rates for cancers of the breast, colon/rectum, lung, and prostate were at least 15% lower than the SEER rates, while the invasive cervical cancer rate was 1.78 times higher than the SEER rate.

Blacks comprise about 50% of the population in these counties. In contrast, the SEER population is predominantly white, and the black population is primarily urban. Estimates of the number of cancer cases in black, rural-poor populations based on SEER incidence rates is not reflective of the cancer experience in these populations.
