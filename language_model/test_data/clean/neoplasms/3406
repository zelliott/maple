Eighty-six patients with tumour induced hypercalcaemia were randomised to 600, 900, 1200 or 1500 mg of intravenous clodronate, according to post hydration serum calcium levels. Sixty-seven were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 49.3% (95% CI: 36.8-61.8) with no significant difference in response rates, i.e. achievement of normocalcaemia at days 6-9 (corrected serum calcium &lt; or =2.6 mmol l(-1)) across all groups.
