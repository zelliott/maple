To describe the process used by our cancer center to assess staff knowledge and attitudes about cancer-related fatigue, and to change clinical practice of fatigue assessment and management.

Review articles, research studies, guidelines, and questionnaires.

Change in clinical practice occurs slowly. One major change that occurred was the inclusion of a fatigue question in the Daily Patient Care Record. This inclusion signified a commitment by the institution to address this under-reported and under-treated symptom.

Professionals challenged to pursue practice change must be passionate, persistent, and patient. A multidisciplinary effort is needed to support change.
