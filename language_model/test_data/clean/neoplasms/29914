Eight non-smokers were experimentally exposed to cigarette smoke by staying in a poorly ventilated room together with heavy smokers for 6 h. Air samples were taken and the extract appeared to contain mutagenic substances. This is in accordance with the presence of carcinogens in tobacco smoke. Inhalation of the contaminated air by the passive-smokers resulted in an increase in the urinary excretion of products mutagenic in the Salmonella/microsome assay. This observation suggests that there is a causality in the association between increased cancer risk and passive-smoking, as was found by other investigators.
