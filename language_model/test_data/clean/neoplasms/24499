The quantitative analysis of the cell dose-survival curves, the randomness of cell killing by radiation, the probabilistic basis of the response to irradiation of tumors and normal tissues, the understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying to this response, the rationale for dose-time and fractionation in radiotherapy, the introduction of the concepts of tumor control probability (TCP) and biologically effective dose (BED), the relationships TCP-dose, BED-alpha/beta BED-fraction size and BED-treatment time, the problems associated with the accelerated regeneration of surviving tumor clonogens during the course of fractionated radiotherapy, the new demands of knowledge on oncology and radiation biology derived from heterogeneous dose distributions in conformal radiation therapy programs and the definition of the biological basis of normal tissues tolerance to reirradiation are, probably, the most important contributions of radiobiology to clinical radiotherapy in the last twenty five years. Radiotherapy is today a scientific discipline based on the interplay of mathematics, physics, biology and oncology. The knowledge of the basic concepts of radiobiology is essential for daily radiotherapy practices and for all oncologists. The most efficient use of multimodality treatments in cancer therapy cannot be done without a clear understanding of these principles.
