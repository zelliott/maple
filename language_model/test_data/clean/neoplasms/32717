Almost one quarter of all cancer patients in the United States is estimated to have children under 18-years-old living with them. However, there is limited research on how children's functioning is affected by parental cancer, and the impact of parenting concerns on treatment decisions. This paper will review the literature and hypothesize about why addressing the needs of the children has not been part of routine cancer care. In addition, we will make a case for the importance of including parenting issues in cancer care, and in assessments of treatment decision-making and quality of life. We also describe a clinical program that is attempting to address these issues, and offer practical recommendations for oncologists who want to help parents with cancer and their partners support their children through the challenges of cancer treatment.
