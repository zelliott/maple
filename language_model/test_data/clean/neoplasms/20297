Through interaction with antibody, IgG Fc receptors provide an interface between specific humoral immunity and Fc gamma R-bearing host cells. Fc gamma R trigger such diverse functions as immune complex clearance, phagocytosis of opsonized pathogens, reactive oxygen intermediate and enzyme secretion, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Moreover, Fc gamma R are the exclusive trigger molecules for tumor cell killing by human myeloid cells. Studies of Fc gamma R function have been aided by the use of bispecific antibodies to link cells or pathogens to specific host cell molecules, including Fc gamma R. These reagents have permitted determination of the role of Fc gamma R in ADCC of the protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii, by human effector cells. This approach has also indicated that Fc gamma R do not serve as entry points for viruses such as dengue virus and HIV. Taken together, these results provide insight into the utility of manipulating Fc gamma R function in the therapy of cancer and infectious disease.
