An epidemiologic investigation of a 1964 cohort of 478 photographic processors in nine Eastman Kodak Color Print and Processing (CP&P) laboratories in the continental United States was undertaken. Analysis of pre-1965 environmental data indicated that chemical exposures were within the standards applicable at the time. The results showed no significant excess mortality, sickness-absence or cancer incidence. The processing cohort's mortality experience after 16 years of follow-up compared favorably with that of two industrial control populations. The present study represents (to our knowledge) the first published occupational epidemiology investigation that specifically examines the health of workers engaged in large-scale commercial photofinishing operations.
