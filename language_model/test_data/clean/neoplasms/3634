Although pain management education results in improved pain control for some patients, it does not work for all patients because some patients remain reluctant or unwilling to use prescribed analgesics to their optimal effect. In a randomized clinical trial that tested the effectiveness of the PRO-SELF Pain Control Program, 11 patients declined to increase their analgesic use despite moderate to severe pain. These patients were selected for a qualitative analysis of their audiotaped discussions about pain management with their intervention nurses. This analysis revealed that these patients often spontaneously provided detailed explanations about why they were reluctant or unwilling to take analgesics in general or opioids in particular. We termed these explanatory accounts pain management autobiographies because of their narrative character and multilayered, richly detailed quality. Pain management autobiographies included stories about (1) previous experience with chronic pain management, including stigmatizing interactions with clinicians and family members; (2) bad experiences with cancer pain management, including severe constipation; and 3) strongly held conventions about medication use, including the belief that all medications are "toxins" that should be avoided. The study findings suggest that a small subset of patients with cancer pain may need interventions such as individual or family counseling or alternative pain management strategies to augment education about opioids.
