Cell migration plays a crucial role in embryonic development, wound healing, regeneration, inflammation, and immune response, as well as in dissemination of malignant tumors. Vimentin is the marker of migrating cells, but its role in cell migration is still unclear. However, recent studies have revealed novel functions for vimentin related to the migration, such as determination of cellular polarity, regulation of cell contact formation, and arrangement and transport of signal proteins involved in cell motility. The review sums up the latest data on vimentin functions and its involvement in molecular mechanisms underlying cell migration. Early studies demonstrated that vimentin expression during embryonic development is associated with cell migration. However, having obtained vimentin knockout mice without apparent impairments in development and ability to reproduce, doubts have appeared ifvimentin is required for cell migration during embryonic development. In the present review, we also discuss involvement of vimentin in migration processes at different stages of development and try to resolve current contradictions concerning the role of vimentin in various events of cell migration.
