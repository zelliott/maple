The purpose of this study was to perform a Phase I trial of raltitrexed, a selective inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, and to determine the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles as a function of raltitrexed dose. Fifty patients with advanced solid tumors and good performance status were treated with raltitrexed as a 15-min i.v. infusion every 3 weeks, at doses escalating from 0.6 to 4.5 mg/m2. Asthenia, neutropenia, and hepatic toxicity were the most common dose-limiting toxicities in this largely pretreated patient population, but they occurred during the initial cycle in only one of nine patients treated with 4.0 mg/m2 and in two of nine patients treated with 4.5 mg/m2. Only 2 of 13 patients treated with 3.5 mg/m2 ultimately experienced unacceptable toxicity after three and seven cycles, compared with 42 and 56% of patients receiving 4.0 and 4.5 mg/m2 after medians of three and two cycles, respectively. The maximum raltitrexed plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve increased in proportion to dose. Raltitrexed clearance was independent of dose and was associated with the estimated creatinine clearance. Asthenia, neutropenia, and hepatic transaminitis were dose-related and tended to occur more frequently when patients received three or more cycles of therapy. A 3-week treatment interval was feasible in the majority of patients at all doses. Although 4.0 mg/m2 appeared to be a safe starting dose in this pretreated patient population, about half who received two or more courses ultimately experienced dose-limiting toxicity. A dose of 3.5 mg/m2 was well tolerated in most patients.
