Age-standardized proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were calculated for 10 036 metal workers in British Columbia with the use of information on cause of death and occupation recorded in death registrations from 1950 to 1978. Metal workers were found to have a significantly increased risk of death from lung cancer (PMR = 134). In addition, certain occupational groups of metal workers were found, for the first time, to be at increased risk of death from other types of cancer; these included leukemia (PMR = 356) and cancer of the rectum (PMR = 248) in metal mill workers, Hodgkin's disease in welders (PMR = 242) and multiple myeloma in machinists (PMR = 209).
