The efficiency of antiemetic drugs was investigated in 36 children with neoplasia (mainly of hematopoietic system) in the course of 83 cycles of chemotherapy. The following antiemetic drugs were investigated: Fenactil (brand of chlorpromazine), Torecan (brand of thienylpromazine maleate), Aviomarin (brand of dimenhydrinate), Decadron (brand of dexamethasone), Primperan (brand of metoclopramid), and placebo. The most efficient was dexamethasone which prevented vomiting in 54% cycles of chemotherapy and diminished their intensity in the remaining cycles. No adverse reactions were noted. Efficacy of Fenactil, Torecan, Aviomarin, and Primperan was similar to that of placebo.
