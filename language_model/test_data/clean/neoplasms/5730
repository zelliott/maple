We investigated cancer risk among mothers of 2365 children who were diagnosed with cancer between 1973 and 1989 in Sweden. From the date of birth of the child until 31 December 1989, 38 cases of cancer were diagnosed among the mothers. The expected number of cases, according to national rates, was 30.9. Cancer of the thyroid was the only site showing a significantly increased risk among the mothers (observed = 6, expected = 1.2, P &lt; 0.01), but two cases were medullary cancer associated with an inheritable syndrome, and inherited by their children.
