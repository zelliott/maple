Towards revolutionary biomarkers, a considerable amount of research funds and time have been dedicated to proteomics. Although the discovery of novel biomarkers at the dawn of proteomics was a promising development, only a few identified biomarkers seemed to be beneficial for cancer patients. We may need to approach this issue differently, instead of only extending the conventional approaches that have been used historically. The study of biomarkers is essentially a study of diseases and the biochemistry relating to peptide, protein and post-translational modifications is only a tool. A problem-oriented approach should be needed in biomarker development. Clinician participation in the study of biomarkers will lead to realistic, practical and interesting biomarker candidates, which justify the time and expense involved in validation studies. Although discussion in this article is focused on cancer biomarkers, it can generally be applied to biomarker studies for other diseases.
