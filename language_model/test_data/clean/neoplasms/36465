The so-called 'Apollonian gasket' offers interesting suggestions on how chromatids might be packaged among microtubular bundles of the mitotic spindle. While transiting through the spindle's viscous environment, the helical motions of coiled chromatids engender important interactions via synergistic or antagonistic torques that are instrumental for both shape and function of normal genomes as well as for certain anomalies (aneuploidy, nuclear deformations, etc) often associated to the malignant state.
