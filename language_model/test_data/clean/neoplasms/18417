Good governance, clinician engagement, and clear accountabilities for achieving specific outcomes are crucial components for improving the quality of care at both an organizational and health system level.

This article describes the benefits and results reported by Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) in transforming from a direct provider of cancer services to an organization whose responsibilities include improving the quality of care across the province's cancer system. The significant challenges in establishing accountability in the absence of direct operational authority are discussed. Case examples illustrate how the structures and processes created through CCO's clinical governance framework achieved measurable improvements in cancer care outcomes.

Challenges in establishing accountability were addressed through the creation of a clinical governance framework that integrated clinical accountability with administrative accountability in an ongoing performance improvement cycle. The performance improvement cycle includes four key steps: (1) the collection of system-level performance data and the development of quality indicators, (2) the synthesis of data, evidence, and expert opinion into clear clinical and organizational guidance, (3) knowledge transfer through a coordinated program of clinician engagement, and (4) a comprehensive system of performance management through the use of contractual agreements, financial incentives, and public reporting.

CCO has succeeded in developing a clinical governance and performance improvement system that measures and improves access to care in the treatment phase of the care continuum. Future efforts will need to focus on expanding quality improvement initiatives to all phases of cancer care, measuring the appropriateness of care, and improving the measurement and management of the patient cancer care experience.
