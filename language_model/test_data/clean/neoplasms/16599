Over the past decade an increasing number of studies have supported the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin) in cancer patients, suggesting that it improves haemoglobin concentrations for some. There is also evidence that this treatment may lead to improvement in quality of life for cancer patients. This systematic review examines the issue. We identified and critically reviewed 13 trials. Although some of the results indicate that epoetin has positive effects on quality of life, methodological limitations inherent in most of the studies hamper interpretation of data. Evidence from this review suggests that more robust designs are required to show any significant quality-of-life benefits for cancer patients undergoing epoetin treatment.
