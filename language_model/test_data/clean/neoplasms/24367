The past two decades of gene targeting experiments have allowed us to make significant strides towards understanding how the Myc/Max/Mad network influences multiple aspects of cellular behavior during development. Here we summarize the findings obtained from the myc/max/mad knockout mice generated to date, namely those in which the N-myc, c-myc, L-myc, mad1, mxi1, mad3, mnt, or max genes have been targeted. A compilation of lessons we have learned from these myc/max/mad knockout mouse models, and suggestions as to where future efforts could be focused, are also presented.
