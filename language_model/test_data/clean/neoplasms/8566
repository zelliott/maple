This paper complements an article in the previous edition of this book by emphasizing recent development in the use of ROC curves, the analysis of multiple markers, and methods of analysis for serial marker data. What has not changed is the need for statisticians and clinicians to work together closely to define clinical issues and their statistical formulations.
