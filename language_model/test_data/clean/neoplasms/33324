The identification, purification, and characterization of cancer stem cells holds tremendous promise for improving the treatment of cancer. Mounting evidence is demonstrating that only certain tumor cells (i.e. the cancer stem cells) can give rise to tumors when injected and that these purified cell populations generate heterogeneous tumors. While the cell of origin is still not determined definitively, specific molecular markers for populations containing these cancer stem cells have been found for leukemia, brain cancer, and breast cancer, among others. Systems approaches, particularly molecular profiling, have proven to be of great utility for cancer diagnosis and characterization. These approaches also hold significant promise for identifying distinctive properties of the cancer stem cells, and progress is already being made.
