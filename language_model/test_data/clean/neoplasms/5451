The aim of this prospective study was to establish the exact role parenteral nutrition has in the provision of nutritional support to patients receiving antineoplastic therapy. The diagnosis, reasons for implementation, method of delivery and duration of nutritional support were determined. The outcome of nutritional support was established by the percentage change in weight and alteration in body mass index during the period of nutritional support. The results indicate that parenteral nutrition can successfully maintain the body weight of patients who are unable to receive enteral nutrition whilst receiving antineoplastic treatment. However, it is recommended that the provision of parenteral nutrition is evaluated at regular intervals and alternative feeding methods via the enteral feeding route are accessed as soon as possible.
