To illustrate the burden depression imposes on society, we present estimates of the annual costs of depression--$44 billion--as well as the number of individuals it affects per year--almost 11 million. Although these estimates point to depression as a major illness, this study examines why it is not generally considered as such by the medical and public health communities or by society at large.

We develop a framework that compares depression with major illnesses such as coronary heart disease, cancer, and AIDS by highlighting salient characteristics of each illness. This comparative illness framework considers the costs, prevalence, distribution of sufferers, mortality, recognition, and treatability of each disease. This comparison underscores many of the similarities and differences among the illnesses examined.

Because depression often is not properly recognized and begins to affect many people at a relatively early age, it exacts costs over a longer period of time and in a more subtle manner than other major illnesses. It also imposes a particularly heavy burden on employers in the form of higher workplace costs.

We conclude that, because of the potential for successful treatment, increased attempts to reach untreated sufferers of depression appear to be warranted. Employers as a group have a particular incentive to invest in the recognition and treatment of this widespread problem, in order to reduce the substantial costs it imposes upon them each year.
