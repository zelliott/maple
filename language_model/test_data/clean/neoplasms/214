There are numerous factors promoting the development of PEM in the child with cancer. Some of these factors are related to the tumor, many to the treatment itself, and some to failure of recognition of PEM. Not all children with cancer are at great risk for the development of PEM. These patients must be monitored and supported with comprehensive enteral programs. Children who have developed or are at risk for PEM must be identified and supported with CPN or PPN plus CEN during early intensive periods of treatment and during the later phases of abdominal radiotherapy, operative resection of tumor, or relapse. The decision to institute CPN must be based not only on the child's current nutritional status but also on the nature of the therapy he or she is soon to receive and the likelihood that he or she will be able to maintain an adequate intake during that therapy. Realistic goals must be set for nutritional support. The value of nutritional intervention lies in its ability to correct or prevent the development of adverse effects related to PEM. This support is hoped to contribute to improved tolerance of therapy, increased energy to complete normal day-to-day activities, and an improved sense of well-being for the child. If these goals have been accomplished, then the nutritional therapy has been successful.
