The simultaneous treatment of heart and concomitant disease is now possible in many cases, and is usual in heart-valve disease with coexistent coronary artery disease. If in addition to the heart disease, a carotid artery stenosis exists, a simultaneous operation is preferred in our clinic using the aid of extracorporeal circulation (with hypothermia, hemodilution, and full heparinization). When both heart disease that is in need of operation and a malignant tumor are present, the clinical strategy can be dependent only on the prognosis of the malignant illness.
