The aim of this study was to determine whether administration of chemotherapy interferes with the quantitative uptake of [(99m)Tc]hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC) annexin V in normal human tissues at 5-7 h and 40-44 h after treatment initiation.

Eleven cancer patients were prospectively included in this study after written informed consent. Five patients underwent two scintigraphic scans with [(99m)Tc]HYNIC annexin V within 40-44 h from each other without any treatment given in between (control group or group 1). Six other patients starting a new chemotherapy or bisphosphonate regimen (treated group or group 2) underwent a scintigraphic scan with [(99m)Tc]HYNIC annexin V pretreatment (within 1 week of treatment initiation) and at 5-7 h and 40-44 h following treatment initiation. Whole-body and organ-specific geometric mean counts, corrected for background activity, were obtained from regions of interest drawn on the earliest images and kept constant over all subsequent images per patient. Differences in whole-body and organ uptake between successive scans were assessed using non-parametric statistics.

No significant differences in mean percentages of injected dose uptake in whole body or organ tissues were observed between scan 1 and scan 2 in the control group and between scan 1, 2, and 3 in the treated group.

Prior administration of [(99m)Tc]HYNIC annexin V and administration of chemotherapy does not interfere with quantitative specific uptake in healthy human tissues when using a schedule of baseline and 5-7 h and 40-44 h post-treatment imaging.
