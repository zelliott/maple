Protocatechuic acid (3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid) is a natural phenolic compound found in many edible and medicinal plants. Recent studies indicate that it could be used as a protective agent against cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms. The mechanism of its action is mostly associated with antioxidant activity, including inhibition of generation as well as scavenging of free radicals and up-regulating enzymes which participate in their neutralization. The influence on phase I and II of some carcinogens' metabolism and, perhaps, direct blocking of specific binding sites of ultimate carcinogens with DNA molecule, thus preventing adduct formation that may result in mutations and neoplastic transformation, are also important. However, the other aspects of the chemopreventive activity of protocatechuic acid including influence on the activity of inducible isoenzyme of cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase or cell cycle regulating proteins are not fully evaluated.
