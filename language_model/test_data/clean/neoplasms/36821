Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a secreted endothelial cell-specific mitogen and permeability factor. Malignant human tumors have been shown to produce VEGF. Elevated levels of VEGF have been detected in sera of cancer patients, but its origin is unsettled. We analyzed VEGF concentrations in serum, plasma, whole blood, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) and platelets in 56 cancer patients and 52 healthy controls using ELISA. The VEGF concentrations in the lysed whole blood samples [blood VEGF (B-VEGF)] were higher in cancer patients than in healthy controls (median, 464 versus 298 pg/ml; P&lt;0.0001). The highest B-VEGF values were found in disseminated cancer. In cancer patients, a high B-VEGF concentration was associated with a high peripheral blood leukocyte count (P = 0.0012) and platelet count (P = 0.019). In healthy individuals, a high B-VEGF was associated with a high leukocyte count (P = 0.0001) but not with the platelet count (P&gt;0.1). The cancer patients regularly had higher B-VEGF concentrations than healthy individuals with comparable leukocyte or platelet counts. The VEGF content of isolated PBMNCs and platelets was severalfold higher in cancer patients than in healthy controls (median, 10.6 versus 0.9 pg per 10(6) PBMNCs, and median, 1.6 versus 0.5 pg per 10(6) platelets; P&lt;0.0001 and P = 0.0008, respectively). Serum VEGF and B-VEGF correlated strongly (P&lt;0.0001). Very little or no VEGF was found in the plasma. The results indicate that VEGF in the bloodstream is transported by blood cells, including leukocytes and platelets. The blood cells of cancer patients contain greatly elevated amounts of this major angiogenic growth factor, and this reservoir of VEGF may have a role in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis formation. VEGF in serum samples originates from blood cells, and the use of VEGF of whole blood or of isolated blood cells may improve the clinical value of VEGF measurements.
