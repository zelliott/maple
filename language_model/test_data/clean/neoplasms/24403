Adolescents with cancer are confronted with many challenges. The extent to which they are able to deal with such challenges appears to be partly contingent on a positive strong social support system. In this article, the author describes findings specific to the sources of social support that 15 adolescents with cancer found to be most important in getting them through the cancer experience. Data were collected as part of a longitudinal qualitative interpretive study and involved individual interviews, focus group interviews, and participant observation as the main sources of data. The relationships that adolescents maintained with their nuclear families, health care team members, and special friends were the 3 main supportive relationships in the adolescents'lives. The act of others "being there" was seen by the adolescents as the key element of a supportive relationship and involved 6 main behaviors. Although the 3 key supportive relationships were essential in helping adolescents get through cancer, these relationships were at times a source of stress for adolescents.
