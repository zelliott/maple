Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and fructosamine (FA) were determined in thirty-three children with malignant diseases and twenty healthy controls aged 1-14 years. Of them, FA was the parameter measured in children with malignancy for the first time. Mean serum TC, HDL-C, LDL-C and FA showed statistically significant decreases in malignancy compared to healthy children, whereas a statistically significant increase was observed for TG concentrations in serum. From these data, we conclude that significant relations between serum lipids and lipoproteins and the state of malignancy exist in the children studied, and it should be remembered that serum FA concentrations are affected by abnormal serum protein turnover when one deals with any type of neoplastic disease.
