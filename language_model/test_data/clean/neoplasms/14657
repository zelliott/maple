Riboflavin deficiency diminishes the rate of growth of spontaneous tumors in experimental animals but enhances the carcinogenicity of specific drugs such as the azo dyes, which are degraded by a microsomal hydroxylase system requiring riboflavin. Human esophageal cancer has been epidemiologically associated with riboflavin deficiency, but the precise role of riboflavin in this tumor remains to be defined. Riboflavin nutriture influences epithelial integrity, tissue flavin concentrations, rates of prostaglandin biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism, each of which may have implications for carcinogenesis.
