The risk posed by the presence of organochlorine pesticides in milk and milk products was estimated for the population of Mumbai. To determine the levels of organochlorine pesticides in milk and milk products, a monitoring study was carried out in and around Mumbai City. 520 samples of milk and milk products of different brands were considered in this study. A survey was also conducted to determine the mean daily consumption of milk and milk products by different age groups and this data was used to evaluate the daily exposure to the public. Non-cancer effects were evaluated by comparing the predicted exposure distributions to the published guidance values. For chemicals identified as potential human carcinogens, cancer risk was evaluated using standard methodology. The majority of the chlorinated pesticides identified in the milk and milk product samples studied were found to be at levels which do not pose unacceptable risks to the public, with the exception of alpha-HCH. The cancer risk estimated for this chemical slightly exceeds the US EPA guidance value.
