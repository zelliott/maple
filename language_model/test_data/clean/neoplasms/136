It has been suggested that a decrease in the availability of oxygen to certain tissues may lead to increased metabolism of glucose through the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway and to increased synthesis of polyols, in particular myoinositol. It is further suggested that these "cytosolic reactions" result in stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol cycle by increasing substrate availability (i.e. phosphatidate, diglyceride and inositol). A relative decrease in local oxygen availability may therefore play a role in cell proliferation and differentiation and in the etiology of cancer, diabetic sequelae and obesity.
