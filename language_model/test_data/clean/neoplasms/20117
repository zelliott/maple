The comparison between the clinical and pathohistoanatomic diagnosis of 3.929 autopsied cases is performed. In 82.5% of cases the clinical and pathohistoanatomic diagnosis were in the absolute correlation; in 8% of cases the clinical diagnosis of the basic disease has no adequate pathoanatomic characteristics, while in 4.5% of cases the clinical diagnosis of the basic disease, immediate cause of death and condition which was important for the course and outcome of the treatment were not adequate. Among the pathologic states diagnosed as: pulmonary thromboembolism, myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular insult--pulmonary embolism most often was not confirmed by autopsy (47%), while in 58% of cases it remained clinically unrecognized. Malignant tumours of the liver, pancreas and kidneys have been most frequently clinically unrecognized compared to other malignancies. Duration of hospitalization has not had the essential influence on correct establishment of the clinical diagnosis.
