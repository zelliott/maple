By addressing questionnaires to 24 cancer patients candidate to immunotherapy, we evaluated both the effects and the effectiveness of the medical information provided to the patient on their knowledge of the disease and the treatment. Most patients had correctly understood the information but 69% stated that they had been unable to ask all the questions they wished, and 62% required additional information. Most patients admitted to being emotionally distressed throughout the interview. These results are not significantly different from those obtained in patients candidate to new chemotherapy agents, but show that important improvements in the informed consent procedure are required.
