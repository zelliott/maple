Fc receptors for IgG (Fc gamma Rs) can trigger the inflammatory, cytotoxic and hypersensitivity functions of immune effector cells. Activation or deactivation of effector cells via Fc gamma Rs can be exploited to develop novel therapies for cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. Initial results of clinical trials for several Fc gamma R-directed immunotherapies show the potential promise of this approach.
