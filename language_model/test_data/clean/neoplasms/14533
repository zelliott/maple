Caring for patients can induce intense emotions in psychiatrists. Although clinical experience suggests that such feeling can become a source of stress for the psychiatrists, particularly the first year resident, and interfere adversely with patient care, research in this area has been lacking. We studied a group of psychiatric residents in order to identify what patient conditions or characteristics induce the greatest dysphoria and adversely affect the quality of patient care. Serious medical illnesses induced the greatest dysphoria.
