Folic acid will soon be added to cereal-grain products as a result of a new public health measure enacted by the Food and Drug Administration. This fortification program will target women of childbearing age with the goal of increasing folic acid intake, a B vitamin shown to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects. This measure may benefit the health of the general population, as recent research demonstrates that folic acid may be associated with the prevention of coronary artery disease and some cancers. This article will review the key concepts related to folic acid and provide an overview of the implications of the fortification program for the primary care practitioner. The clinician working with women and families must be prepared to provide individualized nutritional intervention to assist individuals to reach the goal of 400 mcg of folate per day.
