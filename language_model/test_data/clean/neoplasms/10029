In many respects, tarsal tunnel syndrome is analogous to carpal tunnel syndrome. Despite this fact, tarsal tunnel syndrome has lagged far behind its counterpart in recognition and understanding. Thought of as a local compression phenomenon, reports of systemic associations are now being seen with increased frequency. This article reviews both local and systemic considerations for tarsal tunnel syndrome. Analysis of our own group of patients revealed 49 with electrodiagnostically confirmed tarsal tunnel syndrome, 24 of whom had bilateral involvement. The incidence of systemic disease was found to be 34.7%.
