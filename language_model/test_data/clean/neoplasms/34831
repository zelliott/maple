Skin care regimens using active ingredients that are recommended by physicians who treat mucocutaneous conditions including aging should become more focused on reversing and preventing chronic inflammation. This adjustment of therapeutic and preventive strategies is necessary because chronic inflammation appears strongly linked to many preventable and treatable skin diseases and conditions such as visible skin aging. Mucocutaneous inflammation as the final common pathway of many systemic and mucocutaneous diseases including extrinsic aging has been established at the molecular and cellular levels. The corollary to this strategy includes inhibition of primary activators of mucocutaneous inflammation such as stratum corneum permeability barrier disruption, blocking any pro-inflammatory environmental insult such as ultraviolet radiation, and quenching tissue responses to these insults. This review will present the scientific rationale substantiating the conclusion that chronic inflammation is the common denominator in many mucocutaneous pathophysiologic processes including extrinsic skin aging.
