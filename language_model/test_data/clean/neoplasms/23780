Although there is compelling evidence for multiple mutagenic events in the induction of cancers, there is also substantial evidence in support of nonmutagenic mechanisms. It is proposed that the genetic basis of noninduced or spontaneous tumors, as well as cancers induced by nonmutagens, involves heritable changes in the regulation of gene expression.
