To test the value of oncofetal antigens in the cytologic diagnosis of effusions, immunoperoxidase staining with antisera to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein (SP1) and placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) was carried out on pleural and peritoneal fluids from 72 cases. Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell blocks were used in most cases; cytocentrifuge preparations were used in some. Reactions were negative with all antisera in 23 of 24 nonmalignant effusions as well as in all 7 cases of malignant mesothelioma and 4 cases of malignant lymphoma. In 24 of 36 confirmed carcinomatous effusions, staining was positive with one or more antisera, including anti-CEA positivity in 23 of the 24 cases. In 5 of the 24 cases with positive staining, a confident diagnosis of malignancy had not been made on routine cytologic preparations. Immunoperoxidase staining for CEA appears to be of supportive value in the cytologic diagnosis of malignancy in effusions.
