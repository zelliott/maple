This review focuses on the genetics of inborn predisposition to the development of cancer. The gene defects responsible for the majority of the most common syndromes of inherited predisposition to cancer have been deciphered during the last five years. These discoveries have shown that the genetics of most of these inherited forms of cancer is remarkably simple: the mechanism underlying the risk of cancer is precisely the one proposed by Knudson to explain the inherited forms of retinoblastoma. Only a small minority of the cancers are imputable to inherited mutations causing a very high risk of cancer. However, low penetrance susceptibility genes, mainly acting as environmental risk modifiers, are probably involved in the development of the majority of cancers. As much as possible, we will consider the immediate and long term possible repercussions on everyday medical practice of these advances in basic understanding of genetic cancer risks.
