The purpose of this article is to investigate current evidence for the management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lymphoedematous limb in order to develop guidelines for the management of this patient group. Starting with a review of the literature related to current management of DVT in the wider population, it then considers its applicability to lymphoedema care. Outpatient management of ambulant persons who develop DVT has recently gained wide acceptance. Contrary to standard practice of removing compression, bed-rest and anticoagulant therapy, evidence is emerging for the use of graduated compression hosiery in the management of lower limb DVT in the care of ambulant patients. Its relationship to lymphoedema care and current practice by practitioners in order to improve the care and outcomes of people affected by lymphoedema will also be examined.
