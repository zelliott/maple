The results of the clinical study of beforal (butorfanol) ("Spofa", Czechoslovakia), a synthetic analgetic from a class of opiate agonists-antagonists, in 17 cancer patients at all stages of surgical treatment have been summarized. It has been established that beforal is a potent analgetic analogous in antistressor properties to moradol ("Galenika", Yugoslavia), however differing by a more prompt onset and discontinuation of action, thus improving the control over general anesthesia. A comparative assessment of circulation parameters and stress factors (glucose, cortisol, blood plasma STH) has shown that beforal exceeds fentanyl in the efficacy of prevention of surgical trauma during and after extended cancer surgery.
