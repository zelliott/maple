To retrospectively study the results obtained with the implementation of totally implantable catheters in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

815 totally implantable catheters placed in 793 patients undergoing chemotherapy regimen, preferably using the right cephalic vein. We evaluated early and late complications.

The retrospective analysis showed an average duration of 339 days of the catheters. In 733 (90%) catheters there was no observe complication. Among early complications we observed one pneumothorax, one bad positioning of the catheter, one arterial puncture, one bleeding, one hemothorax and hemomediastinum and six hematomas in the implantation site. As for late complications, there were 35 catheter-related infections ten, infections in the surgical site, six obstructions and 20 thromboses. We removed 236 catheters, 35 due to complications and 201 by the end of treatment.

totally implantable catheters for chemotherapy are a safe means for the administration of substances, in view of the low number of complications observed in this study.
