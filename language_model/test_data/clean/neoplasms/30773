This paper offers an alternative to the conventional social/psychological definition of "coping." Using a theoretical framework of "illness trajectory," the authors examine the uncertainty of temporality, body, and identity inherent in coping with cancer. Analysis then turns to the interaction among these uncertain conditions and the complex work processes described by people with cancer, as they tolerate, i.e., "cope with," the disease. Although presented separately for purposes of clarity, these processes and their related activities are experienced in varying combinations and with varying and fluctuating importance by each individual. Viewed comprehensively, however, they constitute the larger process of coping with cancer, with implications for other diseases as well.
