A recent cross sectional study on symptomatic acute deep vein thrombosis at the National University Hospital (NUH) in Singapore found a frequency rate of 0.79 per 1000 patient admissions. A total of 39 patients were accrued over 18 months, 36 with deep vein thrombosis alone and three complicated by pulmonary embolism. No sex or ethnic predilection was observed in this cohort of hospitalised patients. Twenty-eight (71.8%) patients were 40 years or older. Majority (89.7%) of patients had at least two predisposing factors. While prolonged bedrest and operative procedures featured equally frequently in patients above and below 40 years, neoplasms were predominantly associated with the former and protein C or S deficiency primarily with the latter. The exhaustive laboratory confirmation of an inherent thrombotic tendency is recommended only for patients below 40 years of age.
