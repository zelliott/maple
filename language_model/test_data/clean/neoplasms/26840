To identify changes in plasma cytokine levels after image-guided thermal ablation of human tumors and to identify the factors that independently predict changes in plasma cytokine levels.

Whole-blood samples were collected from 36 patients at three time points: before ablation, after ablation (within 48 hours), and at follow-up (1-5 weeks after ablation). Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured using a multiplex immunoassay. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using cytokine level as the dependent variable and sample collection, time, age, sex, primary diagnosis, metastatic status, ablation site, and ablation type as the independent variables.

There was a significant increase in the plasma level of IL-6 after ablation compared with before ablation (9.6-fold ± 31-fold, P&lt;.002). IL-10 also showed a significant increase after ablation (1.9-fold ± 2.8-fold, P&lt;.02). Plasma levels of IL-1α, IL-2, and TNF-α were not significantly changed after ablation. Cryoablation resulted in the largest change in IL-6 level (&gt;54-fold), whereas radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation showed 3.6-fold and 3.4-fold changes, respectively. Ablation of melanomas showed the largest change in IL-6 48 hours after ablation (92×), followed by ablation of kidney (26×), liver (8×), and lung (6×) cancers. Multivariate analysis revealed that ablation type (P&lt;.0003) and primary diagnosis (P&lt;.03) were independent predictors of changes to IL-6 after ablation. Age was the only independent predictor of IL-10 levels after ablation (P&lt; .019).

Image-guided thermal ablation of tumors increases plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-10, without increasing plasma levels of IL-1α, IL-2, or TNF-α.
