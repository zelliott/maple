Analysis of attendance of the German Cancer Screening Programme according to sex, age and federal state ("Land") reveals noticeable regional differences whereas in general participation is decreasing. It is shown that attendance is above average in the city states, Hesse, and Baden-Württemberg. The remaining Länder should, therefore, improve their rates. A decline in preventive activities and a reluctant attitude towards cancer screening must be taken seriously and be considered when developing the programme further.
