Phosphorylation of 2-(3-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-6,7-methylenedioxy-1H-quinolin-4-one (1) afforded diphosphate 2. We found that, upon treatment with methanol under mild conditions, 2 can undergo facile and highly regioselective dephosphorylation to give the monophosphate 3, with a phosphate group remaining on the phenyl ring. The details of the dephosphorylation process were postulated and then probed by LC-MS and HPLC analyses. Furthermore, as a preliminary study, the water soluble monophosphate prodrug 4 was tested for antitumor activity against a MCF-7 xenograft nude mice model.
