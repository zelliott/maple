In 13 patients the T2 values of muscular and various tumor tissues was determined by MR under in-vivo conditions. The tumors were confirmed by surgery. In 5 cases there was a neurinoma of the acoustic nerve, in 3 cases a lateral neck cyst, a granuloma of the larynx and some other pathological processes. Intraoperatively the tissues are biopsied and the T2* time is determined by spectroscopy in vitro. Both the muscular and the tumor tissue show higher mean values or standard deviations in MR measurements than in measurements by spectroscopy. The relations between muscular and tumor tissue (quotients) are comparable in neurinomas of the acoustic nerve (n. vestibulo-cochlearis) and lateral neck cysts, the granuloma of the larynx and lymph nodes of the neck, using both examination methods. Calculations of the correlation coefficients of T2 values and quotients of the muscular and tumor tissue point to tissue-specific connections between in-vivo and in-vitro measurements.
