A survey was carried out on all the bovine neoplasms recorded in the registration files of the Section of Pathology of the Veterinary Research Institute, Onderstepoort, Republic of South Africa, over a 40-year period from 1935 to 1974. The 606 neoplasms were divided and tabulated into 20 groups according to body systems or tissue types. Skin, connective tissue, lymphoid tissue and ocular tumours in that order accounted for the majority of neoplasms. Squamous cell carcinoma was the most frequent neoplasm and the 2 main sites for it were the eye and the vulva. Fibromas and fibrosarcomas made up the majority of the connective tissue tumours. The lymphoid tissue tumours, composed almost entirely of lymphosarcomas, were the 3rd most common group of tumours. Penile fibropapillomas and cutaneous papillomas were commonly encountered, and there was also a noteworthy incidence of melanomas, mesotheliomas and neurofibromas. The male and female genital tracts were relatively frequently neoplastic, due principally to the occurrence of penile fibropapillomas, vulvar squamous cell carcinomas and uterine carcinomas. The incidence of respiratory, hepatic and vascular system tumours was moderate, whilst tumours of the endocrine, central nervous, skeletal and muscular systems were rarely encountered.
