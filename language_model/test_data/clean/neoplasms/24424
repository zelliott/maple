This study is based on the interview of 21 subjects, aged 70 years and over, attending an oncology centre. At the end of their treatment, we have explored the processes of patient's choice, including goals, resources and constraints. The main variables influencing the acceptance of chemotherapy are full awareness of one's clinical condition, irrespective of whether a cure is possible or not, self perceived state of health, and lastly life expectancy. Age itself initially does not appear to be a limiting factor. Every effort should be made to tailor communication to individual needs, not least because of a link between learned and perceived treatment adverse effects. We found that symptoms, especially fatigue, hamper routine activities, leading to social withdrawal. Gradually the manifestations of the disease itself and of its treatment, combined with age, reveal both personal vulnerability and the role of support networks.
