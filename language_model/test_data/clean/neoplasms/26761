Cancer is associated with psychological and physical morbidities. The presence of such comorbidities has been reported to worsen the overall outcome and quality of life (QOL) of affected people.

To assess the QOL and its determinants among participants with cancer.

We administered the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF instrument, socio-demographic/clinical data collection sheet and structured clinical interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis to 210 consecutively admitted participants with cancer at the University College Hospital Ibadan to determine the diagnosis of major depression.

The sample consisted of 63 men and 147 women; 68 participants had cancer of the breast, while 59, 40 and 43 had cancers of the cervix, colon/rectum and prostate, respectively. The QOL of most of the participants was fair. Approximately 30% of the participants were depressed, 75.7% had pains while 49.5% of them had advanced cancer. Male sex, older age, depression, pains and advanced stage cancers were significantly associated with poor QOL.

The QOL of participants is negatively affected by male sex, older age, depression, advanced stage of cancer and pains.
