Before the advent of ultrasound, no noninvasive techniques were available for the evaluation of diseases of the groin. Ultrasound, because of its unique ability to visualize soft tissue structures distinctly, has been used as a diagnostic test in 95 patients with proved or suspected disease of the groin during a 15 month period. Seventy patients had operative verification of the sonographic diagnosis, and in 68 patients, the sonograms correctly predicted the surgical findings. We have found sonography clinically helpful in patients with undiagnosed pain in the groin, questionable inguinal or femoral region hernias, masses of the groin, postoperative complaints after inguinal or femoral herniorrhaphies and possible femoral aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms.
