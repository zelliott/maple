A formalised report (FR) offers a set of standard phrases to be used to state (1) whether findings of a cytologic study contain new information; (2) the degree of certainty in understanding the significance of morphological forms of available international classifications of a pathology said morphological evidence is compatible with. The use of that FR provides a means of evaluating reported cytologic conclusions, and comparing them with relevant postmortem diagnosis. This makes it possible to ascertain with greater or less certainty, with which nosological forms a doctor deals. It is also a means of inspection over the way materials are sampled and processed at a particular cytological laboratory as well as evaluation of its general standards. The main advantage of introduction of FR is that it is unambiguous and can be computer processed.
