Alcohol consumption has long been recognized as a risk factor for mortality. By combining data on alcohol per capita consumption, alcohol-drinking status and alcohol-drinking patterns, risk relationships, and mortality, the Comparative Risk Assessment Study estimated alcohol-attributable mortality for 1990 and 2010. Alcohol-attributable cancer, liver cirrhosis, and injury were responsible for the majority of the burden of alcohol-attributable mortality in 1990 and 2010. In 2010, alcohol-attributable cancer, liver cirrhosis, and injury caused 1,500,000 deaths (319,500 deaths among women and 1,180,500 deaths among men) and 51,898,400 potential years of life lost (PYLL) (9,214,300 PYLL among women and 42,684,100 PYLL among men). This represents 2.8 percent (1.3 percent for women and 4.1 percent for men) of all deaths and 3.0 percent (1.3 percent for women and 4.3 percent for men) of all PYLL in 2010. The absolute mortality burden of alcohol-attributable cancer, liver cirrhosis, and injury increased from 1990 to 2010 for both genders. In addition, the rates of deaths and PYLL per 100,000 people from alcohol-attributable cancer, liver cirrhosis, and injury increased from 1990 to 2010 (with the exception of liver cirrhosis rates for women). Results of this paper indicate that alcohol is a significant and increasing risk factor for the global burden of mortality.
