Chromosomal study in malignancy has demonstrated the pivotal role of somatic chromosomal rearrangements in oncogenesis and tumoral progression. Structural or quantitative these abnormalities can now be studied in great details with the various Fish techniques, including CGH on chromosomes or in a near future on micro arrays. The multistep pattern of most solid tumors is characterized and their genomic abnormalities more and more used for the diagnosis and the prognosis.
