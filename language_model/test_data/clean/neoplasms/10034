A three drug regimen of carbenicillin, cefazolin and gentamicin was used for the treatment of patients with solid tumors, who developed fever while granulocytopenic following chemotherapy. Thirty-five (8%) of 426 cancer patients receiving various combinations of antineoplastic chemotherapy qualified for the antibiotic treatment. Nine patients (26%) had bacteriologically confirmed infections, all with gram negative microorganisms. Twenty-four patients (69%) recovered and eleven (31%) died. All deaths occurred within five days of antibiotic therapy; in patients who recovered, the fever subsided within six days. Mortality was not influenced by the presence of a positive bacterial culture, age, or the cytotoxic agents used. It was, however, strongly related to metastatic spread: nine out of 14 patients with liver metastases (64%) died from the infection, while only two of 11 patients (18%) with other metastatic sites failed to respond to the antibacterial therapy. No death occurred in 10 patients who had local disease or received adjuvant therapy. This combined antibiotic therapy was as effective as reported for other combinations, with no serious side effects.
