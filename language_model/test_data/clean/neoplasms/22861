Providing social support for families of pediatric cancer patients remains a challenge. The perceived helpfulness of 11 potential support sources was assessed by 107 parents of children with cancer. They rated the spouse, the medical community, and parents from a mutual help group as the most helpful. Mental health professionals and the church were seen less frequently and perceived as less helpful. No significant differences were found in the patterns of social support among parents with children in different stages of treatment. More than half the parents responding to a question on what they needed most during their children's illness mentioned emotional support and counselling. Mental health professionals may find that crisis/supportive and educative models and frequent contact are useful counselling approaches in dealing with families of cancer patients. A team approach to pediatric oncological treatment, consisting of a primary physician, nurse, and psychological consultant, may be a way to optimize the early and flexible involvement of psychosocial staff in total care.
