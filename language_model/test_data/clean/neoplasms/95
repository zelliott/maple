A series of glyceryl 1,3-bis- and 1,2,3-tris[omega-(3-amino-2,4,6-triiodophenyl)alkanoates] were synthesized, radioiodinated with iodine-125, and evaluated for their ability to selectively localize in the liver for potential use as hepatographic imaging agents. Of the nine target compounds synthesized and evaluated in rats, glyceryl 1,2,3-tris[3-(3-amino-2,4,6-triiodophenyl)propionate] (5b) displayed rapid and sustained liver specificity. This agent was found to accumulate in the liver in concentrations of 60, 75, and 86% of the administered dose at 5 min, 30 min, and 24 h, respectively. Moreover, the 24-h liver-to-blood ratio of 235 justifies further studies in higher animal species.
