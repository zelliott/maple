Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is used increasingly for both treatment of diseases, and illness prevention and maintenance of health. However, studies on the latter two subjects are still rare.

In an unsystematic review publications on CAM in the context of the prevalence of use, possible risks, and cost implications of prevention are analyzed. Also, publications published in MEDLINE until December 2008 on CAM modalities used for the prevention of common diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer or dementia, are reviewed.

Among the CAM modalities, some dietary supplements show relatively strong positive evidence for being effective in the prevention of some common diseases.

Still a great deal of systematic research effort lies ahead before most of the options discussed would meet mainstream medical standards for introduction into routine prevention regimens, and even more for maintenance of health. Also, many other popular CAM modalities may have potentials in this context, but published data are still not available.
