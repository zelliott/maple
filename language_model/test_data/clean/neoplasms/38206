In an objective to generate effective carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) specific anti-tumor immune response in Swiss mice, CEA was presented using macrophages with adjuvant help from neem leaf glycoprotein (NLGP). Such vaccination generates significantly higher antibody (IgG2a) and T cell response than immunization protocol without NLGP. NLGP controls the function of both B cells and macrophages by altering the expressions of various regulatory molecules, like, CD19, CD11b, etc. NLGP also directs CEA vaccination towards Th1 bias, by modulating cytokine secretion. This NLGP-generated anti-CEA immune response would be effective as a vaccine to lyse CEA(+) tumors in vitro and in vivo.
