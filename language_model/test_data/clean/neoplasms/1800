Physical exercise plays a crucial role in the treatment of inflammatory myopathies. In the phase of active muscle inflammation the prevention of contractures in the joints and physiotherapy for the respiratory system are the most important goals, whereas in the recovery phase of dermatomyositis and polymyositis the emphasis must be on the strengthening of the remaining muscle fibers and the treatment of the myopathy caused by corticosteroids. The authors discuss in detail the special rehabilitation problems of myositis patients depending on the activity and subtype of the disease and the possible solutions.
