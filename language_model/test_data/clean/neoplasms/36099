Shc (Src homology and collagen homology) proteins are considered prototypical signalling adaptors in mammalian cells. Consisting of four unique members, ShcA, B, C and D, and multiple splice isoforms, the family is represented in nearly every cell type in the body, where it engages in an array of fundamental processes to transduce environmental stimuli. Two decades of investigation have begun to illuminate the mechanisms of the flagship ShcA protein, whereas much remains to be learned about the newest discovery, ShcD. It is clear, however, that the distinctive modular architecture of Shc proteins, their promiscuous phosphotyrosine-based interactions with a multitude of membrane receptors, involvement in central cascades including MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and Akt, and unconventional contributions to oxidative stress and apoptosis all require intricate regulation, and underlie diverse physiological function. From early cardiovascular development and neuronal differentiation to lifespan determination and tumorigenesis, Shc adaptors have proven to be more ubiquitous, versatile and dynamic than their structures alone suggest.
