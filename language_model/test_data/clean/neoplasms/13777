The Japanese guidelines for the clinical practice of cancer pain management supported by evidence-based medicine were established by the Japanese Society for Palliative Medicine in 1999 [as their Evidence-based Medicine-supported Cancer Pain Management Guideline ]. To evaluate usefulness of the Guideline for the management of cancer pain, the same questionnaires were addressed to nurses and physicians of enrolled institutions twice. The first survey was conducted before the distribution of the Guideline in July, 1999 and the second was done after the distribution in January, 2000. Usefulness of the Guideline was examined by comparing the results of two surveys. Cancer patients were divided into two groups depending on their stages (conservative or terminal). (1) Morbidity of pain in cancer patients at each stage having some analgesics did not change at each survey period. (2) At the first survey the rate of pain relief in each stage of cancer patients was essentially unchanged from a previous result obtained in 1998. (3) The rate of pain relief shown in the second survey tended to be higher than that shown in the first in both groups of patients. (4) The rate of pain relief with per os morphine was shown to be significantly higher in the second survey than in the first for each group of patients at conservative or terminal stage. (5) The rate of pain relief of patients staying in the ward where the guidance for dosing of morphine had been carried out was 37.5% at the first survey versus 47.9% at the second. (6) The answers from physicians to questions about treatment of cancer pain remained unchanged between the first and the second survey. The usefulness of the Guideline for cancer pain management is partly confirmed by these results. The significance of the Guideline will be totally discussed by comparing its effects on nurses, pharmacists and physicians.
