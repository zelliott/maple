Human anti-mouse immunoglobulin immune responses were studied in ten patients, eight with ovarian cancer and two with grade IV gliomas, diagnosed and treated with radiolabeled (123I, 131I) murine monoclonal antibodies. It was found that serum from these patients before treatment and from 18 control healthy individuals contained detectable antibodies to antigenic determinants on the Fc but not the F(ab')2 portion of mouse immunoglobulin. No change in this reactivity occurred after the initial (imaging) dose of monoclonal antibodies. However, repeated administration of mouse immunoglobulins for therapy resulted in an elevated immune response directed against determinants on both Fc and F(ab')2 regions of mouse immunoglobulin. This response contained increased levels of immunoglobulin M as well as immunoglobulin G and showed a marked prozone effect in our enzyme linked immunosorbent assay system. None of the immunized patients developed a detectable antiidiotypic response.
