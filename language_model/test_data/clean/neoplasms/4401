This study indicated that by adding cytochalasin B (6 micrograms/ml) at 24 h, the lymphocyte culture time for micronucleus (MN) assay could be shortened to 64 h. In both unirradiated and ex-vivo irradiated (2 Gy) lymphocytes from three populations, we found that the differences in MN yield obtained by our modified cytokinesis-blocked time frame and that recommended by Fenech and Morley (1985) were insignificant (P = 0.66-0.87). We believe that the shorter assay time may enhance the applicability of MN assay for the rapid assessment of ionizing radiation overexposures.
