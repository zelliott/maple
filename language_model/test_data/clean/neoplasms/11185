We determined the incidence of severe bleeding from gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) after myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplant and the outcomes after treatment with endoscopic neodymium:YAG laser photocoagulation. From 1992 to 2005, the incidence of severe bleeding from GAVE was 6/4491 (0.13%). All patients had received oral busulfan and four had sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Gastrointestinal bleeding began a median of 53 days after transplant (range 15-2952). After GAVE was diagnosed by endoscopic and histologic findings, a median of three (range 2-7) sessions of laser therapy were required to control the bleeding with a median of 2737 J (range 1117-6160 J) per session. A median of 16 units (range 4-44) had been transfused prior to laser therapy and a median of four additional units (range 0-113) were transfused until bleeding was controlled. All patients were followed for at least 70 days after the last laser therapy session, with no further episodes of bleeding. Complications were mild and included abdominal pain and asymptomatic ulceration; however, one patient required gastrectomy due to gastric necrosis following transarterial embolizations. In summary, severe bleeding from GAVE is rare following hematopoietic cell transplant. Treatment with endoscopic therapy using the Nd:YAG laser is safe and effective.
