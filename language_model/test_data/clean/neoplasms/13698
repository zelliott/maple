This paper presents the results of calibration of PTW Markus and NACP ionization chambers following the procedures outlined in the TRS 381 International Atomic Energy Agency code of practice. According to this dosimetry protocol, calibration of plane parallel chambers follows 2 methods. The first method uses a high-energy electron beam and consists of comparing the plane parallel chamber with a cylindrical chamber whose N(D,air) calibration factor, traceable to cobalt-60 (60Co), is known, while the second method applies to a 60Co gamma beam whose air kerma rate is known at the calibration point. As the second method is generally applied in Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratories, the consistency of calibrations free in-air and in a water phantom has been studied. A close agreement is shown between the 2 methods (the calibration factors differ by at most 0.98%). These results lead to the conclusion that either of the 2 calibration methods can be used, provided that the correction factors given by the TRS 381 code of practice are applied.
