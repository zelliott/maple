To provide an overview of the various types of ambulatory pumps available in relation to mechanism of delivery, patient selection criteria, potential complications, and educational support.

Ambulatory pumps are an important means of drug delivery in a wide range of clinical conditions. Technologies permitting drug self-administration and automated drug delivery outside the hospital have become increasingly more sophisticated and adaptable; more than 600 models are available. With the shift of health care delivery from the hospital setting to the outpatient and home settings, reliable effective ambulatory pumps are necessary to safely deliver medications.

The use of ambulatory pumps is becoming more common as they are initiated as a part of front-line patient therapy. The nurse involved in the selection and management of ambulatory pumps is challenged to be familiar with the large variety available. Selecting the best type of pump is based on several factors, such as the type of therapy, disease state, reimbursement, and the ability to operate and troubleshoot complications.
