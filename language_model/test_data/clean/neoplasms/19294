During tumor progression, multiple genetic changes in the genome vastly alter the transcriptomes of cancers. Some of these changes, including the mutations of various growth regulatory genes as well as alterations in the transcription of a large number of genes, may lead to resistance to treatment. Therefore, capturing such genomic information of the tumors would enable a physician to decide on the course of treatment options clinically available. Currently, it is still not feasible to identify all the genetic mutations that have occurred in a patient's cancer genome. However, the advent of DNA microarray coupled with the completion of the human genome sequence and the identification of all its genes, have made possible genome-wide gene expression profiling of the cancer genome. In this review, we will focus on the application of expression genomics for identifying signature gene expression profiles in primary cancers to predict response to either radio- or chemotherapy. We envision that transcription profiling of the cancer genomes ultimately will not only reveal how altered gene expression results in resistance to treatment, but also be exploited for predicting and personalizing cancer therapy.
