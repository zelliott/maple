Results from a survey of junior high students conducted in preparation of curriculum materials on cancer prevention are reported. Students in the survey (n = 246) consider cancer to be a serious disease, not particularly amenable to treatment, and caused by many things. About half the students mentioned avoiding tobacco use as important in preventing cancer. However, 27% were unable to identify any ways to avoid getting cancer. Specific knowledge of dietary practices recommended to reduce cancer risk was poor, with fewer than 10% of students mentioning high fibre or low fat as important dietary habits. Knowledge of factors related to skin cancer was better, with 53% of students mentioning avoiding sun exposure as a way to reduce the risk of skin cancer. The majority of students (71%) wanted more information about cancer. The results from the survey indicate a need for cancer-prevention materials in the school curriculum.
