'Not being told what is wrong' is the most frequent complaint patients make (Fletcher, 1980). In cancer a lack of information greatly increases the stress and anxiety experienced. In this report, 46 patients with cancer were given audiotape recordings of their 'bad news' consultations to take home. Analysis of subsequent questionnaire data revealed that both patients and their families benefited enormously from the opportunity to hear the details of their diagnosis and treatment again.
