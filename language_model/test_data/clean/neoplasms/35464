The presence of tumor cells in bone marrow, peripheral blood and lymph nodes has proven its clinical and prognostic value. Since the frequency of these cells in bone marrow and blood is sometimes as low as 1 per million and due to the fact that for the analysis of lymph nodes many sectioning levels have to be analyzed, automated imaging devices have been suggested as an useful alternative to conventional manual screening of specimens. The aim of this paper is to review the performance of current equipment that is commercially available, based on literature published so far. Requirements for introducing this equipment for routine clinical practice are discussed.
