In Canada, it is estimated that in 1992 115,000 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. This total excludes 47,200 estimated new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer. The number of new cases is increasing by about 3,000 per year due partly to the aging population, improved registration, earlier detection of cancer and real increases in the incidence of some types of cancer. It is estimated that there will be 58,300 cancer deaths in 1992. By 1992, prostate cancer will have overtaken lung cancer as the leading cancer among men in the four western provinces while lung cancer is expected to exceed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths among women in some provinces, notably British Columbia. In British Columbia, the relative survival rates for most cancers improved between the periods 1970 to 1974 and 1980 to 1984. However, stomach, lung and pancreatic cancers, which have low survival rates, showed little improvement. This article is based on 1992 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality, cancer trends in Canada and relative cancer survival rates in British Columbia, found in Canadian Cancer Statistics 1992. This publication was prepared at Statistics Canada through a collaborative effort involving the Canadian Cancer Society, Health and Welfare Canada and the provincial/territorial cancer registries.
