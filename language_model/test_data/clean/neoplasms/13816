Cancer is one of the most serious diseases that threaten human being today. To some degree, it is a genetic disease but environmental and other nongenetic factors clearly play a role in many stages of neoplastic process. Genetic factors by themselves are thought to explain only about 5% of all cancer. The remainder can be attributed to external, 'environment' factors that act in conjunction with both genetic and acquired susceptibility. Of note, part of the susceptibility is owing to the variety of human genome. So, environment, human genome and cancer have much to do with each other. Combining all of the information from epidemiology and from research works in laboratory with policy-making and clinical works, purifying the environment, giving special protection to the high risk population, the mortality of cancer may decrease gradually in the future.
