The tyrosine kinase c-Src is upregulated in various human cancers; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying c-Src-mediated tumor progression remain unclear. Here we show that downregulation of microRNA (miR)-542-3p is tightly associated with tumor progression via c-Src-related oncogenic pathways. In c-Src-transformed fibroblasts and human cancer cells that overexpress c-Src, miR-542-3p is substantially downregulated, and the ectopic expression of miR-542-3p suppresses tumor growth. We identified the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) as a conserved target of miR-542-3p. ILK upregulation promotes cell adhesion and invasion by activating the integrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/c-Src pathway, and can also contribute to tumor growth via the AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² pathways. MiR-542-3p expression is downregulated by the activation of c-Src-related signaling molecules, including epidermal growth factor receptor, K-Ras and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase. In human colon cancer tissues, downregulation of miR-542-3p is significantly correlated with the upregulation of c-Src and ILK. Our results suggest that the novel c-Src-miR-542-3p-ILK-FAK circuit plays a crucial role in controlling tumor progression.
