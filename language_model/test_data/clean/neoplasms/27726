1. Local and regional recurrence of disease is a major problem in cancer management. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) combines surgery with irradiation to treat any disease remaining after surgery and to decrease the local recurrence rates for certain cancers. 2. The development of an IORT treatment program is often undertaken by groups and institutions with expertise in multidisciplinary oncology, particularly surgical and radiation oncology. The program uses multiple resources, requiring cooperation and teamwork to achieve an efficient procedure with maximum patient outcome. 3. The process should be reviewed and modified each time it is performed. There is no "standard" way to use IORT, and every program will have variations that adapt to the circumstances existing in each specific facility.
