Various methods of CSF cell differentiation are discussed. These methods provide additional information regarding the origin and, therefore, the types of pathological alterations occurring in the leptomeninges. They include the application of immunological and cytochemical markers to differentiate and identify B and T lymphocytes as well as cells from the monocyte-macrophage series and precursor cells of polymorphnuclear leukocytes. Application of these methods to CSF cells and the differentiation of CSF cells from 16 patients with inflammatory or neoplastic alterations were discussed. B cell or T cell type lymphocytes predominate with multiple sclerosis, T lymphocytes with tubercular meningitis. Varying quantities of B and T lymphocytes are found with viral meningitis. In one case the tumor cells of a reticulum cell sarcoma were identified in the CSF as T cells; in one case of plasmacytoma, tumor cells in the CSF were identified as B lymphocytes. In selected cases of leukemic or carcinomatous infiltration of the meninges and of medulloblastoma, CSF cells did not react to treatment with immunological markers.
