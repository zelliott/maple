Distinctive tastes and odors have been identified as potent nausea-eliciting stimuli in cancer chemotherapy patients who develop anticipatory nausea or vomiting (ANV). Based on the experimental research on illness-aversion learning and based on previous clinical research with chemotherapy patients, it was hypothesized that the presence of tastes and odors during infusions should increase the likelihood that a patient will subsequently develop ANV. Seventy-eight new chemotherapy outpatients were interviewed immediately following each of their infusions with regard to the experience of infusion-related tastes, odors, and body sensations. Results failed to support the hypothesis. The subsequent development of ANV was unrelated to reports of tastes and odors both during patients' initial two chemotherapy infusions and during the two infusions preceding their initial report of ANV. Furthermore, reports of tastes and odors were surprisingly infrequent relative to previous research. Methodological and environmental explanations for this difference in taste and odor prevalence are considered. It is concluded that, when present, infusion-related tastes and odors may indeed increase the likelihood of subsequent development of ANV. However, future research should examine the extent to which the physical characteristics of chemotherapy clinics might affect the prevalence of infusion-related tastes and odors.
