Cancer patients are at risk for profound derangements in the hemostatic mechanism due to multiple factors. Depending upon the dominant abnormality, bleeding, thrombosis or both, in conjunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation, may occur. Critical care physicians should have a high index of suspicion for underlying hemostatitic defects when a cancer patient presents with hemorrhage. Blood replacement therapy tailored to specific abnormalities coupled with effective treatment of the underlying malignancy will render the best result. Thrombosis in malignancy is a frequent occurrence and increasing in incidence due in part to the widespread use of indwelling venous catheters. Fibrinolytic therapy is effective and probably under-utilized in treating thrombosis but must be approached with care in these patients. A thorough understanding of diagnostic techniques, indications, and potential complications of anticoagulant therapy in cancer patients is essential.
