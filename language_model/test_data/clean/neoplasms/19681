Currently, the principal chemistries for the preparation of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) target either lysines or cysteines for coupling cytotoxic drugs for delivery to target cells expressing tumor-specific antigens. All of these chemistries generate populations of molecules which differ in critical properties which are known to affect efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and the therapeutic window. Of key interest are methods to minimize this heterogeneity to achieve reproducible product profiles and efficacy. A current trend in the development of ADC is the evaluation of suitable targets, antibodies, and payloads, occurring well before process development to produce conjugates of clinical quality. This creates a need for an ability to generate comparably high-quality products early in development and at sufficient scale for evaluating in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy, as well as the early identification of any deficiencies in critical quality attributes including solubility and stability. Here we elaborate detailed protocols using maleimide-based chemistry for the conjugation to reduce hinge disulfides in antibodies by several cytotoxic drugs. We present a method for the initial characterization of the reduction/alkylation reaction using polyethylene-glycol (PEG) as a drug surrogate, a 5 mg scale drug conjugation to provide material for initial characterization including cell proliferation assays and a 150 mg scale process for performing efficacy studies in small animals. These methods yield well-defined predictable product profiles at high yield and with low impurities. These procedures include details relevant to the execution of these methods in a safe and contained manner within a typical laboratory environment.
