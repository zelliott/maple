Fourteen patients with advanced cancer received intermittent subcutaneous injection of morphine using an Edmonton Injector (EI). Twelve patients used the system at home. The minimal dose of morphine was 15 mg every 4 hr and the maximal dose was 90 mg every 4 hr. There were two complications: abscess and bleeding. In developing countries, the safety, low cost, and versatility of the Edmonton Injector offers an important alternative in terminally ill patients. This device is an ideal "injection pump" for use in developing countries, where costs are most important in making treatment decisions.
