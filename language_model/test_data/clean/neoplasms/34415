Serum concentrations of lipid-soluble (glycolipid) sialic acid were determined for 96 client-owned dogs, of which 24 were diagnosed as bearing tumors. A markedly increased concentration of lipid-soluble serum sialic acid was found in 22 of 24 tumor-bearing dogs (92%) compared with 17 of 72 dogs with other definitely false-positive, based on necropsy and follow-up work. Almost all others had acute infections or terminal congestive disorders and were potential tumor bearers. The values obtained appeared to be independent of the sex or age (or both) of the dogs. Based on the analysis of a single biochemical variable, the procedure may permit cancer detection applicable to a wide range of tumor types in dogs if evaluated in terms of the general health status of the animal.
