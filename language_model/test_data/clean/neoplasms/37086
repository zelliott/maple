A computerized nationwide autopsy database was analyzed to assess the main pathologic diagnoses and primary sites of malignancies in Japan from 1974 to 1993. The data contained more than 689,000 cases, which corresponds to about 5.0% of deaths in Japan during that time. Cases were analyzed in four 5-year periods. The distribution of the diseases and tumor primary sites for age and sex was listed. The histologic types of pulmonary and gastric malignancies and the frequencies of primary sites in brain metastases were used as examples.
