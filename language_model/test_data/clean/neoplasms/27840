We report the case of a woman with presumed cancer pain treated with escalating doses of opiates despite no evident improvement in her pain and several deleterious side effects.

A 62-year-old woman with cervical myelopathy and a diagnosis of a spinal cord tumor was referred to the University of Washington Medical Center complaining of chest tightness, multiple joint pains, nausea, constipation, seizures and a deteriorating memory. At the time of admission she was confined to her bed with a full-time attendant and was receiving 240 milligrams of intravenous morphine per hour for her pain.

Diagnostic studies failed to find any evidence of neoplasm and revealed only an old hemorrhage within the cervical spinal cord. A program of increasing physical and occupational therapy and decreasing opiate intake was initiated.

Within a month the patient's pain complaints decreased, as did the rest of her presenting complaints. Her activities of daily living greatly increased making attendant care no longer necessary.

This case report illustrates some of the hazards of opioid therapy in the management of patients with chronic pain. Our patient's opiate therapy was expensive, gave her undesirable side effects, and did not reduce her pain complaints or improve her function. In the treatment of chronic pain, of noncancerous or cancerous origin, a) systemic opioids may not be effective in reducing pain complaints in every patient, b) treatment efficacy evaluation should always include functional endpoints, and c) nonefficacious treatments should not be continued indefinitely.
