Hypoxia is a common characteristic of locally advanced solid tumors that has been associated with diminished therapeutic response and, more recently, with malignant progression, that is, an increasing probability of recurrence, locoregional spread, and distant metastasis. Emerging evidence indicates that the effect of hypoxia on malignant progression is mediated by a series of hypoxia-induced proteomic and genomic changes activating angiogenesis, anaerobic metabolism, and other processes that enable tumor cells to survive or escape their oxygen-deficient environment. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a major regulator of tumor cell adaptation to hypoxic stress. Tumor cells with proteomic and genomic changes favoring survival under hypoxic conditions will proliferate, thereby further aggravating the hypoxia. The selection and expansion of new (and more aggressive) clones, which eventually become the dominant tumor cell type, lead to the establishment of a vicious circle of hypoxia and malignant progression.
