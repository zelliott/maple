The review analyses the available evidence on the role of acid and alkaline phosphatases, ATPase as well as non-organic phosphate in the processes of precipitation of insoluble calcium salts in tissues. Participation of phospholipids in this process is noted. The identical role of the ensymatic systems in calcification in the processes of bone formation and in pathological foci including tumours is demonstrated. Exploration of the mechanisms of calcification may be a new step in attempts increasing the effectiveness of human malignant tumours therapy.
