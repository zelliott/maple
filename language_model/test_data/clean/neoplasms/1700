To identify barriers to, models of care for, and initiatives to improve health care of adult survivors of childhood cancer.

Seventeen health care policy experts were asked to respond to the three objectives through a three-iterative Delphi process.

Key barriers identified were that primary care physicians are unfamiliar with the health problems of survivors and survivors are often unaware of their risks. The recommended model of care would incorporate the chronic disease management model. Highest priority initiatives recommended were targeted education of primary care physicians and survivors, development and evaluation of standards of survivorship care, and a national web-based information center.

The insights and recommendations of the panel provide a foundation intended to improve health care of cancer survivors.
