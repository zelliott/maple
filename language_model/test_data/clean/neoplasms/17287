DNA mutation is a very important step in carcinogenesis and elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage have been monitored in a variety of tumors. The discovery of the role of free radicals in cancer has led to a new medical approach. Minimizing oxidative damage may be a significant advance in the prevention or treatment of these diseases, since antioxidants are able to stop the free-radical formation and prevent oxidizing chain reactions. These findings have generated great interest in therapeutic antioxidant-based cancer drug development. The design and development of synthetic compounds, able to scavenge free radicals, could present a significant therapeutic advance, in particular for treating pathological conditions such as cancer. This article will outline the state of the research on the relationship between antioxidant therapy and cancer, describing the new synthetic antioxidant molecules that have anticancer activities. Investigations and association between dietary antioxidants, oxidative stress, and cancer will be also discussed.
