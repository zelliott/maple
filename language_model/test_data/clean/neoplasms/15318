Ifosfamide/mesna was given to 97 patients who had malignant solid tumors diagnosed before they were 21 years of age. Patients received 1.6 g/m2 ifosfamide daily x 5, given i.v. over 15 min, followed by 400 mg/m2 i.v. mesna at 15 min and 4 and 6 h after ifosfamide. Responses were noted in patients with osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and other soft-tissue sarcomas, rhabdoid tumor, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, retinoblastoma, germ-cell tumors, and B-cell lymphoma. Toxicity included mild to moderate nausea and vomiting, transient, reversible myelosuppression, transient elevations of serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine and liver enzymes, infections, and self-limiting neurotoxicity characterized by changes in mental status, motor dysfunction, cranial nerve palsy, cerebellar dysfunction, and seizures. Neurotoxic symptoms were generally seen in patients who had previously received cisplatin. Ifosfamide is an important alkylating agent that should be combined with other agents in phase II and III trials. Alternate dose schedules should also be investigated.
