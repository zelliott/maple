CD133 is a member of a novel family of cell surface glycoproteins. Initially, the expression of CD133 antigen was seen only in the hematopoietic derived CD34(+) stem cells. At present, CD133 expression is demonstrated in undifferentiated epithelium, different types of tumors and myogenic cells. CD133(+) neurosphere cells isolated from brain are able to differentiate into both neurons and glial cells. These data suggested that CD133 could be a specific marker for various stem and progenitor cell populations.

The main goal would be to describe the role for CD133 as a marker of stem cells able to engraft and differentiate, to form functional non-hematopoietic adult lineages and contribute to disease amelioration via tissue regeneration.

In conclusion, since the rise of CD133 antigen as a suitable stem cell marker, the possible use of CD133(+) stem cells in therapeutic applications has opened a new promising field in the treatment of degenerating diseases. The human circulating cells expressing the CD133 antigen behave as a stem cell population capable of commitment to hematopoietic, endothelial and myogenic lineages. CD133 cell therapy may represent a promising treatment for many diseases.
