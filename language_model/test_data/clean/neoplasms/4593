Construction is one of the most dangerous industries in the world. However, there has been little literature on occupational epidemiology in this field. A study of the mortality experience over a 13-year period among construction workers in the UK was carried out.

This was based on 15,007 death certificates of members of the Building and Civil Engineering Holiday and Benefit Scheme, who had died during 1975 to 1987 aged 20-64 years. Proportional mortality ratio (PMR) and mortality odds ratio techniques were used.

Significantly elevated PMR were found for deaths from all cancers, including cancer of the lung and stomach, and for accidental deaths. Associations were demonstrated between several job categories and an increased risk of cancer mortality. Occupational exposures to hazardous substances may have contributed to the elevated cancer mortality, although the study findings should be interpreted with caution. Inadequate supervision of safety procedures, together with a high proportion of young and inexperienced workers, may be associated with the high number of accidental deaths.

The results support the hypothesis that working in the construction industry is associated with a high risk for accidental death and probably also for malignant diseases including lung, mesothelium and stomach cancers. Further epidemiological studies among construction workers are needed to support policies aimed at improving occupational health, including the prevention of accidents.
