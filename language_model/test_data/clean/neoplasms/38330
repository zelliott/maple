In 1999, Singapore created a comprehensive cancer centre because of the rising occurrence of cancer in the country. Although Singapore is different from many developing countries because of its small geographical size and its well-endowed economy, it has issues that are common to any country or community wanting to start such centres. We present our experience of developing a comprehensive cancer centre. We located the cancer centre strategically adjacent to Singapore's largest hospital. Clinics were designed to provide multidisciplinary care, and site-specific radiation, medical, and surgical oncologists could consult with patients on the same day and at the multidisciplinary outpatient clinics. We developed a large research team and ensured that tumour specimens were carefully obtained and annotated in our tissue repository. Furthermore, we are building up a robust cancer informatics system as well as a pipeline of specialists with local training and overseas stints at other top cancer centres.
