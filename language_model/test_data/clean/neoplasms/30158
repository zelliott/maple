Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising death ligand who has received significant attention due to its specific anti-cancer activity. Recently, a number of clinical trials involving either recombinant soluble TRAIL or agonistic death receptor (DR) antibodies have even been initiated. One major caveat in TRAIL-based anti-cancer therapies is that a considerable number of cancer cells are notorious resistant to apoptosis induction by TRAIL. Overcoming this primary or secondary evolved resistance is an utmost important goal of present cancer research. The current literature suggests that TRAIL resistance is mediated by a number of endogenous factors.

According to recent research, stress-related transcription factors have acquired a pivotal role in the sensitization of highly resistant cancer cells, for example, pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma cells, to TRAIL-mediated cell death. Out of this transcription factor family, C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) is linked to the control of DR-mediated apoptosis by modulation of several apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors. Stress responses in certain organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, are potent inductors of CHOP expression. This report focuses on the influence of stress responses on endogenous or acquired resistance to extrinsic apoptosis in tumor cells and summarizes recent findings and results. The Medline and ClinicalTrials database with key words were used for this review.

A potential novel treatment strategy for highly treatment-resistant tumors is the induction of a cellular stress response in cancer cells. The induction of an organelle-related stress response, such as nuclear, ER and mitochondrial stress, leads to a dramatic sensitization of a broad variety of cancer cells of different tumor entities to the apoptotic ligand, TRAIL. Importantly, non-neoplastic cells are not sensitized to TRAIL-mediated cell death through the unfolded protein response in most instances, suggesting that this treatment is not only of high efficacy, but even more less of unwanted toxicity in patients.
