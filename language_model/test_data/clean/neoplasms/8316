In the intravenous administration of cytostatic drugs, top priority is given to preventive measures, and to immediate countermeasures in the event of an accidental paravenous injection. In contrast to earlier recommendations, the use of antidotes has been minimized. Only those with proven efficacy and no tissue toxic potential are to be used. The intradermal application of sodium bicarbonate and sodium thiosulfate, and the subcutaneous administration of glucocorticoids are no longer applicable. As a specific antidote in the case of anthracycline, topical dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is used, and for perivascular injection of vinca alkaloid, subcutaneous hyaluronidase is administered.
