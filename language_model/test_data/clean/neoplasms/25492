Chemiluminescence, indomethacin-sensitive suppression, and adherent cell cytotoxicity were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from normal subjects and solid tumor cancer patients. These functions were found to be differentially affected by malignant disease. In cancer patients with disseminated disease, indomethacin-sensitive suppression and chemiluminescence emission were increased to a level significantly higher than normal without a concurrent increase in adherent cell cytotoxic function. In cancer patients with at most minimum residual diseases, the levels of chemiluminescence, indomethacin-sensitive suppression, and adherent cell cytotoxicity found were comparable to those of the normal study population. In vitro stimulation of cells from patients with disseminated disease by phorbol myristic acetate (PMA) increased chemiluminescence overcame the suppressive effects of indomethacin-sensitive suppressor cells, and increased adherent cell cytotoxicity; in cells from patients with at most minimum residual disease, PMA increased chemiluminescence and cytotoxicity without influencing the activity of indomethacin-sensitive suppressor cells. Vaccination of lung cancer patients with Freund's complete adjuvant or Freund's complete adjuvant plus tumor antigen extracts led to increased levels of chemiluminescence and increased levels of adherent cell cytotoxicity without altering indomethacin-sensitive regulatory cell function.
