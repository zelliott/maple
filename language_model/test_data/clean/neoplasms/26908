Osteoporosis is a major and increasingly serious public health problem not only in postmenopausal women and people over 70 years old (primary osteoporosis) but also in men under 70 years and premenopausal women (secondary osteoporosis). The most common primary osteoporosis occurs as a result of menopause and aging process. Secondary osteoporosis is a consequence of an underlying cause and frequently is diagnosed after an atraumatic fracture. The pathogenesis of secondary osteoporosis is almost always multifactorial. Certain endocrinopathies, systemic diseases, malignant neoplasias, organ dysfunctions, a variety of medications such as corticosteroids, lifestyle conditions and habits, and also major depression can lead to the secondary osteoporosis. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent further bone loss and fractures.
