The primary cause of bleeding in patients with cancer is thrombocytopenia and it commonly is attributed to myelosuppressive chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or bone marrow infiltration of the malignancy. Oncology nurses have a critical role to play in the prevention and management of bleeding in patients with cancer. As part of an Oncology Nursing Society Putting Evidence Into Practice (PEP) project team, the authors of this article reviewed the current literature to identify effective interventions in the prevention and management of bleeding in patients with cancer. The authors evaluated research studies conducted since 1991, current clinical practice guidelines, and systematic reviews. The literature was reviewed, synthesized, and developed into evidence tables that were ultimately published in a PEP card. All data were reviewed by experts in the field of thrombocytopenia. The Prevention of Bleeding PEP card was unveiled at the 8th Annual Institutes of Learning in November 2007.
