Massive doses of hydroxyurea (Hydrea) were given to 35 patients suffering from different cancers. Protection to the hematopoietic system was obtained by autogenous marrow transfusions. The clinical response obtained was not considered superior to the results obtained by administering the drug orally over a prolonged period. The described technique is safe and relatively atraumatic, and it may be advisable to administer a large priming dose by this technique to be followed by smaller maintenance doses of a given anticancer chemotherapeutic agent.
