Parents of 191 children who were treated for cancer over a seven-year period completed and returned a questionnaire concerning marital status. Contrary to the prediction of a high divorce rate among these families, the study found a person-year divorce rate of 1.19%. This is slightly lower than the 2.03% person-year divorce rate among married couples with children in the states of Kansas and Missouri. The Arnold sign indicator analysis of the Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory was used to measure marital stress in 38 intact couples whose children were treated for cancer. The study sample experienced more stress than a comparison group of 23 couples who had hemophilic children. Both of these populations had more stress than a normal standardization group but less than a standardization group of marriage counselees.
