Although apparently infrequent, a variety of agents other than thrombotic material are known to cause cerebral embolization, often with serious consequences. The emboli may originate in different parts of the body or may be introduced from outside under diverse circumstances. The pathologic aspects of these individual embolic phenomena are described with particular emphasis on their recognition at autopsy. Adequate autopsy study appears to be the most important source of information for further elucidation of the incidence, mechanism, and sequelae of these heterogeneous embolic lesions of the brain. Such information is essential for clinical evaluation, management, and, more importantly, prevention of some of these potentially serious embolic phenomena.
