Robert Kerbel is one of the most influential scientists in the field of cancer-related angiogenesis and anti-angiogenic therapies. Along with the late Judah Folkman, Dr. Kerbel has also pioneered the use of continuous low dose chemotherapy for cancer treatment, an approach which is now widely used for many types of cancer and is a promising backbone to be associated with novel targeted therapies. In this interview, Dr. Kerbel describes the steps that moved his career towards the angiogenesis field, the already achieved biological and clinical results and the unmet goals.
