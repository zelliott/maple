Deficiencies in the ability of cells to sense and repair damage in individuals with rare genetic instability syndromes increase the risk of developing cancer. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), such a condition, is associated with a high incidence of leukemia and lymphoma that develop in childhood. Although A-T is an autosomal recessive disorder, some penetrance appears in individuals with one mutated ATM gene (A-T carriers), namely, an increased risk of developing breast cancer. The gene mutated in A-T, designated ATM, is homologous to several DNA damage recognition and cell cycle checkpoint control genes from other organisms. Recent studies suggest that ATM is activated primarily in response to double-strand breaks, the major cytotoxic lesion caused by ionizing radiation, and can directly bind to and phosphorylate c-Abl, p53, and replication protein A (RPA). Analysis of ATM mutations in patients with A-T or with sporadic non-A-T cancers has suggested the existence of two classes of ATM mutation: null mutations leading to A-T and dominant negative missense mutations predisposing to cancer in the heterozygous state. Studies with A-T mouse models have helped determine the basis of lymphoid tumorigenesis in A-T and have shown that ATM plays a critical role in maintaining genetic stability by ensuring high-fidelity execution of chromosomal events. Thus, ATM appears to act as a caretaker of the genome.
