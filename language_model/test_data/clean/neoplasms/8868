Newer methods and advances in radiation therapy promise to reduce the risk of complications in children who require irradiation. They have secured the role of radiation therapy in the treatment of a variety of pediatric central nervous system and solid tumors and for young patients enrolled on clinical trials.

Proton therapy is the latest advancement in radiation therapy. Its availability is increasing as new centers are built throughout the United States. Pediatric specialists should understand that proton therapy is in its pioneering stage of development and that advantages have not been quantitatively demonstrated. Proton therapy clearly reduces collateral radiation dose to normal tissue when compared with photon (X-ray)-based methods of irradiation and has the potential to selectively and safely escalate dose to high-risk tumors; however, research results are lacking in both of these areas, leading to some confusion among pediatric specialists with regard to indications and the need to refer patients for this limited resource and expensive form of radiation therapy.

This review highlights a number of issues surrounding proton therapy in children and supports the use of proton therapy in clinical trials.
