The success achieved to minimise the radiation exposure to staff to levels much below the prescribed dose limits encourages a similar approach in patient protection where dose limits do not exist but where reference levels are provided. A number of radiation injuries among patients have been reported, per capita dose is increasing and medical exposure has become the largest contributor to population dose. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has supported a number of research projects, produced a wide range of guidance publications, conducted over 60 training courses in the past 5 y, produced for free dissemination training CDs on radiation protection and established a dedicated Web site on the radiological protection of patients (http://rpop.iaea.org). The number of countries that is currently receiving assistance in this field exceeds 80, as compared to about half a dozen 5 y ago. Significant results on patient dose management, demonstrating dose reduction of more than 30% while maintaining image quality, have been made available through IAEA projects.
