This final rule adds coverage of National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored Phase I studies for certain beneficiaries. The NCI sponsored clinical treatment trials are conducted in a series of steps called phases. Phase I trials are the first studies conducted in people. They evaluate how a new drug should be given (by mouth, injected into the blood, or injected into the muscle), how often, and what dose is safe.
