Ribonucleases (RNases) are a group of enzymes that cleave RNAs at phosphodiester bonds resulting in remarkably diverse biological consequences. This review focuses on mammalian RNases that are capable of, or potentially capable of, cleaving messenger RNA (mRNA) as well as other RNAs in cells and play roles in the development of human cancers. The aims of this review are to provide an overview of the roles of currently known mammalian RNases, and the evidence that associate them as regulators of tumor development. The roles of these RNases as oncoproteins and/or tumor suppressors in influencing cell growth, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and other cellular hallmarks of cancer will be presented and discussed. The RNases under discussion include RNases from the conventional mRNA decay pathways, RNases that are activated under cellular stress, RNases from the miRNA pathway, and RNases with multifunctional activity.
