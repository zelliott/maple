A predictive model of health-related quality of life in young adult survivors of childhood cancerThis study aimed to examine factors that affect survivors' health-related quality of life (HRQoL), using a theoretical model in which demographic and medical characteristics explain HRQoL mediated by course of life, coping and social support. In a cross-sectional design, 353 survivors aged 18-30 years completed questionnaires. Structural equation modelling was performed to investigate the relationships among the variables in the model and to test whether the model fitted the data. The model fitted the data closely: chi(2)(14) = 21.61, P = 0.087; root mean square error of approximation = 0.039, 90% confidence interval [0.00; 0.070]. The effect of medical and demographic characteristics on HRQoL was mediated by coping. Survivors having been treated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy were most at risk for worse HRQoL because they suffer more from current health complaints and were less inclined to predictive and active coping. Screening survivors medically as well as psychosocially could help to identify patients with the greatest needs and direct interventions by which the follow-up care could be improved.
