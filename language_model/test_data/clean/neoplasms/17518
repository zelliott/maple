A clinically proven experimentally based method of administering intensive combination chemotherapy, which is much safer than methods used in the past, has been developed over the past 13 years. Clinical studies of several different tumour types over several thousand treatment cycles have confirmed the validity of this approach. The implications of this new method of administering chemotherapy to patients with advanced disease are discussed and its potential for improving the 'cure' rates for certain common 'solid' tumours such as breast, small-cell lung, bladder, prostate and ovarian carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck is outlined.
