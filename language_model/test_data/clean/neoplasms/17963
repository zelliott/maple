Over the past decade, the investigation of human genetics and disease has pursued both common and uncommon germ-line variation and shown that both can be associated with altered risk for cancer and its outcomes. This line of investigation has not only begun to generate markers for disease but also insights into the biological pathways that are altered in cancer. Already, there is emerging evidence that germ-line genetic variation can alter susceptibility to different types of cancers, including pediatric cancers. It is evident that common genetic variation has emerged as a key component of a comprehensive understanding of pediatric cancer and its outcome. Future studies should unravel the complex interaction between genes and the environment.
