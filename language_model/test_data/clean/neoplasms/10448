Optimal care for elderly cancer patients requires empathy and alertness about impaired autonomy and an exceptional quality of care. Specific to geriatric oncology is the particular need of attention and care for the patients. Most important from a conceptual point of view is to identify that this will result in additional demands. To care for these patients will require more time as any intervention must be adapted to age specific capabilities. The difficult task of shared decision-making should be preferably based on the quality of life assessment of the individual patient and their needs. The process of assessing quality of life is in itself already an act of enhancing autonomy, because it respects the individual's subjectivity. Many ethical questions arise between the contradictory contexts of paternalism and autonomy. There are conditions to be met and limits of autonomy to be considered, which differ for the elderly patients because of their vulnerability and particular dependencies. As the elderly patient is closer to death and dying, questions of care in these situations are frequently more pressing. It is important to distinguish actively intended euthanasia from the goals and concerns of modern palliative care in order to enable dying with dignity.
