This study demonstrates that short term incubation of blood mononuclear cells (MC) in heterologous sera enhances their natural killer (NK) but not their antibody dependent killer (K) activity, and confirms that NK stimulation is not related to blastogenesis. MC were obtained from healthy donors and incubated with RPMI 1640 supplemented with various serum sources. NK and K activity of incubated vs. fresh MC against SK-N-SH, Chang or Raji cell line targets were compared in a 4-hr 51Cr release assay. A significant (p less 0.01) increase in NK cytotoxicity was detected when MC were incubated with fetal calf serum (FCS) or human AB serum (ABS) at 37 degrees C. When a more sensitive NK target cell (K-562) was used only the cells incubated in FCS demonstrated increased NK cytotoxicity. Augmentation of NK cell activity by FCS was not related to blastogenesis, mitosis, natural antibodies against lymphocytes or target cells, immunoglobulin complexes or alterations in MC OKT4 and OKT8 subpopulations. In contrast to NK activity, K cytotoxicity was not increased after incubation at 37 degrees C in FCS or ABS, and it was depressed in IPT (p less than 0.05). Thus FCS is capable of stimulating NK cell activity against human tumor cell lines in less in less than 24 hr.
