With the objective of clarifying points that needed improvement to provide earlier and better treatment of pain by assessing the current state of cancer pain management in Japan, we conducted a questionnaire survey about pain management in patients with advanced/recurrent cancer who were suffering from pain. The results of the survey revealed that it is important for primary physician to place greater emphasis on pain management when treating cancer patients, to inform patients that the doctor should always be told if the patient has pain, and provide appropriate information about medical narcotics to their patients. The team approach to management of cancer has been increasing in importance recently. This survey suggested it is important for primary physicians, who play a central role in such teams, to listen to their patients' complaints about symptoms including pain. Furthermore, it should be remembered that patients are eager to establish a good, trusting relationship with their primary physician.
