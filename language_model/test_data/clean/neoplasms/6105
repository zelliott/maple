In French hospitals, patients are increasingly asked to participate in research, particularly in oncology where the development of research is stimulated at a national level (plan Cancer). This article express our thoughts based on the literature about the perception by cancer patients of research activities developed in the care centre where they are treated. We focus mainly on the consent for biobanking in a context in which cancer patients are routinely requested to donate tumour samples for research. This article presents the results of a survey among patients treated in a comprehensive cancer centre. The available literature shows that patients have an overall positive image of medical research and of the existence of research activities intertwined with medical care. Patients are globally expressing a wish for more proposals to participate in research in collaboration with scientific teams.
