The chronomodulated delivery of systemic chemotherapy given with irradiation (chemoradiation) is driven by an understanding of: the chronobiology of normal tissue response to cytotoxic insult, chronopharmacology, and by technologic advances in vascular access and in the availability of portable programmable pumps. Since circadian variation exists in the proliferative activity of acute-reacting normal tissues like the gut and bone marrow, a potential therapeutic gain can be realized by the chronomodulated administration of S-phase chemotherapeutic agents at biological times when these normal tissues are in a different cell phase and thus relatively spared (chronotolerance). The reasons for this are complex and possibly include newly described time-keeping genes that may influence the cell cycle. Another important aspect of chronotolerance is based on chronopharmacologic behavior of S-phase chemotherapeutic radiation sensitizing agents, especially 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In this review laboratory and clinical evidence is presented for using chronomodulated 5-FU or the topoisomerase-I inhibitor, camptothecin, when best tolerated biologically. Although the main body of this work has been accomplished with pure chemotherapy schedules, there is emerging clinical evidence this approach to treatment also applies to the application of chemoradiation. This knowledge has been exploited only recently in the clinic. These data should be viewed as a call for additional studies to investigate the precise timing of systemic chemotherapeutic radio sensitizers to ameliorate toxicity and maximize treatment effect, especially with newer and potentially more toxic chemoradiation programs.
