We evaluated 91 episodes of fever in 46 profoundly neutropenic children with cancer, in a search for any symptom, sign or laboratory test that would serve to identify patients with septicemia and differentiate them from those in no immediate need of prompt antimicrobial therapy. Seventeen episodes (19%) were bacteremias, 59 (64%) were suspected septic infections, 9 (10%) were focal bacterial infections and 6 (7%) proved not to be bacterial infections. We were unable to detect any parameter, either on admission or after two days of antimicrobial therapy (except for blood culture findings), that would be helpful in differentiating bacteremia from an episode not of bacterial origin. We focused on serum levels of C reactive protein and found them unreliable on an individual level. Prompt institution of antimicrobial therapy at the occurrence of fever results in low mortality, but does not allow assignment of cases to different categories.
