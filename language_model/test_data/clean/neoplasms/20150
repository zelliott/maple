Since purebred dog populations represent closed gene pools, a relatively high level of consanguinity between individuals, and hence of inbreeding, is common. This case control study was conducted to establish the possible connection between the actual level of homozygosity due to inbreeding and specific diseases (flea allergy, osteochondrosis, laryngeal paralysis, neoplasm, autoimmune disease, hypoplastic trachea, and food allergy) occurring in the Bouvier Belge des Flandres breed. One hundred and sixty-eight animals referred to the Utrecht University Clinic formed the patient group. Each of the seven diseases was chosen because of the demonstrability of the diagnosis. Each animal was chosen because one of the selected diseases was established in that individual, and because its pedigree was complete. All dogs of the patient group were born between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 1985. A control group (n = 123) was randomly chosen from the total population of registered Bouviers born in the Netherlands in the same period. pedigree data were obtained from the Dutch Kennel Club. The extent of inbreeding was determined for all animals using Wright's inbreeding coefficient. The distribution of inbreeding coefficients in each patient group was compared with the distribution in controls. Inbreeding coefficients in the control group ranged from 0.0 to 0.406. Animals in which osteochondrosis, food allergy, autoimmune disease, neoplasm, or hypoplastic trachea was diagnosed had higher inbreeding coefficients than controls. It was concluded that in the Bouvier Belge des Flandres dog population examined, the level of homozygosity was positively correlated with occurrence of these diseases.
