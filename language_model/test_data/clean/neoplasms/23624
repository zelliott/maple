Pain management has emerged as a mature medical discipline over the past few decades. Neurological surgery has provided, and will continue to provide, strong leadership in the field. More emphasis should be placed on multidisciplinary pain medicine in our training programs and continuing education environment. Our patients with acute, chronic, and cancer pain will be the beneficiaries of our pursuit of excellence in this important subspecialty of neurological surgery.
