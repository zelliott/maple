Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a clinico-pathological syndrome of variable expression, resulting from uncontrolled simultaneous activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. DIC can be initiated in a variety of different ways. Additional studies are needed to determine the importance of vascular endothelial damage, hemodynamic alterations and the role of naturally occurring inhibitors of hemostasis. Progressive increase in our understanding of the mechanisms involved in triggering DIC will improve our therapeutic measures in the rational management of these patients. Absolutely essential in the successful management of patients with DIC is identification and control of the underlying illness.
