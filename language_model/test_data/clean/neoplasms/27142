The S100 protein family is involved in epithelial cell maturation and inflammation. Some S100 members are dysregulated during carcinogenesis and have been established as tumor markers. Psoriasin (S100A7) and koebnerisin (S100A15) are highly homologous proteins that have been first described in psoriasis, which is characterized by disturbed epidermal maturation and chronic inflammation. Despite their homology, both S100 proteins are distinct in expression and function through different receptors but synergize as chemoattractants and pro-inflammatory 'alarmins' to promote inflammation. Psoriasin and koebnerisin are further regulated with tumor progression in epithelial cancers. In tumor cells, high cytoplasmic expression of psoriasin and koebnerisin may prevent oncogenic activity, whereas their nuclear translocation and extracellular secretion are associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. The present review outlines these opposing effects of psoriasin and koebnerisin in multifunctional pathways and mechanisms that are known to affect tumor cells ('seeds'), tumor environment ('soil') and tumor cell metastasis ('seeding') thereby influencing epithelial carcinogenesis.
