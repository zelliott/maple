Despite all advances in healthcare, provision of healthcare for cancer patients remains one of major continuing challenges for healthcare professionals. One of these challenges is shorter hospital stay. In this fast-paced environment, identification of cancer patients' needs is limited yet necessary to initiate an appropriate treatment plan for this group of patients. The major purpose of this study was to identify healthcare needs of noninstitutionalized patients with cancer from Arab Jordanians' perspective. The study was conducted at a chemotherapy clinic of a major university hospital in Jordan. An exploratory descriptive design using a structured interview was used to collect the data. The questions of the interview composed of items of several scales including the Patient Need Scale. Sixty-two participants met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate. The participants were patients with cancer, were receiving chemotherapy, and were (a) Jordanian male or female patients, (b) able to communicate in Arabic, (c) 19 years of age or older, and (d) free from psychiatric or mental illnesses. Participants reported 70 existing needs (68.6%). However, 50% of these identified needs were perceived as being not met. Jordanian patients with cancer reported more healthcare needs than patients in Western cultures. Individualized comprehensive assessment of patients' needs from their perspective is essential to initiate an effective treatment plan.
