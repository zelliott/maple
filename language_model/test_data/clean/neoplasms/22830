Describe the self-reported sleep quality and sleep hygiene behaviors of adolescents before diagnosis and during chemotherapy (CTX), compare their sleep quality and sleep hygiene behaviors with published normative data for healthy adolescents and adolescents with chronic pain, and explore factors that predict sleep quality.

Subjects were 51 adolescents (10 to 19 years) receiving CTX for cancer. A questionnaire was used to assess sleep patterns prior to the adolescent's cancer diagnosis, and a 7-day sleep diary was used to assess subjective sleep-wake activity during CTX. Sleep quality was assessed using the Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale, and sleep-facilitating and sleep-inhibiting behaviors using the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale.

Adolescents receiving CTX reported significantly worse sleep quality and sleep hygiene behaviors than healthy adolescents, and better sleep quality but similar sleep hygiene behaviors to adolescents with chronic pain. Significant interactions were found between bedtimes and wake-times on weekdays and weekends before diagnosis and during CTX. Sleep hygiene and demographic variables accounted for 24% of the variance in sleep quality. The cognitive and emotional subscales of the sleep hygiene scale and demographic variables accounted for 36% of the variance in sleep quality.

Both the weekday and weekend sleep-wake patterns of adolescents receiving CTX resembled their weekend sleep patterns prior to diagnosis.
