To compare the pharmacokinetics of continuous venous infusion (CVI) fluorouracil (5-FU) with that of oral eniluracil/5-FU and to describe toxicities and clinical activity of prolonged oral administration of eniluracil/5-FU.

A randomized, open-label, cross-over study compared CVI 5-FU to an oral 5-FU/eniluracil combination. Seventeen patients (arm A) were randomly assigned to receive eniluracil/5-FU combination tablets (10:1 mg/m(2) BID for 7 days) during the first study period, followed by 5-FU (300 mg/m(2) CVI for 7 days) during period 2, with a 14-day washout between periods. Sixteen patients (arm B) received treatment in the opposite sequence. In period 3, all patients received eniluracil/5-FU tablets BID for 28 days. Plasma levels of 5-FU during CVI and oral administration were analyzed in periods 1 and 2. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity was determined by measuring plasma uracil, urinary alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine, and peripheral-blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DPD activity.

There were no grade 3 or 4 toxicities in either arm. Partial responses were observed in three patients. Another three patients had stable disease for &gt; or = 3 months. Eniluracil and 5-FU pharmacokinetics were similar to those observed in previous studies and were unaffected by administration sequence. The mean +/- SD steady-state plasma concentration (C(P)) and area under the curve (AUC)(144-168h) for CVI 5-FU (104 +/- 45 ng/mL and 2,350 +/- 826 ng x h/mL, respectively) were three-fold greater than those for oral 5-FU (38.1 +/- 7.7 ng/mL and 722 +/- 182 ng x h/mL, respectively [P &lt;.00001]). Individual 5-FU concentrations during CVI were highly variable, whereas those after eniluracil/5-FU were very reproducible. DPD activity in PBMCs before each study period was normal.

Both CVI 5-FU and oral eniluracil/5-FU were well tolerated, with moderate activity in these heavily pretreated patients. However, 5-FU steady-state C(P) and AUCs achieved with oral eniluracil/5-FU were significantly less than with CVI 5-FU.
