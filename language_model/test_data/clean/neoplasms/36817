A retrospective evaluation of 215 consecutive recipients of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) was conducted to ascertain the incidence, temporal course, and outcome of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. Herpes zoster was identified in 40 individuals at a median of 69 days following ASCR. Six of these cases occurred at a median of 33 days prior to ASCR but following the initiation of high doses of stem cell mobilization chemotherapy. Twenty-five percent of patients demonstrated cutaneous or systemic dissemination and 32.5% required medical intervention for post-herpetic neuralgia. All except two individuals received antiviral chemotherapy. One patient with active VZV infection died of multiorgan failure 39 days after ASCR. Multivariate analysis of risk factors disclosed the significance of prophylactic acyclovir use in Herpes simplex virus seropositive individuals in reducing the risk of VZV infection. Moreover, the use of busulfan, thiotepa and carboplatin as the conditioning chemotherapy regimen was associated with an increased risk of subsequent VZV infection. The incidence of VZV reactivation after HDC and ASCR is similar to that observed following bone marrow transplantation but has an earlier onset. This may be related to an earlier induction of immunosuppression by stem cell mobilization chemotherapy administered prior to ASCR. We demonstrated a marked reduction in the proliferative and synthetic capacities of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained prior to and following stem cell mobilizing chemotherapy. Moreover, greater than 80% of VZV infections occurred within 6 months following ASCR and late cases were seldom observed compared to allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplantation. The role of antiviral chemoprophylaxis during the period of maximum immunocompromise needs to be studied further in the HDC-ASCR setting.
