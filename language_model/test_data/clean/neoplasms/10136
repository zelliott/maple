BLyS and APRIL are tumor necrosis factor superfamily members shown to be important for B-cell development, maturation and survival. Recent data also indicate that these cytokines regulate the survival and maintenance of malignant B-cells in cancer patients. The key role of BlyS/APRIL in the immune system and their potential role in cancers have attracted the attention of basic scientistis and biotechnology companies alike. As a result, the pathways regulated by BLYS and APRIL have been quickly elevated as attractive targets for antibody-based and non-antibody based therapeutics. Exploitation of these pathways has not only given us enormous insights into the basic biology of the APRIL/BLyS system but it has also identified potential clinical candidates for cancer and autoimmunity. As such, multiple biotechnology companies are currently testing various therapeutic candidates in the clinic. This chapter will review BLyS and APRIL functions and discuss alternative therapeutic approaches to target BLyS and APRIL pathways for human malignancies and autoimmunity.
