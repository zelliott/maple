An avidin-biotin-peroxidase labelling method was applied to frozen sections and to routine-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, and compared with immunohistochemical results of stromal antigen detection (type IV collagen, laminin and fibronectin) obtained in parallel on different neoplasias. Lung, breast and gastrointestinal tract tumors were studied. Superimposable sections were obtained from cryostat and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens (previously digested by pepsin). The data demonstrate the potential use of immunohistochemical investigation of paraffin-embedded tissues for histological analyses of tumors.
