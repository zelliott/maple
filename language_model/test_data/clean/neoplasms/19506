A prospective survey of five palliative care units in the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region of France over a six-month period identified 13 requests for euthanasia (from the patient, family or both). The frequency of the request was low at 2.1% (of 611 patients). We have sought to establish the reasons for this request from the patient or family and the follow up of this request over time.
