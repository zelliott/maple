Evaluation of equine bone marrow and lymph node samples can provide the definitive diagnosis in some cases, and may provide useful information in other cases. Some newer techniques, including immunophenotyping of cells and clonality assays, provide the capability to more precisely identify cells, both as to origin and malignancy. Use of these techniques on equine bone marrow and lymph node samples, and compiling of the data, will eventually provide invaluable information about equine neoplasia that will greatly improve the ability to predict tumor behavior and response to therapy.
