Accepted physical therapy assessment techniques were compared with the Karnofsky Performance Status scores in a group of patients with advanced cancer. Assessment of patients' physical functioning by physical therapy evaluation techniques was highly correlated with the Karnofsky Performance Status score. The KPS has been demonstrated to be a reliable assessment tool and is a good indicator of those patients most likely to maintain independent physical function. Extensive physical therapy measures in this patient population appear to offer no advantage over the KPS as an evaluation tool for studies.
