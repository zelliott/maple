Increase local control rate is the main objective of 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) through sparing surrounding tissues and more precise target volume irradiation. Limits are however present for each step of the procedure (immobilisation device, anatomical data acquisition, dose calculation and optimisation, treatment verification and execution). Dose distribution is clearly better with 3DCRT and allows dose escalation. However, clinical data comparing irradiation techniques are rare and do not allow to consider yet 3DCRT as a standard treatment. Medical and medico-economical studies are warranted both for 3DCRT and IMRT in order to prove their utility and justify their cost.
