Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a method that allows the investigation of the molecular content of tissues within its morphological context. Since it is able to measure the distribution of hundreds of analytes at once, while being label free, this method has great potential which has been increasingly recognized in the field of tissue-based research. In the last few years, MALDI-IMS has been successfully used for the molecular assessment of tissue samples mainly in biomedical research and also in other scientific fields. The present article will give an update on the application of MALDI-IMS in clinical and preclinical research. It will also give an overview of the multitude of technical advancements of this method in recent years. This includes developments in instrumentation, sample preparation, computational data analysis and protein identification. It will also highlight a number of emerging fields for application of MALDI-IMS like drug imaging where MALDI-IMS is used for studying the spatial distribution of drugs in tissues.
