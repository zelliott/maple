The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the long-term, controlled, zero-order release of low- and high-molecular weight chemotherapeutics through nanochannel membranes by exploiting the molecule-to-surface interactions presented by nanoconfinement.

Silicon membranes were produced with nanochannels of 5, 13 and 20 nm using standardized industrial microfabrication techniques. The study of the diffusion kinetics of interferon α-2b and leuprolide was performed by employing UV diffusion chambers. The released amount in the sink reservoir was monitored by UV absorbance.

Continuous zero-order release was demonstrated for interferon α-2b and leuprolide at release rates of 20 and 100 μg/day, respectively. The release rates exhibited by these membranes were verified to be in ranges suitable for human therapeutic applications.

Our membranes potentially represent a viable nanotechnological approach for the controlled administration of chemotherapeutics intended to improve the therapeutic efficacy of treatment and reduce many of the side effects associated with conventional drug administration.
