Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis (BON) is a complication that almost exclusively affects the jaw bones. The clinical presentation of BON often mimics that of other conditions, such as routine dental disease, osteoradionecrosis or avascular necrosis; therefore, diagnosis can be difficult. As this complication has only been recognized within the past 10 years, management strategies for patients with BON are poorly defined. Physicians must choose between continuing the bisphosphonate therapy (to reduce the risk of skeletal complications in patients with metastatic bone disease or osteoporosis) and discontinuing the drug (to possibly improve the odds for tissue healing). A conservative or aggressive management strategy must be chosen with limited evidence that the outcome of either strategy will be successful. BON is most prevalent in patients with cancer using intravenous nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. The pathobiology of this complication is not fully understood and the diagnosis relies on the clinical manifestations of the condition. Future research should focus on the pathobiological mechanisms involved in the development of BON, which could help explain why this complication affects only a small number of those who use bisphosphonates, and also suggest strategies for prevention and management.
