In this study a description of the consumption of fatty acids in Belgium is given. The results indicate significant differences in the consumption of fatty acids according to region. Furthermore, several sex-, age- and district-specific cancer mortality rates are correlated with sex-, age- and district-specific calorie-adjusted intakes of fatty acids. For colorectal cancer in men but not in women, a significant positive association is found in univariate and multivariate regression with consumption of polyunsaturated fat and with the ratio unsaturated to saturated fat. For prostate cancer, breast cancer and total cancer, no clear associations with the studied dietary factors are found.
