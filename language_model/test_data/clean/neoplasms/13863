Mouse monoclonal antibodies (MRK16 and MRK17) against human multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines were tested for antibody-dependent cytotoxicity mediated by human blood mononuclear cells, using a 4-h 51Cr release assay. MRK16 (IgG2a isotype) was shown to be more effective than MRK17 (IgG1 isotype). Moreover, when four pairs of drug-resistant and their parent sensitive human cancer cells were tested for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytolysis (ADCC) using MRK16, only the drug-resistant cell lines were susceptible to ADCC reaction. When highly purified lymphocytes (greater than 99%) and monocytes (greater than 97%) were isolated from blood mononuclear cells by centrifugal elutriation and adherence, MRK16 promoted both lymphocyte- and monocyte-mediated tumor cell killing, whereas MRK17 induced only a lymphocyte-mediated ADCC reaction. These results suggest that MRK16 of IgG2a subtype may be a useful therapeutic agent in eradication of drug-resistant cancer cells expressing P-glycoprotein through ADCC reaction.
