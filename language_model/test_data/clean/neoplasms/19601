The aim of the study was the analysis of frequency of yeast-like fungi as etiological agents of fungemias in 181 children suffering from cancer treated in the years 1997-2000 in the Pediatric, Hematology and Oncology Clinique of the State Clinical Hospital in Bydgoszcz. Peripheral blood samples an collected from vascular catheters were incubated in VITAL 200 (bio Mérieux). Positive blood samples were inoculated on Sabouraud medium with chloramphenicol (bio Mérieux), of cultivation from 24 hours at 37 degrees C, following two hours at 22 degrees C. Fungal strains were identified by standard mycological procedures using ID 32 strips (bioMérieux). The total number of positive blood cultures was 1032 (22,1%). There have been recognized 22 fungemia by the children with fever in neutropenia period. Among fungi isolated from peripheral blood samples Candida spp. (13.4%), C. tropicalis (8.2%), stranis dominated. From blood samples collected from vascular catheters most often Candida spp. (29.9%), Candida parapsilosis (14.4%) and C. tropicalis (9.3%) were isolated.
