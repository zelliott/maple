Recently, the binding ability of DNA on GO and resulting nuclease resistance have attracted increasing attention, leading to new applications both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, nucleic acids absorbed on GO can be effectively protected from enzymatic degradation and biological interference in complicated samples, making it useful for targeted delivery, gene regulation, intracellular detection and imaging with high uptake efficiencies, high intracellular stability, and very low toxicity. In vitro, the adsorption of ssDNA on GO surface and desorption of dsDNA or well-folded ssDNA from GO surface result in the protection and deprotection of DNA from nucleic digestion, respectively, which has led to target-triggered cyclic enzymatic amplification methods (CEAM) for amplified detection of analytes with sensitivity 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of 1:1 binding strategies. This Concept article explores some of the latest developments in this field.
