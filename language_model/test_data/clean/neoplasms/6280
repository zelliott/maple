Plant phytochemicals represent an exciting opportunity to maintain best health conditions through a balanced and properly administered daily nutrition or dietary supplement and have often been considered a good option for obtaining a few promising, expensive new drugs from plants. Several polyphenolic compounds, such as resveratrol, tea catechins and flavonoids, which are commonly found in vegetables, fruits and plant-derived juices or beverages, exert well-evidenced cardioprotective, neuroprotective, chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory properties, but, nevertheless, further clinical and epidemiological research is required. Most of these botanical byproducts are produced as noxious components by plants, in order to prevent pathogen colonization, insect-mediated damage and also to discourage animals from eating them. An evolutionary theory of stress adaptation would explain how these toxic substances from nature act as protective molecules. A future challenge to achieve a rather complete understanding of these chemical phenol derivatives for human health should deal with the complexity of cellular signalling networks, the epigenetic machinery endowment of the cell and the nonlinear relationship between dose and effectiveness.
