Several kinds of cancer cells are shown to revert to normal state by action of chemical or biochemical differentiation agents. The analogy between cancer and embryonic cells, with regard to the expression of oncogenes, and the presence, in young embryos, of regulating factors, lead to the proposition of treatment of cancer cells by extracts of nuclei from embryo cells. Preliminary experiments with these extracts, on hepatoma cells in culture, have shown growth and DNA synthesis inhibitions, without cell toxicity, and a prolongation of survival of rats injected with the treated cancer cells.
