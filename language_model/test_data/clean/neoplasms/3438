As part of a nationwide quality improvement programme, our aim is the assessment of the quality of pain control in German paediatric oncology to tailor the intervention to specific needs. Here we report on the results of a questionnaire-based nationwide survey which addressed the head of the department, one supervising physician, one ward physician, one nurse, and one psychologist/social worker in each of the 76 german paediatric oncology departments. 210/380 health care professionals of 60/76 departments responded to the survey. According to 17% of the physicians (41% of the nurses, p = 0.004) there still exists '(very) often' pain despite pain therapy. Procedures are seen as the main causes of pain. According to 58% of the heads of the department and supervising physician (35% of the nurses and ward physicians, p = 0.005), faces scales are regularly used to score pain intensity. In 80% of the departments a written therapy protocol addressing procedure-related, or postoperative pain is lacking. When larger and smaller departments are compared, in former ones the significantly preferred routes for opioid administration are i. v., or oral for slow release preparations (p = 0.01). The i. m. route is exclusively used in smaller departments. In the treatment of neuropathic pain, only 5% of the physicians regard morphine, but 25% of them regard antidepressants and antiepileptics as ineffective. Only 72% of the physicians (39% of the nurses, p = 0.001) are convinced that during opioid-based pain therapy addiction 'seldom/never' developes. Nurses are less satisfied with pain therapy than are physicians, and they feel more frequently that pain therapy '(very) often' starts too late (p &lt;0.005). The questionnaire revealed obvious deficits in both physicians' and nurses' knowledge regarding pain therapy. Deficits were also addressed by the health care professionals themselves.
