Ninety-two undergraduates were assigned into groups to evaluate the effectiveness of interactive, computer-delivered programmed instruction for nutrition education on the topic of diet and cancer compared to traditional passive modes of instruction. Students were monitored for knowledge gains by means of a single 50-item test and an application task, using a 4-day diet record, administered 4 weeks prior to and 3 weeks after intervention. Results indicated that although subjects in the interactive group took nearly twice as long to complete the program, having the opportunity to respond to program blanks, this group produced significantly greater knowledge gains and lowered their fat intake by 41.8% compared to 26.1% reduction in fat intake in the noninteractive computer group and 18.6% in the passive prose text groups. Results suggest that interactive, computer-delivered, programmed instruction can be a very important adjunct to health care and cancer prevention programs at high schools and university settings.
