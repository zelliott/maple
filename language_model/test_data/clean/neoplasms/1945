Pain can complicate a diverse group of peripheral neuropathies. A number of potential mechanisms have been proposed, but available data are inadequate to posit any pathogenesis with certainty. In most cases, knowledge of the clinical findings associated with the various syndromes permits an etiologic diagnosis, which, in turn, may suggest a primary therapy. Symptomatic treatment is usually needed, however, and includes a large number of pharmacologic therapies, as well as ancillary physiatric and psychological treatments.
