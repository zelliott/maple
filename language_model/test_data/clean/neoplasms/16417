Clinical immunology involves studies of immunological diagnosis and monitoring of cancer patients, their immunity and treatment-induced changes, including those associated with immunotherapeutical exposures, immunodiagnosis of leukemias, estimation of solid tumor markers. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood cells from patients with solid tumors treated with chemo- and immunotherapy has elucidated some relationships to evaluate the efficiency of treatment. Detailed characterization of the structure of leukemic clone has promoted development of individual treatment regimens. The authors' experimental studies will evaluate the effects of cytokines on the mechanisms of multidrug resistance caused by mdr-1 gene hyperexpression and on apoptosis processes diminished by bcl-2 gene hyperexpression.
