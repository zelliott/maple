The Réseau de recherche sur le cancer (RR-cancer) a unit of the Fonds de la recherche en santé du Québec (FRSQ) has joined the worldwide effort to uncover mechanisms involved in cancer development through its well established clinical and fundamental research units. Encouraged by the excellence of the Quebec research community, the RR-cancer has developed a specialized infrastructure which allows better access to tissues and to state of the art analysis services. The research is founded on four axes: 1) Database and Tissue Bank; 2) Leukaemia cell bank; 3) Experimental therapy and 4) the Oncological Research Group of Québec. With these programs, the RR-cancer contributes to ameliorating prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer by facilitating access to the highest quality research material. Optimization of resources is made possible by the contributions of basic scientists and clinicians working together towards a unified objective: fighting cancer.
