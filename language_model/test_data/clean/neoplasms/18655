T-cell receptor (TCR) gene therapy aims to induce immune reactivity against tumors by introducing genes encoding a tumor-reactive TCR into patient T cells. This approach has been extensively tested in preclinical mouse models, and initial clinical trials have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of TCR gene therapy as a cancer treatment. However, data obtained from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that both the therapeutic efficacy and the safety of TCR gene therapy can be and needs to be further enhanced. This review highlights those strategies that can be followed to develop TCR gene therapy into a clinically relevant treatment option for cancer patients.
