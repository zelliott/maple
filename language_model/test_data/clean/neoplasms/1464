Ii protein suppression is a promising antisense drug-based therapy that dramatically enhances the immunogenicity of tumor cell major histocompatibility complex class II-presented antigenic epitopes. The strength of this approach is that the antisense only needs to be transiently effective in a fraction of the tumor cells. The systemic antitumor immune response generated subsequently eradicates both directly treated cells and distant tumor deposits. The drugs and mechanisms of this therapy are considered, in addition to practical developmental questions.
