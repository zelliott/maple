Serum-and-glucocorticoid-inducible-kinase-1 (SGK1) is under regulation of several hormones, mediators and cell stressors. More specifically, SGK1 expression is particularly sensitive to glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and TGFβ. Moreover, SGK1 expression is exquisitely sensitive to hypertonicity, hyperglycemia, and ischemia. SGK1 is activated by insulin and growth factors via phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, 3-phosphoinositide dependent-kinase PDK1, and mTOR. SGK1 up-regulates the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, a variety of carriers (e.g. NCC, NKCC, NHE1, NHE3, SGLT1, several amino acid transporters) and many ion channels (e.g. ENaC, SCN5A, TRPV4-6, Orai1/STIM1, ROMK, KCNE1/KCNQ1, GluR6, CFTR). SGK1 further up-regulates a number of enzymes (e.g. glycogen-synthase-kinase-3, ubiquitin-ligase Nedd4-2), and transcription factors (e.g. forkhead-transcription-factor FOXO3a, β-catenin, nuclear-factor-kappa-B NFκB). SGK1 sensitive functions contribute to regulation of epithelial transport, excitability, degranulation, matrix protein deposition, coagulation, platelet aggregation, migration, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Apparently, SGK1 is not required for housekeeping functions, as the phenotype of SGK1 knockout mice is mild. However, excessive SGK1 expression and activity participates in the pathophysiology of several disorders, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, thrombosis, stroke, inflammation, autoimmune disease, fibrosis, and tumor growth. A SGK1 gene variant (prevalence ~3-5% prevalence in Caucasians, ~10% in Africans) predisposes to hypertension, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, excessive salt intake and/or excessive release of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and TGFβ up-regulates SGK1 expression thus predisposing to SGK1-related diseases.
