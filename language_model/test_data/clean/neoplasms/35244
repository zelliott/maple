Biomarkers provide a powerful and dynamic approach to understanding the spectrum of malignancies with applications in observational and analytic epidemiology, randomized clinical trials, screening, diagnosis and prognosis. Defined as alterations in the constituents of tissues or body fluids, these markers offer a means for homogeneous classification of a disease and risk factor, and they can extend one's basic information about the underlying pathogenesis of disease. The goals in cancer research include finding biomarkers that can be used for the early detection of cancers, design individual therapies, and to identify underlying processes involved in the disease. Because so many myriad processes are involved in the diseased states, the goal is similar to 'finding a needle in a haystack'. However, the development of many -omic technologies, such as genomics and proteomics, has allowed us to monitor a large number of key cellular pathways simultaneously. This has enabled the identification of biomarkers and signalling molecules associated with cell growth, cell death and cellular metabolism. These are also facilitating in monitoring the functional disturbance, molecular and cellular damage, and damage response. This brief review describes the development of biomarkers in cancer research and detection with emphasis on different proteomic tools for the identification and discovery of new biomarkers, different clinical assays to detect various biomarkers in different specimens, role of biomarkers in cancer screening and last but not the least, the challenges in this direction of cancer research.
