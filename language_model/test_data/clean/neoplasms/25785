Over the last several decades, cancer research and therapy have focused primarily on tumor cells. However, in 1971 it was proposed that a solid tumor cannot grow without recruiting endothelial cells. The hypothesis was that if one can block the formation of an adequate capillary network, tumor growth could be inhibited. Antiangiogenesis research is undoubtedly very fashionable today but compounds effective in clinical trials have not been reported so far. The goal of this commentary is to discuss two questions: what are the limitations of the old, established antitumor paradigm? Second, what are the advantages of the antiangiogenesis paradigm? At this time it is important to convince more scientists that the inhibition of angiogenesis is a valid concept against tumor growth. A stronger momentum of the antiangiogenesis movement will hopefully result in finding more effective compounds against cancer growth.
