1. As the incidence of cancer continues to rise among Americans, the number of new cancer patients increases along with the survival rates. It is becoming increasingly important for nurses to recognize and respond to the needs of those living with cancer. 2. Those faced with cancer fear death, disfigurement, financial ruin, and isolation from their friends and loved ones. Patients and families have tremendous needs for assistance but do not know where to turn. Nurses in any practice setting can help these patients access community resources. 3. The American Cancer Society is a national organization offering programs for patients and families in the areas of resources, information, and guidance; education and support programs; and direct services.
