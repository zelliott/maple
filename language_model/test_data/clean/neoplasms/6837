DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), which encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (Rho-GAP), is a potent tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated in several human cancers. DLC1 is a multidomain protein that has been shown previously to bind members of the tensin gene family. Here we show that p120Ras-GAP (Ras-GAP; also known as RASA1) interacts and extensively colocalizes with DLC1 in focal adhesions. The binding was mapped to the SH3 domain located in the N terminus of Ras-GAP and to the Rho-GAP catalytic domain located in the C terminus of the DLC1. In vitro analyses with purified proteins determined that the isolated Ras-GAP SH3 domain inhibits DLC1 Rho-GAP activity, suggesting that Ras-GAP is a negative regulator of DLC1 Rho-GAP activity. Consistent with this possibility, we found that ectopic overexpression of Ras-GAP in a Ras-GAP-insensitive tumor line impaired the growth-suppressing activity of DLC1 and increased RhoA activity in vivo. Our observations expand the complexity of proteins that regulate DLC1 function and define a novel mechanism of the cross talk between Ras and Rho GTPases.1R01CA129610
