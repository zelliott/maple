The authors introduce a new technique for performing aortic stop-flow infusion (ASI) or hypoxic abdominal perfusion (HAP) to treat advanced thoracoabdominal tumors, via an angiographic percutaneous approach. To date, the maneuver has always been performed with surgical exposure of vascular sites in the groins. The materials available on the market were initially used and then dedicated materials have been developed, such as 11-F vascular sheaths, 8-F catheters, latex balloons with maximum phi's of 4 cm and maximum capacity of 70 ml. We performed 72 maneuvers in 56 patients during 22 months. No technical or instrumental complications occurred and all treatments were successful. Three patients (6%) died within 12 hours, two because of ARDS following thoracic perfusion and one for acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation following abdominal perfusion. The percutaneous approach provides the same mechanical-occlusive efficacy for aortocaval occlusion and therefore the same therapeutic results as surgery, but it has fewer risks of technical complications and no technical failures. Moreover, this technique is more repeatable and less expensive than surgery and its hospital stay and recovery time are shorter. To conclude, the ASI/HAP procedure is an interesting therapeutic chance in otherwise untreatable advanced cancer patients offering several prospects of technical and pharmacologic development to further increase its efficacy.
