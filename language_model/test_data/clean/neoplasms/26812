The prognosis of refractory or relapsed pediatric solid tumors is very poor, and there is no standard treatment for this condition. The combination of irinotecan and temozolomide has proved useful in adults as a second-line treatment of different solid tumors. In pediatric patients, this combination has been effective in Ewing's sarcoma, neuroblastoma, and relapsed or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma.

A retrospective study was conducted on 32 pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors, who were treated with irinotecan and temozolomide in the Oncology Department at Children's Hospital Ni√±o Jesus from September 2005 to June 2012. The clinical characteristics, treatment performed, toxicity and outcome, were analyzed.

Thirty-two patients received a total of 180 cycles. Of the 30 evaluable patients, 10 (33%) had a positive response (2 complete remission and 8 partial remission), and in 8 (27%) the disease remained stable. Almost all (94%) of the patients achieved a response in the first four cycles. Of the 180 cycles analyzed, only 50 (28%) had toxicity, and of these only 15 (8%) were grade iii-iv. The most common toxicity was diarrhea appearing in 18 patients. All patients received ambulatory treatment, except three of them who required hospitalization due to symptoms of their underlying disease.

The combination of irinotecan and temozolomide is well tolerated and active against pediatric refractory or relapsed solid tumors.
