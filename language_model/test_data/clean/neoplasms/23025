This study investigates by written questionnaire the information sources preferred by 63 adolescent cancer patients. Physicians were the most common source. Over half preferred private discussions with a health professional over other formats, and 68% indicated physicians as the health professional of choice. Sixty-eight percent wanted parents included. Only 35% indicated that additional information would be personally helpful, while 42% and 45%, respectively, stated that families and friends should have more information. No relationship between diagnosis or sex and the patients' responses was found. Newly diagnosed patients were less likely to perceive physicians as their main information sources or want additional information. Patients in active illness phases were also less desirous of additional information. Younger patients were more likely to prefer information only from parents, to avoid group discussions, and to negate wanting friends to receive additional information. Hispanics were most likely to want parents to have additional information and to request parental inclusion in discussions.
