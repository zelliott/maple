To evaluate the effects of a palliative care education programme on the self-reported knowledge and confidence of 72 community nurses.

a prospective longitudinal postal questionnaire survey was conducted.

seventy-one (99%) completed a pre-course questionnaire, 52 (72%) a questionnaire at completion of the course, and 37 (51%) a questionnaire one year later. Following the programme, more nurses felt that their professional needs were being met well or very well. Confidence in practice showed an increasing trend over time. Desire for education was lower on course completion than at its start. Palliative Care Nursing Quiz scores rose from a pre-course median of 12.5 to 15 at course completion (P=0.001) which was maintained 1 year later.

the education programme was successful in raising standards of knowledge, professional development and confidence. Improvement was maintained one year later.
