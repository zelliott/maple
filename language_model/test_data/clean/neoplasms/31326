In 1969, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) initiated the Monographs Programme to evaluate the carcinogenic risk of chemicals to humans. Results from short-term mutagenicity tests were first included in the IARC Monographs in the mid-1970s based on the observation that most carcinogens are also mutagens, although not all mutagens are carcinogens. Experimental evidence at that time showed a strong correlation between mutagenicity and carcinogenicity and indicated that short-term mutagenicity tests are useful for predicting carcinogenicity. Although the strength of these correlations has diminished over the past 20 years with the identification of putative nongenotoxic carcinogens, such tests provide vital information for identifying potential human carcinogens and understanding mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The short-term test results for agents compiled in the EPA/IARC Genetic Activity Profile (GAP) database over nearly 15 years are summarized and reviewed here with regard to their IARC carcinogenicity classifications. The evidence of mutagenicity or nonmutagenicity based on a 'defining set' of test results from three genetic endpoints (gene mutation, chromosomal aberrations, and aneuploidy) is examined. Recommendations are made for assessing chemicals based on the strength of evidence from short-term tests, and the implications of this approach in identifying mutational mechanisms of carcinogenesis are discussed. The role of short-term test data in influencing the overall classification of specific compounds in recent Monograph volumes is discussed, particularly with reference to studies in human populations. Ethylene oxide is cited as an example.
