Growth factor receptors play critical roles in cancer cell proliferation and progression. A number of such receptors have been targeted for cancer treatment by either a monoclonal antibody or a specifically designed small molecule to inhibit the receptor function. Bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (BN/GRP-Rs) are expressed in a variety of cancer cells and have limited distribution in normal human tissue. Inhibition of BN/GRP-Rs has been shown to block small cell lung cancer growth in vitro. Early phase clinical trials targeting human GRP-R showed anti-cancer activity. This review will focus on the study of the distribution of BN/GRP-Rs in normal and malignant tissues, and various approaches to targeting BN-GRP-Rs for cancer diagnosis and treatment.
