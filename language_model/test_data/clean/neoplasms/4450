Clodronate, one of the most investigated bisphosphonates, has been clinically utilised for over 10 years in malignancy. It is the most used, most effective and safest drug in the treatment of hypercalcaemia. It inhibits lytic bone destruction, prevents bone fractures and relieves bone pain. Supportive clodronate therapy may even reduce hypercalcaemia mortality and the morbidity caused by osteolysis. These results have stimulated studies on the patients' quality of life. New methods for the measurement of bone resorption, such as the degradation product of type I collagen (ICTP), may improve the possibility of monitoring the effect of clodronate. Comparative studies with different bisphosphonates in hypercalcaemia and long-term controlled trials using bisphosphonates as supportive therapy in osteolysis due to malignancy are reviewed.
