The aim of the treatment of a child with cancer is to reach cure without physical and/or psychological sequelae. The quality of life should be preserved by a global approach of the child and his family from the diagnosis until completion of treatment and follow-up periods. The specialist and the general practitioner should inform the child and his family on a regular basis, and check prospectively the tolerance of the siblings. The role of physicians also includes a fight for better information of public, economical and political powers, so that a cured child may become an happy, well integrated adult.
