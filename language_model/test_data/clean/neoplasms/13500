Approaches to cancer therapy for most tumors in adults and children have changed little in 50 years: surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are standard for many solid tumors. When the concept of angiogenesis in cancer biology was introduced in the 1970s, there was little recognition of the therapeutic potential of attacking a tumor's blood supply. Advances in understanding the molecular processes that regulate tumor blood supply and novel agents that can interfere with them have generated a great deal of scientific interest and excitement. This article reviews the current understanding of angiogenesis and its role in cancer then discusses new therapeutic options in animals and humans, with a focus on pediatric tumors and the potential for treating them.
