The fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) regulate important biological processes including cell proliferation and differentiation during development and tissue repair. Over the past decades, numerous pathological conditions and developmental syndromes have emerged as a consequence of deregulation in the FGFRs signaling network. This review aims to provide an overview of FGFR family, their complex signaling pathways in tumorigenesis, and the current development and application of therapeutics targeting the FGFRs signaling for treatment of refractory human cancers.
