The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of Microsporidium among patients given a diagnosis of cancer. For this purpose fecal samples from 320 patients aged 23.60+/-23.00 years were examined using native-Lugol and sedimentation methods and evaluated with modified trichrome, trichrome, and calcofluor dyes. Moreover a control group of 320 non-cancer patients was set up. While 10.9% of the patient group was found to have Microsporidium, only 5.6% of the control group did. Comparison between the control and patient groups in terms of presence of Microsporidium revealed a statistically significant difference. The analysis of a possible relation between intestinal parasites and the presence of Microsporidium revealed a statistically significant correlation between Microsporidium and Blastocystis hominis (P &lt; 0.05). The frequencies of intestinal parasites in the control group and the patient group were found to be 17.8% and 18.1%, respectively. From the findings it was concluded that presence of intestinal parasites and Microsporidium in cancer patients can cause critical problems and adversely affect the therapy. Moreover it was suggested that cancer patients should be informed about regular feces examination and protection against parasites in order to improve their life standards and protect them against parasite infections during treatment.
