Leukapheresis demands patient's compliance and adequate vascular accesses, which can require invasive methods in very small children whose treatment protocol includes hemopoietic stem cell collection for myeloablative chemotherapy and stem cell rescue. Since 1998, at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan, in selected uncompliant small children, the placement of peripheral vascular accesses and leukapheresis have been performed at the same time under general anesthesia. Peripheral venous cannulas were positioned for blood collection, while blood was returned through either peripheral cannulas or mono-lumen central catheters previously installed for chemotherapy. A continuous-flow cell separator was used for leukapheresis. Between 1998 and 2003, 47 children with solid tumors underwent anesthesia for a total of 54 leukaphereses. The patients' age ranged from 12.7 to 93 months (median 30.3) and their weight ranged from 7 to 20 kg (median 14.1). Neither metabolic nor anesthesiological complications were recorded. In 89% of cases, the CD 34(+) cell target was achieved at a single harvest; the median number of CD 34(+) cells was 10.8 x 10(6)/kg/leukapheresis (range 1-117) and the median collection efficiency was 63.4% (range 25-100.6). Leukapheresis under anesthesia is feasible and safe in very low-weight children whose compliance is lacking due to age and disease.
