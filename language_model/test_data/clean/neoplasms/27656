We developed a multi-directional positron imaging system for the whole body in order to evaluate the spatial distribution of radiopharmaceuticals. A positron emission tomography (PET) scanner with ring detectors was modified to provide 54 directional planar images with a three-dimensional appearance by using cinematic display. The initial clinical evaluation was performed on two normal volunteers and 17 cancer patients with 32 foci. Images were obtained approximately one hour after the intravenous administration of 2-(F-18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. In all 19 subjects, good quality images with a three-dimensional appearance were obtained. We were able to visualize 16 of 20 (80%) lesions that were three centimeters or more in greatest diameter. In contrast, only seven of 12 (58%) lesions less than three centimeters in greatest diameter were identified. The overall detectability of lesions was 72%. These results suggest that this system will be useful for tumor detection.
