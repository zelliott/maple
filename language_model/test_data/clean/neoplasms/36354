This study was designed to adapt the Turkish versions of scales to evaluate fatigue in children with cancer from the perspectives of the children, parents and staff. The objective of this study was to validate "Child Fatigue Scale-24 hours" (CFS-24 hours), "Parent Fatigue Scale-24 hours" (PFS-24 hours) and "Staff Fatigue Scale-24 hours" (SFS-24 hours) for use in Turkish clinical research settings. Translation of the scales into Turkish and validity and reliability tests were performed. The validity of the translated scales was assessed with language validity and content validity. The reliability of the translated scales was assessed with internal consistency. The scales were evaluated by considering the following: calculation of the Cronbach alpha coefficient for parallel form reliability with 52 pediatric cancer patients, 86 parents and 43 nurses. The internal consistency was estimated as 0.88 for the Child Fatigue Scale-24 hours, 0.77 for the Parent Fatigue Scale-24 hours, and 0.72 for the Staff Fatigue Scale-24 hours (Cronbach's Î±). The Turkish version of the Child Fatigue Scale-24 hours, the Parent Fatigue Scale-24 hours and the Staff Fatigue Scale-24 hours were judged reliable and valid instruments to assess fatigue in children and showed good psychometric properties. These scales should assist in understanding to what extent initiatives can minimize or eliminate fatigue. Our scales are recommended for further studies and use in pediatric oncology clinics as routine measurements and nursing initiatives should be planned accordingly.
