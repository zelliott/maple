The paper is concerned with the results of recent researches devoted to studies of the structure, properties and physiological role of alpha 2-macroglobulin, one of main inhibitors of blood proteolytic enzymes. Data are presented on its primary and quaternary structure, mechanisms of interaction with proteinases. The role of alpha 2-macroglobulin in regulation of the activity of proteinases participating in blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, kininogenesis, immune reactions is shown. Possibilities of its application in medicine are discussed.
