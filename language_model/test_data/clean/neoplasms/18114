To review existing literature about the psychosocial reactions of cancer patients and provide information about the needs of patients wishing to preserve fertility.

Journal articles, research studies.

The desire for biological parenthood is an important issue for cancer survivors. Patients may not receive accurate, timely information about fertility-sparing options; those not receiving this information are at increased risk for psychological distress.

Fertility-preservation decisions are complex and a team approach may identify patients at risk for psychological distress and provide opportunities for discussion of psychosocial issues involved. Nurses must be informed about the emotional reactions and informational needs of their patients.
