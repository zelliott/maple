The occurrence of cancers in patients with primary humoral immunodeficiency syndrome (X-linked agammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency, IgA deficiency) is more than mere coincidence. An increased risk of non Hodgkin's lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma, particularly for patients with common variable immunodeficiency, is well established. A literature review is presented on this subject with analysis of case reports, prospective and retrospective studies, and data from the Minnesota Immunodeficiency Cancer Registry.
