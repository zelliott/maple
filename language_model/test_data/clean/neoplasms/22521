The results of a recent survey of Australian radiotherapy centres are presented. A total of 56 treatment centres were identified, operating 139 linacs, 26 kV units and 25 remote afterloaders. Of these centres, 51 participated in the survey (91%). Results are presented which summarize the beam qualities, dosimetry protocols, ion chambers and treatment modalities in clinical use. The results provide a snapshot of the equipment and practices used in radiotherapy in Australia in 2009.
