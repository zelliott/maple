A study was undertaken to determine the potential value of DNA flow cytometry (FCM) for the diagnosis of malignancy in pleural effusions and to compare its results with those of traditional cytomorphology. Forty-one pleural fluids from 37 patients were evaluated by DNA FCM and routine cytologic techniques. Of the 41 pleural fluids, 29 (70.7%) demonstrated an abnormal DNA content by FCM. Two of the 29 pleural fluids had been originally diagnosed as benign by cytology. Cytologic review of these two cases showed no abnormal cells; therefore, there were no false-negative cases based on cytology. In 12 (29.3%) of the 41 fluids, DNA FCM and cytologic evaluation both indicated benign processes. Our preliminary observations indicate that FCM is an accurate and reliable technique that may be of aid in the diagnosis of malignant effusions. The technique may prove to be of special value in the differential diagnosis of reactive mesothelial cells versus malignant mesothelioma as well as for following patients who receive chemotherapy for malignant pleural effusions. DNA FCM may also complement cytomorphologic diagnoses in other serous, exfoliative or aspiration material.
