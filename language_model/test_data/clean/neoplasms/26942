Kinases become one of important groups of drug targets. To identify more kinases being potential for cancer therapy, we developed an integrative approach for the large-scale screen of functional genes capable of regulating the main traits of cancer metastasis. We first employed self-assembled cell microarray to screen functional genes that regulate cancer cell migration using a human genome kinase siRNA library. We identified 81 genes capable of significantly regulating cancer cell migration. Following with invasion assays and bio-informatics analysis, we discovered that 16 genes with differentially expression in cancer samples can regulate both cell migration and invasion, among which 10 genes have been well known to play critical roles in the cancer development. The remaining 6 genes were experimentally validated to have the capacities of regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis and anoikis activities besides cell motility. Together, these findings provide a new insight into the therapeutic use of human kinases.

This team of authors have utilized a self-assembled cell microarray to screen genes that regulate cancer cell migration using a human genome siRNA library of kinases. They validated previously known genes and identified novel ones that may serve as therapeutic targets.
