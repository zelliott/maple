Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one subgroup of adult stem cells and possess a proliferative potential and ability to differentiate into various ceells.

Emerging evidence suggests that MSCs can reprogram toward cancer stem cells (CSCs), due to alterations of intrinsic and extrinsic microenvironments, leading to tumorigenesis. The CSC concept has fundamental clinical implications because of its involvement in cell migration/invasion, metastasis, and treatment resistance. Therefore, targeting CSCs provides a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. However, the origin of CSCs and its molecular connections are not fully understood. Emerging evidence suggests the existence of an inter-relationship between CSCs and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypic cells, in the context of inflammation and hypoxia, as well as the potential role of miRNAs.

We suggest that targeting CSC signatures along with EMT, inflammation, and hypoxia will provide a more effective therapeutic approach for the elimination of CSCs. To that end, curcumin especially its synthetic novel analog CDF have been shown to attenuate CSC characteristics along with the deregulation of multiple pathways and miRNAs, leading to the inhibition of human tumor growth in vivo, suggesting the potential role of CDF as an anti-tumor agent for the prevention/treatment of tumor progression.
