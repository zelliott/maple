We measured plasma heparin cofactor II (HC II) activity in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to various underlying diseases together with the levels of antithrombin III (AT III), pseudocholinesterase (a marker of hepatic synthesis), and various haemostatic molecular markers. Both HC II and AT III were decreased in DIC secondary to all the underlying diseases studied, except acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), when compared with healthy subjects. The lowest HC II and AT III levels was observed in coagulopathy secondary to liver disease, the HC II level in sepsis was the second lowest. In DIC due to APL, the decrease in HC II was not accompanied by a decrease in AT III. Thus, we divided all 124 samples tested into APL and non-APL groups. The HC II level correlated positively with fibrinogen and plasminogen in both the APL and non-APL groups. In the APL group, the HC II level had a significant negative correlation with the thrombin-AT III complex (TAT), fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products, and D-dimer levels as well as the prothrombin time, while AT III showed no correlations with any of the haemostatic parameters. These results suggest that HC II may be consumed preferentially by thrombin in APL patients with DIC, and thus may spare the consumption of AT III. Accordingly, HC II seems to be a superior indicator of DIC than AT III in APL patients. Moreover, replacement therapy with HC II instead of AT III may be useful to treat DIC associated with APL. In the non-APL group, the HC II levels were positively correlated with the levels of AT III and pseudocholinesterase activity. This indicates that plasma HC II levels are closely related not only to consumption coagulopathy but also to hepatic synthetic activity, as is the case for plasma AT III.
