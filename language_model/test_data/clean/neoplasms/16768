Oral ulcerations are frequently observed in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Herpes simplex virus is the most common viral pathogen association with lesions. Reactivation of latent virus is responsible for the vast majority of culture-positive infections. The natural history of this virus has been well studied in selected patient populations. These infections may cause local complications and, if untreated, may not heal for weeks. Reactivation of the virus may occur predictably in patients after bone marrow transplantation or acute leukemia. Recognition that herpes simplex virus is present in oral lesions is of importance because of the availability of safe, effective antiviral therapy. Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated that acyclovir is the most effective agent to treat or prevent herpes simplex virus infections in immunocompromised patients.
