MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are pivotal regulators involved in various biological functions through the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Alterations of miRNA expression and function contribute to both physiological and pathological processes such as development and cancer. While their roles have been attracting more attention in connection with tumor development, the mechanisms regulating miRNA biogenesis have not been well understood. Accumulating evidences have revealed the dynamic regulation of miRNA biosynthesis by several regulatory factors and demonstrated the complexity of miRNA-mediated gene regulation. In addition, several reports showed the interplay between the p53 tumor suppressor network and the miRNA-mediated gene regulatory system. We recently found that p53 modulates miRNA maturation at the processing step of primary miRNA transcripts, unraveling a novel function of p53. Here, we review the recent understanding of functional links between miRNA biogenesis and intracellular signaling pathways, with particular focus on the crosstalk between the p53 network and the miRNA biogenesis machinery. Further characterization of controlling elements for miRNA production and activity would provide important insights for a comprehensive understanding of the miRNA function in health and disease.
