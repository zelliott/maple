The results of cancer-associated miRNA research have yielded surprising insights into the pathogenesis of a range of different cancers. Many of the dysregulated miRNAs are involved in the regulation of genes that are essential for carcinogenesis.

This review discusses the latest discovery of miRNAs acting as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, as well as the potential applications of miRNA regulations in cancer therapy. Several translational studies have demonstrated the feasibility of targeting oncogenic miRNAs and restoring tumor-suppressive miRNAs for cancer therapy using in vivo model systems.

miRNAs are extensive regulators of cancer progression. With increasing understanding of the miRNA target genes and the cellular behaviors influenced by them, modulating the miRNA activities may provide exciting opportunities for cancer therapy. Despite the hurdles incurred in acquiring effective systemic drug delivery systems, in vivo delivery of miRNAs for therapeutic purposes in preclinical animal models is rapidly developing. Accumulating evidences indicate that using miRNA expression alterations to influence molecular pathways has the potential of being translated into clinical applications.
