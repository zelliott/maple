Studies into the molecular mechanisms of cancer have revealed that, with a few exceptions, the disease lacks a specific drug target. Therefore, new anticancer drugs not only take many years and much money to develop but also might not outperform existing drugs. However, what are assumed to be unfavorable hallmarks of cancer, for example drug resistance, can be exploited for selective anticancer therapy and for protection of normal cells. Based on this paradigm, the drug discovery can be complemented by novel use of existing agents and even "failed" drugs. The pharmacological industry could develop low cost, effective therapeutic modalities, by "re-using" already marketed and late-stage products in cancer-selective therapeutic kits.
