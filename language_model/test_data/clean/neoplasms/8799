A new type of metabolizable and efficient radiosensitizers for cancer radiotherapy is presented by combining ultrasmall Au nanoclusters (NCs, &lt;2 nm) with biocompatible coating ligands (glutathione, GSH). The new nanoconstruct (GSH-coated Au25 NCs) inherits attractive features of both the Au core (strong radiosensitizing effect) and GSH shell (good biocompatibility). It can preferentially accumulate in tumor via the improved EPR effect, which leads to strong enhancement for cancer radiotherapy. After the treatment, the small-sized GSH-Au25 NCs can be efficiently cleared by the kidney, minimizing any potential side effects due to the accumulation of Au25 NCs in the body.
