An education specialist in follow-up clinics for childhood cancer survivors assists these individuals in meeting their complex educational needs. Most survivors present with unique educational profiles as a result of their cancer diagnosis or treatment. Children at risk for neurocognitive late effects are especially in need of ongoing educational consultation. Lack of funding for educators in the clinical setting results in the need for nurse practitioners to take on this role. However, nurse practitioners may feel inadequate in regard to their knowledge of the educational system. This article presents a model for targeting high-risk patients and monitoring their educational needs and gives practical advice in advocating needed services in the school system.
