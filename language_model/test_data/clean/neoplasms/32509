This review provides a summary of the European Association for Cancer Research Award Lecture, presented at the ECCO12 meeting in Copenhagen in September 2003. It describes what we have learnt about the mechanisms responsible for deregulating RNA polymerase III transcription in transformed cells. A network has been discovered of unanticipated links to key tumour suppressors and oncogenes. Novel functions have been revealed for RB, p53 and c-Myc, that may help explain their profound biological effects.
