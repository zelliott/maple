Delayed hypersensitivity to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) was tested prior to radiation therapy in 206 patients with solid tumors. The patients were separated into a DNCB-positive group who showed a significant response to DNCB and a DNCB-negative group who did not. After one year, it was found that patients with a positive DNCB reaction had a statistically better chance of survival than those with a negative DNCB reaction. Although this is not proof that DNCB testing can indicate those patients who should be excluded from radical therapy, it can help identify those who may respond favorably to extended efforts at palliation or cure despite clinically advanced disease.
