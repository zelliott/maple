A detailed approach to the gathering of information on the cost-effectiveness of palliative chemotherapy for patients with cancer has been described. The measures are qualitative and so difficult to study scientifically, but several innovations have been incorporated into the programme which should ensure a level of robustness to give reliable and valid information. Making judgements about the usefulness of treatment for patients involves comparing factors that are inherently incomparable and measuring those which are inherently unmeasurable. Nevertheless, it is hoped that this will be found to be a pessimistic view of what can be achieved by audit, particularly in the light of advances that have been made in assessing quality of life. At the least, the project will provide important statistical information and the existence of the audit process itself should enhance significantly standards of medical practice.
