There is an increasing amount of research into the health benefits of berry flavonoids. Moreover, the consumption of flavonoid-rich food is on the increase; with women in particular showing a interest in eating a diet which may benefit their long-term health. The aim of this review was to examine the evidence for the benefits of berry flavonoids for cardiovascular health, cancer and cognition in the menopausal woman. Due to the limited amount of clinical data on this subject both in vitro and animal as well as human studies have been included. These data appear to support epidemiological studies that suggest cardiovascular benefits, cancer prevention and cognitive improvement from berry flavonoid consumption. However to date, it is not possible to be definitive about the specific berry type, preparation or regime which confers maximum benefits, or to give specific advice to menopausal women. Limited data from a combination of pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest that the addition of berry flavonoids to the diet has moderate effects on cardiovascular function in subjects at risk and potential preventative effects in oesophageal cancer. Evidence for cognitive benefits is limited to animal data but shows promise.
