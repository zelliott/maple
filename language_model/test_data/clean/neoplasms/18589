Cancer is an extremely complex disease and most cancer treatments are limited to chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. The progression of tumours towards malignancy requires the interaction of various cytokines, growth factors, transcription factors and effector molecules. Osteopontin is a cytokine-like, calcium-binding, extracelular-matrix- associated member of the small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoprotein (SIBLING) family of proteins. It plays an important role in determining the oncogenic potential of various cancers. The role of osteopontin in various pathophysiological conditions suggests that the alteration in post-translational modification result in different functional forms that might change its normal physiological functions.

Osteopontin -based anticancer therapy, which may provide a new insight for the effective management of cancer.

A better understanding of the signalling mechanism by which osteopontin promotes tumourigenesis may be useful in crafting novel osteopontin -based anticancer therapy. The role of osteopontin in promoting cancer progression is the subject of in depth investigation and thus targeting osteopontin might be a suitable therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer.
