The tumor protein p73 (TP73) gene belongs to the TP53 gene family and functions in the induction of apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest. The TP73 polymorphism (G4C14-A4T14) has been reported and many studies have focused on the role of this polymorphism in various cancers. However, the data reported for most individual cancer types were limited and not able to support a convincible conclusion. Hence, in this study, we explored the relationship between TP73 polymorphism (G4C14-A4T14) and cancer risk by carrying out a comprehensive meta-analysis. Performing both the overall and subgroup meta-analyses with a total of 23 eligible studies (6635 cases and 7378 controls in all), we detected significant cancer risk variations in the overall analysis, as well as the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity for both Asians and Caucasians. In the subgroup analysis based on source of controls, significant associations were also observed in the hospital-based controls' subgroup yet not in the population-based controls' subgroup. Furthermore, in the subgroup analysis based on cancer types, significant associations were found in colorectal cancer's subgroup but not in other cancer types' subgroups. In summary, according to the results of our meta-analysis, the TP73 polymorphism (G4C14-A4T14) probably associates with cancer risk.
