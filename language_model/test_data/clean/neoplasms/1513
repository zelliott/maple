Oncogenic ras-p21 directly activates jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its substrate, jun as a unique step on its mitogenic signal transduction pathway. This activation is blocked by the specific JNK-jun inhibitor, glutathione-S-transferase-pi (GST-pi). Four domains of GST-pi have been implicated in this regulatory function: 34-50, 99-121, 165-182, and 194-201. The 34-50 domain is unique in that it does not affect GST-pi binding to JNK-jun but blocks jun phosphorylation by JNK. We now find that it completely blocks oncogenic (Val 12-) ras-p21-induced oocyte maturation but has no effect on insulin-induced oocyte maturation. Because the latter process requires activation of wild-type ras-p21, this peptide appears to be specific for inhibiting only the oncogenic form of ras-p21, suggesting its use in treating ras-induced tumors.
