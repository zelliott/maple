The management of 19 patients with malignant obstruction of the oesophagus who previously had undergone partial gastrectomy was reviewed. With stomach unavailable for oesophagoplasty, the jejunum was used in 12 patients, and the colon in seven patients, for reconstruction or bypass. The technique recommended is jejunal oesophagoplasty. Surgical intervention to restore swallowing in this group of patients has been associated with a 52% hospital mortality and a considerable morbidity. Because of the late stage of the disease, survival beyond two-three years after a successful operation has not been possible so far.
