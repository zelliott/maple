The aim of this study was to analyze the role of immunocytochemistry as an ancillary method on routine FNACs of enlarged lymph nodes, using different markers. In a validating cohort study all patients had confirmatory histological and/or clinical follow-up. 10 FNACs were analyzed for the differentiation of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) from metastatic carcinoma (MC), 30 cases to identify the sites of metastatic unknown primary tumors and 16 cases were checked to confirm clinical suspicion of a specific MC. Accuracy to differentiate NHL from MC was 100%, 92.3% to identify a primary tumor site of MC, and 100% to confirm a clinical suspicion of a specific MC. In 7 cases, the site of the primary tumor remained clinically unknown. Application of immunocytochemical markers on the same slide used for microscopic diagnosis is a useful tool in the routine assessment of FNACs of lymph nodes.
