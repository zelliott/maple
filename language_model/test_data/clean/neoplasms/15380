New pathologic techniques are improving the ability to detect malignancy and determine treatment modes. With immunohistochemistry the pathologist can make important distinctions, such as differentiating between carcinomas and lymphomas. With the flow cytometer various cell parameters and fluorescent labels can be measured. Still investigational are techniques for the detection of activated oncogenes and early viral infections.
