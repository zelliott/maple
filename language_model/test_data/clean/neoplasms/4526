Cancer incidence patterns of Jews from the former USSR differ from those among Israeli Jews originating from Europe who arrived with previous waves of immigration. Projected estimates of cancer incidence in Israel following the current Russian immigration indicate that the total cancer rate in the country will grow in proportion to this immigration. In addition, changes are anticipated in the distribution of cancer sites. These include increases in the incidence of esophageal cancer of 50%, stomach and cervical 33%, pulmonary 21%, and laryngeal 18%. In contrast, malignant melanoma, breast and rectal cancer, and leukemia and lymphomas, will decrease slightly. These changes mandate appropriate adjustments with regard to both curative and preventive measures.
