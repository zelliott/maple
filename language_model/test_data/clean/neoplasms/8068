For most age-related disorders there is no cure, and treatment is expensive and often ineffective. Thus, disease prevention is an issue of increasing concern and importance. Nurses form the largest professional healthcare group in the world, and the professional code of the modern day nurse advocates health promotion as a primary role. Nurses, by virtue of their close, direct interaction with their community and clients, are in a strong position to disseminate and reinforce the message of health promotion with the aim of achieving functional longevity in our aging population. This requires that nurses themselves increase their awareness, knowledge and understanding of relevant interdisciplinary research findings. In the current review, the influence of diet on the risk of four of the most prevalent age-related diseases (cancer, cardiovascular disease, dementia and diabetes) is presented, and the underlying mechanisms of influence are discussed, with particular focus on antioxidant-rich foods.
