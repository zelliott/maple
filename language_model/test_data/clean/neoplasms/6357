MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small (21-23 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that emerged as key post-transcriptional gene regulators, implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes. Currently, a main focus of miRNA research is related to the roles of miRNAs in cancer development. The biogenesis and modes of action of miRNAs have not been completely elucidated; however, miRNA-mediated translational repression is involved in the regulation of almost every cellular process. Thus, pathological alterations in miRNA expression signatures are commonly associated with disease development. This review specifically focuses on miRNAs in cancer, with an emphasis on their use as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Then, we discuss the potential use of synthetic antisense or miRNA mimetic oligonucleotides and dietary agents to modulate miRNA expression for chemotherapy and chemoprevention of cancer, respectively.
