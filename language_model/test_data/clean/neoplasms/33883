Research in health psychology and behavioral medicine has increased exponentially over the past three decades. Prevention and control efforts across a variety of diseases have recognized that individual difference factors, belief systems, attitudes, behaviors, and environments can affect an individual's health. This work continues, as there has been no abatement in the rate at which aversive, chronic, and life-threatening diseases continue to affect millions of Americans each year. The purpose of this review is to discuss the influence of cognitive factors on health psychology and behavioral medicine using the cancer literature as an example. The main discussion focuses on the impact of cognitive constructs on behavioral medicine and health psychology in cancer, which appears to be widespread. The article concludes with some implications for future research in the area.
