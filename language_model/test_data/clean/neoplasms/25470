The binding specificities of monoclonal antibodies against human cutaneous malignant melanoma were analyzed using radioimmunoassay (RIA), mixed hemadsorption assay (MHA), and peroxidase-antiperoxidase assay on a variety of malignant and nonmalignant cells. Twenty-four of the 30 monoclonal antibodies bound to the majority of melanoma cell lines tested, and only two antibodies did not bind to any of the melanoma lines. Three antibodies bound to melanoma lines only, 13 antibodies reacted also with fetal cells, 21 antibodies bound to at least one carcinoma cell line and nine antibodies reacted with one or more cell lines of leukemic or lymphoid origin. The antibodies could be divided into seven groups based on their binding characteristics. These groups had been established by a panel of monoclonal antimelanoma antibodies produced and characterized at The Wistar Institute.
