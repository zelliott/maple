A comprehensive cancer pain management consultative service sponsored by a department of anesthesia at a moderately sized community hospital is described. Medical records of 111 patients from 1986 to 1990 were reviewed. Different therapies utilized and patient populations are described. It is suggested that trained anesthesiologists who are committed to a multidisciplinary approach to alleviating cancer pain can provide similar support.
