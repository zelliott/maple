This research sought to identify what has been helpful for young people who have a parent diagnosed with cancer. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with young people (N = 15, age: M = 15.9 years) who had a parent diagnosed with cancer within the last 5 years. A phenomenological thematic data analysis distinguished three superordinate themes, identifying what helped adolescents cope with their parent's cancer diagnosis. These were parental behavior, specific coping strategies used by the young person, and community support. These results contribute to our knowledge of what can help young people whose parent has been diagnosed with cancer.
