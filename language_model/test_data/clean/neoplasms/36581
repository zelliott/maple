TNF, in addition to its antitumor activity, would play an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer-related severe complications, including ARDS and DIC. Therefore, the modulation of TNF secretion could be important in the supportive care of advanced cancer patients. At present, PTX is the only drug which has been proven to be able to inhibit in vitro the release of TNF. The present study was performed to evaluate the effect of PTX on TNF blood concentrations in disseminated cancer patients with abnormally high TNF values. The study included 14 cancer patients, with initial or conclamate signs of ARDS (n = 8) or DIC (n = 6). PTX was given intravenously at a dose of 300 mg/day for 7 days. Mean serum levels of TNF significantly decreased in response to PTX therapy, and they returned to normal range in 5/14 patients. These preliminary data would suggest that PTX may be considered as a biological response modifier, capable of inhibiting TNF secretion in humans, with a following potential use in the treatment of cancer-related severe complications.
