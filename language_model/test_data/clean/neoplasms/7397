A recent nationwide cancer survey provided data for an analysis of future cancer mortality in the People's Republic of China. Aging of the population is projected to increase annual cancer mortality from 691,000 deaths in 1975 to 1,169,000 in the year 2000, a rise of 69 percent. Approximately 20,000 more patients will die of cancer each year during this period, placing substantial burdens on limited medical and economic resources in China. Carcinogenesis research and cancer prevention programs are examined as appropriate strategies for cancer control in this populous nation.
