Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique that is a powerful and versatile research tool and an important adjunct to tumor diagnosis and prognosis. Akin to the recent role of immunohistochemistry, research and clinical applications of FISH in cytopathology have been growing enormously over the last few years. Furthermore, due to its feasibility for virtually all types of cytologic specimens, a new and exciting era in both investigative and clinical cytopathology is expected.
