Anorexia and cachexia frequently complicate the late stages of malignancy and may be a prominent feature of early disease. The resulting weight loss often becomes a major focus of concern for the patient and the family and may significantly add to the morbidity and mortality of cancer. Factors which contribute to the wasting syndrome include the effects of the tumour, effects of chemotherapy, abnormalities of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism and the cytokine response. Administration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is an important method of addressing malnutrition, particularly in patients with nonfunctioning gastrointestinal tracts. A critical review of the TPN cancer literature is provided along with a discussion of new approaches and future directions in the nutritional support of patients with malignant disease, such as anabolic agents, hydrazine sulfate and megestrol.
