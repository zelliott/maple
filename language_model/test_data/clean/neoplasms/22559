The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, one family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK), are promising targets for the cancer therapy. Many potential inhibitors including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), reversible inhibitors and irreversible inhibitors have been developed. Some of them have been approved by the FDA or in the stage of clinical trials. This report reviews the recent progress of the structures, functions and inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases.
