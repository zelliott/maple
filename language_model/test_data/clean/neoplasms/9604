To explore job strain in Norwegian primary-treated cancer survivors compared to matched controls from the general population. The study has a cross-sectional, matched case-control design. A sample of 417 employed cancer survivors (208 females with breast cancer and 209 males with testicular or prostate cancer) who had been diagnosed 1-5 years prior to the study and were tumor-free rated themselves on the Demands-Control-Support Questionnaire (DCSQ). Their ratings were compared to those of 417 employed controls from the general population, matched with the survivors on time of investigation, gender, age and municipality of living. No differences in job strain were observed between cancer survivors and controls, or between subgroups of survivors, except that female survivors experienced more strain than males. In certain subgroups statistically significant differences on the DCSQ were found: older survivors showed higher scores on demands than their controls, female survivors reported lower control and higher strain than male survivors, and older male survivors felt higher demands than younger ones. However, the effect sizes of these differences were so small (&lt; 0.20) that they hardly were relevant for the work situation. In multivariate analyses survivorship versus control status was not significantly associated with any of the DCSQ measures. The job strain of these cancer survivors did not differ in any work relevant way from their controls, and survivorship status was not significantly associated with job strain. A longer follow-up of survivors is necessary in order to draw conclusion about the stability of these findings over time.
