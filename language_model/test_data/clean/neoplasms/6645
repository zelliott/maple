Well-characterized monoclonal antibodies directed against different intermediate filament proteins were used in the typing of tumor cells in 30 fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy specimens received for routine cytologic examination to assess the value of intermediate filament typing in FNA cytology. Tumors from sites that included liver, large bowel, pancreas, breast, skin, thyroid, thigh and kidney were examined with monoclonal antibodies specific for either all keratins or keratin subsets, vimentin, desmin or specific neurofilament polypeptides. Intermediate filament typing helped to confirm, revise or refine the diagnoses made by light microscopy and provided information of value in the classification of tumors of uncertain origin.
