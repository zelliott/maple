The in vitro activity of paldimycin, a novel antimicrobial agent, was compared with that of vancomycin against 306 gram-positive isolates (representing 12 bacterial species) obtained from patients with cancer. Paldimycin had lower MICs for 90% of isolates than vancomycin did against most isolates tested. Its activity, however, was medium and pH dependent, being greatest in Nutrient broth at a pH of 6.8.
