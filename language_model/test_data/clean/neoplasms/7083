Erythropoietin corrects and prevents anemia and decreases the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions; its impact on quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy is not clear.

399 patients with solid tumors and Hb level of &lt; or = 12 g/dl receiving chemotherapy were randomized to receive or not 10,000 IU epoetin-alpha thrice weekly. QOL was measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) scale and various subscales at baseline, at two months and at the end of the study.

Changes in the average QOL scores were similar in the two groups. The improvement in Hb levels was significantly higher for the epoetin-alpha group, with a decrease in transfusion requirements compared to the control group.

Epoetin-alpha does not improve QOL of patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy as assessed using FACT-An scale and various subscales, despite improving Hb levels and reducing transfusion requirements.
