This article describes a partnership model used to establish the Center for Cancer Nursing Education and Research at the University of Louisville (U of L) School of Nursing. The model was used to bring together area nursing education programs, institutions providing cancer nursing care, and related community groups. The need for the project was directly related to the high cancer morbidity and mortality in the community. The U of L's strategic agenda and strong commitment to cancer prevention and care provided a growth opportunity for the recognition of nurses' role in cancer care. Nurses are positioned to influence cancer care across the continuum from prevention to end of life, and building the capacity for cancer nursing is essential to building a system of cancer care. This article describes an innovative partnership model used to stimulate a community-wide focus on cancer nursing. The organizational structure, development of partner relationships, description of project activities, and outcomes are presented along with a discussion of the said model's benefits and potential for replication.
