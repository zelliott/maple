Pediatric solid tumors represent a distinct set of malignancies of embryonal origin whose incidence peaks in the first years of life. Specific genetic anomalies with pathogenic significance, which have helped to define the diagnosis better and to improve the prognosis of children with these tumors, recently have been discovered. Survival of children with solid tumors also has improved significantly because of effective multidisciplinary care, which, in this case, always involves chemotherapy and surgery. These favorable results require that children with these diseases are referred and treated at institutions that have multidisciplinary teams and the infrastructure and expertise for caring for these children. Diagnostic and therapeutic principles for the most common childhood solid tumors are discussed in this article, with an emphasis on surgical procedures.
