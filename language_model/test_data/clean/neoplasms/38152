A novel tissue-specific shRNA delivery system has been developed using cre-lox technology. Conditionally silenced pSico vector containing oligonucleotides of CD44shRNA and tissue-specific promoter-driven Cre-recombinase expression vector are packaged into transferrin-coated nanoparticles that can deliver shRNA into specific tumors. This system has strong potential in cancer therapy.
