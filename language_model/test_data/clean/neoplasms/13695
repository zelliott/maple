Stress is a term that has become synonymous with modern life. This review aims to appraise the evidence linking stress with disease with particular reference to the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the Western World, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and depression. Changes in immune parameters in stressful situations were reviewed as a possible pathophysiological mechanism for such effects.

A Medline search was carried out for the period 1996-2000 to identify recent findings in this field using the terms "stress", "disease", "immune system". Relevant references that were found in all identified publications were also followed up.

There is evidence to link stress with the onset of major depression and with a poorer prognosis in cardiovascular disease and cancer. Few small studies suggest that stress management strategies may help to improve survival. Chronic stress appears to result in suppression of the immune response, whereas immune activation and suppression have been associated with acute stress. Inflammatory cytokines, soluble mediators of the immune response, can result in symptoms of depression.

Further prospective epidemiologically based studies are needed to clarify the role of stress on disease onset, course, and prognosis. Stress management strategies, aimed at prolonging survival in patients with cardiovascular disease, cancer, and possibly other chronic illnesses, are an exciting area of further research. Immune system changes may account for the relationship between stress and disease. We propose the "stress, cytokine, depression" model as a biological pathway to explain the link between stressful life events and depression.
