The purpose of this study was to examine the predictors of treatment decision evaluation in patients with cancer.

A convenience sample of 199 patients with cancer at a Turkish university hospital completed a structured questionnaire including demographic characteristics and the treatment decision evaluation for patients with cancer in 2006. In analysis of the data, descriptive statistics, and multiple regression analysis were used.

The mean scores of the treatment decision evaluation's subscales showed that the patient were uncertain about their satisfaction with the treatment decision. The mean score of the symptom inventory suggested that the patients had moderate-level symptoms. Education level, marital status, and the severity symptoms of the independent variables were effective predictors of the treatment decision evaluation. Together the independent variables explained 18.7% of the variance of the satisfaction-uncertainty dimension, 9.1% of the variance of the informed choice dimension, and 16% of the variance of the decision control dimension. Overall the independent variables explained 8.3% of the variance of the treatment decision evaluation.

The results in this study should increase the awareness of cancer care professionals about a range of treatment decision evaluation and may help them to target particular patient groups for particular support interventions and informed treatment decision.
