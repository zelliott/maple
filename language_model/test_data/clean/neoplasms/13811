Increasing age is a major risk factor for developing cancer and the number of older people is rapidly expanding. Therefore, cancer in the geriatric population is becoming an emerging problem. Older patients are extremely heterogeneous. Instruments collecting information related to comorbidity and disability, (which have both been demonstrated to affect the survival of elderly patients) may help treatment decision. The G.I.O.Ger (Gruppo Italiano di Oncologia Geriatrica) has validated a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) scale for geriatric cancer patients, and we recommend its use in clinical practice. Our findings suggest that cancer adversely affects physical performance and psychological status less than other comorbidities. Many aspects of physical limitations are not totally recognised by performance status, in particular those aspects of daily life that require instrumental activities and that may affect adherence to diagnostic or therapeutic protocols. Quality of life as a main objective in the management of elderly cancer patients is now recognized by many clinicians. In clinical practice. quality of life means maintenance of function and symptom control, and quality-of-life instruments rated by the patient rather than by clinicians should be preferred. Whether it is preferable to use cancer-specific or generic instruments is an ongoing debate.
