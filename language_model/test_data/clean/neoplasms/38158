The purpose of these guidelines is to offer to the nuclear medicine team a framework that could prove helpful in daily practice. These guidelines contain information related to the indications, acquisition, processing and interpretation of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) in paediatric oncology. The Oncology Committee of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) has published excellent procedure guidelines on tumour imaging with (18)F-FDG PET (Bombardieri et al., Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 30:BP115-24, 2003). These guidelines, published by the EANM Paediatric Committee, do not intend to compete with the existing guidelines, but rather aim at providing additional information on issues particularly relevant to PET imaging of children with cancer.

The guidelines summarize the views of the Paediatric Committee of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine. They should be taken in the context of "good practice" of nuclear medicine and of any national rules, which may apply to nuclear medicine examinations. The recommendations of these guidelines cannot be applied to all patients in all practice settings. The guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper procedures or exclusive of other procedures reasonably directed to obtaining the same results.
