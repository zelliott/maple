Blood lymphocytes of cancer patients lysed autologous, freshly isolated tumor cells. The autologous tumor-killing (ATK) activity is strongly associated with postoperative clinical course, indicating that ATK is a meaningful prognostic indicator and provides evidence for immunological control of tumor growth and metastasis. Large granular lymphocytes (LGL) with ATK activity released a soluble cytotoxic factor(s), termed LGL-CF (LGL-derived cytotoxic factor) during interaction with autologous tumor cells. The cytotoxic factor lysed autologous and allogeneic freshly isolated human tumor cells, while they were resistant to any of recombinant cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), lymphotoxin (LT), interferon (IFN) alpha, IFN gamma, interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and IL-2. Biological activity of LGL-CF was not abrogated by monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against these cytokines. LGL-CF also exhibited lysis of a variety of tumor cell lines, but not of nonmalignant cells. Actinomycin D augmented the lysis of LGL-CF. LGL-CF was stable at 56 degrees C, but was destroyed at 100 degrees C. Treatment of LGL-CF with trypsin or proteinase K reduced or abrogated the lytic effect, respectively, while it was resistant to papain, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. These results indicate that LGL produce a novel cytotoxic factor in response to autologous tumor cells that mediates lysis of fresh human tumor cells.
