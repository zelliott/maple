The main functions of luteinizing hormone (LH) are concerned with regulation of gonadal function, and these functions are today well delineated through previous physiological studies. However, novel information of less well-known aspects of actions of this hormone is currently emerging from studies on genetically modified mouse models, with either enhanced or suppressed LH/LH receptor (LHR) function. The novel functions of LH include its role, in specific situations, as promoter of formation and growth of gonadal and extragonadal tumors. Chronically elevated LH levels in transgenic (TG) mice can also induce responses to this hormone in extragonadal tissues. The knockout (KO) mouse for the LHR has elucidated various less well-known details in the function of LH during ontogeny and adult life. Finally, studies on LHR promoter function have revealed that the expression of this gene occurs in age, sex and tissues-specific fashion. The purpose of this brief review is to summarize some of our recent findings upon studies of TG and KO mice with altered function of LH or its receptor.
