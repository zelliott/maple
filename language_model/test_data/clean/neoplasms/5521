Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively new protocol for cancer treatment which has recently been approved for limited clinical use. Traditionally, the success of treatment with PDT has been compared on the basis of total light delivery. Using the mathematical model of Henning et al. (Radiat. Res. 142, 221-226, 1995), we have determined that when oxygen is not depleted from the tissue, the concentration of singlet oxygen that is generated is directly proportional to the product of the light fluence rate (phi) and the concentration of the photosensitizer (Cs). Therefore, phiCs is an appropriate parameter for comparing the potential success of PDT protocols under these conditions. For a treatment of time t, the observed photodynamic effect resulting from singlet oxygen exposure should be directly related to phiCst. For high phiCs, the model predicts that oxygen depletion occurs within the tumor tissue. As a result, the photodynamic effect is no longer proportional to phiCst. We have expanded the model of Henning et al. to include the changes in oxygen concentration which occur within the capillary as blood flows through the tissue. Our new predictions with the mathematical model for optimal PDT treatment conditions are significantly different from those predicted by the previous models. Predictions of the model are given using parameters relevant for treatment of solid tumors with Photofrin.
