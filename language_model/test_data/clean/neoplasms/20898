Tumor-induced osteolysis or lytic bone disease is mediated by osteoclast activation. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption by reducing osteoclastic activity.

Bisphosphonates were shown to be effective in treating cancer-related hypercalcemia. Recent large randomized clinical trials have shown the efficacy of bisphosphonates in reducing bone pain, pathological fractures and spinal cord compression for patients with multiple myeloma and breast cancer metastatic to bone. The potential survival benefit from pamidronate in patients with advanced myeloma warrants further study.

Future clinical trials will use more potent bisphosphonates (zoledronate, ibandronate) with the ultimate goal of trying to prevent bone metastases.
