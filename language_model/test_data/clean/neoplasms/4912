Intense research over the past 15 years has demonstrated Eph receptors and their cell surface ephrin ligands to be one of the most prevalent and complex cell-cell communication systems; this system guides cell positioning and orchestrates tissue patterning in multicellular organisms by coordinating synchronised cell-cell adhesion or segregation of interacting cells. The expression of many Eph and ephrin family members together with their embryonic patterning functions often re-emerge during oncogenesis and have generated considerable interest as targets for anticancer therapies. The first generation of monoclonal antibodies, kinase inhibitors, and vaccines suggests considerable promise in preclinical and early clinical development, but there is little doubt that successful clinical use will rely on a comprehensive understanding of the complex and sometimes puzzling activities of Eph receptors during tumor progression.
