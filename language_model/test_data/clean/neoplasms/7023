O-[(18)F]Fluoromethyl-D-tyrosine (D-[(18)F]FMT) has been reported as a potential tumor-detecting agent for positron emission tomography (PET). However, the reason why D-[(18)F]FMT is better than L-[(18)F]FMT is unclear. To clarify this point, we examined the mechanism of their transport and their suitability for tumor detection. The stereo-selective uptake and release of enantiomerically pure D- and L-[(18)F]FMT by rat C6 glioma cells and human cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cells were examined. The results of a competitive inhibition study using various amino acids and a selective inhibitor for transport system L suggested that D-[(18)F]FMT, as well as L-[(18)F]FMT, was transported via system L, the large neutral amino acid transporter, possibly via LAT1. The in vivo distribution of both [(18)F]FMT and [(18)F]FDG in tumor-bearing mice and rats was imaged with a high-resolution small-animal PET system. In vivo PET imaging of D-[(18)F]FMT in mouse xenograft and rat allograft tumor models showed high contrast with a low background, especially in the abdominal and brain region. The results of our in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that L-[(18)F]FMT and D-[(18)F]FMT are specifically taken up by tumor cells via system L. D-[(18)F]FMT, however, provides a better tumor-to-background contrast with a tumor/background (contralateral region) ratio of 2.741 vs. 1.878 with the L-isomer, whose difference appears to be caused by a difference in the influence of extracellular amino acids on the uptake and excretion of these two isomers in various organs. Therefore, D-[(18)F]FMT would be a more powerful tool as a tumor-detecting agent for PET, especially for the imaging of a brain cancer and an abdominal cancer.
