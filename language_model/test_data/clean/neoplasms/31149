For the end-stage cancer patient to live at home with his or her quality of life (QOL) sustained, Home Helper Services are considered effective. In fact, however, many do not avail themselves of such services. Since the disease situation is apt to change dramatically, it is difficult to predict the length of time of care at home, and the patient's family does not tend to utilize such services unless the patient is completely bedridden. Short-term use or the difficulty or rapid response of such services has been among the reasons given of this. Given this background, there appears to be a need for suitable assessment in dealing quickly with possible disabilities which might occur and a number of occupations. Also, when considering home medical care for the cancer patient, an administrative system capable of a rapid response when problems of this kind occur is indispensable. Working on the administration to fulfill this need is also the task of the professionals in this field.
