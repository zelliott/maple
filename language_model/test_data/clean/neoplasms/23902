In 1983, 27 areas of ecological hazard were recognized in Poland. The situation was especially bad in the south of Poland, in the region of Katowice and Cracow. In this paper the synergistic effects of various air pollutants on the residents' health were analysed. Results show that, besides the threat to future generations, pollution reduces somatic strength and mental ability by diminishing biological energy formation.
