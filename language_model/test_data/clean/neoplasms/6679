In the early stage of internal malignancies, it is important to detect the relation between the malignancy and accompanying skin lesions. Skin lesions are commonly classified according to their origin as follows; skin lesions induced by internal malignancies, skin lesions as a part of a syndrome, nonspecific lesions and complications of internal malignancies, but with an unknown relationship so-called Bowen's disease, and Paget's disease. These skin lesions consist of various kinds and are multiple. Commonly, the disease which is detected seems to be an immunological reaction to internal malignancy; malignant acathosis nigricans, and dermatomyositis are examples in point. A description of internal malignancies and skin lesions is presented, including those which are most commonly encountered together with a description of such cases experienced at the National Cancer Center Hospital.
