Groups of 60 Wistar rats of each sex were fed diets containing 3, 6 or 12% of the margarine emulsifier TOSOM (thermally oxidized soybean oil interacted with mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids) for 2.5 yr. In addition, three groups of 60 rats of each sex were fed two products of the release agent TOS (thermally oxidized soybean oil) in dietary levels of 1.2% TOS(G) (TOS from Grindsted Product A/S, Denmark) and 0.3 and 1.2% TOS(N) (TOS from Nexus Aps, Denmark), respectively for 2.5 yr. 120 rats of each sex fed a diet containing mono- and diglycerides served as controls. The diets given to all groups were isocaloric. Clinical appearance, food consumption, body weight and weight gain, survival, haematology, and clinical chemistry parameters were examined. Gross and histopathological examinations, including neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions, were performed on all groups. Time to occurrence of tumours was recorded. No substance-related effect, including carcinogenicity, was found.
