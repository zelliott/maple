Endostatin has been demonstrated to represent a promising novel medicine to treat malignant tumors, and it may be more effective when combined with conventional treatment. Meanwhile, a promising area of research in radiation oncology is the integration of molecular targeting agents to improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy (RT) in the control of primary tumor. Antiangiogenic agents are one such class of targeted therapies and have shown promise in both laboratory and clinical experiments. Endostatin in combination with RT has feasibility; but it also has lots of problems. Further understanding of the mechanisms is needed.
