Dolasetron mesylate (MDL 73,147, Anzemet, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Kansas City, MO) is a 5-HT ( 3 ) receptor antagonist undergoing clinical evaluation as an antiemetic agent. Dolasetron is rapidly metabolized to form hydrodolasetron (MDL 74,156). The pharmacokinetics of hydrodolasetron were studied after administration of a single intravenous infusion of 0.6 mg/kg (group I) or 1.8 mg/kg (group II) in 21 cancer patients participating in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter trial of the drug in patients receiving their first course of high-dose (&gt;/=75 mg/m ( 2 ) ) cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. The intent of this study was to obtain preliminary data on the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite, hydrodolasetron, in cancer patients. The reduced metabolite, hydrodolasetron, was formed rapidly with peak plasma concentrations (group I, mean = 128.6 ng/mL; group II, mean = 505.3 ng/mL) occurring at or shortly after the end of the infusion. Plasma concentrations of hydrodolasetron remained quantifiable for up to 24 hours. Increases in peak plasma concentrations and AUC of hydrodolasetron were proportional to dose, suggesting linear pharmacokinetics over this dose range. Apparent clearance, apparent volume of distribution, elimination rate, and terminal elimination half-life of the reduced metabolite were similar at both doses. The results support a pharmacokinetic basis for the prolonged duration of antiemetic efficacy after a single intravenous dose.
