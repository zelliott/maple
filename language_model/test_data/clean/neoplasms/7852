The possibilities and limitations in cancer prevention are shown by means of some examples and historical facts. A necessary prerequisite for effective prevention is to know the exact cause of cancer. This is known for some tumor types (e.g., bronchial cancer), while for others it is hardly known (e.g., breast cancer). There are many factors which influence the whole process of carcinogenesis. Exposure to environmental pollutants in a wide sense represents only one of many possible etiologies. This has to be taken into consideration.
