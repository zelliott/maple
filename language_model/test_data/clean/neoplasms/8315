Treatment with cytostatic agents is associated with both acute side effects such as nausea, emesis, blood count changes, and allergic reactions, and late complications such as cardiac, renal or gastrointestinal toxicity. In addition to differences in substance groups, intra-individual variations on the part of patients, and their general and nutritional status, are of particular importance for the severity of such side effects. For improved treatment monitoring, side effects should be recorded and documented in accordance with common toxicity criteria. In view of the complexity of oncological treatment, including the optimal supporting measures, such treatments should remain in the hands of oncological specialists.
