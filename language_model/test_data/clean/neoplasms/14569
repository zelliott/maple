Survival is an objective criteria, reliable, easy to measure and easy to analyse. But this criteria, the most important in almost all therapeutic trials, is a very rough one and not all fitted to many questions raised in cancer treatment decision making. We suggest a new criteria, combining quality and quantity of survival, which is equivalent in years of survival at a maximal quality level to the time of survival at a varying level of a cancer patient. This criteria could be usefull in the majority of "palliative" clinical trials (advanced cancers, recurrences, metastatic evolution...).
