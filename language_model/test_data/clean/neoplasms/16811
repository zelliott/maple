Serum levels of the protein factor of fertility (PFF) were measured by immunoenzymatic assay with a sensitivity of 4 ng/ml. The normal concentration of PFF was within 8-20 ng/ml in males and 20-40 ng/ml in females. Elevated levels of PFF--from 50 to 400 ng/ml--were found in patients with ovarian tumors (19%), cancer of the uterine body (25%) and tumors of the uterine cervix (37%).
