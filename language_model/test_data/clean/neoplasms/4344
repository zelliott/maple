To describe the feelings and concerns of family members with hereditary cancer syndrome (HCS) and their level of participation in prevention and early detection activities.

Qualitative methods; content analysis of interviews.

Community, hospital-based cancer screening center with a special program of supportive services for families with HCS.

Purposeful theoretical sampling produced a sample (n = 13) of people with HCS. Most were Caucasian women representing a variety of types of HCS.

In-depth, unstructured, audiotaped interviews that lasted about 60 minutes.

Five themes emerged: (a) issues regarding communication with health professionals, (b) relationships with family members, (c) financial concerns, (d) psychosocial concerns, and (e) participation in screening activities.

Individuals from families with HCS live with the knowledge that they have a high risk of developing malignancy. A true understanding of this risk may take time to comprehend. Many members of families with HCS require more education and support regarding cancer screening and prevention activities.

Nursing roles include being an educator on risk and early detection measures, a patient advocate, and a resource to all members of the family with HCS. Future nursing research can help identify specific psychosocial needs among different family members and specific psychosocial needs associated with different types of HCS.
