Following reports of its teratogenicity, thalidomide was banned from the market in the 1960s. Later, the elucidation that the inhibition of angiogenesis underlies this teratogenicity and the recognition of the importance of angiogenesis in malignancies has raised interest in thalidomide as an anti-tumour agent. Since then, numerous other mechanisms accounting for the anti-tumour effect of thalidomide have been revealed and many studies exploring the efficacy of thalidomide in tumours have been initiated. This Review focuses on the application of thalidomide and its derivatives in solid tumours, the mechanisms underlying their anti-tumour effects, and their potential to be applied in combination with other anti-tumour agents.
