Here we describe the isolation of C33/CD82/KAI1 in a screen for apoptosis-inducing genes. C33 is a gene that is downregulated in many metastatic tumor cells and the expression of which can attenuate the process of metastases formation in a variety of tumors. In accordance, we observed cell death induction by C33 in many different cell types. C33 seems to promote cell death by the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). These ROIs, however, are not derived from the mitochondrial respiratory chain as in most other scenarios leading to apoptosis. We observed that C33 renders cells sensitive to ROIs by causing the specific release of the intracellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) from cells. Moreover, C33 activates the GTPase Cdc42, which mediates GSH release and apoptosis induction and allows to detect the formation of ROIs.
