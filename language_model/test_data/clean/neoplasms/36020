The "wellness picnic," an interactive hands-on learning activity, was developed to engage people in reflective conversations about their health behaviors and wellness journey. Participants used pictures, colors, and words to transform a paper plate into a symbolic representation of what wellness looked like to them. Within the wisdom of each participant's paper plate drawing, there emerged pathways for living well, creating a respectful place for sharing wellness understandings and cancer risk reduction activities.
