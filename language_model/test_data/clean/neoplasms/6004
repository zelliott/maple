During the period 1988-1992, a total of 4,030 malignant neoplasms were recorded in Kingston and St. Andrew, Jamaica. These comprised 1,829 in males and 2,201 in females. Histological confirmation was obtained in 83.4%. The crude incidence rate for males was 128.5, and 136.2 for females. The age-standardized rates (ASR) were 179.9 for males and 166.1 for females. Age-specific rates by site, sex and age are tabulated. Attention is drawn to increased incidence for cancers of prostate, larynx, bronchus and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in males. There was also an increase in female breast cancer (crude rate 36.0; ASR 47.1). Invasive cervix cancer has shown no significant change in incidence. Neoplasms of the body of the uterus have increased (crude rate 7.6; ASR 9.5). The rise in cancer of breast and body of uterus suggests that the influence of exogenous oestrogens should be considered.
