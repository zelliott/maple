Cancer therapies have led to remarkable results due to improved toxicity profiles and effects on survival. While these medical, surgical, and radiation protocols are chiefly responsible for these noteworthy contributions, an unexpected constellation of toxicities has emerged. Most notably, dermatologic adverse events have gained considerable attention, due to their high frequency, visibility, and impact on physical and psychosocial health, all of which affect dose intensity and possibly clinical outcome. Consequently, increased attention to cutaneous health in oncology has resulted in supportive oncodermatology clinical programs and toxicity-driven investigations, aiming to mitigate these untoward events and permit the continued optimization of cancer treatments.
