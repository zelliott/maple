Dr. Houtsmuller, a retired internist, introduced an anticancer diet ten years ago. He claimed to have cured himself from metastatic melanoma by following a diet consisting of healthy nutrients, large amounts of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and shark cartilage powder in combination with psychological support. The efficacy of the therapy was never described in a scientific article. Currently about 63% of all cancer patients in the Netherlands using a diet use the Houtsmuller diet. The national cancer fund (Koningin Wilhelmina Fonds) invited him to speak at their 50-year commemorative symposium. Shortly before he admitted that his medical history did not mention metastatic melanoma. Dr. Houtsmuller has seriously damaged the position of physicians in the Netherlands by addressing patients directly without first seeking support from his scientific medical peers. Cancer organizations such as Koningin Wilhelmina Fonds are urged to properly inform the public about the real value or lack of value of alternative treatments in general and of alternative diets in particular.
