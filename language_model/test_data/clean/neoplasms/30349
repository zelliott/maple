Structural modification of one of our earlier reported lead molecule (ABNM13) has been carried out to study the effect of different substituents at the Nâ€³-position of N-hydroxy-N'-amino guanidines (HAGs) on their anticancer activity. Compounds with electron donating substituents were found to be less active. In contrast, those with electron withdrawing groups were found favorable for anticancer activity. The obtained results provide significant SAR information that may be useful for further drug designing with HAGs.
