TEL/ETV6 is the frequent target of translocations associated with lymphoid and myeloid leukemias and solid tumors. We show that TEL induces aggregation of immortalized and transformed fibroblasts, endothelial cells and astrocytes. These aggregates form cellular cords in NIH3T3-UCLA by a cell autonomous process, which occurs when the monolayer is made up of over 75% of cells expressing exogenous TEL. Cords with a diameter of 15-25 microm contain a lumen and occur as tube structures. The possible relevance for vasculogenic mimicry is discussed. By contrast TEL did not induce aggregation of regular NIH3T3 cells, an effect that could only be induced by co-expression of oncogenic RAS/Lys12. Also transduction of TEL and RAS retroviral vectors into the endothelial MS1 cell line and TEL alone in the highly transformed glioblastoma cell lines EH-A and EH-B resulted in extensive aggregation. Thus, the induction of cellular aggregation by TEL correlates with transformation.
