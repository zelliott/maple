Vitespen is a heat shock protein (gp96)-peptide complex purified from resected autologous tumors, developed as a means of capturing the antigenic 'fingerprint' of a specific cancer for use as a patient-specific vaccine. Vitespen has been extensively assessed in animal models, and clinically in a range of cancers, including Phase I and II trials in colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, lung cancer, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, and two Phase III studies in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Vitespen has shown itself capable of inducing major histocompatibility class I-restricted immune responses in a range of tumor types, and clinical responses in patients with earlier-stage disease, in line with previously published data on cancer vaccines. Vitespen is almost devoid of side effects aside from minor injection-site reactions.
