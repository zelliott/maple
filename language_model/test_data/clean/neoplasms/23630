The organization of the Southern Buenos Aires Tumor Registry is reported. It was accomplished with the effort and cooperation of the Argentine Association for Cancer Education and Prevention, the Bah√≠a Blanca Regional Basic and Applied Investigation Center and the local branch of the Argentine League Against Cancer (LALCEC). During 1989 and 1990; 1287 new cancer cases were registered: 498 and 789 respectively. This increase is due to the number of Hospitals and Clinics that have joined the Registry during the second year. Data from the two years, excluding non melanoma skin cancers and carcinomas in situ, and taking into account both sexes, show that the highest frequency was for cancer of the breast (19.2%), followed by cancers of the colon and rectum (15.6%), lung (8.3%), stomach (5.4%) and cervix (5.0%). The most frequent cancer for women was breast cancer (36.2%), followed by colon and rectum (14.0%), cervix (9.5%), corpus (5.7%) and stomach (3.0%). For males the figures were 17.4% for cancers from the colon and rectum, 15.5% for cancer of the lung, 8.0% for stomach cancer, 7.8% for bladder cancer and 7.3% for prostatic cancer. The impact of breast, colon and rectum and lung cancer could promote a change of attitude regarding preventive actions increasing the use of mammograms, recommending no smoking and diet education campaigns as have been carried out in other countries.
