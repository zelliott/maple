Xanthate derivatives were shown previously to display antitumor activity against transformed fibroblasts and lymphoma cells in combination with monocarboxylic acids [1]. Various malignant cell lines of human origin were treated in vitro to explore the range of antitumoral activity of the compounds. The combination of tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate (D 609) with undecanoic acid (C11) exerted dose dependent cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects on cell lines both from solid tumors (glioblastomas, colon-carcinomas) and hematological diseases (lymphomas, CML/BC). Additionally, the combination of D 609/C11 was able to kill both methotrexate- and adriamycin-resistant L 1210 and S 180 cells, indicating that there is no cross-resistance for these drugs and D 609/C11 in vitro.
