Quebec's Oncology Nurse Navigators (or "IPOs" after their French acronym) have been integrated in the entire Montérégie health care region. They have been agents of change mandated with implementing a philosophy of care that centres on the patients and their families, and is delivered by oncology teams. The goal of this second article is to describe the role of IPOs in practice, the problems encountered in the various contexts and the solutions brought forward to facilitate their integration. The training of IPOs, the support they receive from administrators, the deployment of interdisciplinary teams dedicated to oncology, the holding of regular structured interdisciplinary meetings and the training of professionals, and development of standardized work instruments are discussed. The observed impacts of introducing IPOs will also be examined.
