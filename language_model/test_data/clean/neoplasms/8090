There is no comprehensive study that compares the different usage strategies of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in platinum-induced anemia. In order to clarify this issue, we conducted a prospective clinical study.

Seventy-seven patients were studied in three main groups. Group 1 (n = 17) consisted of cancer patients without anemia. These patients received rHuEPO starting from the first chemotherapy cycle. Group 2 (n = 26) consisted of patients whose hemoglobin (Hb) values decreased by at least 1 g/dL after the first cycle of chemotherapy. Group 3 (n = 34) consisted of patients whose Hb values dropped below 10.5 g/dL after the second chemotherapy cycle. Groups 2 and 3 were each divided into two subgroups. In groups 1, 2A and 3A rHuEPO (5000 U/day subcutaneously three times a week) treatment was continued until three weeks after the completion of chemotherapy. In groups 2B and 3B, rHuEPO was given for 12 weeks only.

There were no prominent differences between the Hb values of these groups throughout the chemotherapy cycles. Transfusion rates and the number of patients who became anemic were also not different between groups.

No rHuEPO usage strategies are superior to others in terms of Hb levels and transfusion requirements. The decision as to when rHuEPO is to be added to platinum-containing therapy should be tailored to the health conditions of individual patients.
