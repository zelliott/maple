Grief is a normal and highly personal reaction to loss. Bereavement care (individual and/or group) can assist family members and friends in coping with their feelings of grief, thereby reducing the possibility of complicated grief reactions. The families and significant others of patients who have died in settings other than a hospice do not automatically have the opportunity for bereavement follow-up.

An eight-session psychoeducational group that provided psychosocial support and information aimed at assisting in the bereavement process was initiated at an outpatient cancer center. It was led by a family therapist who was a member of a psychosocial services team. Family members and friends of recently deceased patients were invited to participate by letter and phone call.

Seven people participated in at least one group session. Participants were asked to complete a face-valid follow-up questionnaire three months after completion of the group.

Group members found the group experience beneficial, especially regarding the opportunity to talk with others who had experienced similar losses, learning about the reactions one would expect in the grieving process, and developing new strategies to deal with the grief associated with the loss.
