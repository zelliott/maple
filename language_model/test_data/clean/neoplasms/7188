In a discussion of the management of galactorrhea in oral contraceptive (OC) users, focus is on the following: evaluation of the significance of the galactorrhea; whether to allow continuation of OC use; and how common is galactorrhea among OC users.  The presence of galactorrhea in a patient 12 months following weaning, or in a patient who has never been pregnant, indicates that there has been excessive stimulation of the breast by the hormone prolactin.  During pregnancy the mechanism for the rising prolactin level is estrogen inhibition of the inhibitory factor in the brain that prevents prolactin secretion.  As estrogen levels rise, prolactin levels rise--both hormones acting to prepare the breast for breastfeeding.  Full breast milk production is prevented during pregnancy because estrogen is simultaneously stimulating prolactin secretion and blocking prolactin's action on the breast.  The belief is that estrogen either interferes with or reduces the number of prolactin receptors on the breast.  The estrogen in the OC can function similarly.  The diagnostic problem when breast secretions are encountered in OC users is whether the patients have a pituitary adenoma.  When this situation is encountered, there are 2 alternatives: the OC may be discontinued and the patient followed closely, for if breast secretions are because of the OC they should disappear in 3-6 months; and if the patient does not desire to discontinue the OC, evaluation for prolactin secreting tumor must be performed.  To rule out pituitary adenoma a serum prolactin level an a coned-down view of the sella turcica are all that are necessary.  At this timr there is no contraindication to administering OCs to those with breast secretions or elevated prolactins.
