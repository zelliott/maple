Euthanasia is clinical practice in several countries world-wide. Cancer patients' attitude in this field was focused through a review of case reports and questionnaire-based studies on Medline (1992-97). A total of nine publications including 459 cancer patients from USA, Canada and Holland were found. The majority of patients had poor performance status and advanced disease. At least one third reported themselves positive to euthanasia. Patients below 50 years of age, having superior performance status and not considering themselves religious, more frequently supported euthanasia. Psychological factors seem to be more significant than physical factors for support of euthanasia. Loss of control, being a burden on one's family and loss of dignity are the psychological factors most frequently reported. A "help to live" approach aimed at avoiding patient requests for help to die will mean that health care workers must allocate more of their time to these patients. Overcrowded hospitals with several patients in corridors and lack of nursing-homebeds do not make this situation easier to handle.
