The sequence specificity of the antisense technique makes it an attractive basis for novel molecular therapeutics. Inhibition of gene expression by antisense in cell culture models has provided a strong rationale for identification and validation of disease targets. Analogues modified from normal phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides have entered clinical trials of diseases including AIDS, cancer, and inflammation. It is becoming increasingly apparent that these drugs act by means of a complex mechanism of action, and some of their effects can be sequence independent. Nevertheless, these oligodeoxynucleotides offer considerable promise as novel molecular drugs. Harnessing the therapeutic potential of this powerful technique depends on elucidation of the complex mechanism of action so that effective and meaningful therapeutic modalities can be realized.
