The morphologic and biochemical characterization of cytocontractile and cytoskeletal elements in a given cell or tissue appears more and more as a useful tool in the study of differentiation phenomena, the origin of various human tumors (including metastases), and the degree of cellular adaptation during physiologic and pathologic processes. Thus, the biologic features of cytocontractile and cytoskeletal elements may be of practical interest to the pathologist and may furnish important information concerning basic cell responses during disease processes.
