To evaluate the percentage and risk factors of thyroid dysfunction in 79 children who underwent bone marrow transplantation in a single centre.

The mean age of the cohort was 6.8 and mean follow-up 5.5 years. The 79 patients were divided in two groups according to the pretransplant conditioning regimen: fractionated total body irradiation (TBI)(N=54), chemotherapy with Busulphan (N=25). Thyroid function was evaluated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) tests. Overt hypothyroidism was defined by low fT4 blood levels and TSH &gt; 4 mU/l, and compensated hypothyroidism by normal fT4 index and TSH &gt;4 mU/L.

The six-year probability of hypothyroidism was 36 +/-6% for the whole group of 79 patients, 49 +/-8% after TBI and 9 +/-6% in the Busulphan group (P &lt;0.001). Neither gender, nor primary disease, nor presence of graft versus host disease were found to be statistically significant for occurrence of hypothyroidism in the TBI group. However, a younger age seemed to influence statistically the 6-year probability of hypothyroidism in the TBI group: 59 +/-9% if age &lt;7.7 years versus 34 +/-13% if age &gt;7.7 years (P =0.02).

A careful follow-up of thyroid function is recommended even without TBI conditioning regimen. Young age as a potential risk factor of hypothyroidism has never been described and needs to be studied in a larger cohort.
