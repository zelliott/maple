Thrombotic complications are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Studies in Caucasian populations have shown that up to one-third of such patients test positive to antiphospholipid antibodies. Our aim was to determine the prevalence and serotypes of antiphospholipid antibodies in an unselected group of Asian cancer patients with thrombosis. All patients with cancer-related thrombosis seen in the Department of Hematology-Oncology and Radiation Oncology were enrolled in this study. The study period was from April 2000 to May 2001. Antiphospholipid antibodies tests were performed, namely lupus anticoagulant screen, anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM) and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I antibodies (B2 GPI) IgG, IgM and IgA. Thirty-three patients were recruited. There were 14 males and 19 females, with an age range of 35-78 years of age. Of those enrolled, there were 25 Chinese, five Malays and three Indians. The patients had several cancer types: 11 (36.7%) patients had adenocarcinoma as the histological cell type. Of the 33 patients, 75.8% had stage IV disease. Arterial thrombosis was seen in eight patients (24.2%), and venous thrombosis occurred in 29 patients (87.9%). Antiphospholipid antibodies were positive in 60.6% of the patients, of which anti-B2GPI IgA antibody was the most prevalent antiphospholipid present (46.9%). The presence of anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I IgA antibody was associated with strokes, extensive and recurrent venous thrombosis, and coincident arterial and venous thrombosis. A high prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies (60.6%) was found in Asian patients with cancer-related thrombosis. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, particularly anti B2GPI IgA, may identify a subset of cancer patients who are at high risk of developing thrombotic complications, and further studies are warranted.
