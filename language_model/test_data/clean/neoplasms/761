Both cancer diagnosis and the consequent treatment are particularly challenging for adolescent patients. Adjuvant psychological interventions to reduce cancer-related distress are therefore a fundamental part of a multidisciplinary treatment. Assuming that psycho-oncology has to consider developmentally specific aspects, this review summarizes empirical studies of the efficacy and effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for adolescent cancer patients.

Electronic searches were conducted in four databases. Studies were included only if they were exclusively designed for adolescent cancer patients and incorporated a defined outcome measure to evaluate the effects of the implemented intervention.

Only four studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. One of those studies reported a significant improvement compared with a waitlist control group. The relevant gains were found in the overall level of distress, as well as in additional outcome variables such as knowledge of sexual issues, body image and anxiety about psychosexual issues. The remaining studies revealed no significant changes related to psychological distress and psychosocial functioning.

Taken together, the findings point out that there is a lack of intervention research in psycho-oncology with adolescents. So far, there is only limited evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to improve coping with cancer-associated problems in adolescent patients. Future research needs to be done in this population. In order to establish more conclusive results, larger samples and interventions particularly designed for adolescent patients ought to be studied.
