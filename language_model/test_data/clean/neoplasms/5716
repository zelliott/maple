Evidence from intervention trials with vitamins E and C and beta-carotene are reviewed as well as evidence from trials that have used intermediate endpoints with a special emphasis on biomarkers of cancer of the colorectum. The methodologic issues that require resolution before a second generation of clinical trials are launched to assess the efficacy of these antioxidants in the prevention of cancer are identified. Specific concerns regarding the validation of pathologic biomarkers of cancer and biochemical markers of mechanism of action for the antioxidants are discussed. Cellular proliferation indexes in the colon are used as an example of pathologic biomarkers for cancer and the measurement of plasma and tissue malondialdehyde concentrations is used as an example of problems with the development of biochemical markers of oxidative stress that can be used in prevention trials. The use of DNA oxidation products as promising biomarkers is also discussed.
