If stress and cancer are related by coping failure, that connection presumably involves the immune system. This involvement has already been shown in animals. It can be hypothesized that Type A personalities (driving, impatient, sometimes hostile) go through states of repeated frustration because of unachieved goals. From that point of view, Type A individuals are alternately able to cope and unable to cope. Such a pattern would theoretically tend toward repeated episodes of suppression and recovery of the immune system, with increased probability of growth of transformed cells. An opposing hypothesis, derived from human survival studies, suggests that a subgroup of Type B individuals (termed "Type C"--accepting, giving-up) are more likely to suffer a poor prognosis. A preliminary study relating Type A/B behavior pattern to cancer mortality was done in a cohort of 3154 men from the Western Collaborative Group Study (WCGS). The cancer mortality rate for the period 1960-1977 was 0.037 for Type A subjects (58 cancer deaths/1589 Type A subjects), and 0.025 for Type B subjects, yielding an odds ratio of 1.55. The odds ratio dropped to 1.29 (95% confidence interval = 0.84-1.96) when controlled for age, cigarette smoking, serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and education. Preliminary analysis from a follow-up to mid-1983 shows a similar association. The findings suggest that, if anything, Type A subjects are more likely to die of cancer than Type B subjects. Although the finding is not strongly suggestive of a clinically or theoretically significant association between Type A/B behavior pattern and cancer mortality, it is sufficiently interesting to warrant further investigation.
