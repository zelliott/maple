Some individuals, groups, and communities are at special risk from environmental threats. This is especially the case for low income persons, the working class, and people of color whose health may be imperiled by lead in their houses, pollution in their neighborhoods, and hazards in their workplace. Moreover, many of their children face potential health threats in the parks where they play. The environmental justice perspective unmasks the ethical and political questions of "who gets what, why, and in what amounts." An environmental and public health strategy is needed to ensure that all Americans are protected.
