Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (IFISH) is an interesting and intriguing cytogenetic approach in the study of tumor chromosomal abnormalities when metaphases are not available. This technique can be applied to different types of tumor nuclei, including imprinted nuclei (IM), nuclei obtained from conventional cytogenetic procedures (PB), frozen nuclei, paraffin-embedded nuclei (PE), and nuclei extracted from paraffin-embedded sections (EX). IFISH is a high-sensitivity approach in tumor studies that can give evidence of genetic aberrations present in a small percentage of cells that are likely to escape detection if only molecular techniques are applied. Despite its high sensitivity and versatility, IFISH is an indirect cytogenetic method and needs controls to have adequate specificity. This study includes present data obtained in IFISH experiments using different types of probes (alpha-satellite and YAC clones) hybridized on different types of normal control nuclei, such as PB, IM, EX, and PE nuclei, to define the threshold level for monosomy and trisomy of different chromosomal regions. My findings demonstrate that the cut-off values depend both on the types of probes and on the types of target nuclei. Therefore, even if IFISH is a versatile, high-sensitivity technique for detecting chromosomal abnormalities, the lack of accurate controls may result in the misdiagnosis of some abnormalities.
