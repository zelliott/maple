Cancer mortality in Texas 1969-80 was 25 per cent lower among Mexican American males compared to other Whites; among females, rates were only 4 per cent lower. Reduced mortality was primarily a result of lower rates for cancers of the most common sites: lung, colon, breast and prostate. However, for cancers of the stomach, liver, and gallbladder, Mexican Americans had higher rates than other Whites. Female Mexican Americans were also at a higher mortality risk for cervical cancer. Implications are discussed.
