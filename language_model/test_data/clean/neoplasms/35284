At our institution, a retrospective review of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in oncology patients had previously demonstrated a complication rate of 40.7%. Since then we have implemented strategies to reduce complications including staff and patient education, insertion technique modification and PICC maintenance utilizing a PICC nurse. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the recent PICC complication rate and to compare it with the previously reported findings. Prospectively collected PICC complication data and medical records from all patients with solid tumours who had PICCs inserted in 2003 were analysed. A historical cohort comparative analysis was performed using our PICC complication rate from 2000 to 2001. Eighty-eight PICC lines were inserted in 73 patients under radiological guidance. The median PICC dwell time was 44 days (1-524 days). The overall complication rate was 15.9% (14/88) or 2.0 complications per 1,000 PICC-days. Infections developed in 5.7% (5/88) and thrombotic events occurred in 4.5% (4 /88) of PICCs. The mean time to complication was 45 days. The complication rate for 2003 was significantly lower than the rate for 2001 (P = 0.006), especially of infective complications (P = 0.004). Strategies introduced to reduce PICC complications may have been the reason for this improvement.
