As survival rates for childhood cancer have increased during the past three decades, a significant population of young adult survivors has emerged. Medical late effects of particular concern to this population, including reproductive issues, osteoporosis, cardiotoxicity, hepatitis C, and second malignancies are discussed. Educational, occupational, insurance, and other significant psychosocial sequelae are addressed. Models for medical and psychosocial follow-up with this population are described, and a psycho-educational intervention model, implemented by members of the Long-Term Information, Follow-up, and Evaluation (LIFE) team at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, is presented for consideration. Future research and clinical challenges are discussed.
