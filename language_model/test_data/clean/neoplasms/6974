Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) converts nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) intermediate. Previously identified as a cytokine pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor and controversially claimed as an insulin-mimetic hormone visfatin, Nampt has recently drawn much attention in several fields, including NAD biology, metabolism and inflammation. As a NAD biosynthetic enzyme, Nampt regulates the activity of NAD-consuming enzymes such as sirtuins and influences a variety of metabolic and stress responses. Nampt also plays an important part in regulating insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. Nampt seems to have another function as an immunomodulatory cytokine and, therefore, has a role in inflammation. This review summarizes these various functional aspects of Nampt and discusses its potential roles in diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cancer.
