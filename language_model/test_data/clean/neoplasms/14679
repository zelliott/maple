The monoclonal antibodies BA16 and BA17, reacting specifically with human keratin 19 (40 kD) have been tested by immunohistochemical staining methods for their reaction with a wide range of human tumours and cultured cells. Primary adenocarcinomas and their metastases showed a homogeneously positive reaction with greater than 95% of the tumour cells staining. Non-epithelial tumours, basaliomas and squamous cell carcinomas were unstained, while benign breast lesions and a thyroid adenoma show a mosaic pattern of stained and unstained (5-40%) cells. These three staining patterns were also seen in cultured cells. Positive homogeneous staining was seen in all breast cancer cell lines examined with the exception of PMC42, which exhibits stem cell characteristics, and which showed the heterogeneous pattern of staining seen in milk cell cultures. Non-epithelial lines and strains, two cell lines from cervical carcinomas and three SV40 transformed breast epithelial lines were unstained. The antibodies BA16 and 17 are potentially useful reagents for distinguishing adenocarcinomas (and their metastases) from non-epithelial tumours and from squamous carcinomas. They may also discriminate between benign and malignant breast lesions, and identify a specific differentiation phenotype in the secretory cell lineage.
