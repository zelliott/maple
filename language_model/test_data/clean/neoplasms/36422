Recent data from a variety of countries and from the individual states in the US show that the annual cancer death rate is highly correlated with the percentage of the population aged 60 or more years. Historical data for the United States over the period 1900-1990 reveal that the percentage of its population &gt; or = 60 yrs increased with a corresponding increase in the annual cancer death rate. When the US data over this time period are viewed against the current world data and the current individual state data there is a striking similarity, thereby demonstrating that the current world and state cancer mortality values provide an accurate historical picture of the US cancer death rate over almost a century.
