Gene therapy is one of the promising treatment modalities in cancer therapy. The current gene therapy modalities are mainly focused on the introduction of suppressed tumor suppressor genes into cancer cells, modulation of anti-tumoral immune response, and the suicide gene therapy by introducing pro-drug-activating enzyme genes into the tumor cells. Currently, various gene therapy trials are being conducted in cancer patients. However, the early results of these trials conducted so far are not so encouraging. Combination of gene therapy strategies with conventional treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy has yielded encouraging results in experimental models and early clinical trials.
