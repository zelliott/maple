It is very important to relief the pain of terminally ill patients. Populalization of WHO "Cancer Pain Relief" saved many cancer pain suffered patients. The patients in hospital may get enough pain relief as soon as they suffer the pain by their medical stuffs. But It spend much more time to relieve the pain, I write prescription of regular use morphine and additional morphine. Additional dose is 1/4 of regular dose. When they suffer any pain, they may take additional morphine on their demand. Six terminally ill patients were given additional morphine. Four of 6 used the additional morphine for once to 4 times. They were satisfied the effect of additional, they did not use. Their pain did not increase. I suppose, they knew the means of pain relief then they were free from the anxiety of increasing pain. Decreasing the anxiety reduce their pain. Additional doses of morphine on demand are very useful to relieve the pain of the patients at home.
