In an audit of 17,417 necropsies from 1939 to 1989 at the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, 46 congenital tumors comprising 24 teratomas, 8 vascular tumors, 6 neuroblastomas, three rhabdomyomas, two mesoblastic nephromas, one thyroid adenoma, one hepatic adenoma and one cerebellar medulloblastoma were found. The teratomas were generally large tumors and, because of their size and location, incompatible with extrauterine life. Ten teratomas were associated with polyhydramnios, three with obstructed labour, five of the fetuses were hydropic and four had malformations at sites distant to the tumor. Twenty teratomas occurred in stillbirths, half of whom were macerated. The vascular tumors were associated with polyhydramnios in three cases and hydrops fetalis in two. The neuroblastomas were all incidental findings. Four were intra-adrenal, one was an adrenal tumor which had metastasized to the liver and the remaining case was a small paravertebral lesion. Two of the three rhabdomyomas were multiple and one of these occurred in a case of tuberous sclerosis. One of the mesoblastic nephromas occurred in a hydropic fetus who had the Arnold-Chiari malformation. The thyroid and hepatic adenomas were small incidental lesions. The cerebellar medulloblastoma had led to marked hydrocephalus. Congenital tumors have different incidence, presentation and behaviour than those in childhood or adult life. The association of congenital tumors with congenital malformations and hydrops fetalis should always be remembered.
