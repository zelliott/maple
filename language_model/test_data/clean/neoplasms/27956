This article explores the relationship between a repressive style of adaptation and depressive symptomatology.

Thirty-one adolescent cancer patients were compared with 83 healthy high school students. Subjects with repressive adaptation were identified as those reporting low anxiety and high defensiveness. Depressive symptomatology was measured by self-report.

Patients with cancer reported significantly lower levels of depression, and a significantly higher proportion were identified as repressors. Repressor status accounted for significant variance in depression over that explained by illness.

Adaptive style may be common in medically ill children and may directly and indirectly influence psychological and medical outcome.
