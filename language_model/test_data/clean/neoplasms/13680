The 92nd Annual Meeting of the AACR comprised over 5000 abstracts, 12 plenary and award lectures and numerous talks in educational sessions, symposia and mini-symposia. Given the wealth of information presented, we narrowed our coverage to the area of prenyltransferase and protein kinase inhibitors. Many rationally designed drugs are now in clinical trials and exciting results were presented for the Bcr-Abl inhibitor STI-571. The cancer community is beginning to envision new ways to evaluate and administer these well-tolerated drugs which do not fit the traditional anticancer drug profile. There is an emphasis in developing surrogate markers for evaluating the mechanism-based effectiveness as well as identifying off-target toxicities. In addition, there is a large effort in investigating effective drug combinations and the use of these new agents as radiosensitisers. Here we present specific examples of these issues as applied to prenylation and protein kinase inhibitors.
