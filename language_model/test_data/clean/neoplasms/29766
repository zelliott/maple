It is clear that the rate of change in biology is rapidly accelerating. This is most apparent in the BRM area with respect to the development of new cancer therapies. New surgical approaches are being developed, and new forms of delivery for therapeutic radiation are now available. Radiosensitizers are now also being tested. Similarly, new chemotherapeutic agents and new methods of utilizing existing drugs are being developed. However, the use of BRM either alone or in combination with these other modalities is the area of greatest change and can be expected to be a major factor in achieving a greater understanding of cancer biology and a greater therapeutic specificity in the treatment of cancer patients in this decade (2, 65). Given the new technology of the 1980's, this is an exciting time. It is hoped that sufficient resources will be available to support continuing efforts to develop biologicals into effective anticancer agents. The rapidly advancing technologies of computers, cell fusion, and genetic engineering are all interrelated through the underpinnings of molecular biology to offer us unparalleled opportunities in biological research. These opportunities should translate into more effective treatments for cancer in this decade.
