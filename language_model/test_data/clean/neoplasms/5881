Interleukin-7 (IL-7) was originally discovered to be a pre-B cell growth factor. Soon thereafter, a broader role for IL-7 in leukocyte development and function began to be identified. IL-7 now has been shown to be a critical cytokine for normal T and B lymphopoiesis and a mobilizer of pluripotent stem cells and myeloid progenitors. IL-7 has been demonstrated to enhance T cell function and induce cytokine expression in monocytes. Preclinical studies have already found that IL-7 could accelerate murine lymphocyte regeneration following chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, induce antitumor effects in mice, and expand anti-HIV-specific human T cells. Thus it is essential that further preclinical and clinical research be performed to evaluate IL-7 as a potential therapy for leukopenia, bone marrow/stem cell transplantation, cancer, and HIV/AIDS.
