The present study was designed to investigate quality of life (QOL) among caregivers of cancer inpatients, and to explore the related factors with the long-term goal to improve QOL of cancer caregivers in China.

A cross-sectional study was performed during the period January-March 2008. Subjects comprised 358 caregivers of cancer inpatients. The questionnaires pertaining to QOL, sociodemographic characteristics, caregiving demands, available social resources, caregiving situation, and caregiver's health status were used. Data were collected by nurses through interviews.

The average QOL score of these subjects was 5.26. General linear model analysis showed that caregiver's QOL was significantly associated with, in standardized estimate sequence, spousal relationship, patient's activities of daily living, and chronic disease (no). Overall spousal relationship to patient had the strongest association with caregiver's QOL.

Psychological well-being and social concerns of cancer caregivers were disrupted more seriously than spiritual well-being and physical well-being. In addition, spousal relationship, patient's disability, and caregiver's health status could affect the caregiver's QOL.
