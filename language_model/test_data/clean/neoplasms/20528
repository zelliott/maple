Recent advances in cancer detection and treatment have resulted in an increase in the survival rate of individuals diagnosed with cancer. The increased survival rate brings new challenges for increasing the quality of life for cancer survivors. Debilitating side effects can result from the cancer itself and the cancer treatment. The negative effects lead to decreased functional (work) capacity, increased fatigue, and debilitating muscular weakness. There have been very positive benefits seen from the use of individualized prescriptive exercise intervention in alleviating these cancer treatment related symptoms. The role of exercise intervention as a complementary therapy is just emerging. Studies have shown that exercise decreases the amount of fatigue, improves functional capacity, increases immune function, and leads to improved quality of life. The effects of cancer and cancer treatments require that an exercise intervention program be well based in sound scientific principles. The exercise intervention needs to be carefully structured and controlled. All patients should be assessed and reassessed to evaluate progress. A cancer exercise specialist should closely monitor the exercise regime. Exercise should involve a whole-body approach that emphasizes all areas of fitness. Exercise therapy for cancer patients is a new and exciting area that will continue to grow as medical professionals realize the necessity for post-cancer treatment intervention to improve quality of life.
