Oncogenes have been discovered through the study of oncogenic retroviruses. Viral oncogenes present in the viral genome are the genes responsible for the transforming properties of these viruses. Viral oncogenes are altered forms of cellular genes, designated as proto-oncogenes, that have been transduced into the genome of transforming retroviruses. Deregulated expression or structural alteration of cellular proto-oncogenes by amplification, mutation or translocation has been implicated in the occurrence of human cancers.
