Carcinogenic theory is making a unilateral step toward complication, resulting in even apparent chaos. Under such chaotic circumstances, a new theory that stems from the analogy of cancer cells with stem cells, called cancer stem cell theory, is gaining attention. This theory, if correct, necessarily urges two major corrections. One is that such complication may not entirely be the cause of carcinogenesis and, thus, at least partly, nothing more than a consequence. The other is need to create a new framework of cancer therapy. Such a new therapy should allow for long-term symbiosis of a patient with cancer cells; a chemical compound (drug)-based sustainable therapy that directs the dormancy of cancer cells, or converts cancer cells to normal cells (or their resemblances), for example.
