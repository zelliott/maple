Cancer cachexia is a severe debilitating disorder, which causes significant morbidity and mortality. In clinical practice, cachexia is often not treated until a late stage, when therapeutic options are limited.

It is therefore of great interest to analyse early biomarkers of this syndrome.

In this review article, we summarise recent biomarkers found in various body compartments. We also explore the likelihood of a genetic predisposition to cachexia and focus on the potential role of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes coding for pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and 'atrogenes' associated with wasting in skeletal muscle.
