Administration of interleukin 1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) protects bone marrow precursor cells (BMPC) from ionizing radiation and antineoplastic drugs. The time of injection is critical: the best protective results being obtained when cytokines are given around 24h prior to the induced injury. Multiple daily cytokine injections that precede irradiation or drug administration are more effective than single ones although single doses are quite effective at increasing survival in mice. Protection is positively correlated with both rapid granulocyte recovery and BMPC survival. Mechanisms involved in BMPC radioprotection include: (1) push to the S/G2 + M or arrest in the G0 phases of the cell cycle by IL-1 or TNF alpha, respectively, and (2) induction of mitochondrial manganous superoxide dismutase synthesis. For BMPC chemoprotection, proposed mechanisms are: (1) increase of aldehyde dehydrogenase synthesis, and (2) modulation of multiple-drug resistant gene expression. Stimulation of glutathione synthesis in BMPC could be operating in both radio- and chemoprotection. These findings point to the relevance of IL-1 or TNF alpha in cancer therapy as a means of reducing BMPC sensitivity to cytoreductive drugs or irradiation (including radioimmunotherapy) as well as in in vitro tumor cell purging with drugs in autologous BMT. Prior administration of these cytokines should be also considered for people in imminent danger of exposure to radiation.
