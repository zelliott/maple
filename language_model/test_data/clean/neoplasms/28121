In the past few years, the technical breakthrough in generating MHC-peptide tetramers has revolutionized the analysis of T-cell responses. The major advantage of this technique over currently available methods is the ability of these tetramers to label T lymphocytes according to their antigenic specificity. The present review describes some technical aspects of tetramers generation and discusses some of the numerous possibilities opened up by this new technology.
