A spectrum of oncologic treatments including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and molecular targeted therapies is available to combat cancer. These treatments are associated with adverse effects in several organ systems including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The immunocompromised state induced by oncologic therapy is also an important contributing factor underlying GI complications. This review discusses common GI complications that can result from cancer therapy. The pathologic mechanisms underlying each complication and the pharmacology of the agents used to treat these complications are discussed.
