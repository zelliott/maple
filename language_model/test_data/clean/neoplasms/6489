We have examined, in proliferating neoplastic cells, the effect on DNA of EGTA (a chelator of Ca2+) and W7 (an inhibitor of calmodulin). The treatment results in release of single-stranded DNA fragments (2-10 kb) from pre-labelled HMW DNA. When DNA from synchronized neoplastic cells in S phase is examined, almost all pre-labelled DNA appears as short fragments. However, fragmentation does not occur in growth-arrested cells or in normal cells. Furthermore, fragmentation can be prevented by incubating cells in excessive amounts of Ca2+. Hence Ca2+ and the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin are involved in the processes conferring stability to DNA in proliferating neoplastic cells.
