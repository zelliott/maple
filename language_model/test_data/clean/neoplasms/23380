MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA regulators of gene expression that play important roles in critical biological processes, including cell division, self-renewal and cell state maintenance. Their deregulation leads to extensive clinical consequences in tumorigenesis. Cancers demonstrate heterogeneity in their cell states implicated in their resistance and resurgence. Apart from proliferating cells, cancers harbor a small proportion of assorted quiescent cells that resist conventional therapeutics and contribute to cancer recurrence. MicroRNA expression, targets, microRNPs (microRNA-protein complexes) and their functions have been demonstrated to be regulated in distinct tumor cell states and as an adaptive response to stress signals in tumor-unfavorable environments. In turn, altered microRNPs and their modified post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene expression may contribute to tumor resistance and influence tumor progression. An understanding of distinct microRNA mechanisms in cancer cells would provide extensive insights into the versatile roles of microRNAs in the perpetuation of tumors and indicate potential therapeutic avenues.
