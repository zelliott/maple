Peptide-based therapies offer the potential for non-genotoxic, genotype-specific alternatives, or adjuvants, to the current range of traditional cancer treatments. Such a patient-tailored cancer-cell-directed therapeutic approach should have fewer side effects and could well be more effective than the current drug- or combination-based regimens. Here, we review the potential of novel natural anticancer peptides such as necrotic peptides, apoptotic peptides, function-blocking peptides, antiangiogenic peptides and immunostimulatory peptides in the context of their ability to induce tumor regression. We focus on the therapeutic prospects of anticancer peptides and their possible application in tumor therapy.
