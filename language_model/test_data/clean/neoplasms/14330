Clinical trials are an important tool for innovation in cancer treatments. Therefore, accrual into trials has been highlighted for Commission on Cancer (CoC)-accredited hospital programs. The current Standard 5.21 and Standard 1.92 which take effect in 2015 require a minimum percentage of patient enrollment for compliance, as well as an opportunity for commendation at a higher percentage. The standards do not define a role for the hospital cancer registry staff but, at C/NET Solutions, we believe that the data collection and management efforts of the registry can be leveraged to effectively screen patients for clinical trials accrual.
