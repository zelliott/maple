Tamoxifen inhibits the binding of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine ([3H]NBMPR) to human MCF-7 breast cancer cells with an IC50 of 8 microM. Tamoxifen at 30 microM changed the apparent Kd for [3H]NBMPR binding from 0.63 +/- 0.12 to 4.75 +/- 0.58 nM, with little effect on the Bmax (311000 +/- 76000 and 263000 +/- 46000 sites per cell for untreated and tamoxifen-treated cells respectively). Corresponding to this decrease in binding of [3H]NBMPR in the presence of tamoxifen was an inhibition of NBMPR-sensitive equilibrative transport of 50 microM [3H]uridine (IC50 7-10 microM). In the presence of 15 microM tamoxifen, the apparent K(m) for [3H]uridine transport was increased from 390 +/- 30 to 1500 +/- 250 microM, with no change in Vmax (12.0 +/- 0.1 and 11.3 +/- 4.3 microM/s for untreated and tamoxifen-treated cells respectively). The inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on NBMPR-sensitive equilibrative uridine transport was specific, as similar results were also observed in HL-60 leukaemia and EL4 lymphoma cells. Furthermore a similar concentration of tamoxifen had no effect on the NBMPR-insensitive equilibrative transport of uridine in MCF-7, HL-60 and Morris 7777 hepatoma cells, and on the Na(+)-dependent transport of uridine in murine splenocytes. In this paper we demonstrate that tamoxifen by itself might have some antiproliferative effects through inhibition of DNA synthesis by blocking the nucleoside salvage pathway.
