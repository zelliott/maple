Although interstitial techniques are invasive, they are still the first-line therapeutic modalities for certain types of tumour. They are mainly relevant to tumours that are either inoperable or located so deep that access is complicated. Of the various types of radiation that can be delivered by the interstitial route, ultrasound is the most suitable for deep heating. The study compares the efficacy of two types of applicator with respect to their ability to induce cylindrical zones of coagulation necrosis. The transducer of the first applicator is tubular, whereas the second is plane and can rotate around its axis. Both have an external diameter of 4 mm, are fitted with surface cooling systems and operate at 10.7 MHz and 14 W.cm-2. Comparison involves mathematical modelling of ablated tissue in the targeted area by resolving the bioheat transfer equation (BHTE) using an algorithm based on finite differences. The BHTE gives a temperature value from which the thermal dose can be determined. It is shown that tissue ablation by tubular transducers is slow, and, in consequence, perfusion disturbs the heating pattern: in vivo, irradiation with a tubular transducer lasting 1081 s would be required to ablate a tissue mass with a radius of 8 mm. The corresponding period using a rotating plane transducer with 20 firing angles is only 618 s. The mean exposure time of each shot lasts 31 +/- 7 s. Therefore perfusion would have much less impact in the case of therapy administered using a plane transducer than that using a tubular one.
