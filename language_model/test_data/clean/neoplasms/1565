Understanding the biology of the DC and its pivotal role in immune response initiation and regulation has enabled new effective anti-cancer therapies to be developed for treatment of a wide range of tumor types. Many studies on DC-based cancer vaccine development have focused on the development of methods that can effectively deliver tumor Ags to DCs. Numerous methods have been developed or evaluated for the delivery of defined and undefined tumor Ags to DCs for processing and presentation to T lymphocytes. This review provides a brief summary of these methods, the techniques that are used in each, how they have -- or could -- be applied clinically, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each method.
