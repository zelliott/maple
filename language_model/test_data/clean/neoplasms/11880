In a sample of 8 cases of solid malignant neoplasms occurring in children resident in the Western Region of Saudi Arabia the most important finding was a remarkable preponderance of lymphomas when compared with Western series. Other notable differences were the prevalence of Hodgkin's disease in the first decade of life, the different proportions of its subtype, and the occurrence of well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma. Included is a case of lympho-epithelioid cellular lymphoma (Lennert's lymphoma) which, as far as we can ascertain, is the youngest reported case. There was a relatively large number of embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas and a paucity of neuroblastomas. Our study, which is concerned with proportional rates (population studies are not yet completed), contributes to the interesting ethnic and geographical differences which exist in the prevalence of childhood lymphomas and other solid malignant neoplasms. The biases that affect studies such as ours are stressed.
