To present the more frequent solid tumors, that require a general anaesthesia and to describe the particularities of the anaesthetic management.

The PUBMED database was searched for articles (1990 - 2005) combined with references analysis of major articles on the topics.

Neoplasma is the first cause of paediatric death. In children less than 5 years of age, neuroblastoma and nephroblastoma are the more frequent of the tumour. The incidence of each pathology is low. However a general anaesthesia is required in numerous situations: bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, central venous catheter insertion, various biopsies under computed tomography, ultrasound, thoracoscopy or laparoscopy, MRI scan, surgery and body radiation. The key points of successful anaesthetic management include complete preoperative evaluation together with the oncology paediatric team. Particularly, cardiotoxicity may result from chemotherapy and hypertension is frequently associated with neuroblastoma and nephroblastoma. Mediastinal location of lymphomas induced a significant risk of cardiopulmonary complications during induction of general anaesthesia. A peak expiratory flow rate or a tracheal cross-section area less than 50% of predicted values are contraindication to general anaesthesia. Cephalic rhabdomyosarcoma may be responsible of difficult airway management. Specific guidelines are available for platelet and red cell transfusion in paediatric oncology patients. Surgical antibioprophylaxis are adapted in immunodepressed children to a potential increased risk of postoperative infectious complications, according personal previous history, microbiological ecology and body bacterial flora. Dosage of anaesthetic agents takes into account denutrition, hydroelectrolytic disturbances and hypovolemia.
