Obesity is a risk factor for cancer and is associated with increased mortality from a number of malignancies. We describe our experience with bariatric surgery patients with a history of malignancy and review the safety and outcomes of bariatric surgery in patients with a history of cancer.

We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from all patients diagnosed with a malignancy before, during, or after bariatric surgery. Data on weight loss, co-morbidities, and recurrence were collected.

From July 1999 to February 2008, 1566 patients underwent bariatric surgery. Of these 1566 patients, 36 (2.3%) had a history of malignancy before they underwent bariatric evaluation and surgery, 4 (0.26%) were diagnosed with a malignancy during their preoperative evaluation, 2 of whom subsequently underwent bariatric surgery, and 2 had intraoperative findings suspicious for malignancy; bariatric surgery was completed in both cases. The evaluation revealed renal cell carcinoma and low-grade lymphoma, respectively. No procedures were aborted because of a suspicion of malignancy. Postoperatively, 16 patients (0.9%) were diagnosed with cancer, 3 of whom had a history of malignancy: 1 with metastatic renal cell, 1 with recurrent melanoma, and 1, who had had prostate cancer, with bladder cancer.

A history of malignancy does not appear to be a contraindication for bariatric surgery as long as the life expectancy is reasonable. Screening for bariatric surgery might reveal the malignancy. Bariatric surgery does not seem to have a negative effect on the treatment of malignancies that are discovered in the postoperative period.
