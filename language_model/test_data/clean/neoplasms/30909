A monitoring committee policy was established by the Southwest Oncology Group in 1985 to address documented problems in study conduct. Committees consisting of the study coordinators, disease committee chair, study statistician, Group chair, Group statistician, an uninvolved Southwest Oncology Group clinician, an NCI representative, and a representative from each involved group for intergroup studies have been appointed for each phase III study. Business is conducted largely through the mail and through conference calls. Since then, problems identified in older studies have been largely resolved. Appropriate and timely decisions are being made at modest additional expense to the Group.
