This paper investigates the presence of HLA class I-restricted and tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in tumor sites of esophageal cancers. Five CTL lines were established from the metastatic lymph nodes or pleural effusion by incubation with interleukin-2 of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes: cases 1 and 5, HLA-A26- and HLA-A33-restricted and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)-specific CTL; case 2, HLA-Cw0102-restricted and esophageal SCC-specific CTL; case 3, HLA-A24- and HLA-A26-restricted CTL recognizing histologically different tumor cells; and case 4, HLA-A26-restricted and esophageal SCC-specific CTL. These results suggest the existence of HLA class I-restricted and tumor-specific CTL in metastatic esophageal SCC.
