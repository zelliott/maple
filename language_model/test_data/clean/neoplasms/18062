p53 is activated genetically by a set of kinases that are components of the calcium calmodulin kinase superfamily, including CHK2, AMP kinase, and DAPK-1. In dissecting the mechanism of DAPK-1 control, a novel mutation (N1347S) was identified in the death domain of DAPK-1. The N1347S mutation prevented the death domain module binding stably to ERK in vitro and in vivo. Gel filtration demonstrated that the N1347S mutation disrupted the higher order oligomeric nature of the purified recombinant death domain miniprotein. Accordingly, the N1347S death domain module is defective in vivo in the formation of high molecular weight oligomeric intermediates after cross-linking with ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate). Full-length DAPK-1 protein harboring a N1347S mutation in the death domain was also defective in binding to ERK in cells and was defective in formation of an ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate)-cross-linked intermediate in vivo. Full-length DAPK-1 encoding the N1347S mutation was attenuated in tumor necrosis factor receptor-induced apoptosis. However, the N1347S mutation strikingly prevented ERK:DAPK-1-dependent apoptosis as defined by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, Annexin V staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling imaging. Significant penetrance of the N1347S allele was identified in normal genomic DNA indicating the mutation is germ line, not tumor derived. The frequency observed in genomic DNA was from 37 to 45% for homozygous wild-type, 41 to 47% for heterozygotes, and 12 to 15% for homozygous mutant. These data highlight a naturally occurring DAPK-1 mutation that alters the oligomeric structure of the death domain, de-stabilizes DAPK-1 binding to ERK, and prevents ERK:DAPK-1-dependent apoptosis.
