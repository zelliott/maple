More than 30 mouse tumors are associated with virus-like agents that may readily be detected by enzymic techniques. Radiation and chemically induced tumors do not ordinarily give evidence of such activity. The present report is of experiments in which a synergistic effect has been observed to occur when animals were inoculated with both the filtrable agent and a virus-free tumor. Synergism was shown by accelerated growth of the tumor and by elevation of a glycolytic enzyme (lactic dehydrogenase) in the host plasma
