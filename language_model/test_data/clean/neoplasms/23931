In reviewing abnormal growth, we may distinguish autonomous and nonautonomous growth processes. The highest diversification is reached in the autonomous non-self-limiting processes, the malignant neoplasms which, if not treated, are characterized by extensive growth and progression. In their development these processes exhibit autonomy on one hand and heterogeneity on the other. Neoplastic and related diseases are extremely complex. It is unacceptable to view them exclusively as genetic or metabolic diseases, or merely as the tumor itself, including its progressive stages, as evidenced in neoplastic metastasis. All these characteristics appear in the different types of neoplastic malignomas, e.g. genetic variations in the neoplastic cells from the normal cells of the parent tissue(s). Included here are tumor progression and cloning of the neoplastic cells, stagewise development of host metabolism and of tumor metabolism; neoplastic hereditary and endocrine-like syndromes as well as paraneoplastic syndromes and cachexia. Neoplastic progression, as observed in the metastatic cascade, derives from the cells of the primary tumor. In contrast, multiple primary tumors originate from different host tissues, whereas the syndromes themselves constitute a symptom complex developing in a neoplasm-bearing host and cannot be assigned to local or distant spread of neoplasms. The only possible explanation for these apparently contrasting processes lies in the interaction of tumor and host metabolism, which seemingly varies in tumor-bearing hosts and in those cases where the tumor has been surgical removed. Antigens and other compounds again show an increase with the usually ensuing secondary tumor spread, a course which provides the basis for most deaths from cancer.
