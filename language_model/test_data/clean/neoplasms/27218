Long-term follow-up (LTFU) of childhood cancer survivors is important in view of their high frequency of chronic medical problems, many of which may be serious, disabling or life-threatening. Several LTFU guidelines for the care of survivors have been developed by different national groups but provide varied recommendations with areas of both agreement and of disagreement. This diversity has generated uncertainty about the ideal nature and content of LTFU.

The EU-funded PanCareSurFup project is developing pan-European guidelines for the prevention, early detection and treatment of physical or psychosocial late effects of childhood cancer and its treatment, as well as the organization of LTFU care including age-appropriate transitional care as survivors approach adulthood and optimal health-promotion advice for individual survivors and their families. The International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group aims to achieve consensus concerning clinical practice guidelines for LTFU of major late effects in survivors. The overall aim is to produce harmonized recommendations of value to all the participating countries despite their potentially disparate needs and healthcare settings.

These initiatives seek to standardize and increase the efficiency of LTFU care and improve long-term health outcomes and quality of life in survivors.
