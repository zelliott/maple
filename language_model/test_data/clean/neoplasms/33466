We analyzed the postal surveys conducted by Japanese Cancer Association (JCA) in 2004 and 2006. This survey aimed to assess JCA members' behavior and their attitudes toward patients who are smokers, smoking cessation, and their responsibilities. In the 2006 version, questions were added about hope for various approaches related to smoking and health and the attitudes as medical experts when treating patients. JCA members' smoking rate was 5.9% in 2004 and 9.0% in 2006. Current smokers were significantly more likely than never or former smokers to disagree or have no opinion with most activities about smoking control such as 'raising the price of tobacco' and 'labeling health warnings describing the harmful effects of tobacco in large letters with clarity for easier reading', while most members including smokers agree to ban smoking while walking, to educate general people about tobacco and health, to provide an environment where children cannot get tobacco and the information about tobacco and health. Smoking rate among JCA members were less than that of general populations, and most of them are in favor of promoting tobacco control activities.
