Translational and clinical cancer research, as well as clinical trials and treatment of cancer, are essentially structured based on the organ in which tumors originate. However, the recent explosion of knowledge about the molecular characteristics of tumors is opening a new way to tackle cancer. This article proposes a different approach to the classification of cancer with important implications for treatment and for basic, translational, and clinical research. The authors postulate that cancers from diverse organs of origin with similar molecular traits should be managed together. The common molecular features observed in different tumors determine clinical actions in a better way than organ-based classification. Thus, comparisons between tumors residing in different locations but with shared molecular characteristics will improve the therapeutic approach and the understanding of the biology of cancer.
