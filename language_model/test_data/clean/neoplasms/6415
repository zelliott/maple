Most retroviruses are immunosuppressive in vitro and in vivo. They are able to enhance virus-induced tumor development and/or to induce acquired immune deficiency syndromes (AIDS) which are characterized by malignant tumors and opportunistic infections. Experimental evidence for the immunosuppressive properties of several type D viruses derived from human cell lines and other retroviruses is presented.
