Renal transplantation is associated with many long-term complications caused by a combination of the patient's comorbid medical illnesses and the effects of the various maintenance immunosuppressive agents currently in use. Careful patient selection with an emphasis on adequate cardiovascular function and low maintenance doses of immunosuppression at a level compatible with graft acceptance should help to prevent significant long-term morbidity. Recurrence of the original renal disease is a common histologic finding but, except in a few diseases, rarely results in graft loss. Parenthood can be a reality for most patients who have excellent graft function.
