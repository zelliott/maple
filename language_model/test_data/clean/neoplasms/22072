Bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract (bDLE) is a dialyzate of a heterogeneous mixture of low molecular weight substances released from disintegrated blood leukocytes or lymphoid tissue obtained from homogenized bovine spleen. The purpose of this study was to determine if bDLE had cytotoxic effects and modulated apoptosis gene expression in breast cancer cells.

The MCF-7, BT-474, MDA-MB-453, A-427, Calu-1, U937 and L5178Y cancer cell lines and PBMC human cells were treated with bDLE (0-0.66 U/mL) for 72 h. The bDLE effect on cell growth proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay, and the MCF-7 was evaluated by ethidium bromide-acridine orange staining; total DNA was evaluated for DNA fragmentation, and total RNA was isolated for p53, bag-1, c-myc, bim, bax, bcl-2 and bad mRNA expression.

The bDLE had dose-dependent cytotoxic effects and demonstrated an IC50 at a dosage of 0.06 U/mL (P&lt;0.05). The bDLE did not affect the viability of normal human PBMC. The bDLE induced DNA fragmentation at doses of 0.06 and 0.13 U/mL in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The bDLE induced cytotoxic effects and suppressed the p53, bag-1, c-myc, bax, bcl-2, and bad mRNA expression that influences apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Bim mRNA expression was not detected.

This may open up interesting prospects for the treatment of human breast cancer.
