The process of environmental health risk assessment may be described as a series of distinct stages, ranging from hazard identification and risk estimation to the selection and implementation of an appropriate risk management strategy. An important step in this process is the estimation of health risks at low levels of exposure. The toxicological and epidemiological data base on which such estimates are based are reviewed in the case of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), a persistent organochlorine pesticide, along with data on human exposure. This information is used to assess the potential human health risks attributable to HCB.
