Radioimmunology was used to measure serum levels of CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) in 108 patients with a variety of different advanced malignant neoplasms and in a control group of 60 healthy subjects. TPA proved more sensitive as a tumour marker than CEA, since increased TPA was found in 76% of the cancer cases compared to 42% for CEA. No significant increase in diagnostic sensitivity was obtained by using both markers rather than PTA alone.
