The response of cells to DNA damage is critical for maintaining genomic integrity and for preventing cancer development. Current advances in our understanding of the response of cells to DNA double-strand breaks and to stalled DNA replication forks and the relationship of these responses to human disease were discussed at the 52nd Benzon Symposium in Denmark, Copenhagen. Here we review the novel findings that were presented at this Symposium and the current state of the field.
