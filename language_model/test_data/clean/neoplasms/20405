Iron, apart a for long time well-known function connected with: transportation (hemoglobin), storage (myoglobin), and utilize (cytochromes, cytochrome oxidase) oxygen for respiration, has a critical role in host-pathogen interactions. Iron is essential for microbial growth, but also for immune function. The role of iron in infection, thermoregulation, acute lymphocytic leukemia, neoplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, stimulation of free radical reactions, and studies with iron chelation therapy are discussed.
