To review the current advances in fertility preservation strategies and to discuss future directions with an emphasis on ovarian tissue cryobanking.

The publications related to fertility preservation in cancer patients were identified through Medline and other bibliographic databases, focusing on the most recent developments.

There are several options for fertility preservation in cancer patients. Even though most of them are still experimental and their efficacy and reliability have not been determined, the future of fertility preservation in women with cancer is promising. In particular, the recent report of a live birth after transplantation of human ovarian tissue has reinforced the clinical potential of ovarian tissue banking for fertility preservation. Many exciting studies are underway to improve the efficacy and solve the problems with current fertility preservation strategies. It is inevitable that we will see the emergence of more complex ethical problems with the application of new technologies to humans. However, continuous efforts to improve current strategies and to develop new strategies will benefit many women and children who are facing premature ovarian failure and sterility.
