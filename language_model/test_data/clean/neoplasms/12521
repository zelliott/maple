Recent epidemiological studies estimate that the number of occupational cancers is high, as more than 3800 and up to 7000 cases occur each year in France in men. Attribuable fraction to occupational factors varies widely from one site of cancer to another. Respiratory cancers (lung and pleura) are by far the most frequent of occupational cancers with an attributable fraction of 13 to 29% for lung cancer in men according to the international literature, and an attributable fraction of 85% for pleural mesothelioma. Previous occupational exposure to asbestos is the most frequent occupational exposure for these cancers. Many occupational agents have been identified as etiological factors of cancer for different sites. Attention should be paid to these aetiologies and primary prevention programmes should be held at work in order to avoid residual occupational exposure.
