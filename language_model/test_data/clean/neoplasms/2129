Transferrin is a growth factor in malignancy. In this function, transferrin is taken up into the proliferating malignant cell. The tumor-induced loss of circulating transferrin results in a hypotransferrinemia which correlates with tumor mass and proliferation rate. The cellular uptake of iron into the erythropoietic precursors depends on the presence of iron-saturated transferrin. Thus, iron utilization for the hemoglobin synthesis correlates with the transferrin concentration in blood. In 256 patients with malignancies of different histological types and different tumor extension a strong correlation was found between the degree of tumor-induced hypotransferrinemia and anemia. This correlation between transferrin concentration and hemoglobin concentration could be demonstrated in the different histological tumor entities. Tumor progression was accompanied by a progressive fall in transferrin concentration and hemoglobin concentration. By contrast, tumor remission achieved by an effective antineoplastic therapy resulted in an improvement of hypotransferrinemia and anemia. These variations in the two parameters were found to be strongly correlated. We conclude from our data that tumor-induced loss of transferrin is one of the most important factors responsible for the development of anemia in malignancy.
