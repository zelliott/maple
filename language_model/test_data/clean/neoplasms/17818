Endoscopic surgery has some clear benefits, but it also has some disadvantages in reducing surgeons' normal dexterity and limiting their ability to deal with difficult situations. Computer-aided surgery has been proposed to overcome some of the drawbacks of traditional minimally invasive surgery. The proposed systems make possible a secure, precise procedure with no limitations on the operator's freedom of movement. Image-guided surgery is a new technical tool in surgical oncology. Interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has entered a new stage in which computer-based techniques play an expanding role in planning, monitoring, and controlling procedures. MRI-guided surgery not only represents a technical challenge but is a transformation from conventional hand-eye coordination to interactive navigational operations. We have recently developed an MRI-guided robot-assisted interventional surgical system as well as an MRI-compatible endoscope. They allow the performance of precise image-guided interventional therapy and endoscopic surgery. MRI-guided laparoscopic surgery is now feasible for malignancies and will play an important part in the development of minimally invasive therapy.
