In bioequivalence trials, one often considers two or more generic products with the original one. The 3 x 3 crossover design can be adopted to evaluate the two generic candidates with a brand name drug, rather than conducting two separate 2 x 2 crossover trials. Dropouts, however, are more likely to occur due to various administrative reasons when we consider a higher order crossover design. A modified method, which was originally given by Chow and Shao (1997), is extended to compare two generic products with a reference in the incomplete 3 x 3 crossover design. A simulation study and discussion are also presented.
