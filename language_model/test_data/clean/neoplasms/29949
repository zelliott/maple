Cells obtained from human solid tumor biopsies and from ascites of various histological origin were cultured in soft agar. Forty-six out of 72 malignant biopsy specimens, consisting mainly of ovarian and breast adenocarcinoma, were grown successfully. Cloning efficiencies ranged from 0.001 to 1%. In a few cases large variations occurred in the different specimens from the same patient. The cells in the colonies had the same morphological characteristics as those of the original tumor. The soft agar assay was used to study the chemotherapeutic response of ovarian tumors.
