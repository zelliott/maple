Phase I trials in 1979 include some drugs representing totally new structures, new schedules of old compounds undergoing reevaluation, and second generation compounds. The rational development of analogs based on structure-activity relationships and on overcoming pharmacologic or toxicologic problems of parent compounds requires much future emphasis; two such examples (pentamethylmelamine and AZQ) are cited here. For all drugs, a plan of clinical development should ensure a more thorough initial evaluation as well as validation of concepts and systems that have prompted their introduction into the clinic. Establishment of clinical usefulness for the new structures, and particularly for three compounds herein reintroduced after a long period of oblivion, would constitute tangible proof of methodological and technological advances that have taken place in the development and clinical evaluation of anticancer drugs.
