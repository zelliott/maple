Fifty-one episodes of bacteraemia due to Pseudomonas species other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurring between 1980 and 1990 in a Belgian cancer centre were reviewed. This corresponded to an incidence of 0.62/1000 admissions, or 1.5% of all bacteraemic episodes. Twenty-nine episodes, each with several positive blood culture sets were considered clinically significant, including six patients belonging to a well-documented outbreak of pseudobacteraemia with Xanthomonas maltophilia and associated with contaminated blood sampling tubes. The respiratory tract was the source in six (20.7%), an infected intravenous catheter in 10 (34.5%) and the source was unknown in seven (24.1%). Seven patients died from infection (24.1%). Twenty-three episodes with a single positive blood culture set were considered clinically not significant, although four of them were considered significant by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria because of the presence of symptoms and specific antibiotic treatment being administered. None of the patients with a single isolate died from infection despite the fact that 17 of 22 did not receive an effective antimicrobial agent. All isolates were susceptible to co-trimoxazole.
