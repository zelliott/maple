There is now widespread interest in the subject of drug dose intensity in cancer treatment. Recent retrospective analyses have shown a clear-cut benefit for those patients receiving either the intended drug dosage in a particular regimen or the highest dosage achievable through an escalation scheme. In this discussion, the participating physicians will review dose intensity in light of these retrospective studies, highlighting the particular tumor types in which benefits have been demonstrated. Other important issues will be discussed, such as scheduling of drug combinations and the importance of using toxicity as a biologic response monitor of drug efficacy. The panelists will also provide opinions as to the best design for a prospective clinical trial to test dose intensity.
