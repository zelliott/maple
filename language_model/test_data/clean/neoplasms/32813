After presentation of several important methodological problems in the development of new cytostatic agents, the newer substances adriamycin, the nitroso-urea derivatives, ICDT, diaminodichloro-cisplatinum, VP 16-213 and tamoxifen are briefly discussed with regard to their pharmacology and activity spectra. In this context adriamycin, diaminochloro-cisplatinum and VP 16-213 may be considered break-throughs in the field of therapeutic oncology.
