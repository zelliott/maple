We aimed to determine the risk factors for healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in patients with solid tumours.

This retrospective study was performed in the Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Mersin Teaching and Research Medical Centre, between January 2004 and December 2008. SPSS version 11.5 program package was used for the statistical analyses.

A total of 145 patients who had an HCAI were analyzed; 62% of the patients were male and their median age was 57.7 ± 16 y and median Charlson co-morbidity score was 4.94 ± 1.2. During the study period, 83 MDR bacteria were isolated from HCAIs that developed in 70 (48.3%) patients. In multiple binary logistic regression analysis, duration of hospital stay (odds ratio (OR) 1.041, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.007-1.077; p = 0.019), surgery (OR 3.115, 95% CI 1.288-7.535; p = 0.012), use of glycopeptides (OR 5.394, 95% CI 1.960-14.850; p = 0.001), and use of third-generation cephalosporins (OR 5.521, 95% CI 2.017-15.110; p = 0.001) were found to be independent risk factors for the development of an MDR infection.

Among hospitalized patients with a solid tumour, HCAIs caused by MDR bacteria occurred more frequently in patients undergoing surgery, receiving third-generation cephalosporins and glycopeptide antibiotics, and having a prolonged hospital stay.
