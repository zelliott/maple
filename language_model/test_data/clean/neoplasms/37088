Previous studies have suggested that peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation has an advantage over autologous bone marrow transplantation.

To compare the hematologic recovery and costs associated with PBSC transplantation with those associated with autologous bone marrow transplantation in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphomas.

Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial.

French Federation of Cancer Centers, located in cancer facilities or public hospitals with transplantation units.

Children and adults with solid tumors or lymphomas who were candidates for high-dose chemotherapy.

Bone marrow or filgrastim-mobilized PBSCs.

The major and point was the duration of thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 50 x 10(9)/L). An economic evaluation of both types of transplantation was done prospectively to measure costs and cost-effectiveness.

129 patients entered the trial; 64 had PBSC transplantation, and 65 had bone marrow transplantation. The median duration of thrombocytopenia was 16 days in the PBSC group and 35 days in the bone marrow group (P &lt; 0.001). All of the other clinical end points studied (time to last platelet transfusion, duration of granulocytopenia, number of transfusion episodes, and duration of hospitalization) favored PBSC transplantation. A cost analysis showed that total cost was decreased by 17% in adults and 29% in children with PBSC transplantation; thus, PBSC transplantation was clearly more cost-effective than bone marrow transplantation for both platelet and granulocyte recovery.

Transplantation of PBSCs is associated with more rapid hematologic recovery than is bone marrow transplantation after high-dose chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphomas. Furthermore, global costs are lower and cost-effectiveness ratios are better with PBSC transplantation.
