Hormonal-metabolic examination was performed in 150 children suffering nephroblastoma and retroperitoneal tumors to outline features of surgical stress in pediatric cancer patients. Surgical trauma causes hyperglycemia associated with relatively low level of insulin and elevated concentration of somatotropin in blood. A reverse correlation was established between pre- and intraoperative values of many hormonal-metabolic parameters. Surgical stress results in cytolysis, protein catabolism and an increase in endogenous intoxication. Retabolil, eleuterococcus, gordox and preoperative infusion of glucose and neohemodes can be used for prevention of surgical stress.
