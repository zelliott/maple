Geriatric oncology is increasingly developing in Western countries as it is established that cancer peaks after 60 years of age, and the populations are inexorably aging. Aging is associated with a decrease in the use of chemotherapy, and some patients are therefore exposed to undertreatment. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is a composite of several scores that target the multidimensional aspects of the old person. With the use of comprehensive geriatric assessment, geriatricians and oncologists can tailor treatment to their patients. In this review, we briefly describe the characteristics of elderly cancer patients, and identify the pitfalls of anticancer treatment in elderly patients. In light of our expertise, we describe the benefits that can be awaited from joint efforts from geriatricians and oncologists and suggest future directions to answer unmet needs.
