As the cure rate for childhood malignancies increases, the number of patients at risk for development of second malignancies also increases. Due to the potentially long remaining life span, long-term follow-up is difficult and patients are often at risk after presumptive cures. Some authors believe that cure rates for second malignancies are similar to cure rates for primary malignancies. We reviewed the records of 162 patients seen at our institution who had developed a second malignancy after treatment for childhood cancer. Presentation, age at diagnosis, tumor histology, extent of tumor, treatment (including radiotherapy with dosage when available, and chemotherapy) plus outcome were recorded. Mean age at diagnosis of the primary malignancy was 10.3 years. The most common primary malignancy was Hodgkin's disease (33) followed by soft tissue sarcoma (28), retinoblastoma (20), bone tumor (17), central nervous system (CNS) tumor (13), leukemia (8), Wilms' tumor (7), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (6), neuroblastoma (5), thyroid neoplasm (5), and others (20). The average interval between diagnosis of the first and second malignancy was 10.8 years. These second tumors carried a high mortality. Only 56 patients have no evidence of disease. Five patients are known to be alive with disease and 92 patients have expired due to their second malignancy. Disease status in 8 patients is unknown. The most common second malignancy was osteosarcoma (35) followed by soft tissue sarcoma (24), breast cancer (15), leukemia (14), thyroid carcinoma (14), CNS tumors (12), melanoma (8), nonmelanomatous skin cancer (8), lymphoma (5), and others (27).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
