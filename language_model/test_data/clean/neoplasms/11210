Loco-regional antiblastic perfusion with circulatory block (stop-flow perfusion, SFP) is a procedure designed to treat solid tumors of the limb and pelvis in an advanced stage, like melanoma, sarcoma of the soft tissues and colon-rectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate if subarachnoid anesthesia could represent a safe and suitable anesthetic technique for this procedure.

Thirty SFP procedures were performed in the angiographic room, 15 for the treatment of lower-limb neoplasias and 15 for pelvic neoplasias. The patients (ASA I-III) had a mean age of 59.1 years (range: 19-81 years). The patients were given different dosages of bupivacaine (range: 10-20 mg) in hyperbaric solution at the concentration of 0.5% and 1% by lumbar subarachnoid injection at different levels (from T12-L1 to L3-L4). Standard monitoring was set up (ECG, pulse-oximetry, and non-invasive artery pressure). The use of any anesthetic and analgesic drug, eventually used in the intra- or postoperative period, was recorded.

The lumbar puncture was approached at L1-L2 and L2-L3 levels in 80% of the cases. Doses of bupivacaine between 12 mg and 14 mg were administered in 2/3 of the cases. Bupivacaine was formulated in hyperbaric solution and administered at a concentration of 0.5% (8 patients) or 1% (22 patients). Complica-tions related to the anesthetic technique were absent. Intraoperative pain control was almost complete with one exception, when the procedure lasted unusually long. Pain control was satisfying immediately after the procedure as well: only in 3 cases were non-opiod analgesics administered within the first 6 h.

Spinal subarachnoid anesthesia has proven to be an effective, safe, and easy-to-manage technique for carrying out SFP procedure in a non-conventional environment such as an angiographic room. It was free of serious side effects and well tolerated even in patients in poor general conditions.
