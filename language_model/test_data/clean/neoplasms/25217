Solid tumors form a heterogeneous group of diseases, although common features such as hyperproliferation, overexpression of certain growth factor receptors and deregulated vessel formation including leaky vasculature give the opportunity to target macromolecular drug and nucleic acid carriers to tumor tissue. Similar to other macromolecular drugs, nucleic acid carriers have to be designed to enable tumor targeting after systemic injection. Chemical modification of nucleic acids makes them resistant towards enzymatic degradation. Cationic lipids or polycations condense nucleic acids into small, virus-like structures and the surface modification with hydrophilic polymers allows passive accumulation in tumor tissue; tumor cell binding ligands allow cellular targeting. To avoid toxic side effects, biodegradable and biocompatible carriers were designed. The design of thermoresponsive gene carriers allowed their selective tumor accumulation by locoregional hyperthermia. As a therapeutic concept, tumor-specific delivery of antitumoral RNA was realized in an orthotopic brain tumor model. The combination of gene- and radio-therapy enabled selective accumulation of radionuclides in tumors and boosted antitumoral effects. Hence, combining a smart delivery concept for nucleic acids with a suitable therapeutic strategy will allow successful treatment of otherwise incurable malignant diseases.
