On the basis of analysis covering the documentation of I and II Pediatric Clinics--PMA in Szczecin, encompassing the Western Pomeranian region with respect to specialist care, material concerning proliferative diseases of hematopoietic system for 1979-1988 was collected. They were diagnosed in children under the age of 15 years. The material was divided into disease groups and subjected to mathematical-statistical analysis with due consideration given to the following parameters. Total incidence, morbidity according to sex, character of inhabited environment, also an analysis was carried out to define the interdependence between the appearance of acute leukemias as well as lymphomas, and selected factors of the child's family milieu. Differentiation of the coefficient was disclosed in morbidity among the children in the individual provinces of the studied regions. Statistically significant dependence was revealed between disclosure of acute leukemias, lymphomas and all the proliferative diseases on the one hand, and sex, character of environment inhabited by children, on the other (boys and rural children are affected more frequently). It has been found out that there is greater predisposition for acute leukemia and lymphoma to affect children suffering more frequently from bacterial infections of respiratory tract, and relationship was shown to exist between artificial feeding of children in the first 6 months of life, and the appearance of acute leukemias.
