The assumption of molecular epidemiology that carcinogens leave fingerprints has suggested that analysis of the frequency, type, and site of mutations in genes frequently altered in carcinogenesis may provide clues to the identification of the factors contributing to carcinogenesis. In this mini-review, we revise the development, and validation of the yeast-based p53 functional assay as a new tool for molecular epidemiology. We show that this assay has some very interesting virtues but also has some drawbacks. The yeast functional assay can be used to determine highly specific mutation fingerprints in the human p53 cDNA sequence. Discrimination is possible when comparing mutation spectra induced by sufficiently different mutagens. However, we also reported that the same carcinogen may induce distinguishable mutation spectra due to known influencing factors.
