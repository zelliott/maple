To report our experience with inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in pediatric patients.

Over a 19-month period, eight low-profile percutaneously introducible IVC filters were placed in four male and four female patients aged 6-16 years (mean 11 years). Indications were contraindication to heparin in six patients, anticoagulation failure in one, and idiopathic infrarenal IVC thrombosis in one. Six of the eight devices placed were titanium Greenfield filters. One LGM and one Bird's Nest filter were also placed. Two of the filters were introduced via the right internal jugular vein by cutdown, and the remainder were placed percutaneously via the right internal jugular vein or the right common femoral vein. Patients received follow-up abdominal radiographs from 2 to 13 months after IVC filter placement.

All filters were inserted successfully without complication. Three of the patients died during the follow-up period: two due to underlying brain tumors at 2 and 12 months and a third at 6 weeks due to progressive idiopathic renal vein and IVC thrombosis. The remaining five patients were all alive and well at follow-up without evidence of IVC thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, or filter migration.

IVC filter placement using available devices for percutaneous delivery is technically feasible, safe, and effective in children.
