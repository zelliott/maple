Bone marrow biopsies are now employed in the investigation of many disorders in haematology, oncology and internal medicine. This review provides a survey of the recent literature and a summary of observations made on undecalcified bone marrow biopsies embedded in plastic. The conditions investigated include osteopathies, myelopathies, haematologic and non-haematologic malignancies in the bone marrow. The interrelationship and interdependence of bone and bone marrow have been emphasized, and examples of the effects of diseases of bone on marrow, and of disturbancies of marrow function on bone, have been given. In the myelo- and lympho-proliferative disorders bone marrow biopsies contribute to diagnostic evaluation and classification, as well as to provide factors of prognostic significance. In the investigation of patients with solid tumours bone marrow biopsy may detect metastases in 20 per cent (bronchus), 35 per cent (prostate), 40 per cent (breast), to 80 per cent (unknown primaries) of the patients. Bone marrow biopsy constitutes an additional investigative parameter capable of providing valuable information in many different clinical situations.
