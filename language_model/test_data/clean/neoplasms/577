The understanding of passive transfer of cell mediated-immune responses with transfer factor and other cell free materials has progressed to the point that investigators are seeking the chemical identity of the molecule(s) that are responsible for these effects and are working on their mechanisms of action. In addition, clinical trials are underway that should clarify the potential for use of transfer factor in treatment of infections, neoplastic and autoimmune diseases. This chapter will critically review the past and current data concerning the components of transfer factor and their effects on immunologic and inflammatory reactions. Some of the recently developed animal models will be described and evaluated, and the clinical studies that have provided conclusive data regarding efficacy will be reviewed.
