Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein ( hnRNPs) is a widely expressing protein family in human body,which has a close relationship with health. HnRNPs takes part in the developing processes of many diseases such as viral diseases, tumor, autoimmune system diseases and so on. hnRNPs also regulates the expression of special genes such as cyp2a5, CYP2A6, eNOS. There are numerous proteins in vivo and hnRNPs links with them in numerous ways. Much work is needed to unclose the relationship between hnRNPs and related diseases or gene regulation.
