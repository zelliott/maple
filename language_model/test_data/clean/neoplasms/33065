Vinflunine (Javlor) is the first fluorinated microtubule inhibitor belonging to the Vinca alkaloids family. Vinflunine is obtained by semisynthesis using superacidic chemistry to selectively introduce two fluorine atoms at the 20' position of the catharanthine moiety. This compound has been selected for clinical development on the basis of encouraging preclinical activity that warrants study in patients with a wide spectrum of solid tumors. Clinically significant activity has been seen in phase II studies, mainly in the treatment of transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract, non-small cell lung cancer, and carcinoma of the breast. Vinflunine is currently in phase III trial assessment in patients with (second line) transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium and first-line advanced breast cancer. The efficacy of vinflunine in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with a platinum-containing regimen was confirmed by a large phase III trial.
