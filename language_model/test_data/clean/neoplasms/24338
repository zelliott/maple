To highlight key issues in the administration of cancer therapies that target the EGFR.

Published clinical trials of anti-EGFR therapy, secondary literature on the administration of anticancer drugs, and illustrative case study reports.

Anti-EGFR agents represent a new class of therapy. It is important for nurses to acquire familiarity with the specific issues related to the administration of anti-EGFR agents. Preparedness and active patient monitoring can minimize the impact of toxicities (including interstitial lung disease, infusion reactions, and metabolic alterations) and help ensure the delivery of full treatment courses.

Nurses familiar with the administration issues and the severe adverse events associated with anti-EGFR therapy will be better equipped to manage them effectively.
