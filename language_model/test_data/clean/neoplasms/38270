Some properties of the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of peripheral blood plasma were assessed in 153 employees of atomic industry enterprises. The contents of ribosomal repeat (rDNA) and its concentration in plasma increased in cfDNA of the group of persons in comparison with non-irradiated individuals. The contents of satellite III in cfDNA of donors and of irradiated persons do not differ and less than in DNA nucleus. The correlation between cumulative dose of radiation, contents of rDNA in cfDNA and the frequency of lymphocytes bearing mutations at T-cell receptor (TCR) locus was obtained. The definition of three indications in irradiated persons: the contents of ribosomal genes in cfDNA, TCR-mutant cell frequency and concentration of ribosomal genes in blood plasma--may be useful for revealing individuals in organism of which an intensive cell apoptosis takes place and there is an increased probability of carcinogenesis and of progress of disease of immune system.
