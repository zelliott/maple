The Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control is a stakeholder-driven initiative, led by a partnership between the Canadian Cancer Society, National Cancer Institute of Canada, Canadian Association of Provincial Cancer Agencies and Health Canada. The planning process began in January 1999 and currently involves more than 130 health professionals and community representatives who are volunteering their time, experience and expertise. A crucial aspect of the strategy's successful implementation is early participation of the provincial/territorial ministries of health in the planning process. Working groups are addressing 11 areas of the cancer continuum: prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, supportive care/rehabilitation, palliative care, pediatric cancer, research, human resource planning, surveillance and informatics/technology. Two stakeholder conferences will engage all cancer stakeholders in helping develop recommendations and establishing priorities for cancer control in Canada.
