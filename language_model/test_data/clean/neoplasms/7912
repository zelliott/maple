A model system employing a modified nylon matrix is described for the separation of rare cells titrated into either a leukaemic cell line or normal bone marrow. A 75- to 125-fold enrichment and recovery of the rare cell population was achieved, starting from an initial level of 0.014 to 0.2% of the total population. The rare cell population was identified by pre-labelling with Hoechst 33342, which intercalates into the DNA, and renders cells highly fluorescent. Separation and recovery of cells was totally dependent on the use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies binding to the labelled population. The nylon matrix, precoated with an anti-mouse immunoglobulin, traps the cells coated with monoclonal antibodies, and these can be released simply by gentle manipulation of the matrix. The matrix employed has been shown to not specifically trap committed bone marrow progenitors as determined by CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM assays. The use of this technique should simplify the isolation of rare tumour cells metastasizing to bone marrow.
