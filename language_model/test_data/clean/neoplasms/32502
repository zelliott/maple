Digene Corporation is a molecular diagnostics company that develops, manufactures and markets proprietary gene-based testing systems for the screening, monitoring and diagnosis of human diseases. The company's primary focus is in women's cancers and infectious diseases. Our proprietary, patented Hybrid Capture((R)) technology has been successfully applied to the development of diagnostic tests for human papillomavirus (HPV), Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, hepatitis B virus and cytomegalovirus. Digene's Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2) trade mark HPV DNA test has now been established as part of the standard of care for cervical cancer screening in the US. We are focusing our research and development activities on support and improvement of existing product lines as well as the development of several new products. We have several ongoing basic research programs with the goal of developing improved molecular diagnostic assay systems for the detection of HPV and other targets of interest in the area of women's cancers and infectious diseases. Digene's goal is to establish primary screening by the Hybrid Capture HPV DNA Test as the worldwide standard of care for cervical cancer screening.
