This research investigated complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use by Hawai'i cancer patients. Thirty-six percent of patients used CAM, most commonly religious/spiritual therapy and herbal treatments. CAM use was linked with younger age, female gender, Catholic religion, and more education. More research is needed to inform decision-making.
