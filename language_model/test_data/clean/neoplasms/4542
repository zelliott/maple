The pilot project brought to attention in this study aims to improve social integration and reintegration at school of pupils inflicted by cancer. The guidelines include an intensive, long-range individual care and accompanied visits in the patients' own classes. Conversations are offered by hospital-teachers and, eventually, by physicians in the classroom proper. This approach results in reducing fear, insecurity and ignorance of both school-mates and teachers at the school of origin, thus mediating better human implications facing children and adolescents involved. The experience attained from over 80 visits in schools of origin indicates that these contacts strengthen the patients' prospects and reduce their social and school-associated problems in terms of promotising their psycho-social conditions.
