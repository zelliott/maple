The relative distribution of T- and B-lymphocytes in the blood and in pleural or abdominal effusions was compared among 24 patients with fluid accumulation due to metastatic cancer and 8 patients without evidence of cancer. The data obtained indicated that the mean percentage of T-lymphocytes in malignant effusions was significantly greater than that in the peripheral blood of the same patients. At the same time, the mean eprcentage of B-lymphocytes was decreased in malignant effusions when compared with peripheral blood. Neither of these differences was observed when effusions and blood of patients with nonmalignant effusions were compared. In addition, patients with both types of effusions had fewer total lymphocytes in their blood than did normal control patients, whereas those with cancer-associated effusions had an increased proportion of active T-lymphocytes in their blood.
