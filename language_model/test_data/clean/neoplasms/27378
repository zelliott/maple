Opportunistic fungal infections and antibiotic-refractory bacterial infections remain important causes of morbidity and mortality in neutropenic individuals. Furthermore, the expanding use of dose-intensive cancer treatment strategies has increased the frequency of prolonged neutropenia. Therefore, the transfusion of granulocytes should be a logical therapeutic approach. Substantial progress has been made in the field of granulocyte transfusion therapy during the past decade. Interest in granulocyte transfusion therapy has been rekindled by both the use of hematopoietic growth factors to mobilize neutrophils and modern leukapheresis techniques. Moreover, promising results were observed in the use of community donors and in granulocyte storage experiments, which could enhance the ability of blood banks for institution of granulocyte concentrates. Recent clinical trials suggest that granulocyte transfusion therapy may be effective and well-tolerated in the neutropenic patient affected by life-threatening infections. These results must be confirmed in controlled, clinical trials.
