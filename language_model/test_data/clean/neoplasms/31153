We have provided home treatment mainly for cancer patients since June 1995 and had 7 such patients until March 1996. Among them two patients died not at home but in the hospital, although the patients and their family understood that the patients were in the terminal stage of illness. It home was thought to be difficult that they accept death at their homes. From the standpoint of physical and mental conditions, social status and actual medical care, the factors to promote death at home were examined. The two cases mentioned above and their families wished to have treatment at home. The reasons why we decided to discontinue medical care at their homes were twofold: 1) the difficulty of palliating patients' symptoms and anxiety; and 2) the uneasiness of the family in caring for patients at home. Therefore sufficient palliation of symptoms and "death education" for patients and families are required to encourage death at home.
