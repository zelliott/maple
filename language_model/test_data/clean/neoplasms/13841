The Swedish Cancer Environment Register (CER) was used to analyze occupational risks of cancer over time. Using expanded time coverage (1961-1984) and two census-based sources in employment information, risk in the work environment was evaluated for a 24-year period for pleural mesothelioma, nasal adenocarcinoma, and non-melanotic skin cancer. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for pleural mesotheliomas were found to increase among plumbers and pipefitters over this period, whereas those for mechanics, electricians, painters, and paperhangers remained relatively stable. Risk for nasal adenocarcinoma among cabinet makers remained exceedingly high over the 24-year period and SIRs for other kinds of woodworkers moderately increased during the same time. Excess skin cancer risk among physicians declined over the period. Reasons for these trends are discussed as well as the limitations and potential of register epidemiology in the evaluation of cancer trends in the work environment.
