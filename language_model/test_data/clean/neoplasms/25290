Flow cytometry (FCM) allows the rapid measurement of a variety of physical and biochemical properties of individual cells suspended in a liquid medium. Recent developments now allow FCM to assess cellular properties with a speed and precision unobtainable by any other means. Because of its multiple capabilities, FCM is being used for ever greater numbers of applications, in both basic and applied biology, and its expected soon to be widely used in the clinical laboratory.
