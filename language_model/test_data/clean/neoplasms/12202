It is currently estimated that &gt; 50% of all patients diagnosed with cancer explore complementary and alternative medicine - especially herbal medicine. We conducted a comprehensive review to assess the safety and efficacy of herbal medicines commonly used by patients in an attempt to: prevent cancer; treat cancer; and treat adverse effects associated with conventional cancer treatments. Current evidence suggests that Asian ginseng, garlic, green tea, tomatoes and soy intake as part of the diet may be useful in preventing various cancers; additional research is needed in order to determine the efficacy of essiac, evening primrose oil, mistletoe, reishi, shiitake and turmeric as cancer treatments; and ginger may be effective in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
