Prevention of human cancer in the future will depend on using the results of epidemiologic and animal studies and strategies to minimize exposure. Changes are occurring in the area of animal testing and research that potentially represent significant steps toward reducing our dependence on the traditional 2-year bioassay as our primary tool for identification of chemical carcinogens and management of risk. Efforts to prevent cancer would be enhanced by more attention to describing modes of action so that the development of tumors would not be the only basis for predicting carcinogenic potential. These markers might also serve for early detection of cancer at a stage more amenable to treatment. What carcinogens do we want to detect through animal tests in the future? Whether the goal is to identify weak or potent carcinogens, or both, there will still be a need for 2-year bioassays, but hopefully for confirmatory rather than screening purposes.
