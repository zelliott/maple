In less than ten years, the study of inherited conditions predisposing to cancer led to major discoveries on the basic mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Those investigations have permitted to discover a new class of cancer genes now named "suppressor" genes (or antioncogenes), and to demonstrate their implication in the majority of cancer including the sporadic one's. Those studies have indicated that familial forms of cancer can also result from alterations of a set of genes controlling genomic stability. In clinical practice, the identification of the molecular basis of major forms of inherited predisposition to cancer, has allowed to better define those cancer syndromes. As a consequence, it is now possible to propose to the at risk individuals, and their families, screening protocols based on precise estimate of their genetic risk.
