Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and its receptor KGFR play a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival, in response to injury and tissue repair. Altered expression of this pathway in cancer opened the way to the development of targeted therapy to achieve KGFR inhibition. Nevertheless, KGF administration has been demonstrated to ameliorate oral mucositis resulting from chemoradiotherapy, besides protecting epithelial cells against radiation-induced damage.

This review focuses on the potential therapeutic interest of KGF/KGFR in two different areas: selective inhibition of KGFR signaling for the treatment of cancers characterized by upregulation of this pathway and administration of KGF to protect epithelial cells from induced damage. The review presents an overview of therapeutic strategies in both directions.

KGF/KGFR signaling can contribute to enhancing the malignant potential of epithelial cells and to promoting tumorigenesis. On the other hand, the therapeutic use of KGF in cancer patients provides epithelial protection, reducing chemotherapy side effects. FGFRs have become attractive antitumor targets and various inhibitors have been used to contrast tumor cell growth. The identification of KGFR-specific molecules might represent a promising therapeutic strategy that could increase the window of available agents and treatment methods.
