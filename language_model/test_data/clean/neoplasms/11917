TNM classification is a short description of a cancer at a point in its natural history--the onset of definitive treatment--and should be considered in planning treatment, in assessing prognosis, in evaluating end results, in facilitating the exchange of information between treatment centres and thus in contributing to the continuing investigation of human cancer. For four cancers of urologic sites there are new TNM classifications. Although previous classifications of bladder cancer were satisfactory, the new classifications for kidney, prostate and testis are the first internationally accepted classifications for these three organs that are clinically practical. Widespread use of these classifications is recommended.
