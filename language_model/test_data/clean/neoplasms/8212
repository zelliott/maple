Taurolidine is an antimicrobial agent that was originally used in the local treatment of peritonitis and was shown to be effective in the prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI). In this pilot study, we used taurolidine solution as an intravenous (i.v.) lock into the totally implantable intravascular devices of 11 consecutive oncological patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections not responding to systemic antimicrobial chemotherapy. All patients recovered completely from the infection. No adverse drug effects were seen. Three patients were successfully retreated for a recurrent infection. Our data suggest a beneficial role of taurolidine i.v. lock for the therapy of catheter-related bloodstream infections in oncological patients. Taurolidine i.v. lock application is feasible and could especially be useful in infections resistant to antibiotic chemotherapy.
