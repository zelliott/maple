TNF-alpha and IL-6 are multipotential mediators involved in the control of many host's reactions to tumour. Their biological effects are mediated through the membrane-bound receptors (TNFRp55, TNFRp75 and IL-16R respectively) which can exist in soluble forms. In the present study we compared release of soluble sTNFRp55, sTNFRp75 and sIL-6R with expression of their membrane-bound on PMN and PBMC. Cells were isolated from patients with cancer diseases with a different location and histological classification. We have found that alterations of membrane-bound TNFRp75 expression and in the secretion of soluble TNFRp75 form, as opposed to other receptors examined, are characteristic features of neutrophils and mononuclear cells isolated from cancer patients. The similar changes observed in the expression of TNFRp75 by PMN and PBMC appear to confirm a significant role of PMN in the tumour response mediated by TNF-alpha. Furthermore, the altered membrane-bound TNFRp75 expression and sTNFRp75 secretion appear to depend on the tumour type.
