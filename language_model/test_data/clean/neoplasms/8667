In highly developed countries the prophylactic medical examinations to evaluate health effects of exposure and general health condition of the workers started early in the past. Nowadays, there is an increasing trend of developing new methods for early detection of occupational and work--related diseases. Thus the individuals oversensitive to the agents of the working environment could be prevented from exposure. However, the gap between the capacities that the new methods offer theoretically and their actual application in the prophylactic examinations still remains quite large. Part I of the present study has been devoted to three essential problems of public concern which have been specified in the paper's subtitles.
