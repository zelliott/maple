In this paper, we report a new strategy of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) by using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as efficient long-range energy acceptor in sandwich immunoassays. In the design of CRET system, we chose the highly sensitive chemiluminescence (CL) reaction of luminol and hydrogen peroxide catalysed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) because the CL spectrum of luminol (Î»(max) 425 nm) partially overlaps with the visible absorption bands of AuNPs. On the basis of CRET strategy, we developed a sandwich immunoassay of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) cancer marker. In immunoassay, two antibodies (anti-AFP-1 and anti-AFP-2) were conjugated to AuNPs and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), respectively. The sandwich-type immunoreactions between the AFP (antigen) and the two different antibodies bridged the donors (luminol) and acceptors (AuNPs), which led to the occurrence of CRET from luminol to AuNPs upon chemiluminescent reaction. We observed that the quenching of chemiluminescence signal depended linearly on the AFP concentration within a range of concentration from 5 to 70 ng mL(-1) and the detection limit of AFP was 2.5 ng mL(-1). Our method was successfully applied for determination of AFP levels in sera from cancer patients, and the results were in good agreement with ELISA assays. This approach is expected to be extended to other assay designs, that is, using other antibodies, analytes, chemiluminescent substance, and even other metallic nanoparticles.
