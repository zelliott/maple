The design and optimization of p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitors has attracted a great deal of interest in the development of new anticancer agents. Systematical 2D-QSAR studies on 98 isoindolinone-based p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitors were carried out using linear and the non-linear mathematical methods. At first, a forward stepwise-multiple linear regression model (FS-MLR) was proposed with reasonable statistical parameters (R(2)(train) =0.881, Q(2)(loo) =0.847, R(2)(test) =0.854). Then, enhanced replacement method-multiple linear regression (ERM-MLR) and support vector machine regression (SVMR) were applied to set up more accurate models (ERM-MLR: R(2)(train) =0.914, Q(2)(loo) =0.894 and R(2)(test) =0.903; SVMR: R(2)(train) =0.924, Q(2)(loo) =0.920 and R(test) (2) of 0.874). Furthermore, the reliability and application value of the ERM and SVMR model was also validated in virtual screening through receiver operating characteristic studies.
