A mouse monoclonal antibody (mAB 22-II-D8B) raised against lysed transformed human amnion cells (AMA) has been characterized. The mAB decorated the Golgi apparatus in growing and quiescent cultured monolayer cells (fibroblasts and epithelial cells) of various species as determined by double immunofluorescence labeling and colocalization with galactosyltransferase antibodies. It reacted with the acidic human proteins IEF 58 (Mr = 29,000) and 57a, respectively (Mr = 30,000) (HeLa protein catalogue number; [(1982) Clin. Chem. 28, 766]), Golgi staining was also observed in BS-C-1 cells microinjected with mAB 22-II-D8B suggesting that the epitopes recognized by the antibody are most likely located on the cytoplasmic face of the membranes. The precise localization of the antigens to the various cisternae of the Golgi apparatus could not be demonstrated by immunogold cytochemistry on ultrathin cryosections due to either weak reactivity of the antibody or low concentration of the antigens. Immunofluorescence staining with mAB 22-II-D8B of lymphoid human Molt-4 cells and some human tissues failed to reveal any significant staining even though these expressed high levels of both IEF 58 and 57a. These results are taken to imply that the epitopes recognized by mAB 22-II-D8B may be masked in some cell types.
