The frequency and distribution of rare and common chromosomal fragile sites in metaphases derived from peripheral lymphocytes were compared in 26 patients with malignant solid tumours and 24 normal controls. In order to avoid bias in evaluation, the identity of each individual as patient or control was disclosed only after the study was completed. Rare heritable folic acid inducible fragile sites were found in five patients (2q13; 6p23; 8q22; 16p12) and two controls (8q22). Common fragile sites were present in 21 of 26 patients and in 19 of 24 controls. These differences are statistically not significant in the Fisher test. We conclude that the expression of fragile sites does not indicate a predisposition for solid tumours.
