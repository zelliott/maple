To determine differences in screening for routine physical exam and cancers among Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Cambodian Americans.

The sample consisted of 2011 participants. Chi square was used to identify relationships between demographic/acculturation factors and screenings.

Never-screened rates were high for all Asian subgroups. Never-screened rates for mammography ranged from 20.1% to 78.5% for Pap test, 28% to 75.6% for prostate cancer, 56.7% to 97% for colorectal cancer, 65.3% to 94.9%. Koreans had the highest never screened for health checkups (34.7%).

Efforts should be made to comply with screening guidelines among Asian Americans.
