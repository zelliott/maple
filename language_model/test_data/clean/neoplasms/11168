Angiogenesis is critical to solid tumor growth; therefore, understanding how blood vessels form within a developing tumor has become a principal, yet challenging, objective. The recent discovery that deletion of the water channel protein, aquaporin-1, impairs tumor angiogenesis provides novel insights into the mechanisms governing the neovascularization and growth of tumors.
