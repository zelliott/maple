Medications that can selectively target tumors at the same time avoid access of the drug to nontarget areas, employ utilization of homing devices termed as ligands, that can bind to specific epitopes expressed on the surface of the necrotic mass of cells. Molecular signatures for transferrin, Epidermal Growth Factor, Sialic Lewis and folic acid are expressed on the surface of these cells. Dendrimers are nanosized, non-immunogenic, and hyper-branched vehicles that can be efficiently tailored for spatial distribution of bioactives, thereby reducing untoward cytotoxicity on normal cells. These nanoparticulate drug delivery vehicles provide a unique platform that has precisely placed functional groups so that multiple copies of ligands can be attached to it and facilitate targeting to the tumor surface or neo-vascularizing vessels proliferating around these cells. The article reviews the scope of ligand based dendritic system as a prospective for delivery of anti-cancer drugs, via active targeting with interception of minimal side effects.
