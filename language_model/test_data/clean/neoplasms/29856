Fine needle aspiration biopsy and subsequent histopathologic examination was done in 69 patients with bone tumors. In 83% of the cases, the cytologic diagnoses were in complete agreement with the histopathologic diagnoses. In the remaining aspirations, the cytologic diagnosis could not be made, mostly due to a paucity of cells on the smears.
