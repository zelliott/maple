Traditional education methods for physicians have failed to impact positively upon cancer pain clinical practice. This article presents a new paradigm for physician cancer pain education based on principles of adult learning and physician behavior theory. Three key issues that weave together education and institutionalization issues are reviewed: (a) how to make physicians aware that their current practice behavior is less than optimal; (b) how to match education objectives with appropriate education formats; and (c) how to change pain management practices without imposing new burdens on physician practice.
