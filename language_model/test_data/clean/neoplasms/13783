Monoclonal antibody (McAb) 3H11 can specifically bind to different cancer cells from different tissues. Meanwhile, McAb 3H11 labeled with radioactive isotopes has been successfully applied to detect primary cancer and metastatic cancer in clinical imaging. Molecular cloning of the antigen recognized by McAb 3H11 will be significant for understanding tumor development.

Based on the fragment of the McAb 3H11 antigen cloned by Immunoscreening MGC803 cDNA expression library, the whole length of the cDNA molecule was gotten by RACE and nested PCR.

Sequence data of the cDNA molecule indicates that there was no homologous gene in GenBank. Northern blot experiments showed that mRNA of McAb 3H11 antigen extensively distributes in different cancer cells and tissues but not in corresponding normal tissues. Moreover in producing antibodies of the antigen expressed prokaryotically, it was found that the immunogenicity of the antigen was quite low in mammalian.

The antigen recognized by McAb 3H11 acts as a regulator in embryo cells and regains expression in tumor cells; and it may be associated with low differentiation and high proliferation.
