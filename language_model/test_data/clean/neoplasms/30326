We sought to verify the hypothesis that children and young adults with cancer who have completed treatment differ according to the type and degree of renal damage.

This study included 144 children and young adults (73 female) who had completed treatment for leukemias and lymphomas (group L, n=45), Wilms tumor (group W, n=52) and other solid tumors (group S, n=47). The following parameters were evaluated: serum concentrations of creatinine, cystatin C, β2-microglobulin, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and urine excretion of albumin, and urinalysis with sediment. Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated using the classic Schwartz (eGFRSch), Schwartz redux (eGFRSchred), and Filler (eGFRFiller) formulas and with the new Schwartz equation for patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFRSchCKD).

Group S had the lowest eGFRSchCKD and eGFRFiller, the highest serum cystatin C and the highest albumin excretion compared with groups L and W. Groups S and W had lower eGFRSch and eGFRSchred and higher serum β2-microglobulin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin compared with group L. Group W had lower eGFRSchCKD than group L.

Children and young adults with cancer who have completed treatment differ in the type and degree of renal damage they sustain.
