Lymphedema (LE) is described as chronic swelling caused by impairment in lymphatic system drainage. The cause of LE is either primary or secondary (Holcomb, 2006). The experience can be disturbing. Patients and healthcare providers often overlook the initial presentation because of subtle changes. With a basic understanding of LE, oncology nurses can monitor for the presence, educate about preventive measures, and assist in treatment of LE.
