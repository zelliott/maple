Advances in cancer pain research and management are an example of the advances that have occurred within the field of neuro-oncology, the medical discipline that includes the diagnosis and treatment of primary central nervous system neoplasms, metastatic and nonmetastatic neurological complications of cancer originating outside the nervous system, and pain associated with cancer. Progress in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, coupled with advances in our understanding of the anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and psychology of pain perception, has led to improved care of the patient with pain of malignant origin. Currently, specialized methods of cancer diagnosis and treatment provide the most direct approach to treating cancer pain by treating the cause of the pain. Yet, before the introduction of successful antitumor therapy, when treatment of the cause of the pain has failed or when injury to bone, soft tissue, or nerve has occurred as a result of therapy, appropriate pain management is essential.
