During a study on intestinal parasitic infections in immunocompromized patients complaining of diarrhoea, a parasite belonging to the Phylum Myxozoa described from human samples was identified in three stool samples out of eleven. On staining with modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain the spores were identified. They were pyriform in shape with an average size 14.0 micro x 10.0 micro. Every spore has thick wall and one suture in the anterior third followed by two polar capsules. Each polar capsule has about four to five coils ending by polar filaments at the suture level. The size of the polar capsule is 2.5x 3.5 micro. Co-infection with Cryptosporidium parvum parasite was also found in one stool sample and Giardia lamblia cysts in the second sample and Hymenolepsis nana eggs in the third sample. So, the pathogenicity of Myxozoa was not role out as the three co-infected parasites cause diarrhea.
