It has been well documented that patients with a diagnosis of cancer are at an increased risk of committing suicide. However, there is a paucity of literature on the risk of suicide in the head and neck cancer patient. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the incidence of suicide and expressed suicidal intent in a series of such cancer patients.

A retrospective chart review of 241 patients who were diagnosed with head and neck cancer at the University of Maryland Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Oncology Division was done.

Three patients were identified who committed suicide, 1.2% of the series. Two patients expressed suicidal intent, and four patients refused all treatment and counseling, preferring to die of their disease.

Head and neck cancer patients have many of the same risk factors for suicide as patients with other forms of cancer. To reduce this risk, it is essential that the surgeon maintain good rapport with the patient, because this serves as a foundation for all other aspects of their therapy. In addition, these patients need to be fully evaluated for depression, hopelessness, pain, and other factors important in raising the possibility of suicide, and appropriate, aggressive management must be provided.
