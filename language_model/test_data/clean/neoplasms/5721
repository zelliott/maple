Clinical approbation of human recombinant yeast human interleukin-2 (rIL-2) was carried out in 10 patients with III-IV stages of tumor that have undergone 65 intravenous drop by drop infusions of the drug as a course of 5-11 injections in the dosage of 1-8 mln/un. The drug toxicity was shown in 4 mln and especially, in 8 mln/un dose administration. That's why the dose of 1-2 mln/un is recommended. This dose was not followed by any serious complications, and the number of slightly complicated cases was significantly decreased as compared to similar rIL-2 drug made by the "Cetus Corporation" firm. Immunostimulating effect of yeast rIL-2 was found which appeared to be able to reach it's maximum by 3-4 administrations, with it's following disappearance or inversion, which may cause immunosuppression.
