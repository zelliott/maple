Microfilariae were observed during routine cytopathologic or histopathologic examination of tumor tissue from six neoplasms. Subsequent to the detection of the parasite in smears or sections, repeated examination of night blood smears from these patients demonstrated microfilariae in only one case of squamous-cell carcinoma of the cervix. Histopathologic examination of the serial sections revealed different types of unrelated tumors, but no microfilariae could be demonstrated except in one case of hemangioblastoma of the cerebellum.
