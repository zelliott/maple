A series of sulfonamides incorporating 4-thioureido-benzolamide moieties have been prepared from aminobenzolamide and thiophosgene followed by the reaction of the thiocyanato intermediate with aliphatic/aromatic amines or hydrazines. The new derivatives have been investigated as inhibitors of the zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1), and more precisely of the cytosolic isozymes hCA I and II, as well as the tumor-associated isozyme hCA IX (all of human origin). The new compounds showed excellent inhibitory properties against all three isozymes with inhibition constants in the range of 0.6-62 nM against hCA I, 0.5-1.7 nM against hCA II and 3.2-23 nM against hCA IX, respectively. These derivatives are interesting candidates for the development of novel therapies targeting hypoxic tumors.
