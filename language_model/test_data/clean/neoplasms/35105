Insufficient clinical data given to pathologists often hamper the differentiation of inflammatory muscle diseases. Thus we proved the value of a classification based only upon morphological criteria. Among 160 biopsies with myositic pattern (4.9% of a series of 3264 muscle biopsies) we could distinguish the following groups: Interstitial inflammation with only few fibre necroses (17.6%), predominance of fibre necroses with few inflammatory infiltrates (38.1%), small vessel vasculitis (20.0%), arteritis (13.1%), granulomatous myositis (8.8%) and polymorphonuclear leukocytic infiltrates (2.6%). This classification is compared with the used clinical diagnoses. Some special morphological aspects (histometric and immunocytologic examinations, tissue calcification, inclusion bodies, neurogenic atrophies) are analysed and so are some clinical peculiarities (e.g. malignoma-association, differentiation of mixed connective tissue syndrome, drug-induced reactions). The diagnostic value of purely morphologic criteria is restricted. For better diagnostic work a great number of clinical informations is required. Nevertheless, certain morphological patterns give important directions, e.g. to occult malignoma.
