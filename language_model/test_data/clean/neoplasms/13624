Cellular therapy is defined as the transfer, to the intact host, of living cells with the intent of introducing new host functions or correcting defective functions. The appeal and the promise of cellular therapy derive from the ability to manipulate, ex vivo, cellular and molecular biologic pathways in a way that is not possible in the intact organism.
