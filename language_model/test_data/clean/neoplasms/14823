Neprilysin (NEP, CD10, CALLA-common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen, neutral endopeptidase, enkephalinase) is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase, which is involved in the metabolism of a number of regulatory peptides and plays an important role in turning off peptide signalling at the cell surface. Neprilysin is involved in many physiological and pathological processes in organism. It regulates blood pressure and inflammatory response, takes part in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, influences cellular proliferation and differentiation, as well as neoplastic progression.
