In a histological survey of 244 tumerous growths from 155 horses, the tumours commonly found were fibromas, squamous cell carcinomas, sarcoids and papillomas, most frequently affecting the skin, external genitalia, eye and orbit. The histological features that differentiate fibroblastic citaneous growths are detailed so that the clinical behaviour of these distinct neoplasms can be studied.
