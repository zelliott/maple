The CCATT/enhancer binding protein alpha, C/EBPalpha, is a key transcription factor involved in late differentiation events of several cell types. Besides acting as a classical transcription factor, C/EBPalpha is also a well-characterized inhibitor of mitotic growth in most cell lines tested. In line with its anti-mitotic properties, C/EBPalpha has been shown to interact with, and alter the activities of, several cell cycle related proteins and a number of models as to the mechanistics of C/EBPalpha-mediated growth repression have been proposed. More recently, several reports have indicated that C/EBPalpha acts as a tumour suppressor in the hematopoietic system and that mutation within C/EBPalpha is sufficient to induce tumourigenesis. Here, we will review these data and probe the possibility that C/EBPalpha also act as a tumour suppressor in other C/EBPalpha-expressing tissues.
