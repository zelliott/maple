Qualitative and quantitative methods can be used simultaneously for hypothesis generation and testing. A pilot study was conducted in 1991 in three rural Colorado communities to clarify health service delivery problems related to cancer. The analysis focused on the perceptions of three types of respondents in each community related to whether cancer was a major problem, whether health services were adequate in their community, and what perceived solutions could be implemented. Respondents included community influentials, health care providers, and cancer patients or family members. Semistructured phone interviews were used to collect perceptions of these community members. Transcripts from the three communities were combined, coded, and tallied. Several distinct themes emerged from the analysis. These included: cancer was a major problem; public and provider education was needed; community systems and support to identify and solve health problems were lacking; medical networking needed to be expanded; transportation was a problem for remote communities; inability to pay for services was a problem for rural communities. Most respondents identified the problems as relevant to other chronic and acute diseases as well as cancer. This method identified the critical problems for the majority of the people without losing sight of the outlier responses.
