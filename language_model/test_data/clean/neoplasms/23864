The guidelines for early cancer detection of the American Cancer Society are critically reviewed. It is concluded that only for some elements of the guidelines relating to breast, cervix and colorectal cancer is there good evidence of effectiveness sufficient for public health policy. However, for breast cancer screening under the age of 50, and prostate cancer screening at any age, the evidence currently does not justify the approaches recommended by the Society.
