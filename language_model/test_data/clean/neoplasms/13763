The twentieth century has witnessed the discovery of the various genetic alterations that drive a normal cell toward neoplasia. One the challenge of the near future concerns the diagnostic of these alterations and their correlation with clinical parameters such as response to therapy or survival. It will be important to define, for each patient, a specific profile of the various alterations in order to improve and personalize the therapy. It is also essential to understand the various mechanisms of these alterations in order to develop new diagnostic procedures. Furthermore, the relation between genotype and phenotype is not straightforward and can be influence by various parameters such as the localization of the mutation, alterations of other genes or the expression of modifiers genes.
