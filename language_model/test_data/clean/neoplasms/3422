Conditionally replicating (oncolytic) viruses, which selectively replicate in tumor cells but not in normal cells, show great promise as antitumor agents for cancer therapy. The principal antitumor activity of these viruses derives from their replication within tumor cells, which results in cell destruction and the production of progeny virions that can spread to adjacent tumor cells. However, one potential limitation of this approach is that viral gene deletions conferring tumor selectivity also result frequently in reduced potency of the virus in tumors. Therefore, strategies designed to enhance the potency of current oncolytic viruses will likely increase their chance of clinical success. Here we report the construction of an oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV) of which the infection also causes strong cell membrane fusion (syncytial formation). In vitro characterization on a variety of human tumor cells of different tissue origins showed that the plaques from this virus (Fu-10) are phenotypically unique and are significantly larger than those from the parental G207 virus, a well-characterized oncolytic HSV lacking fusogenic function. Furthermore, the syncytial formation caused by this virus depended on HSV replication, indicating that cell membrane fusion will only occur in dividing cells (such as tumor cells) where the virus can undergo a full infection cycle but not in normal cells where the viral replication is restricted. Systemic administration of Fu-10 into mice with established lung metastatic breast cancer resulted in a dramatic therapeutic effect. These studies demonstrate that incorporation of fusogenic function into an oncolytic virus can significantly increase the potency of viral oncolysis; this may lead to an enhanced clinical performance, especially in late-stage cancer patients.
