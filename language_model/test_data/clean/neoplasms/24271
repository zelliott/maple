The association between cancer and dependence was estimated using a cross-sectional study among persons 75 years of age or-older in Tarn county (area with a cancer registry recognized by the National Committee of Registries). A representative random sample stratified on age, sex, and size of district, was drawn using the electoral registers. Each person randomly selected answered the questions of a surveyor about previous history of cancer, aid in daily life activities and use of health care. Among 5,161, the questionnaire was filled for 3,368 persons (participation: 65.3%). Only 2.3% declared a past history of cancer (cancers diagnosed before 1982 and cancers of the skin excluded). After verification 12.6% of the men and 5.2% of the women in the sample were found in the registry. This result shows a very high tendency for people not to declare their disease. From 75 years of age, 1 man among 8, and 1 woman among 20 suffer or have suffered from a cancer during the last 12 years. Only a weak association between prevalence of cancer and aid in daily life activities could be found, probably explained by the important polymorbidity existing in this age group. The persons who suffered from cancer, are not more often confined in bed or in old people's home. Regarding use of health care, they see a nurse or their general practitioner more frequently, they have been operated or admitted in the hospital more frequently than persons without a past history of cancer. Persons with a past history of ear-nose-throat cancer differ from other cancers by needing more aid to go out of their home, and by taking medical advice more frequently. Except for the ear-nose-throat cases, cancer (aside from the acute stage) does not generate more dependence or hinder the quality of survival, in comparison to those of people of the same age.
