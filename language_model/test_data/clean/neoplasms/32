Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising new diagnostic modality that is well suited for the evaluation of children with hematological or oncological diagnosis. The side effects of ionizing radiation are avoided, the tomographic pathological anatomy in three orthogonal planes can be obtained, and differences between normal and abnormal tissues are often present. In order to present our preliminary clinical experience with MRI in pediatric hematology and oncology, the historical background of MRI, the technique, and possibilities for tissue characterization are reviewed.
