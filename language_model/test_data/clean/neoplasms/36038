These analyses examine a) survival from the start of renal replacement therapy (RRT), based on the total incident UK RRT population reported to the UK Renal Registry, including the 18% who started on PD and the 7% who received a pre-emptive transplant and b) survival of prevalent patients. Changes in survival between 1997 and 2009 are also reported.

Survival of incident patients (starting RRT during 2009) was calculated both from the start of RRT and from 90 days after starting RRT, both with and without censoring at transplantation. Survival of prevalent dialysis patients was calculated to exclude patients once they were transplanted. Both Kaplan-Meier and Cox adjusted models were used to calculate survival. Causes of death were analysed for both groups. Relative risk of death was calculated compared with the general UK population.

The 2009 unadjusted 1 year after 90 day survival for patients starting RRT was 86.6% (87.3% in 2008). In incident patients aged 18-64, the unadjusted 1 year survival had increased from 86.0% in 1997 to 91.3% in 2009. In incident patients aged â‰¥ 65, unadjusted 1 year survival had improved from 64.1% to 76.2%. There were no survival differences between genders. The relative risk of death compared to the general population decreased from 25 times at age 30-34 to 2.7 times at age 85+. Cause of death data completeness has improved 18% since last year. Cardiac disease is the most common cause of death in prevalent dialysis patients and malignancy most frequent in prevalent transplant patients.

Survival of patients starting RRT has improved for all ages since 1997. The frequency of cardiac disease as the cause of death has decreased since 1997.
