Geriatric oncology is defined by the multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach of the elderly cancer patients. Autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice are the four fundamental principles on which are based the treatment objectives and practical management of these patients. The comprehensive geriatric assessment is the tool the most likely to detect the functional problems in these elderly patients. The standard oncologic managements of cancer are applicable to these patients. However treatment plan and geriatric interventions must be tailored to each individual patient characteristics. Thus a strong interdependence between oncologic and geriatric teams is warranted. This implies specific teaching programs during initial medical studies and in the setting of continuous medical education. Furthermore, such worldwide teaching programs may help to the implementation of geriatric oncology programs which is only based, to date, on personal experiences as described in this report.
