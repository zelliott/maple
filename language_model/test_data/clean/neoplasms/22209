Fibroids are a benign gynecologic disorder, sometimes asymptomatic, but often accompanied by bleeding, leukorrhea, pain, dysuria, or constipation.  For differential diagnosis hysterometry, endometrial aspiration, hysterography, hematology, or urography may be required.  Appropriate therapy may be physical therapy, surgery, (hysterectomy, myomectomy), progestagens, or amino-caproic acid, depending on location, extent of the lesion, and age and desires of the patient.  Myomectomy may permit childbearing in a woman sterile because of fibroids.
