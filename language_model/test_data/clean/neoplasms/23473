The great majority of cancer deaths are due to metastasis, which remains a poorly understood pathological process. The formation of a metastasis reflects a succession of complex steps leading to the macroscopic outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells at the secondary site. In the past 5Â years, certain microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to regulate either a single step or multiple steps of metastasis, doing so by downregulating the expression of their target genes. In this review, we discuss recent studies on the functions and molecular mechanisms of miRNAs in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis.
