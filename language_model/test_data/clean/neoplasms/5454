Xerostomia causes a great deal of morbidity in patients with advanced cancer. However, it is an area which has received little attention. Indeed current management of xerostomia in palliative care units is based largely on anecdotal evidence. There are a number of studies in progress specifically looking at patients with advanced cancer, but until these are published we should take note of studies done in other patient groups. This article reviews the medical literature on the symptomatic management of xerostomia as a whole, with particular reference to treatments that are currently available in the United Kingdom.
