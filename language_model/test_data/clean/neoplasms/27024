Five new quinolone alkaloids, euocarpines A-E (16-20), four new natural products (1, 4, 12, and 14), and eleven known natural products were isolated from the fruits of Evodia rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated based on spectroscopic evidence. All compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against three strains and for their cytotoxic activity against four human tumor cell lines. The results revealed that 5, 7-11, 13, 14, and 16-20 exhibited moderate antibacterial activities (MIC values: 4-128 μg/mL), and 9, 11, 14, and 17 exhibited moderate cytotoxic activities against HepG-2, Hela, BEL7402, and BEL7403 (IC50 values: 15.85-56.36 μM).
