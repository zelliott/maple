A retrospective analysis of 54 patients with a peritoneovenous shunt inserted to control massive ascites refractory to conventional medical treatment is presented. The cause of ascites was hepatic in 29 patients (Group 1, 54 percent), malignant in 13 (Group 2, 24 percent), and nephrogenic in 12 (Group 3, 22 percent). The peritoneovenous shunt failed in 11 patients (20 percent): 6 in Group 1, 3 in Group 2, and 2 in Group 3. Shunt outflow obstruction (thrombosis) was the principal cause. Systemic sepsis in five patients and variceal hemorrhage in three were the factors responsible for most of the deaths (22 percent). Of the 42 patients who survived operation, the peritoneovenous shunt was effective in controlling the massive ascites in 37 (86 percent). Eight patients (15 percent), four with hepatic and four with nephrogenic ascites, survived 3 years or more without ascites. Removal of at least 50 to 70 percent of ascitic fluid at the time of shunt insertion was considered an important factor in decreasing morbidity and mortality. A peritoneovenous shunt can be effective for a long-term period in controlling massive ascites with an hepatic or nephrogenic cause in a selected group of patients; however, in patients with malignant ascites, although the benefit was substantial in half, the survival period did not exceed 6 months.
