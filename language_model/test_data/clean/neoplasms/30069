Hypoxia-inducing transcription factor-1α (HIF-1α) in hypoxic tumors induces the TNF receptor family member CD137 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This can be exploited for intratumoral low-dose injection of effective systemic immunotherapy with agonist CD137-specific monoclonal antibodies that induce circulation of systemic tumor-specific effector T cells capable of eradicating distant metastases.
