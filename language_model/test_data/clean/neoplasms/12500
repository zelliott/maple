The biological effect induced in the cell by a fixed dose of radiotherapy (e.g. 1 Gy) can be increased, reduced or significantly altered when chemotherapeutic or hormonal agents interact. A different timing of the combination between chemo/hormonotherapy and radiotherapy may also influence the cascade of effects induced by the dose of 1 Gy. Furthermore, patient, tumor and treatment-related factors are individual parameters which should be carefully considered for their potential impact on the radiation dose.
