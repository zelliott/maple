The concept of angiogenesis and consecutive stages of the neovascularization processes under physiological and pathological conditions have been described. Angiogenesis is regulated by the different mechanisms which are in dynamic balance. The regulating components of these processes are the stimulating and inhibiting factors, the mediators of these reactions under influence of the host cell-tumor cell interaction. The role of angiogenesis in cancer development is connected with obtaining the angiogenic phenotype by tumor when the transformation from prevascular to vascular phase of neoplasm goes on. The further tumor growth and metastasis processes depend on neovascularization. Actual research trends in the field of angiogenesis have been presented in this paper. We need to know such markers of angiogenesis would be the most useful for doing research work and monitoring neoplasm diseases in clinics. Antiangiogenic management seems to be a new promising therapeutic concept in oncology.
