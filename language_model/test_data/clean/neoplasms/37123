Basing our views on recent works of an Ontarian research group, we analyze the profiles of incidence of the main types of cancers observed in the province of Québec for the periods 1984-1986 and 1989-1991. Using the Québec Tumors Registry, we have calculated standardized incidence rates according to sex for each of the 32 departments of community health in the province. A geographical analysis of cancers was conducted via two methods of spatial autocorrelation (SA). Many cancer sites (i.e., breast, lung, stomach) show a positive SA (p &lt; 0.05), indicating an aggregation of cases. Several aggregation schemes observed in Québec resemble those observed in Ontario. In women, the highest incidence rate increases are in leukemia and lung cancer; in men, prostate cancer and leukemia show the highest increase of rates (p &lt; 0.01). The consistency of our observations with those of the Ontario group is discussed.
