Prospective intervention studies have shown that cognitive-behavioral interventions can improve morbidity and mortality both in cancer and in circulatory disorders. Research in fields like molecular biology, psychoneuroendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology has identified some of the links between emotions and biological reactions. The paper reviews the situation today and concludes that psychobiologically based interventions may make important contributions to somatic medicine.
