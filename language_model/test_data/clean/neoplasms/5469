The majority of patients with cancer in the United States are more than 70 years old. Despite the increased understanding of the molecular bases for both oncogenesis and aging, the overlap of cancer and aging at that level remains a wide-open research domain. Similarly, at the clinical level, there is also an increased awareness of the need for more information about the influence of host age on the development of tumors, on the growth and spread of the disease, and on treatment expectations. In this review, we have attempted to frame questions regarding cancer and aging from the perspective of biogerontology and geriatric medicine. An increased effort to address the issues of aging is of paramount importance at all levels of cancer investigation.
