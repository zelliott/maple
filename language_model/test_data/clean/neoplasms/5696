Artificially induced thermal intermittence using thermogenic agents was utilized to treat AIDS patients in an attempt to make an analogy with the sterilization process by tyndallization employed in laboratories. It is known that micro-organisms are more sensitive to discontinuous than to constant heat. The author believes that the AIDS virus may be either destroyed or weakened using this method which may also provoke an immune stimulus over the body's system of defense, especially over the bone marrow, with the consequent increase of the indexes of lymphocins, opsonins and hematogenesis.
