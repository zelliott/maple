To review clinical experience and studies with anti-EGFR therapies in metastatic CRC, SCCHN, and NSCLC. Case studies in each tumor type will also be outlined.

Research articles and patient case histories.

Several phase II/III trials have shown the activity of anti-EGFR therapy in CRC, SCCHN, and NSCLC. Treatment confers substantial clinical benefit with improved symptoms, particularly in previously treated patients. Toxicity of anti-EGFR therapies is generally manageable and non-overlapping with other treatment options, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

It is important for nurses to further advance our understanding of anti-EGFR therapies and continue to encourage patient enrollment in ongoing trials of anti-EGFR therapy.
