Definitions and terms currently employed in the nomenclature of cancer are examined and found inadequate or misleading. It is suggested that the two entirely different processes involved in cancer, namely, neoplastic transformation and neoplastic disease, be clearly distinguished and rigorously defined. It is also suggested that proper terms and expressions to describe these processes be adopted and clearly defined.
