It is widely recognized that spiritual care plays an important role in physical and psychosocial well-being of cancer patients, but there is little evidence based research on the effects of spiritual care. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial on spiritual care using a brief structured interview scheme supported by an e-application. The aim is to examine whether an assisted reflection on life events and ultimate life goals can improve quality of life of cancer patients.

Based on the findings of our previous research, we have developed a brief interview model that allows spiritual counsellors to explore, explicate and discuss life events and ultimate life goals with cancer patients. To support the interview, we created an e-application for a PC or tablet. To examine whether this assisted reflection improves quality of life we will conduct a randomized trial. Patients with advanced cancer not amenable to curative treatment options will be randomized to either the intervention or the control group. The intervention group will have two consultations with a spiritual counsellor using the interview scheme supported by the e-application. The control group will receive care as usual. At baseline and one and three months after randomization all patients fill out questionnaires regarding quality of life, spiritual wellbeing, empowerment, satisfaction with life, anxiety and depression and health care consumption.

Having insight into one's ultimate life goals may help integrating a life event such as cancer into one's life story. This is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the role of an assisted structured reflection on ultimate life goals to improve patients' quality of life and spiritual well being. The intervention is brief and based on concepts and skills that spiritual counsellors are familiar with, it can be easily implemented in routine patient care and incorporated in guidelines on spiritual care.

The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01830075.
