Complications of vascular procedures performed for tumor infiltration of major vessels or for the rescue of complex tumor resections may significantly affect perioperative patient outcome and long-term patient survival rate.

Retrospective review of 39 patients undergoing major resection for malignancy between April 1980 and April 1998; 35 patients underwent major-vessel reconstruction, 3 patients underwent extra-anatomic bypass, and 1 patient underwent major venous thrombectomy.

Vascular complications and patient survival rate.

Vascular complications included major stroke (3), carotid artery blowout (2), acute graft thrombosis (1), bowel infarction (1), and anastomotic disruption (1). Factors such as patient demographics, preoperative irradiation, tumor stage, resection for recurrent disease, and vessel or graft type had no bearing on the occurrence of a vascular complication (P&gt;.05 in all cases). Eight patients (21%) died within 30 days of surgery, and 2 (5%) died after 30 days but before hospital discharge. Five of these deaths were directly related to vascular problems (P&lt;.001). Cumulative patient survival rate was 44%, 26%, and 10% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.

The long-term patient survival rate is poor when resections for carcinoma are associated with maj or-vessel infiltration or a complication that necessitates an emergent vascular procedure. In this setting, in-hospital mortality is negatively affected by the incidence of a major vascular complication.
