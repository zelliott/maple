A cross-sectional study was conducted with 153 survivors (9-16 years of age) during follow-up at the oncology outpatient clinic. The study found that depressive symptoms are a strong predictor of quality of life in childhood cancer survivors and that systematic screening of this population is important. It is essential for health care professionals to develop, plan, and evaluate interventions with the aim of alleviating depressive symptoms for childhood cancer survivors so as to enhance their quality of life.
