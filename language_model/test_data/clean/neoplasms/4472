The first enzymatic step in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones occurs in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is dependent on the mobilization of cholesterol from cellular stores. We report on the isolation of a human cDNA which encodes a mitochondrial protein called steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, implicated in transport of cholesterol into mitochondria. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence analyses indicate that the human and murine polypeptides are highly conserved, sharing 87% identity with an overall homology of 92%. Analysis of the distribution of StAR mRNA transcripts in human tissues by Northern blotting reveals several mRNA species, the most abundant of which is a 1.8 kb mRNA transcript present in testes, ovaries and kidneys. Using in vitro translated protein, we demonstrate that the StAR gene product can be efficiently imported into exogenously added mitochondria.
