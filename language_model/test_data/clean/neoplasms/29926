Between 1-04-1980 and and 1-01-1982, 50 catheters have been inserted in children from 6 months to 16 years of age. The silicone right atrial catheter is implanted using surgical technique under local or general anesthesia in a cervical or brachial vein. The mean duration of catheter life was 6 weeks. Catheters have been inserted according to the exact nature of cancer, the intensity of the treatment and the preexistent malnutrition (acute Leukemia, malignant lymphoma, bone marrow transplant, ...). The mechanical complications and the infections risk were studied. These incidents must not contraindicate this technique because the setting up of a central venous line allows in a treated child: 1. To maintain a correct nutritional state. 2. To slow the functioning of the digestive tract. 3. To further the administration of the therapeutic and the hematologic supervision in good conditions of security and comfort.
