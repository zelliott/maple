In this brief review, we show that intravital microscopy has permitted characterization of the specific aspects of tumour microcirculation. Microvascular networks in tumour are largely different from those in non-tumoural tissue or in non-tumoural neoangiogenesis. Both from the anatomical and the hemodynamical aspects, the tumour microvascular network appears highly chaotic. In vivo measurements have shown the large heterogeneity of oxygen and metabolic status associated with tumour growth. Effects of antiangiogenic drugs can also be tested using intravital microscopy. These techniques have also allowed demonstration of the specific vasomotor response of vessels irrigating tumours, thus allowing specific modulation of tumour blood flow.
