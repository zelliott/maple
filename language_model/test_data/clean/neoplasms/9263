Improvement of cancer therapy by introducing new concepts is still urgent even though there have been major advancements lately. Immunotherapy is well on the way to becoming an established tool in the cancer treatment armory. It seems that a combination of (1) activation of immune effector cells and selective targeting of them to tumors and (2) the inhibition of immune suppression often induced by the tumor itself are necessary to achieve the therapeutic goal. The immunotoxin naptumomab estafenatox was developed in an effort to activate and target the patient's own T cells to their tumor, by fusing a superantigen (SAg) variant that activates T lymphocytes to the Fab moiety of a tumor-reactive monoclonal antibody. Naptumomab estafenatox targets the 5T4 tumor antigen, a 72-kDa oncofetal trophoblast protein expressed on many carcinomas, including renal cell carcinoma. The therapeutic effect is associated with activation of SAg-binding T cells. The SAg-binding T lymphocytes expand, differentiate to effector cells, and infiltrate the tumor. The therapeutic efficacy is most likely related to the dual mechanism of tumor cell killing: (1) direct lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes of tumor cells expressing the antigen recognized by the antibody moiety of the fusion protein and (2) secretion of cytokines eliminating antigen-negative tumor cell variants. Naptumomab estafenatox has been clinically tested in a range of solid tumors with focus on renal cell carcinoma. This review looks at the clinical experience with the new immunotoxin and its potential.
