The compromised host is susceptible to a wide spectrum of opportunistic pathogens. Early identification of patients who can be classified as immunocompetent as well as an understanding of the specific compromise are crucial in successful management. Since this population frequently does not exhibit overt signs and symptoms of infection, prompt action is necessary to avoid overwhelming sepsis from any number of endogenous or exogenous pathogens. A careful study of the underlying mechanisms causing increased host susceptibility as well as familiarity with some of the unusual organisms capable of causing infection assist with the medical and nursing management of the immunologically compromised host.
