A prospective registration of incident cancers in childhood in two south-east regions of France since 1 January 1984 allows us to collect pertinent data on 875 cases throughout a period of 8 years. World age-standardised overall incidence rate is 137.63 cases/million/year. It is close to that reported in other white European. North American and Oceanian populations. The age-adjusted (age-standardised) relative frequency of each pathological group is: leukaemias 29.71%; central nervous system tumours 20.61%; lymphomas 12.75%; sympathetic tumours 9.03%; soft tissues tumours 7.37%; bone tumours 5.89%; kidney tumours 4.82%; epithelial tumours 3.83%; germinal and gonadal tumours 3.24%; retinoblastomas 2.11%; liver tumours 0.45% and others 0.14%. The comparison of these results with international available data shows that we record the world highest adjusted incidence rates for neuroblastomas (15.46) and rhabdomyosarcomas (7.04) and a high rate for Ewing's sarcomas (3.30); this fact will need to be confirmed by a longer period of observation, but even now the total number of cases (particularly for neuroblastoma) is high when compared with the data of other children registries which give rates for longer periods and for similar or larger populations.
