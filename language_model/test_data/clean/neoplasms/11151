For clinical treatment of cancer patients, surgical operation, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and palliative care are available. Among these therapies, the main radical treatments such as surgical operation, chemotherapy and radiotherapy provide patients with anti-cancer-effects, but also cause unwanted invasive influences to normal tissues. Nutritional support is essential for cancer patients because it helps reduce these invasive influences and promotes recovery of damaged non-cancer tissues. Nutritional support for cancer patients receiving any anti-cancer therapies helps decrease the degree of invasion to non-cancer tissues and healthy body functions, helps with the promotion of reproduction and recovery of injured tissues and functions, normalizes metabolic disturbances by anti-cancer therapies, improves malnutrition based by side effects of invasive treatments, promotes immune-function using immune-nutrients, and offers nutritional care for patients at the terminal stage by assisting in metabolic conditioning for patients with cancer cachexia.
