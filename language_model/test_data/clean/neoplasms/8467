The ototoxic side effects of cisplatin are evaluated in 23 patients by a conventional and high-frequency audiogram. The ototoxicity of cisplatin consists of a high frequency loss which was found to be dose and frequency related. The hearing loss started predominantly in the higher frequencies (12-16 kHz) and the ototoxicity increased with increasing dose of cisplatin. The ototoxicity of cisplatin appears to be inversely related with the patient's age, although it is difficult to draw definite conclusions because age and dose are closely related to each other in our study.
