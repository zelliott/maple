The rel oncogene induces rapidly fatal lymphomas in birds. The mechanism by which this occurs is not clear, but investigations into the properties of rel have shown it to be an unusual protein. Unlike other 'nuclear' oncogenes described in this issue, v-rel can be found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. In addition, it appears to transform avian lymphoid cells regardless of its localization. Interestingly, the rel gene is highly homologous to the Drosophila gene dorsal, which is involved in determination of dorsal-ventral polarity in the developing embryo. In this review, the biology of the virus containing the rel oncogene, REV-T, will be described. The structure of the gene and the properties of the rel protein will be examined. The rel protein will be compared to the Drosophila homolog, dorsal, both structurally and functionally.
