In summary, the overall approach to the treatment of neutropenic cancer patients is to bridge the neutropenic gap. Empirical therapy serves as an important pillar of support, and a rational programme for modifications of the initial therapy, according to the evolving clinical course of the patient, forms another pillar in bridging this gap (Pizzo & Meyers, 1989). The incorporation of biologicals that might shorten the duration of neutropenia could potentially lead to greater improvements in outcome and greater success for therapy for the febrile neutropenic cancer patient.
