This study examined facilitators and barriers to effective patient and caregiver communication with providers with emphasis on communication related to cancer pain management. Focus groups and personal interviews were conducted with cancer patients and family caregivers of patients. Communication experiences of subjects as well as suggestions for ways to improve the communication process were elicited. Twenty-two cancer patients and 16 family caregivers participated in the study. Seven themes emerged suggesting improvements that are needed in the communication process. These include: 1) improving the process of information exchange, 2) increasing active participation of patient and caregiver in the care process, 3) improving provider relationship-building skills, 4) overcoming time barriers, 5) addressing fears regarding use of pain management medications, 6) fostering appropriate involvement of family and caregivers in the communication process, and 7) improving coordination of care among providers. Specific suggestions and their practice implications for health care providers are highlighted.
