The importance of internal medicine for the care of patients with carcinoma increases. This is particularly connected with the rapid development of the antineoplastic drug therapy. However, these are not the only tasks of the internal specialists. He is responsible for the ascertainment of the diagnosis, the judgment of the anatomical extension of the tumour with clinical means (classification of stages) and the diagnostics and treatment of concomitant diseases as prerequisites of a rational therapeutic planning. In the oncological team the internal specialist not only represents the specifically internal possibilities of treatment, but is in charge of the continuous general medical and psychic care of the patient. The internal specialist plays an important role in the entire coordination of the specialised care. This refers to the documentation of findings in the carcinoma register of the hospital, to planning and evaluation of controlled clinical experiments, special oncologic consulting hours and consulting functions as a competent specialist also outside oncologic centres, which should be established in district hospitals and teaching hospitals as a common task of all participating disciplines. For this a profound specialisation within the field of internal medicine is necessary. A subspecialisation acknowledged by the state would be a stimulus, but it is not compulsorily necessary. This introduction into the topic shall the internal  specialist make clear his role and responsibility in the oncologic care and facilitate the communication with other specialities.
