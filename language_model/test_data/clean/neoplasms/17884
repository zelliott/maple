The aim of the study was to find out which of childhood cancer survivors are at higher risk of thyroid dysfunction, and the timeframe for its development. The consequences of different treatments, particularly chemotherapy, were of interest. Follow-up data for 291 patients from a cohort of 360 patients were available and analysed in this retrospective study. Impaired thyroid function occurred in 71/291 (24%) patients: brain tumours 30/65 (46%), Hodgkin's disease (HD) 10/21 (48%), leukaemia/non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) 19/140 (14%) and others 12/65 (18%). Patients with brain tumours had a higher hazard ratio (HR) over leukaemia/NHL (HR 7.47) but not over HD (HR 1.57). These patients also developed thyroid hypofunction earlier than patients with HD or leukaemia/NHL. Age at diagnosis did not have an effect on the occurrence or timeframe of development of thyroid hypofunction. Radiotherapy (HR 4.68) and radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy (HR 2.90) were associated with a higher risk than chemotherapy alone. Chemotherapy added to radiotherapy tended to increase risk (HR 2.42 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-5.87). Craniospinal irradiation did not differ significantly from total body irradiation (TBI) (HR 1.09 95%CI 0.25-4.76) or direct thyroid irradiation (HR 0.81 95%CI 0.32-2.06), but cranial irradiation (CIR) (HR 0.18 95%CI 0.08-0.38) was less harmful to thyroid function. Girls were more prone to effects of irradiation (HR 2.10 95%CI 1.15-3.82). All treatments, excluding surgery, predispose to thyroid dysfunction. Suggestions for follow-up of thyroid function are made.
