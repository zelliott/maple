Effective analgesia is a crucial factor in promoting quality of life for cancer patients. While undergoing treatment with the minor tranquilizer alprazolam for a coincidental psychiatric disturbance, 39 patients with malignancies and an associated causalgic pain syndrome had a marked analgesic response. Diagnostic and treatment guidelines for organic pain syndromes are reviewed, as are indications for the use of anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines as analgesic adjuvants. The results of this study suggest that the use of benzodiazepines for patients with this refractory pain syndrome should be evaluated further.
