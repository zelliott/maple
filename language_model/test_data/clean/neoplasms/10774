Adoptive cell transfer of allogeneic tumor-specific T cells could potentially be used as a universal treatment for cancer. We present a novel approach for adoptive immunotherapy using fully MHC-mismatched allogeneic T cells redirected with tumor-specific, non-MHC-restricted antibody-based chimeric antigen receptor (T-bodies) in the absence of GVHD. Mice bearing systemic metastatic disease were lymphodepleted by irradiation and treated with Her2/neu re-directed T cells. Lymphodepletion created a 'therapeutic window', which allowed the allo-T-bodies to attack the tumor before their rejection. A single split dose administration of allogeneic T-bodies extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice similarly to syngeneic T-bodies, and to a significantly greater extent than nonspecific allogeneic T cells. Blocking egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs using the sphingosine-1-phosphate agonist, FTY720, extended the persistence of allogeneic T cells such that allogeneic T-bodies provided superior therapeutic benefit relative to syngeneic ones, and dramatically extended the median survival time of the treated mice for more than a year. Therefore, we suggest that ex-vivo generated MHC-mismatched T-bodies can be used universally for off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapy and that their graft-versus-host reactivity can be safely harnessed to potentiate adoptive cell therapy.
