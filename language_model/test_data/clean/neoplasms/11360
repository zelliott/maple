AEOL-10150, a small-molecule antioxidant analogous to the catalytic site of superoxide dismutase, is under development by Aeolus (formerly Incara) as a potential subcutaneous treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, spinal cord injury, lung inflammation and mucositis. The compound is currently undergoing a phase I clinical trial for ALS. In October 2005, the company had applied for Fast Track status, and planned to submit a special protocol assessment for a pivotal phase II/III trial.
