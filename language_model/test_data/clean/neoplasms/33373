Results from multiple human studies have continued to spur the development of dendritic cells (DCs) as therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of cancer, chronic viral infections, and autoimmune diseases. The antigen-specific activity of DCs is dependent on the ability of the DCs to take up and process tumor-associated antigens for presentation to the immune system. Although immature DCs have been shown to naturally take up tumor-associated antigens by phagocytosis, approaches that significantly affect antigen delivery need further evaluation, especially if such methodologies can be demonstrated to result in the elicitation of more robust and comprehensive immune responses. We have developed a rapid, robust, scalable, and regulatory-compliant process for loading DCs with whole tumor lysate. The use of whole tumor lysate facilitates the generation of a more robust immune response targeting multiple unique antigenic determinants in patient's tumors and likely reduces the tumor's potential of immune escape. We demonstrate that DCs electroloaded with tumor lysate elicit significantly stronger antitumor responses both in a tumor challenge model and in a therapeutic vaccination model for preexisting metastasic disease. These effects are observed in a processing scheme that requires 20- to 40-fold lower amounts of tumor lysate when compared with the standard coincubation/coculture methods employed in loading DCs.
