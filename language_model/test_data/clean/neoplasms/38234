Nucleic acids and regulatory proteins are architecturally organized in nuclear microenvironments. The compartmentalization of regulatory machinery for gene expression, replication and repair, is obligatory for fidelity of biological control. Perturbations in the organization, assembly and integration of regulatory machinery have been functionally linked to the onset and progression of tumorigenesis. The combined application of cellular, molecular, biochemical and in vivo genetic approaches, together with structural biology, genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics, will likely lead to new approaches in cancer diagnostics and therapy.
