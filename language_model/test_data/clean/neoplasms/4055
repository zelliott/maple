A geriatric education retreat in oncology was held in February 1997 to develop a plan to integrate geriatrics into oncology.

A group of 42 geriatricians and medical oncologists convened to assess the means of incorporating the contents of geriatrics into oncology training. The basic science and clinical aspects of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of cancers in older persons and the geriatric aspects of aging were presented.

This comprehensive review of the problems of aging and cancer provided encouragement to representatives of both disciplines to stimulate further research and clinical training relating to the problems of aging and cancer. The overall conclusions considered means to reach this goal.
