The requirement for intraoperative blood salvage (IBS) in cancer surgery stems from the high transfusion rate, the unfavourable effects of an anaemia, and the impact of transfusion risks like immunomodulation in tumor patients. The advantages of IBS are availability, the low waste rate, and the excellent quality of this autologous, unstored blood. The only effective elimination of the risk of tumor cell dissemination after retransfusion of wound blood is achieved by blood irradiation. The combination of the established methods of IBS and blood irradiation is practical, and allows a very efficient saving of blood. For Jehovah's witnesses it may open the possibility for tumor surgery. From an anaesthesiological point of view it is part of the therapy, but any context that puts it compatible to medicolegal regulations is welcome. For him as the one responsible for the therapy of intraoperative blood loss it represents the safest and best blood for an optimal hemotherapy in tumor patients. In addition, first data indicate a better outcome of these patients.
