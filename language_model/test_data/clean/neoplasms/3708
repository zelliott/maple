Many carcinogens are mutagens, indicating that mutagenesis is the driving force of carcinogenesis. But what if we turn this prevailing view on its head? I will argue here that carcinogens are cytostatic and/or cytotoxic, and it is not mutation per se, but clonal selection for resistance to these antiproliferative conditions, that leads to cancer. But why aren't all cytotoxins carcinogenic?
