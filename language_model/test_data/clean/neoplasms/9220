Since the first reported patient with hyper-IgM, more than 200 patients with this phenotype resulted from CD40 ligand deficiency have been reported. However, in addition to this common finding, they presented with different manifestations like opportunistic infections, autoimmunity and malignancies each of them are worth a detailed look.
