The results of recent clinical trials have demonstrated that cancer vaccines continue to struggle to achieve tangible clinical benefits as monotherapy. Tumor-induced abnormalities in the immune system hamper anti-tumor T cell responses limiting the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy. Recently, evidence has been mounting to suggest that immunotherapy has the possibility of achieving better success when used in combination with conventional chemotherapy. In clinical trials, immune responses elicited by cancer vaccines appear to augment the effectiveness of subsequent conventional cancer therapies.
