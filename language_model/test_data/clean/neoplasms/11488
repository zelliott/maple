A retrospective study was conducted of 26 adult cases of fusobacterium bacteraemia that occurred between 1998 and 2003 at Center Hospitalier Universitaire de Grenoble, France. Most patients presented with pre-existing adverse medical conditions, including evolving malignant diseases (eight patients), recent surgery (four patients), and chronic organ failure (six patients). Only one patient presented with a classic Lemierre's syndrome. These results suggest an opportunistic pattern of modern fusobacterium infections.
