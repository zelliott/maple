Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a key regulator of physiological growth control and regulation of tissue homeostasis. Tipping the balance between cell death and proliferation in favor of cell survival may result in tumor formation. Moreover, current cancer therapies, e.g. chemotherapy, gamma-irradiation, immunotherapy or suicide gene therapy, primarily exert their antitumor effect by triggering an evolutionary conserved apoptosis program in cancer cells. For example, death receptor signaling has been implied to contribute to the efficacy of cancer therapy. Thus, failure to undergo apoptosis in response to anticancer therapy because of defects in death receptor pathways may result in resistance. Further insights into the mechanisms regulating apoptosis in response to anticancer therapy and how cancer cells evade cell death may provide novel opportunities for targeted therapeutics. Thus, agents designed to selectively activate death receptor pathways may enhance the efficacy of conventional therapies and may even overcome some forms of cancer resistance.
