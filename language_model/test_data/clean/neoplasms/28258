The concept of aggression was long relegated to the shadow of the libido in psychoanalytic theory, placed among the negative affects by some theoreticians, denied the role of a primary drive among leading writers in clinical psychology, brought to the fore as an adaptive force in ethology, and proved to be a decisive factor in the development of psychosomatic ailments. The second part of the paper reviews experiments using projective techniques, showing that highly creative subjects as opposed to ones low in creativity seem inclined to accept their aggressive impulses. A total denial of these impulses has been typical of women with breast cancer.
