To promote cancer chemotherapy among outpatients, a special room for cancer chemotherapy (outpatient drip infusion room) was established in Yamaguchi University Hospital in April 2002. Since then, pharmacists have played a central role in all aspects, including decisions on the flow rate for prescriptions/injections, protocol checking, preparation of injections, aseptic preparation of anticancer agents, provision of information to patients, and financial impact analysis. In this study, we analyzed the current status of these activities and conducted a questionnaire survey regarding the involvement of pharmacists in chemotherapy at the outpatient clinic among patients and physicians. Pharmacists contributed to the administration of anticancer agents, including protocol checking and aseptic preparation, and no malpractice incident has occurred since the outpatient drip infusion room was established. According to responses from patients, 28 of 29 patients reported that they underwent treatment without anxiety. According to responses from physicians, 15 of 18 physicians considered the involvement of pharmacists beneficial. In addition, the amount claimed for health insurance as of March 2003 was 500000 yen, which was about 5-fold that before the establishment of the outpatient drip infusion room. These results suggest that pharmacists contribute to the promotion of cancer chemotherapy in outpatients with respect to the safety of medical practice, patient services, and hospital management. Therefore participation in cancer chemotherapy at the outpatient clinic may become a primary activity of pharmacists.
