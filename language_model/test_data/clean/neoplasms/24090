Quality of life (QOL) measures are now accepted as indicators of efficacy in the palliative treatment of cancer. Utility measures may also provide valuable information in this area yet they have rarely been applied. To assess the concordance of QOL and utility scales, 93 patients with advanced, symptomatic cancer completed two QOL instruments, the Spitzer Quality of Life Index (QLI) and Spitzer Uniscale, and a time-trade off (TTO) question reflecting the utility of their health states. The scales were self-administered. All patients completed the QLI and Uniscale but only 37% of participants were prepared to trade time. The remainder comprised 39% who felt too well to trade time and 24% who did not wish to consider trading time at all. Those prepared to trade time had significantly worse scores on both QLI and Uniscale instruments than those who felt too well to trade. However the correlation between time traded and QLI and Uniscale scores was poor. We conclude that the TTO question used in this study, while not strongly related to QOL, provides a measure of the patient's attitude to their health state. This may explain why patients differ in their attitude to quantity vs. quality of life.
