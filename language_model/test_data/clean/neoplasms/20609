Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen presenting cells. Mature DCs activate antigen specific na√Øve T cells, B cells and NK cells. Under certain conditions, DCs even silence T cell immune responses in vivo, thus, modulating the immune response. This special function of DCs could be exploited in the treatment of cancer, autoimmune disorder and chronic viral infections.
