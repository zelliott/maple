To be able to label a gene and monitor its migration are key important approaches for the clinical application of cancer suicide gene therapy. Photonic nanomaterials are introduced in this work. One of the most promised suicide genes - herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene - is successfully linked with CdTe/CdS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) via EDC/NHS coupling method. From confocal microscopy it was demonstrated that plasmid TK intracellular trafficking can be effectively and distinctly traced via monitoring the luminescence of the QDs up to 96 h after transfection of QDs-TK conjugates into Hela cells. MTT results show that the QDs-TK conjugates have a high efficient cytotoxicity after adding GCV into Hela cells, whereas the QDs exert no detectable deleterious effects on the cellular processes. The apoptosis induced by QDs-TK conjugates with GCV is distinctly traced partly due to the strong luminescence of the QDs. Our results indicate that photonic nanomaterials, e.g. QDs, provide a tool for monitoring TK gene delivery and anti-cancer activity.
