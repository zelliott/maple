The main limitation of photodynamic therapy is a very short penetrance length of the light in tissues. To overcome this shortcoming, a new method is proposed, where first a gene encoding protein luciferase is delivered using, e.g. adenovirus vector to the neoplastic cells and, after its expression, the photosensitizer, which should be activated, together with luciferin are injected to the organism. After their accumulation in the cancer cells, the photosensitizer activation is accomplished via light produced by chemiluminiscent reaction of luciferase and luciferin.
