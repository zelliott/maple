The skin flora of patients with disseminated malignant disease and seborrheic dermatitis has been investigated and compared with controls as well as with otherwise healthy patients suffering from seborrheic dermatitis. Although significant differences were detected in both bacterial and yeast counts between different sites on the body, no significant qualitative or quantitative differences were found between the three groups of subjects. Whereas abnormalities of the skin flora have been described in seriously ill patients and in individuals subjected to occlusion, we were unable to demonstrate any changes in skin flora in patients with malignant disease and seborrheic dermatitis. Our results do not support the view that increased numbers of Pityrosporum yeasts are important in the pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis.
