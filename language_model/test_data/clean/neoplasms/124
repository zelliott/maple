In a study of serum levels of endogenous tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in healthy people and patients with neoplastic or infectious disease, only patients with kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis) and malaria were found to have a strikingly increased frequency of raised TNF levels (66.6% and 70.0%, respectively). 7.9% of samples from both healthy subjects and patients with neoplastic disease contained measurable TNF. The discovery of elevated TNF levels in the sera of patients with parasitic diseases suggests that this cytokine may play a part in host defences against parasitic infections.
