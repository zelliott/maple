A 10-year experience with a program designed to reduce the incidence of bacteremias in the cancer patient, specifically those caused by Corynebacterium CDC-JK, is presented. Retrospective chart reviews identified patients at risk and generated the hypothesis that special attention to body hygiene may play a significant role. Implementation of a skin hygiene program resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of CDC-JK bacteremias in Memorial Hospital patients.
