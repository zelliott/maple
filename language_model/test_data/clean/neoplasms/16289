Nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy have an impact on cancer patients' quality of life (QOL). The Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE), which is designed to assess the change in QOL from the influence of nausea and vomiting is rarely used in Japan, regardless of its utility, because it is written in English. We investigated the use by cancer patients with the main object of designing a reliable and valid Japanese version of the FLIE. We also verified the validity of a Japanese translation and improved part to design a highly precise Japanese version FLIE. Consequently, we found a correlation between the FLIE Japanese version and the QOL questionnaire Quality of Life Assessment of Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy (QOL-ACPRC), which was the external standard. Furthermore, we improved the questionnaire to raise the rate of patient response, and improve reliability and validity. We think that this FLIE Japanese version will become useful in assessing the change in patient QOL due to the influence of nausea and vomiting.
