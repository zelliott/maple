The role of the adult oncologists in the area of pediatric cancer treatment previously has been unmeasured. A questionnaire bearing regarding the practice of 447 adult oncologists was administered in June 1991. The membership list of the Association of Community Cancer Centers was used to identify contact oncologists. One hundred thirty-one questionnaires (29.3%) were returned for analysis. The data reveal that 204 patients younger than 21 years of age were treated during the last year in 63 adult oncology practices. Most of these patients were more than 15 years of age. Only a minority (53) were treated in rural practices. In addition, only a minority (27%) of these patients are reported to be enrolled in clinical trials. In addition, adult oncologists appear to regard physiologically mature adolescents (age 16-21 years) as adults. They do not seem to make a distinction between patients 16-21 years old and those older than 21 years.
