The mechanism behind disabling muscle weakness in tumor-induced hypophosphatemic rickets is obscure. Histological investigation of growth plate tissue of patients with tumor-induced osteomalacia has so far not been reported.

A mesenchymal tumor was detected in the left distal fibula by (68)Ga-DOTATOC in a 17-yr-old boy with adolescent onset of severe hypophosphatemic rickets. Disabling muscle weakness improved within days after surgery, and normal mobility was restored within months.

The resected tissue included part of the growth plate allowing immunohistochemical investigation. Positive staining of FGF23 was found in the tumor cells and in hypertrophic chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts of the adjacent growth plate. This distribution matched that found in growth plate tissue of a healthy control. We found positive staining for the somatostatin receptor not only in the tumor but also within the growth plate and adjacent bony tissue in the patient and the healthy control. Muscle tissue provided evidence for a partial defect in respiratory chain complexes I-IV. Biochemical markers were nearly or completely restored to normal 12 months after surgery.

Hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes are a target or source of FGF23 in tumor-induced osteomalacia. Low serum phosphate, FGF23, or other factors produced by the tumor may interfere with mitochondrial function.
