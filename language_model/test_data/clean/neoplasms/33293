The article reviews methods, experiences, and results of quality of life research in cancer, and presents recommendations. The research has comprised descriptive studies, end-points in clinical trials, prognostic studies, and clinical applications of quality of life questionnaires. There is a need for additional quality of life studies in relation to all cancer sites and treatments but such studies should be undertaken only when the necessary resources are available, as only well-conducted studies are of value.
