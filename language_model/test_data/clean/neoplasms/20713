The implication of environmental carcinogens in childhood cancer is still unknown. To assess a possible link between DNA damage and alterations of the tumor suppressor gene p53, blood samples of 21 children with malignancies were examined for the presence of micronuclei in lymphocytes using the cytokinesis blocked micronucleus assay (CBMA). The constitutional karyotypes were analyzed for chromosome abnormalities and the presence of anti-p53 antibodies in blood sera was evaluated by an enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). A control group of 20 children was also included. The rates of micronucleated cells were 5.1 per thousand+/-3.9 and 2.4 per thousand+/-2.3 for the cancer and control groups, respectively. The difference between the groups were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05 by the Mann-Withney rank sum test). Two children in the cancer group showed extensive chromosome breakage in lymphocytes. The sera of two other children from the cancer group and of one child from the control group contained anti-p53 antibodies. Chromosome breakage and anti-p53 antibodies from the five children were associated with increased micronucleated cell rates. The results of the present study suggest that genotoxic events can occur in the lymphocytes of children with a cancerous state.
