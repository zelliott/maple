A study was conducted to evaluate prospectively the correlation between docetaxel clearance and pharmacokinetics of dexamethasone previously obtained in 21 patients.

Dexamethasone pharmacokinetics were performed in 17 patients 24 h before docetaxel treatment as monochemotherapy. Dexamethasone and docetaxel plasma concentrations were determined by HPLC methods. Determination of docetaxel unbound fraction in plasma was performed using microequilibrium dialysis.

Significant correlation was observed between observed plasma docetaxel clearances (CL(docetaxel)) and values predicted from dexamethasone plasma clearance (CL(dexa)), unbound plasma docetaxel fraction estimated from serum alpha1-acid glycoprotein level (fu(alpha1-AAG)), and hepatic metastasis status. However, after splitting of the prospective data set according to gender, no correlation was observed for males (R(2) = 0.08, NS, n = 10), then strong correlation was observed for females (R(2) = 0.78, P &lt; 0.01, n = 7). Multivariate analysis was performed from data obtained in the women included in the first study and those of this prospective study (n = 18). Docetaxel CL was significantly correlated with CL(dexa) (P = 0.001) and fu(alpha1-AAG) (P = 0.01) according to the relationship (with +/-95% confidence intervals): CL(docetaxel) (l/h) = 1.92 (+/-0.94) x CL(dexa) (l/h) + 2.68 (+/-1.95) x fu(alpha1-AAG) (%) (R(2) = 0.68).

Dexamethasone may be used to predict docetaxel clearances in females, but not in males.
