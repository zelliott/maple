Perceptions about the health care system are a key driver of disparities and utilization. This study examined individual and contextual factors related to care and noncare dimensions and their relationship to perceptions of the cancer care system. A national sample of 877 cases was modeled using a multilevel modeling approach. Insurance complaints, number of treatments, and advocacy impact were negatively associated with satisfaction with the cancer care system at the individual level. Also, respondents in states where more Christians resided and lower hospital capacity were more likely to indicate satisfaction. Findings suggest implications for practitioners and health policy makers.
