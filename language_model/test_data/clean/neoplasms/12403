Exposure to the sun's UV radiation appears to be the most important environmental factor involved in the development of skin cancer. UVA is the major portion of UV radiation in sunlight and is considered to be a human carcinogen. In this study, we have investigated the delayed and sustained activation of ERK MAPK by UVA exposure. In parallel, a delayed Ras activation with a similar time course was observed after UVA exposure. The activated Ras was found to be localized in endomembranes such as the Golgi apparatus instead of plasma membranes. Expression of dominant negative Ras (N17Ras) abolished ERK activation by UVA. The presence of AG1478, an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor, had no effect on ERK or Ras activation, indicating that EGFR kinase activity is not involved in ERK activation by UVA. In contrast, protein kinase C (PKC) depletion by chronic 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment nearly abolished UVA-induced ERK and Ras activation. The presence of the Ca(2+)-dependent-PKC inhibitor Go6976 had a similar effect. These findings suggest that ERK activation by UVA is mediated by PKC in a Ras-dependent pathway. In addition, a gradual increase in intracellular calcium level after UVA exposure was detected by flow cytometry. The presence of the PLC inhibitor U73122 or the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N, N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM) blocked both ERK and Ras activation, suggesting that both PLC and calcium are required for ERK activation. Our findings demonstrated that, different from UVC and UVB, UVA-induced delayed and sustained ERK activation is EGFR kinase activity-independent, but PLC/calcium/PKC-mediated. The delayed and sustained ERK activation provides a survival signal to human HaCaT keratinocytes, which may serve as an important mechanism for cell transformation and potential skin carcinogenesis in vivo caused by UVA exposure.
