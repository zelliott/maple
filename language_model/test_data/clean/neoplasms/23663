The aim of this study was to attempt to determine which anatomical lesions were found late after cardiac transplant and could be fatal. A series of 44 autopsies, beyond a 6 month survival time, revealed the types of cardiac and extra-cardiac lesions encountered. They were viewed in the context of clinical findings. Three lesion patterns accounted for more than 9 cases out of 10: coronary disease affecting the transplant (accelerated atherosclerosis or chronic cardiac rejection: 48% of cases), infectious lesions (29%), more than half of which were due to aspergillosis, and neoplasia (14%), favourised by immune-depression. Three results show that graft coronary disease is currently the essential long term problem in the many patients who survive the early postoperative period of cardiac transplant.
