Intraperitoneal administration of chemotherapeutic drugs with hyperthermia (HIPEC) increases their local effect on malignant peritoneal diseases and reduces systemic cytotoxicity. The most commonly used are cisplatin, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C. A major disadvantage of intraperitoneal chemotherapy is limited penetration of the drug in the tumor lesion depth (1-3 mm). Extended exposure and increased pressure in the abdominal cavity solution increases penetration of the agent into the tumor and hyperthermia has synergy with cytostatic agent on the permeability of cell membranes and metabolism of the drug. Real clinical hyperthermia is achieved at 41 degrees C. Of greatest importance is the concentration of the drug, but crucial for the prognosis is complete cytoreductive surgery. A major disadvantage of the closed technique is the uneven distribution of the perfusion solution in the peritoneal cavity, and the main advantage is better control of the perfusion, keeping of constant hyperthermia of the solution and regular repetition of manipulation, like intravenous chemotherapy. Laparoscopy determines the stage of the tumor process, refines the indications and preoperative selection for HIPEC, monitors the effects of treatment and determines locations for introducing catheters. In the review the results of the inraperitoneal chemotherapy with hyperthermia in gastric, colorectal, ovarian and other cancers are discussed as well as in diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma and others.
