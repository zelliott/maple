Preliminary clinical experience with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 28 pediatric patients with 20 different hematological diseases, benign tumors, or malignant neoplasms is presented. The clinical results are presented in the form of case presentations that are discussed in the context of alternative diagnostic imaging modalities. Also discussed are the known biological effects, or lack thereof, the need for sedation, the effect of motion, the effect of MRI on foreign metallic objects, the financial considerations, and the trends for the future of MRI. This imaging modality has many unique merits. Present difficulties should be overcome by future innovations, making MRI even more efficacious for the diagnosis of blood diseases and cancer in children.
