Pluronic-based core/shell nanoparticles (NPs) were formed using various strategies such as self-assembly and temperature induced-phase transition. To improve their functionality as a nanomedicine for diagnosis and therapy, the vesicle fusion and layer by layer approach were employed. Because of the hydrophilic nature of the Pluronic shell and the relatively small size, Pluronic-based core/shell NPs were used in order to improve their pharmacokinetic behaviors in drugs and in imaging agents. This review will introduce various types of Pluronic-based core/shell NPs according to their preparation method and formation mechanism. The focus will be on the Pluronic-based core/shell NPs for tumor targeting, stimulated release of proteins, and cancer imaging capabilities.
