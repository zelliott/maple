To compare the accuracy of intraoperative fine needle aspiration cytology samples prepared by the ThinPrep method to conventional cytological methods. Specimen adequacy and turn around time (TAT) were also assessed.

Fifty consecutive fresh tumours submitted for histological analysis were aspirated and each prepared as follows: (i) direct smear with H&E stain, (ii) direct smear with Pap stain, (iii) ThinPrep slide with H&E stain, and (iv) ThinPrep slide with Pap stain. The slides were randomly distributed to three cytopathologists for interpretation. The quality of the preparation, the diagnosis and the time needed for interpretation were recorded.

Accuracy was measured as the percentage of absolute agreement between the cytological and the histopathological diagnoses of the lesions. Histologically, there were 43 malignant and six benign lesions and one atypical lipoma. The TAT began when the slides/cytolyte specimens arrived at the lab and ended with the pathologist's diagnosis.

In terms of accuracy and specimen adequacy, ThinPrep slides with Pap stain is the best procedure. This advantage however is offset by the longer testing time.
