Delays in accessing radiation treatment are of concern in Australia and New Zealand, both in terms of the proportion of patients who are actually able to access care, and in the timeliness of starting treatment. For those who are able to access treatment, one in three patients experience an unacceptable delay in starting treatment, and only one in four patients starts radiotherapy within standard good practice times. During the year 2002, more than 15 000 Australians who potentially could have benefited from radiotherapy, did not receive this treatment. For those who were able to access radiotherapy treatment, worsening delays were experienced in Australia, with greater than 40% of patients receiving curative treatment, 30% receiving palliative treatment, and 56% receiving emergency treatment starting outside of standard good practice times. Delays of up to 151 days were experienced in Australia. In Australia, delays in implementing recommendations to improve the infrastructure are resulting in a declining service for cancer patients. In New Zealand, the situation, in general, is improving, although there needs to be an ongoing commitment to grow the service according to the population needs. Urgent implementation of strategic planning is required.
