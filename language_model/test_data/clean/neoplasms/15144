Several experimental and epidemiological evidence indicate that, irrespective of the trigger for the development (chronic infection/inflammation or genetic alteration), a "smouldering" inflammation is associated with the most of, if not all, tumours and supports their progression. Several evidence have highlighted that tumours promote a constant influx of myelomonocytic cells that express inflammatory mediators supporting pro-tumoral functions. Myelomonocytic cells are key orchestrators of cancer-related inflammation associated with proliferation and survival of malignant cells, subversion of adaptive immune response, angiogenesis, stroma remodelling and metastasis formation. Although the connection between inflammation and cancer is unequivocal the mechanistic basis of such association are largely unknown. Recent advances in the understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways involved in cancer-related inflammation as well as their potential relevance as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets are herein discussed.
