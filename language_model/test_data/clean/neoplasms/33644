In a randomized cross-study analgesic activity and side effects of two narcotics, buprenorphine and pentazocine, administered orally in 91 advanced cancer patients whose pain intensity varied from moderate to severe, have been compared. The number of hours of sleep and hours standing after administration of both the drugs were also assessed and in 16 patients life activity was taken into consideration. The analysis of data showed: a better pain control with buprenorphine, than with pentazocine, with a statistically significant difference of P less than 0.001; an increase in the number of hours of sleep with buprenorphine, in comparison with pentazocine, with P less than 0.001; an increase in the number of hours standing with buprenorphine, in comparison with pentazocine; as for side effects, many more patients had to stop treatment with pentazocine than with buprenorphine.
