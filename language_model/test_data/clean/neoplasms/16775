Radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy have increased long-term survival with certain cancers. The use of dental investigation and treatment of chronic or delayed oral complications is developing. Altered dental root development, enamel opacities, hypocalcifications, periodontal problems, and a higher caries rate are seen in children treated with chemotherapy. The psychosocial implications of long-term survival on routine dental care are important. Prevention and treatment of long-term oral complications of radiation therapy are changing. Osteoradionecrosis remains complicated and devastating. Strategies that avoid post-RT extractions include caries prevention, oral hygiene measures, meticulous restorative dentistry, overdentures, and improved posts for endodontically treated teeth. Guidelines for post-RT extractions vary greatly. Pediatric patients who receive head and neck irradiation may have total arrest of tooth and jaw development within the portal. The dentist must be able to diagnose and treat the variety of alterations already identified and should engage in scholarly research to answer the questions that remain.
