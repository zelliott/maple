Computer technology has acquired an important role in structuring a variety of biological systems. The availability of modern powerful computers has stimulated the development of good and accurate models of biological systems. Biological systems, such as the immune response against cancer, are complex and it is difficult to experimentally control all the interacting elements constituting the immune response of a host to cancer. Complex biosystems do not always behave or act as expected during experimental investigation. In these cases computer models can be helpful in understanding the behavior of such complex systems. The purpose of this review is to consider the use of mathematical models to study the immune response against cancer. The logic and design of some operable models relevant for tumor immunology will be discussed. Special attention is given to the conceptualization of a model based upon a new hypothesis of tumor rejection presented by De Weger et al. [10]. Technical details concerning the mathematical aspects, differential equations, details on hardware and software package etc. are not included in this survey. These details are contained to in the original papers.
