To review current information on the biology and characteristics of hereditary cancer syndromes (HCS), and to identify families with HCS, various methods to communicate the diagnosis to families, and associated considerations for clinical practice and education.

Published articles and book chapters.

HCS, which accounts for approximately 5%-10% of all malignancies, is characterized by diagnosis of the same malignancy in multiple family members, an earlier age of onset than expected, an increased frequency of bilateral cancers in paired organs, and the presence of premalignant syndromes.

Identifying families with HCS and referring them to screening programs are necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality in these families. Many clinical, educational, and research issues are emerging.

Nurses need to be aware of HCS in order to identify families with HCS and refer them to screening programs. Information about HCS needs to be incorporated into basic, graduate, and continuing education nursing programs to increase awareness of HCS. Further nursing research is needed to better understand the best way to communicate the diagnosis to families, identify the psychosocial needs of individuals from these families, and facilitate cancer prevention and detection measures in these families.
