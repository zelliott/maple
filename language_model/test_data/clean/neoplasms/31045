Several investigators have reported that interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) can alter tumor necrosis factor alpha induced effects in vitro. We assessed in vivo effects of recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN gamma) on recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF alpha) induced activation of systemic blood coagulation in a non-randomized study in 20 consecutive cancer patients. Eight patients were treated with rIFN gamma prior to and during hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion with rTNF alpha and melphalan (IFN gamma group). They were compared with twelve patients who did not additionally receive rIFN gamma (non-IFN gamma group). Before start of perfusion, higher levels of TNF alpha, F1+2 and TAT levels were found in the IFN gamma group. Fibrinogen and ATIII levels tended to be lower in this group. High TNF alpha levels, due to leakage during perfusion, were associated with activation of coagulation in all patients, that became obvious after the end of perfusion, when heparin treatment had been antagonized. Activation, measured by increased F1+2 and TAT levels, was significantly stronger in the IFN gamma group. Monocytic TF remained low, possibly due to shedding of TF positive vesicles and/or sequestration of TF positive activated monocytes against the vessel wall. In both groups F1+2 and TAT levels declined 24 h after the perfusion, whereas monocytic TF increased to levels that were higher in the IFN gamma group. In conclusion, our data confirm a strong activation of coagulation induced by rTNF alpha in cancer patients. They suggest that rIFN gamma may lead to a slight activation of coagulation and augments TNF alpha induced procoagulant activity. These effects may be due to rIFN gamma induced sustained monocytic TF activity.
