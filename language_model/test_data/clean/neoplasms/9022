Pain is a significant and alarming symptom of cancer seriously affecting the activity and quality of life of patients. Recent research proved that inadequate analgesia shortens life expectancy. Therefore, pain relief is not only a possibility but a professional, ethical and moral commitment to relieve patients from suffering, as well as ensure their adequate quality of life and human dignity. Proper pain relief can be achieved with medical therapy in most of the cases and the pharmacological alternatives are available in Hungary. Yet medical activity regarding pain relief is far from the desired. This paper gives a short summary of the guidelines on medical pain management focusing particularly on the use of opioids.
