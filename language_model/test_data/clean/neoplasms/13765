Conformal radiotherapy results from several technical and data processing advances. The treatment planning and the daily treatments have benefited from a significant improvement of the quality control. However, all the steps of the process contain various limitations of varying effects. It appear important to identify, describe and exploit those limits to better drive the procedures and optimise the quality. Identifying the limits of the conformal radiotherapy should be an important help to implement intensity modulation radiotherapy.
