A potential activity of interferons in the treatment of solid tumors has been suggested by in vitro experiments and, more recently, by phase I trials. Phase II trials have demonstrated a possible antitumoral activity in treating some solid tumors: malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian adenocarcinoma, carcinoid tumor, superficial bladder cancer. Further trials are necessary to establish the precise role of interferons in treating solid tumors, when administered alone or in combination.
