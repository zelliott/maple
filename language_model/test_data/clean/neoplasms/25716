Few previous studies of workers in the rubber industry have focused on women. We examined patterns of mortality among 2871 women employed in one of five German rubber plants for at least 1 year on or after January 1, 1976, and observed through December 31, 1991. All-causes mortality was near that expected (standardized mortality ratio [lsqbSMR], 101; 95% confidence interval [CI], 87 to 118), but cancer mortality was decreased (SMR, 90; 95% CI, 70 to 115). Nevertheless, excesses were observed for mortality from stomach cancer (SMR, 156; 95% CI, 63 to 322), lung cancer (SMR, 140; 95% CI, 56 to 289), and lymphatic system cancers (SMR, 175; 95% CI, 48 to 448). Stronger associations were observed among sub-cohorts defined by time period hired. Despite limited numbers of deaths, modest excesses of mortality due to specific cancers were observed and are consistent with previous studies.
