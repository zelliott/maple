Despite the growing number of PAP tests performed in Poland every year, (approximately 3 million per year in 1992) the mortality rates of cervical cancer are stable or increasing. With the intention of changing this unfavourable situation, a team of specialists in 1988 has developed a model for cervical cancer screening in Poland. Six experimental centres were chosen for the implementation of this model. The principles of the screening system were as follows: 1) population-based; 2) individual invitations; 3) computer assisted; 4) reproducible; 5) cytotechnicians' participation; 6) target population 30-60 years; 7) frequency of PAP tests: every 3 years. Preliminary data from the population of 25,841 which was covered by the screening campaign in Warsaw showed a 70.1% attendance rate and detectability of 3 cases per 1,000 screened women.
