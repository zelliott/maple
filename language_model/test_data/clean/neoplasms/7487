The distribution of 103-Ru-Ruthenium red in tumour bearing animals indicates that Ruthenium red labelled with radioruthenium shows the characteristics of a tumour scanning agent. Its accumulation seems to be related to its specific binding to mucopolysaccharides. In addition, this radiocompound shows a potential value in the study of other pathological states involving the metabolism of mucopolysaccharides and glycoproteins.
