gamma-Linolenic acid (GLA) is known to have selective tumoricidal action. In this study, the effect of lithium salt of GLA conjugated to iodized lymphographic oil (LGIOC) was injected intra-arterially close to the origin of tumor-feeding vessel(s) was studied. Four patients with stage 4 cancer disease (2 with hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 with giant cell tumor of the bone, and one with renal cell carcinoma), were selected for the study. Angiography, radiography and computed axial tomography were performed prior to and immediately after the injection of LGIOC and at periodic intervals. All four patients tolerated the treatment well. The most significant observation was the complete occlusion of the tumor-feeding vessels after LGIOC injection. Follow-up angiograms performed in all the patients showed occlusion of the tumor-feeding vessels is more or less permanent. A significant reduction in the size of the tumor was also observed in these patients. LGIOC showed occlusion of tumor-feeding vessels after infusion, and further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.
