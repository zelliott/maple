Pain and symptom management is an important aspect of hospice care. In an attempt to deliver consistent and high-quality interventions in a timely manner algorithms for pain and symptom management were developed. We have used these algorithms for the past 2 years with successful outcomes. Development of the pain and symptom management algorithms has contributed to the development of a standardized plan for symptom management. The algorithms offer the flexibility to respond to individual differences found in our patient population. Working together, physicians, nurses, and pharmacists offer a team approach to patient care.
