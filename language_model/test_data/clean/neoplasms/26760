Sialic acids (Sia) are involved in many biological activities and frequently exist as monosialyl residues at the non-reducing terminal end of glycoconjugates. Occasionally, polymerized structures in the form of disialic acid (diSia), oligosialic acid (oligoSia) and polysialic acid (polySia) are also found in glycoconjugates. In particular, polySia, which is an evolutionarily conserved epitope from sea urchin to humans, is one of the most biologically important glycotopes in vertebrates. The biological functions of polySia, especially on neural cell adhesion molecules, have been well studied and an in-depth body of knowledge concerning polySia has been accumulated. However, considerably less attention has been paid to glycoproteins containing di- and oligoSia groups. However, advances in analytical methods for detecting oligo/polymerized structures have allowed the identification and characterization of an increasing number of glycoproteins containing di/oligo/polySia chains in nature. In addition, sophisticated genetic techniques have also helped to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of polySia-mediated activities. In this review, recent advances in the study of the chemical properties, distribution and functions of di-, oligo- and polySia residues on glycoproteins are described.
