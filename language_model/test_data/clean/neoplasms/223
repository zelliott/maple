The study was concerned with social attitudes to cancer, cancer patients and readiness to make contact with former in-patients of cancer clinics. A specially-developed questionnaire was used to interview 300 persons. It was shown that certain attitudes to problems of cancer prevention and treatment as well as preparedness to make social contact are determined by relevant concepts and available knowledge on malignant diseases.
