A survey of papers read during a workshop held in Vienna, 1977, is given showing that the pineal gland can be considered a model for research on neuroendocrine control mechanisms in neoplastic growth. From data obtained by different authors it can be concluded that the role of the pineal indole melatonin is very important in regard of the incidence and the development of tumours. On the basis of all the facts mentioned in this paper it is obvious that pineal gland activity should be included into the neuroendocrine factors studied in relation with oncogenic processes. For future research a number of experimental approaches, which need special emphasis, are recommended.
