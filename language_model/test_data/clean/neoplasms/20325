This prospective, non-randomized study was designed to evaluate the quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients receiving new cytotoxic therapy. QOL was measured using a linear analog self assessment scale (LASA). Cancer patients who received a phase I agent (n = 45) had no significant changes in any of the individual QOL variables, overall QOL (p = 0.77) or performance status (p = 0.08) following one course of phase I therapy. However, patients who were not eligible for entry on a phase I protocol and who received supportive care (n = 10) experienced significant decreases in overall QOL (p = 0.02) and performance status (p = 0.003) after 1 month of follow-up. This pilot study suggests that participation in phase I trials does not adversely affect one's QOL.
