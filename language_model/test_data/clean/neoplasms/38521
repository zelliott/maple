Adequate pathologic slide preparation of percutaneous fine-needle biopsy (PFNB) specimens is necessary to maximize sensitivity and yield a tissue diagnosis. We present a quality control review of our biopsy technique and results in 71 aspiration biopsies done in 59 patients. Immediate cytology slide preparation in the radiology suite enabled us to increase our diagnostic yield from 53% to 84%, and allowed us to preserve PFNB, rather than open biopsy, as the primary diagnostic modality. We recommend regular review of biopsy techniques to confirm adequate diagnostic yields of these procedures.
