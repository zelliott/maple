Tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen were both good inhibitors of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation in rat cardiac microsomes. Tamoxifen was also a good inhibitor of lipid peroxidation in liposomes prepared from the phospholipid obtained from rat liver microsomes. In a modified rat liver microsomal system containing a sufficiently low amount of peroxidizable phospholipid to make it comparable with the rat cardiac microsomal system, tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen were of similar effectiveness as in the cardiac system. Tamoxifen is known to lower serum cholesterol levels, and the findings reported here indicate that the drug might also protect heart cell membranes against peroxidative damage. Potential cardioprotective and antiatherosclerotic benefits of tamoxifen are discussed in relation to the drug's use in cancer prevention and treatment.
