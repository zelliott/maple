As a first step to develop a method to evaluate general ward nursing care practices targeted at families of cancer patients, the current study aimed to identify and select items for evaluation. Forms of nursing care considered to be necessary for the families of cancer patients were extracted from previous literature and categorized. We identified 5 categories, and 20 items were created to reflect the type of nursing care in these categories. A paper questionnaire evaluation composed of the 20 items was given to 77 general ward nurses. Valid responses were obtained from 67 (87.0% response rate). Factor analysis revealed 6 subscales which included "encourage family to participate in patient care", "commitment and adjustment", "adjust nursing care to meet family member needs", "realize the burden on family members", "attend the death", and "respect family decisions". Items for evaluation were refined based on other responses in the questionnaire, and a total of 26 items regarding nursing care were selected for use in the evaluation.
