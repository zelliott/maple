Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is a serine-threonine kinase that regulates various functions within the cell, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and cell motility. In normal cells, this protein plays key roles in multiple signaling pathways by relaying information from the extracellular environment and/or upstream kinases and converting them into a regulated intracellular response. The aberrant expression of PKD1 is associated with enhanced cancer phenotypes, such as deregulated cell proliferation, survival, motility, and epithelial mesenchymal transition. In this review, we summarize the structural and functional aspects of PKD1 and highlight the pathobiological roles of this kinase in cancer.
