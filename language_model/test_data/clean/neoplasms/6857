The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship of intrahospital transport patterns with patient throughput and outcomes in an oncological intensive care unit. We retrospectively reviewed all patients admitted to a closed medical-surgical intensive care unit at a cancer center between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005. We compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without transport and analyzed all intrahospital transports in relation to intensive care unit occupancy, length of stay, and intensive care unit and hospital outcomes. Transport patterns were also assessed by day of week, time of day, timing of the first transport to intensive care unit admission, and destination. Transported patients (n = 413, 43.5%) had significantly higher severity of illness scores on intensive care unit admission, greater use of vasopressors and mechanical ventilation, and longer intensive care unit and hospital length of stay and higher hospital mortality than nontransported patients (n = 535, 56.5%). Multiple transports (!2) occurred in 45% of the transported patients. The number of transports was directly proportional to intensive care unit length of stay. The highest transport rates and nearly half of all first transports occurred during the first 24 hours of intensive care unit admission. Transports were most common during weekdays and on afternoon and evening hours and most frequently to the computed tomography suite. Our study shows that intrahospital transport of the critically ill is a multifaceted process with important implications for intensive care unit resource analysis, workload and throughput.
