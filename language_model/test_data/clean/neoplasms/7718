Developments in the treatment of childhood cancer have been evaluated in patients who had been treated in the National Children's Hospital from 1965 to 1987. The total number of patients was 867, of which leukemia accounted for 376, malignant lymphoma 61, neuroblastoma 174, Wilms' tumor 55, yolk sac tumor 29, rhabdomyosarcoma 36 and hepatoblastoma 30. Patients were divided into three time intervals: the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. A marked improvement in five-year survival was recognized in Wilms' tumor and yolk sac tumor, amounting to 80%, followed by rhabdomyosarcoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant lymphoma. There was no improvement in patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia, neuroblastoma and hepatoblastoma. Prognostic factors for neuroblastoma were further analyzed, and the age of onset and stage of disease were found to have remained constant for 23 years. Factors relating to the improvement of survival were discussed.
