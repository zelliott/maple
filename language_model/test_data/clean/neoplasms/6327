Informing patients with cancer has been a subject of great scientific interest. Initially the research was aimed at quantity evaluation, in other words, the number of doctors who break the news to the patient, the number of patients seeking informing etc. Since the 1980s to present, research has shifted its focus equally on quality evaluation. In other words, serious efforts are being made to answer the question: "Is it possible to determine who should be told what, when and how?" It seems that deepening on the patient s character traits offers the best starting point for understanding the patient. The aim of this paper was to describe the character of personality types based on the question: "How could characters or personality types be used in informing patients with cancer?" As method of research was used the qualitative method through groups with doctors and nurses, while research within groups lasted for 5 years. The degree of informing is similar to the degree of the hyperthymic personality; initially, is "minimal, then "small" until it reaches "medium". The degree of denial varies between "large" and "very large" to sometimes "medium". Family: similar to the emotional-hyperthymic person, with the added difficulty of introversy. There is a discordance between what the patient shows and what the family reports about him, especially when the compensation mechanism is that of a controlling - orderly patient.
