Cancer in the Netherlands, is predominantly seen in the older age group (older than 65 y.). Reliable figures concerning the incidence rate are not available. 69% of all patients who die from cancer are over 64 years. The major cancer sites in the formerly mentioned age group are lung, prostate, large bowel, stomach, breast, and internal female genitals. The demographic figures show an impressive increase of the older age group (11----18%), and consequently of the overall cancer incidence. A similar situation and development is seen in the United States of America. Special attention for the problem of cancer in the older age group is required in view of these developments.
