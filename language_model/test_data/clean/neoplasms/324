Fine-needle aspiration is a rapid, safe and accurate technique for diagnosing a variety of radiologically evident or palpable lesions. Cellular material is obtained from suspicious areas with an 18- to 23-gauge needle. The technique can be applied to lesions of the breast, prostate, thyroid and subcutaneous tissue, as well as to many pulmonary and intra-abdominal lesions.
