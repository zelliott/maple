To assess the incidence of malignant tumors in patients with thrombophlebitis of the leg with regard to potential early tumor detection.

140 consecutive patients were enrolled over a period of over 9 years in a retrospective follow-up study based on the electronic patient record.

There were 18 patients (12.9%) suffering from thrombophlebitis in association with a malignant tumor: breast cancer in seven patients, colon carcinoma and haematologic cancer in four, skin cancer in three patients and one case each of oesophageal, prostatic, kidney and neck cancer . In two patients thrombophlebitis preceded the diagnosis of the malignancy. Superficial thrombophlebitis may have been associated in four cases (2.9%) with a benign tumor.

Breast, colonic, haematological and skin cancer were mainly associated with superficial thrombophlebitis in our patients. In case of a thrombophlebitis without a known malignancy a thorough clinical examination with special regard to skin, breast and abdomen is mandatory.
