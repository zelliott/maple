Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy visible mobile lipids are considered important markers in the diagnosis of human cancer and are thought to be closely involved in various aspects of tumour transformation, such as cell proliferation, necrosis, apoptosis, hypoxia and drug resistance. A method allowing the straightforward identification of the lipid classes contributing to the mobile lipids in human malignant tissues is highly advisable. Ex vivo High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy was done directly on human cerebral, renal and colorectal malignant tissue specimens. A diffusion edited sequence, based on stimulated echo and bipolar gradient pulses, was used to characterize molecules with low diffusion rates, arising from mobile lipid components. Cholesterol, triglycerides and phosphatidylcholine are simultaneously detected and all contribute to the mobile lipid resonances present in malignant glioma and clear cell renal carcinoma tissue specimens spectra. On the contrary, papillary cell renal carcinoma spectrum is predominated by phosphatidylcholine resonances and that of colorectal adenocarcinoma is characterized by signals arising from triglycerides. Ex vivo diffusion edited High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, done on intact tissue, is a powerful analytical tool to obtain a simple and immediate identification of mobile lipid components. This can offer a significant contribution to better understanding their involvement in cancer tissues. Furthermore, ex vivo high resolution spectroscopic measurements allow to improve the interpretation of in vivo Magnetic Resonance spectra, increasing its clinical potentiality.
