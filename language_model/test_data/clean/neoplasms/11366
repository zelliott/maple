Amifostine is a broad-spectrum cytoprotective agent approved for protection against cisplatin toxicities and radiation-induced xerostomia; strong clinical evidence exists that amifostine protects normal mucosa and lung from radiation damage. Hypotension, nausea/vomiting, fatigue and fever/rash are the main side-effects associated with amifostine administration. The present study summarizes our experience on daily amifostine administration to cancer patients with various coexisting medical conditions and diseases. The tolerance and the eventual interference of amifostine with the course of the coexisting diseases is reported, providing a core list of medical conditions met in radiotherapy practice, their compatibility with amifostine administration and recommendations on how to deal with these patients. This list comprises genetic diseases (xeroderma pigmentosum, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency), autoimmune disorders (vitiligo, scleroderma, thyroiditis, perforating collagenosis), metabolic diseases (diabetes mellitus), cardiovascular diseases, neuro/psychiatric diseases and other medical conditions (hypoglycemia, hepatic cirrhosis, alcoholism). A high incidence of fever/rash was noted in patients with autoimmune diseases, while all other conditions did not alter the patterns of side-effects expected following amifostine administration.
