Five new 8-9' linked neolignans conchigeranals A-E (1-5), together with three known compounds galanganal (6), galanganols A (7) and B (8), were isolated from the whole plant of Alpinia conchigera. Their structures were established by spectroscopic analysis, including 2D-NMR spectroscopic techniques. Cytotoxicities of compounds 1-8 were tested against two cancer cell lines A549 and Hela. Results showed that 4, 5, 7 and 8 exhibited cytotoxicity against A549 with the IC50 values of 12.36, 9.72, 10.26, 13.05 μg/ml, respectively, and 1-8 against Hela with the IC50 values from 1.53 to 5.29 μg/ml.
