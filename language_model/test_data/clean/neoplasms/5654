Invasive fungal infections are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Amphotericin B deoxycholate is still considered the gold standard of antifungal therapy, although the new triazoles (itraconazole and, especially, fluconazole) have shown to be able to replace amphotericin B for some therapeutic indications. The new lipid formulations of amphotericin B have disclosed new therapeutic perspectives, especially in patients with severe renal failure and documented, infections. At this time, indications, contraindications and limitation of the various drugs in the antifungal armamentarium are still partially unclear. Antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole may be indicated in high-risk patients, although the duration of such prophylaxis should be limited as much as possible, in order to prevent selection of resistant strains and acquired resistance. Empirical antifungal therapy is used extremely widely (maybe, too widely) in many cancer centres, despite being based on limited clinical data. For this indication, fluconazole may also be effective in patients not receiving fluconazole prophylaxis, in whom Aspergillus infection is unlikely.
