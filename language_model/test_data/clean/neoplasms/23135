Rosenberg et al discovered in the coordination complexes of platinum a new, novel type of potential antitumor agent. Cisplatin [cis-dichlorodiammine platinum (II)4 proved active against a variety of rodent tumors and acted synergistically when combined with other chemotherapeutic agents. Initial clinical tests by Hill et al in 1971, showed cisplatin to be active against malignant lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and certain other malignancies. Significant nephrotoxicity, nausea, and vomiting were noted. Since then, cisplatin has been tested alone and in combination chemotherapy and has proven an efficacious anticancer agent in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, ovarian carcinoma, disseminated testicular cancer, and others. Its therapeutic value was acknowledged when approved in 1978 by the U.S. FDA for treatment of the latter cancer. The current clinical literature indicates clearly that the full potential of this drug has not yet been realized. Hydration and diuresis have served to mitigate much of the nephrotoxicity, while significant strides toward amelioration of the nausea and vomiting have also been achieved. Literally, thousands of chemically-related congeners have been synthesized, and many have shown marked potency against rodent tumors. Very few, however, have been evaluated clinically, vis-a-vis malonato trans(-)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum(II); this appears a most promising and fertile area of future investigation.
