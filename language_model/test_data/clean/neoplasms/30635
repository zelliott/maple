Oncology nurses (n = 57) and oncology physicians (n = 40) employed in the same hospital completed the Cancer Attitude Questionnaire. Significant differences (p &lt; or = .001) between nurse and physician attitudes were evident on the two major subscales addressing the issues of (a) aggressiveness of treatment/de-emphasis of socioemotional aspects of care and (b) the importance of patient-family attitudes. Physicians' attitudes were significantly more favorable on the first subscale; nurses' attitudes were significantly more favorable on the second. Implications of these findings as indicators of potential nurse-physician conflict are discussed.
