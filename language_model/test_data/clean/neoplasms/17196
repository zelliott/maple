This case study evaluates the oncology nurse practitioner (NP) role in a chemotherapy unit.

The NP works in the cancer centre of a major metropolitan public hospital. The NP role was established in the chemotherapy unit in 2007. The NP reviews all patients that have an unscheduled presentation to the unit, with symptoms relating either to their disease or treatment.

All unscheduled occasions of service provided by the NP in the chemotherapy unit over 6 months were recorded. Data were collected on patient demographic characteristics, medical problems and reason for presentation. Data on duration of care, interventions and outcomes administered by the NP were captured.

There were 87 occasions of service (72 patients) during the study period. Nausea, vomiting or dehydration were the most common presenting problems and most presenting problems were moderate or severe (n = 73, 84%). The median time to review for the NP was 5 min and nearly all consultations (n = 83, 96%) took 30 min or less. Following NP consultation, most occasions of service did not require subsequent hospital admission (n = 52, 60%), medical advice (n = 61, 70%) or medical review (n = 75, 86%).

The NP is a valuable asset to a busy department, increasing access to timely and appropriate healthcare for patients on chemotherapy.
