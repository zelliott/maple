Monoclonal antibodies targeting c-erbB-2 protooncogene product p185 were conjugated with adriamycin via a pH-sensitive spacer. The resultant antibody-adriamycin conjugates showed immunoselective binding, internalization and cytotoxicity to p185-positive human breast cancer cell SKBr-3 and gastric cancer cell MKN-7, but not to normal human lymphocytes.
