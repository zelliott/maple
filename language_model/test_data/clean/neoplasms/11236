Patients with cancer-related anemia have an inadequate Epo response that is further impaired by cancer treatments such as chemotherapy. Significant number of studies have demonstrated that treatment of anemia in cancer patients using recombinant human EPO(rHuEPO, epoetin alfa) significantly increases hemoglobin(Hb) levels,reduces transfusion requirements,and improves quality of life,particularly by relieving fatigue. However,the findings of several studies have raised the possibility of an adverse effect of thromboembolism. The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Hematology developed an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the use of epoetin in patients with cancer. In cancer patients, the risk of bleeding depends not only on the platelet count, but also on the underlying disease, in accordance with coagulation defects. The cause of thrombocytopenia must be established prior to platelet transfusion since platelet transfusions may be relatively contraindicated in certain conditions e. g., heparin-induced thrombocytopenia(HIT), and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome(TTP/HUS).
