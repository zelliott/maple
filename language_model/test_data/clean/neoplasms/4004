An attempt was made to study the histological and histochemical changes as well as immunohistochemical changes in desmin expression occurring in four types of clinical myopathies e.g. Chronic ischaemic myopathy due to Buerger's disease (Group I), Carcinomatous myopathy (Group II), Metabolic myopathy (Group III) and Muscular dystrophy (Group IV). The number of cases studied were 16 cases, 15 cases, 4 cases and 5 cases respectively. The study revealed: (i) a combination of normal, degenerated, necrotic and regenerating fibres in different proportions in all the four groups having maximum number of degenerated fibres in Group I and Group IV, relatively more number of regenerating fibres in groups III and absence of necrotic fibres in Group I. (ii) Altered tinctorial property in most of the fibres indicating degenerated and regenerating fibres in all the groups with Masson's trichrome staining against inconstant staining with PTAH appear to be a good indicator for myopathy. (iii) The Desmin expression was week and irregular in most of the cases with most of the fibres probably due to reduction of desmin content probably indicating degenerated fibres, appear to be a good indicator for myopathy. (iv) Chronic ischaemic myopathy showed close resemblance with muscular dystrophy though no typical or distinct distinguishing feature could be identified in these four groups.
