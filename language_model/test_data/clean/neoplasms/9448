While posttranslational regulation of p53 levels by its interaction with the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 is widely accepted, it has recently become clear that regulation of p53 translation also contributes to p53 induction following DNA damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the translational control of p53 are still poorly understood. In this review, we will focus on the translational regulation of p53 through the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of its mRNA. We will also discuss in detail the recent discovery of the p53 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), its role in p53 translation in response to DNA damage, and how it might lead to a better understanding of the process of oncogenesis and provide new avenues for cancer therapeutics.
