Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) were found to inhibit proliferation of different tumor cell lines. LPS-induced maturation of DC strongly increased their capacity to inhibit tumor cell growth. We observed that tumoristatic activity of LPS-activated DC was independent of their cytotoxic potential. Indeed, LPS-activated DC were able to inhibit growth of caspase-8-deficient or Bcl-2-overexpressing Jurkat cells whereas they were not cytotoxic towards the same targets. On the other hand, we found that supernatant derived from LPS-activated DC exerted a significant anti-proliferative activity against Jurkat cells while it did not induce any cytotoxic effect. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was shown to critically contribute to tumor growth inhibition in this system.
