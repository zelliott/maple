The response of a cell to the myriad of signals that it receives is varied, and it is dependent on many different factors. The most-studied responses involve growth-factor signalling and these signalling cascades have become key targets for cancer therapy. Recent reports have indicated that growth-factor receptors and associated adaptors can accumulate in the nucleus. Are there novel functions for these proteins that might affect our understanding of their role in cancer and have implications for drug resistance?
