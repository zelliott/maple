This study describes the unique supportive care needs and associated distress among older adults receiving cancer survivorship care in a community cancer center. The psychological and social changes that accompany aging may influence the impact of cancer, so documenting the distinctive experiences of older survivors is critical to the development of evidence-based practice guidelines. A secondary analysis of data was conducted using results from a survey of adult cancer survivors. Data were available from a convenience sample of 307 survivors receiving care in a community cancer care setting who volunteered to complete a Survey of Needs. Fatigue, fear of recurrence, sleep disturbance, balance/walking/mobility difficulties, long-term effects of treatment, and body changes were most frequently reported. Results suggest assessment of older adult cancer survivors' experiences related to physical symptoms, symptom management, and interest in education targeting physical effects common to survivorship.
