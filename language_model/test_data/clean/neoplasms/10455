Children, young people and their families come into contact with a large number of health and social care professionals within hospital, education and community settings following a cancer diagnosis. The multiprofessional team best supports these families through an open and communicative approach to care. The side effects of cancer treatment include fever, infection, gastrointestinal upset, altered body image and psychological impact on children, young people and their families. Debate continues as to how children, young people, their siblings and parents cope with childhood cancer and its treatment due to its impact on family quality of life. It is considered that the short- and long-term wellbeing of children, young people and their families during treatment is best supported by continuing routine daily activities, such as attending nursery, school or college.
