The distribution of chromogranin A and secretogranin I (chromogranin B) in normal and neoplastic human endocrine tissues was analyzed with two human monoclonal antibodies against chromogranin A, anti-bovine antiserum against chromogranin A, and an anti-rat antiserum against secretogranin I. Western blotting analyses showed both chromogranin A and secretogranin I in normal adrenals, pheochromocytomas, a pituitary adenoma, and in normal pituitary glands, but not in a bladder carcinoma. Rat adrenal medullary and anterior pituitary tissues reacted with the polyclonal chromogranin A and secretogranin I antisera, but not with the two monoclonal chromogranin A antibodies. All antibodies reacted with most of the neuroendocrine cells and tumors examined. Pituitary prolactinomas contained immunoreactive secretogranin I, but not chromogranin A. Analysis of the distribution of chromogranin A and secretogranin I in pancreatic islet cells showed that chromogranin A was found predominantly in the glucagon-producing A cells, whereas secretogranin I was present in less than 5% of islet cells. These results indicate that chromogranin A and secretogranin I are both useful in the characterization of some neuroendocrine cells and neoplasms.
