Sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, gangliosides are highly expressed in human cancer cells and regulate cell signals transduced via membrane microdomains. Generally, disialyl gangliosides enhance tumor phenotypes, while monosialyl gangliosides suppress them. In particular, gangliosides GD3 and GD2 are highly expressed in melanomas and small cell lung cancer cells, and their expression cause increased cell growth and invasion. In osteosarcomas, expression of GD3 and GD2 also enhanced cell invasion and motility, and caused increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. In addition to focal adhesion kinase, Lyn kinase was also activated by GD3/GD2 expression, leading to the phosphorylation of paxillin. In contrast with melanoma cells, osteosarcomas showed reduced cell adhesion with increased phosphorylation of paxillin. Thus, increased expression of GD3/GD2 caused enhanced activation of signaling molecules, leading to distinct phenotypes between melanomas and osteosarcomas, i.e. increased and decreased adhesion activity. Thus, whole features of glycolipid-enriched microdomain/rafts formed in the individual cancer types seem to determine the main signaling pathway and biological outcome.
