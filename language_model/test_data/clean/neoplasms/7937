A paradoxical effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy for cancer is that some of these treatments can themselves cause new cancers. Most epidemiologic methods can be applied successfully to the investigation of this problem and this paper reviews various approaches that have already been used by various researchers. The authors first review the more traditional methods, i.e., cohort and case-control studies and they then describe designs that have been proposed more recently, such as case-cohort studies. A distinction is established between internal comparisons, carried out within the study population, and external comparisons, in which a general population external to the population under study is used as the reference category. This presentation is mainly aimed at investigators using tumor registry data. However, the general principles formulated here are easily generalized to contexts other than that of registries.
