Pre-operative levels of the acute phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin (assessing nutritional status), the tumour marker CEA and three plasma protease inhibitors, i.e. C1-esterase inhibitor, alpha-2-macroglobulin and antithrombin III, were prospectively studied in 183 patients with various solid cancers. First, the predictive value of abnormal levels for operability at the primary operation was studied. Secondly, the predictive value of abnormal levels for cancer recurrence and metastases was evaluated during 2 years of follow-up. The results show that malignancy induces increased CRP and C1-esterase inhibitor levels and decreased albumin levels in serum. These changes, as well as raised alkaline phosphatase and lowered haemoglobin levels, also correlate to the 'overall' tumour burden. The most important conclusion is, that increased pre-operative CRP levels (CRP &gt; or = 10 mg/l; sensitivity, 79%; specificity, 71%) and/or low albumin levels (albumin &lt;37 g/l; sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 54%) are seen in inoperable cancer patients compared with patients having operable cancers. The second main important conclusion is, that high pre-operative C1-esterase inhibitor levels (C1-esterase inhibitor &gt;152%; sensitivity, 45%; specificity, 90%), and in some patients a high alkaline phosphatase level, are seen in patients exhibiting early cancer recurrence (within 2 years post-operatively).
