Three biphasic materials have been synthesized from a magnetic glass-ceramic (Si-Ca-Fe) and a bioactive sol-gel glass (Si-P-Ca). The ratios of glass-ceramic:sol-gel glass used in this work were 1:1, 2:1, and 5:1. These materials show bioactive and magnetic properties and can be used as thermoseeds for hyperthermia treatment of bone tumors. The sol-gel glass content affects the textural properties of the glass-ceramic, giving rise to porosity, which plays a fundamental role in the formation of an apatite-like layer on the surface. On the other hand, as the sol-gel glass content increases, the magnetic properties change due to the diffusion of Fe ions to the glassy phases of the biphasic materials. The biphasic nature of these materials allows the changing of both properties, depending on the requirements of the patient.
