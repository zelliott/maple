To establish structural equation model (SEM) of subjected quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients taking into account qualification of pharmacists.

The SEM model was constructed from correlation matrix of the scores of answers of questions to both patients and pharmacists. Data were collected from 15 cancer patients who hospitalized and took opioid analgesics for pain control. The patients were asked 18 questions and pharmacists were asked seven questions. From the correlation matrix among scores of answers, a reasonable model was explored by SEM.

Health-related QOL (HRQOL) in cancer patients can be modeled by latent variables consist of contributions from physical, emotional and functional domains. The fitting between data and the model was acceptable by statistical goodness-of-fit (GOF) index. The modeled HRQOL by SEM was weakly correlated with subjected QOL in patients, indicating that subjected QOL in patients would be affected not only by above latent variables but other variables. The model taking into account qualification of pharmacists to improve subjected QOL in patients was also made by SEM. The model was reasonably explained and fitting between data and the model was acceptable from some statistical index. The final model suggests that pharmacist can raise subjected QOL in patients through restraining unpleasant side effects.

The qualification of pharmacists to improve subjected QOL in patients can be modeled by SEM. The final model suggests that pharmacists with qualification to assess patients' pain status contribute to raise subjected quality of life in cancer patients.
