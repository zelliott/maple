In certain social circles a variety of volatile nitrites are being used extensively to expand creativity, stimulate music appreciation, promote a sense of abandon in dancing, and intensify sexual experience. Soon after amyl nitrite (the prototype of this group) became a prescription drug, legally produced substitutes appeared and were sold as room odorizers. Analyses of eight of these substitutes showed them to contain isomers of butyl or amyl alcohol and a corresponding nitrite. The authors describe the context of use of these products and their desired and adverse effects.
