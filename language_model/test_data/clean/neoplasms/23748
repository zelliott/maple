The diagnostic relevance of recording motor evoked potentials (MEPs) after electrical stimulation of the cervical region, as compared with conventional needle electromyography (EMG), was evaluated in 26 patients with brachial plexus (BP) damage of different aetiology, severity and topography. MEP abnormalities (absence or latency increase) were observed in at least one muscle of all the patients, with a global incidence of 61.5% of the muscles examined. Neurogenic EMG signs were present in all but one patient with an incidence of 62.2% of the muscles examined. Combining the two methods, the global incidence of abnormalities rose to 69.9%. MEP abnormalities were consistent with the clinical topography and severity of BP lesions and were fairly parallel with EMG findings. Recording MEPs after percutaneous electrical stimulation of the cervical region may be regarded as a rapid, non-invasive method for quantitative electrophysiological assessment of BP damage.
