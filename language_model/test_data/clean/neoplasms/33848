DNA adducts generated by carcinogenic chemicals reflects human exposure and DNA adducts are related to tumor formation. Most chemical carcinogens require activation to reactive intermediates that bind to nucleophilic centers in proteins and nucleic acids thereby forming covalent adducts. Also, many of the chemicals considered carcinogenic for humans form covalent DNA adducts. Therefore, such DNA damage is generally considered to be causative and linked to tumor formation. In this article we have summarized the work done for many years on the role of DNA adduct formation as an indicator of their carcinogenicity. We have also addressed the important role for measurement of DNA adducts in studies with potential chemopreventive agents for which it is central to have a marker that can be measured more rapidly than changes in cancer incidence.
