A number of publications have attributed a tumor suppressive (TS) function to PARKIN, a gene associated with recessive familial early onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD). Discoveries of PARKIN deletions and point mutations in tumors, functional studies, and data from mouse models have been presented to support the hypothesis. We have asked whether PARKIN mutations are associated with history of cancer in humans. We interviewed 431 participants who were screened for PARKIN mutations, including 149 EOPD cases and their family members, who were unaware of mutation status. We found no significant difference in self-reported history of cancer among carriers of one or two PARKIN mutations and noncarriers, odds ratio 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.27-1.83). In particular, no increase in cancer history was seen among homozygous and compound heterozygous mutation carriers compared to noncarriers. Therefore, we hypothesize that published studies attributing TS capability to PARKIN merit further exploration and we present a reevaluation of these data with respect to patterns of mutation frequencies in normal and cancer cells. We conclude that although Parkin may exert a suppressive effect in mice, further studies are required prior to assigning a TS function to PARKIN in humans.
