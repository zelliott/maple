Systemic Candida infections are a major cause of infectious morbidity and mortality during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Because of the unreliability of conventional diagnostic tests to detect systemic infection early in its course, treatment of established disseminated Candida infection has been generally disappointing with mortality rates of 60-80% in leukemia and bone marrow transplant patients and 30-40% in solid tumor patients. The use of empiric amphotericin B in patients with fever not responding to empiric antibacterial agents has been shown to be successful in reducing morbidity and mortality from fungal infections. However, its toxicity has mitigated the success of this approach. Fluconazole given prophylactically at the institution of chemotherapy has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative. It, however, is not active against all fungal species, especially Aspergillus and some of the less virulent Candida species. Some centers have reported break-through infections by these less susceptible organisms. Whether or not these limitations in its spectrum of activity will limit its usefulness in the future remains unanswered at this time and could pose a cloud to an otherwise bright promise.
