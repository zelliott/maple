Planar and tomographic imaging techniques and methods of treatment planning in clinical radioimmunotherapy are reviewed. In clinical trials, the data needed for dosimetry and treatment planning are, in most cases, obtained from noninvasive imaging procedures. The required data include tumor and normal organ volumes, the activity of radiolabeled antibodies taken up in these volumes, and the pharmacokinetics of the administered activity of radiolabeled antibodies. Therefore, the topics addressed in this review include: (1) Volume determination of tumors and normal organs from x-ray-computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, (2) quantitation of the activity of radiolabeled antibodies in tumors and normal organs from planar gamma camera views, (3) quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography, (4) correlative image analysis, and (5) treatment planning in clinical radioimmunotherapy.
