Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 share the IL-12p40 molecule. IL-12 promotes T helper (Th)1 immunity and IL-23 promotes Th17 immunity, and it has recently become apparent that the balance between IL-12 and IL-23 is important in carcinogenesis. A series of studies demonstrated that, where tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis are concerned, IL-12 may act independently of interferon (IFN)-Î³, and IL-23 independently of IL-17A. This review explores the activity of IL-23 in carcinogenesis. In the context of the tumor-inhibitory effects of IL-12, and tumor-promoting effects of IL-23, we discuss the use of anti-IL-12p/23 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in autoimmune inflammatory disorders and the alternative specific neutralization of IL-23.
