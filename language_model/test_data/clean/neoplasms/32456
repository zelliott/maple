The last period of life of a child suffering from cancer is of crucial importance not only for the child himself but for his parents and relatives as well. The way the child dies will remain in the memory of his parents for ever. Multiple problems in management of dying child may arise during this last phase. Timely and sensitive discussion of such aspects of management as implementation of Do Not Resuscitate order, possible provision of fluids and parenteral nutrition, initiation of palliative sedation and management of depression is necessary and may help parents to better cope with this tragic situation. Palliative care team consisting of medical and psychosocial staff plays vital role conveying comprehensive and timely management of all these problems and providing all necessary assistance for parents and other involved during ones' last weeks, days, and hours of child's life. The palliative care team cannot avert approaching death but it is responsible for making it as peaceful and as free of suffering as possible. This is achieved by vigorous control of all physical symptoms in the dying child and by paying close attention to all existential, emotional, and social demands of both the child and his relatives.
