ASK1, a member of the MAPK Kinase Kinase family of proteins has been shown to play a key role in cancer, neurodegeneration and cardiovascular diseases and is emerging as a possible drug target. Here we describe a 'replacement-soaking' method that has enabled the high-throughput X-ray structure determination of ASK1/ligand complexes. Comparison of the X-ray structures of five ASK1/ligand complexes from 3 different chemotypes illustrates that the ASK1 ATP binding site is able to accommodate a range of chemical diversity and different binding modes. The replacement-soaking system is also able to tolerate some protein flexibility. This crystal system provides a robust platform for ASK1/ligand structure determination and future structure based drug design.
