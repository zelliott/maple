Selection of mouse models of cancer is often based simply on availability of a mouse strain and a known compatible tumor. Frequently this results in use of tumor models long on history but short on homology and quality control. Other factors including genetics, sex, immunological status, method and site of tumor implantation, technical competence, biological activity of the tumor, protocol sequence and timing, and selection of endpoints interact to produce outcomes in tumor models. Common reliance on survival and tumor burden data in a single mouse model often skews expectations towards high remission and cure rates; a finding seldom duplicated in clinical trials. Inherent limitations of tumor models coupled with the advent of new therapeutic targets reinforce need for careful attention to design, conduct, and stringent selection of in vivo and ex vivo endpoints. Preclinical efficacy testing for anti-tumor therapies should progress through a series of models of increasing sophistication that includes incorporation of genetically engineered animals, and orthotopic and combination therapy models. Pharmacology and safety testing in tumor-bearing animals may also help to improve predictive value of these models for clinical efficacy. Trends in bioinformatics, genetic refinements, and specialized imaging techniques are helping to maintain mice as the most scientifically and economically powerful model of malignant neoplasms.
