Recent advances in biotechnology have led to discoveries resulting in major improvements in the therapy of refractory malignancies, although most advanced cancers remain incurable. Thus, there is global consensus around the need to streamline the drug approval process for effective agents. Accelerated Approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation hold the promise of making new treatments available sooner through the use of smaller studies using intermediate endpoints. Here, we consider the inherent limitations of smaller studies and discuss the strategies for hastening oncology drug development while maintaining high-efficacy standards.
