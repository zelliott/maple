Cancer development and progression has been associated with numerous genetic events in tumor cells. Germline mutations of caretaker and gatekeeper genes are responsible for hereditary cancer syndromes. Exogenous factors in conjunction with functional germline variants of a variety of genes may contribute to tumor initiation in sporadic malignant disease. Furthermore, pathways to neoplasia require somatic events in the developing tumor. Acquired or inherited genetic instability permits stepwise tumor progression. The most fearsome aspect of tumor progression is dissemination of tumor cells to draining lymph nodes of the primary or to distant organs, which limits effectiveness of surgical therapy. Cellular heterogeneity of malignant neoplasms has important implications for chemotherapy and radiotherapy. An increasing understanding of the molecular biology of tumors is the prerequisite for improved prediction, prevention and therapy of malignant disease.
