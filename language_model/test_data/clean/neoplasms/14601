Previous studies have shown that fast homoarginine-sensitive alkaline phosphatase (FHAP) is roughly equivalent to CEA (Roche) as a marker in colon cancer. The present study compares FHAP with CEA-EIA (Abbott) as a marker in cancer of the colon, breast, lung, ovary, uterus, skin, and lymph nodes. Comparison is made with regard to sensitivity, specificity, predictive value of a positive test, and diagnostic efficiency. It was determined that FHAP and CEA-EIA were comparable as markers for cancers of the colon, breast, and lung. FHAP was more sensitive and specific and had a higher predictive value and diagnostic efficiency for cancers of the ovary, uterus, skin, and lymph nodes.
