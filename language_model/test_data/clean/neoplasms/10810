To investigate anticancer activity of different fractions of Tephrosia purpurea [TP] (Sharapunkha, Fabaceae) and Ficus religiosa [FR] (Peepal, Moraceae).

The fractions of TP and FR were prepared and tested for in vitro anticancer activity using human MCF 7 cell line by trypan blue exclusion method.

The result showed that among all these fractions of TPI, TPIII, FRI and FRIII showed better anticancer activity compared to other fractions. The IC(50) value for TPI (152.4 μM), TPIII (158.71 μM), FRI (160.3 μM) and for FRIII (222.7 μM) was observed.

The present study shows anticancer potential of TP and FR fractions in MCF 7 cell line.
