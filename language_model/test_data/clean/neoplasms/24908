Adriamycin, a new antitumour antibiotic of the anthracycline group with a structural formula very similar to daunorubicin, has proved to have potent tumour-growth-inhibiting properties, and to be particularly effective in childhood malignancies. Though adriamycin produces a higher percentage of side-effects than daunorubicin-namely, stomatitis and alopecia-a lower dosage may be used for therapy.
