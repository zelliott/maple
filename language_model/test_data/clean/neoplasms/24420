The term epigenetics encompasses all the modifications that are stable across cell generations, but which do not imply any change in DNA sequence. Post-translational modifications of the histones and DNA methylation are the most studied types of epigenetic information due to their major impact on transcription. The link between epigenetics and cancer arises from the fact that epigenetic deregulations frequently participate in tumorigenesis by inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes. Since these deregulations are reversible, hopes of treatment rely on a better understanding of the maintenance mechanisms of the epigenetic information. Among the different pathways of transcription inhibition, DNA methylation is the simplest and one of the best characterized at the present time. Inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases are currently under clinical trials and already show promising results.
