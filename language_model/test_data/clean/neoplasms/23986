A review of the microdosimetry of boron neutron capture therapy is presented focusing on the progression of key scientific ideas and developments in this field rather than on a comprehensive and inclusive review of the literature. The author concludes that from a microdosimetry perspective the field is highly advanced, but what is lacking is the correlation of the proposed models and results with experimental radiobiological data.
