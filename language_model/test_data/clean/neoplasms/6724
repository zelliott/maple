Modern multidisciplinary treatment of childhood cancer has made extent of disease evaluation important for proper treatment planning. Accurate staging is essential to cooperative group studies and for comparing treatment modalities at different centers. Operative staging plays an important role where clinical or imaging methods are limited, as in abdominal Hodgkin's disease or regional nodal metastasis. Operative staging is carried out either as a special diagnostic procedure, as in lymphoma, or as part of a planned surgical resection of a solid tumor. For lymphomas: Operative staging of abdominal Hodgkin's disease is required where protocols include involved field irradiation and sparing of normal growing tissue in the child. In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, bulky abdominal tumor may be surgically evaluated after intensive chemotherapy either in delayed primary surgery or in second look procedures. Residual tumor may be excised or tagged with clips for localized irradiation to the tumor sparing normal abdominal organs. For solid tumors: During surgical resection of neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma, the correct procedure involves regional staging either by formal node dissections or by multiple biopsies to determine extent of spread. Regional node dissections are often part of a correct cancer operation for cure, but also give staging information unobtainable by other methods. The surgeon must plan every procedure carefully with the aim of curing the patient and also deriving maximum information from the operation to enable correct planning of further treatment.
