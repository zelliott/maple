Valid measurement tools are needed by oncology researchers to help in the evaluation of the effectiveness of pain relief methods used in the treatment of cancer patients. A study was conducted to assess the validity and reliability of a tool designed to evaluate quality of life as a measure of pain management outcome in the individual patient. Items in the tested quality of life survey represented the areas of psychologic well-being, physical well-being, general and specific symptom control, and degree of social support. Using the test instrument, two oncology nurses interviewed subjects in three groups, each consisting of 50 subjects: cancer patients with pain, cancer patients without pain, and subjects with no cancer. Statistical analysis of the interview results revealed that the instrument has test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and interrater reliability, as well as content and construct validity for the major factors, psychologic well-being, worry, and nutrition. Further revision of the instrument is needed to restructure its subscales. The quality of life tool will enable researchers to evaluate a treatment regarding not only its effect on pain intensity but also its impact on the total individual.
