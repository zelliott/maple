The authors studied the relation between home parenteral nutrition (HPN) and medical economy. The items of study are 1) cost benefit of HPN compared with TPN, 2) hospital intention to promote HPN, 3) economical demerits for outpatients receiving HPN.

1) HPN had the advantage of cost benefit compared with TPN in reimbursement; however, hospitals did not have such an intention. 2) It is necessary for advanced home care to improve reimbursement in the health insurance system; and in the existing situation, hospitals do not profit from HPN. 3) Home care companies are unprofitable because of nursing visits and reimbursement issues which do not ease legal restrictions. 4) HPN in the present situation depends on the ability of patients to pay and the ability of care givers to provide care.
