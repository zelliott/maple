The attitude of Italian general practitioners in prescribing practices for patients with cancer pain was assessed by means of a questionnaire. The results indicated that among most of the doctors who completed the questionnaire the basic principles of pain treatment in cancer patients are largely understood. Oral morphine emerged as the most commonly used opioid (60%) and controlled-release morphine as the preferred preparation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most commonly used minor analgesics. Fear of side effects and restrictive prescribing regulations emerged as the most important barrier against adequate pain management. The survey emphasised the need for continued efforts in implementing specific educational programming for improvement in cancer pain management.
