The experience of thermoradiotherapy of superficial and deep-seated tumors with Thermotron RF-8 in the Kyoto University Hospital indicates the effectiveness of RF capacitative heating. CT scanning plays an important role in the assessment of thermoradiotherapy as it permits the detection of low density zones in a heated area. In such cases even in the absence of tumor regression, local tumor control is observed. It is confirmed by the retardation of tumor growth and histology findings.
