In Fez-Boulemane, Morocco, there is no cancer registry so there is a lack of information about the incidence and characteristics of cancer in the region. In this retrospective study we examined the epidemiological and pathological features of 5532 cases of cancer collected from the Department of Pathology in Hassan II University Hospital of Fes from 2004 to 2010. The mean age of the patients was 53.5 years and 52% were male. Digestive cancers and skin cancers were the most common. Digestive cancers were predominantly colorectal and stomach. Cancers of the urinary bladder and colorectal cancers were the leading cancers in men accounting respectively for 9% and 8% of all male cancers. In women, cancers of the breast (62%) and uterine cervix (22.6%) predominated. As a first step in cancer control in our area, establishment of a regional cancer registry is recommended.
