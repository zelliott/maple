It is important to augment the anti-cancer host response in cancer treatment. Recent studies suggested that the signaling via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which are newly identified receptor molecules recognizing many pathogens, are involved in the induction of anti-cancer immunity. Seya et al. demonstrated that maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and cytokine induction by the cell wall skeleton of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG-CWS) are induced via both TLR2 and TLR4. Akira et al. discovered a new molecule of TLR family, TLR9, recognizing unmethylated bacterial CpG-DNA, whose clinical use is expected for cancer therapy as a potent inducer of a helper T cell 1 (Th1)-type T-cell response. TLR9-deficient mice did not show any responses to CpG-DNA, including Th 1 cytokine production and maturation of DCs. We have obtained two molecules, a lipoteichoic acid-related molecule isolated from streptococcal agent OK-432, and a plant-derived 55-kDa protein that can induce Th1 response and elicit a strong anti-cancer effect in vivo and in vitro. Our basic experiments demonstrate that TLR4 signaling is intimately involved in anti-cancer immunity induced by these immunopotentiators. Our clinical examination in oral cancer patients also suggests the requirement of both TLR4 and MD-2 in the OK-432-induced anti-cancer host response. Establishment and clinical use of the methodology for human cancer therapy by utilizing TLR signaling is greatly expected.
