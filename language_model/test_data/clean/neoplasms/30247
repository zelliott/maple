The folate receptor (FR) is a potentially useful biological target for the management of many human cancers. This membrane protein binds extracellular folates with very high affinity and, through an endocytic process, physically delivers them inside the cell for biological consumption. There are now many examples of how this physiological system can be exploited for the targeted delivery of biologically active molecules to cancer. In fact, strong preclinical as well as emerging clinical evidence exists showing how FR-positive cancers can be (i) anatomically identified using folate conjugates of radiodiagnostic imaging agents and (ii) effectively treated with companion folate-targeted chemotherapies. While the biological results are compelling, it is of equal importance to understand the conjugation chemistries that were developed to produce these active molecules. Therefore, this review will focus on the methods utilized to construct folate-based small-molecule drug conjugates (SMDCs), with particular attention focused on modular design, hydrophilic spacers, and self-immolative linkers.
