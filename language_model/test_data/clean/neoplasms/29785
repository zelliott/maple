Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by living microorganisms which have the capacity to inhibit or kill other microbes of a different class. They were used successfully to revolutionize the treatment of infectious disease several decades ago. It is hypothesized that the concept of antibiosis or microbe antagonism will do the same for the treatment of cancer during the forseeable future. It is predicted that anti-cancer antibiotics, still mostly unidentified in the environment, which can be classified as being Biologic Response Modifiers to enhance the host's natural immune defenses against cancer, will prove to be the chief weapon to win the final battle against invasive cancer. However, to reach that goal the basic laws of immunity, including that of anamnesis, will have to be implemented and not ignored.
