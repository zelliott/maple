Four decades ago, angiogenesis was recognized as a therapeutic target for blocking cancer growth. Because of its importance, VEGF has been at the center stage of antiangiogenic therapy. Now, several years after FDA approval of an anti-VEGF antibody as the first antiangiogenic agent, many patients with cancer and ocular neovascularization have benefited from VEGF-targeted therapy; however, this anticancer strategy is challenged by insufficient efficacy, intrinsic refractoriness, and resistance. Here, we examine recent discoveries of new mechanisms underlying angiogenesis, discuss successes and challenges of current antiangiogenic therapy, and highlight emerging antiangiogenic paradigms.
