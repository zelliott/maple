Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is involved in a wide range of functions in the nucleus. However, a substantial amount of PCNA is also present in the cytoplasm, although their function is unknown. Here we show, through Far-Western blotting and mass spectrometry, that PCNA is associated with several cytoplasmic oncoproteins, including elongation factor, malate dehydrogenase, and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. Surprisingly, PCNA is also associated with six glycolytic enzymes that are involved in the regulation of steps 4-9 in the glycolysis pathway.
