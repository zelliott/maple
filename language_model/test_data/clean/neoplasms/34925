Increasing longevity of the cancer patient has brought about the need for mental health professionals to help patients and families cope with stresses not only at diagnosis and death but throughout the course of the illness and cure when the survivor experiences late effects and societal barriers. Patients, parents, mental health professionals, physicians, and the public all have differing perspectives on problems facing the survivor. The tendency is for physicians to minimize problems in light of curing a disease that was once fatal. The public may be reluctant to acknowledge problems out of a lack of awareness that cure is possible. Differences in points of view may account for disagreements about the significance of problems associated with survival. Acknowledgment and understanding of these various perspectives are prerequisite to resolving problems and facilitating the coordination of care and support survivors require in their pursuit of a normal life.
