Recombinant human interleukin-11 (rhIL-11) has been shown to enhance recovery from thrombocytopenia and mucosal injury after cancer chemotherapy. Since RNA for the receptor and signal transducer for IL-11 is detected in many cell types including some cancer cells, it was theoretically possible that rhIL-11 could affect the growth of tumor cells. This study was intended to determine whether rhIL-11 stimulates the proliferation of human tumor colony-forming units (TCFUs) taken directly from patients. Tumor cells were cultured in soft agar and continuously exposed to three concentrations of rhIL-11 (1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 U/ml) for 14 days in the capillary cloning system. Growth stimulation was noted in two of 66 (3%) of evaluable specimens, including one of 14 evaluable non-small cell lung cancer and one of five evaluable colon cancer specimens. In these two specimens, there was no increased stimulation of TCFUs with escalating concentrations of rhIL-11. Interestingly, the highest concentration of rhIL-11 tested inhibited the growth of 16 specimens (24.2%; 95% confidence interval 13.9-34.5%). Growth inhibition demonstrated a concentration-response relationship (p &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that rhIL-11 appears unlikely to stimulate the growth of the most common solid tumors.
