Folate metabolism is thought to play an important role in carcinogenesis through its involvement in both DNA methylation and nucleotide synthesis. A common Ala(222)/Val variant in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene leads to a disturbed folate metabolism and is associated with decreased genomic DNA methylation. We previously reported that the MTHFR Val/Val genotype was associated with increased cancer mortality in men from a population-based cohort of subjects ages &gt; or = 85 years. To further explore the deleterious effects of the MTHFR genotype, we studied the association of the genotype with cancer risk in 860 men ages 65-84 years who were followed &gt;10 years (Zutphen Elderly Study). During follow-up, 149 new cases of cancer occurred among the 793 men without cancer at baseline. The risk of developing cancer was 1.80-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.00) higher among men with the Val/Val genotype than among men with the Ala/Ala genotype. Except for lung cancer [relative risk (RR), 1.15], the risks of common forms of cancers were significantly increased among men with the Val/Val genotype [cancer of the prostate (RR, 3.48); the colorectum (RR, 3.65); the kidney and bladder (RR, 5.48)]. The risks of cancer were particularly increased among men with a lower folate and a higher alcohol intake and men of an older age. In conclusion, our current and previous studies in two independent populations indicate that a common Ala/Val variant in the MTHFR gene is a risk factor for cancer in elderly men from the general population. The mechanism underlying this association might involve genomic instability as a result of insufficient methylation of genomic DNA.
