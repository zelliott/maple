Renal failure secondary to CDDP is due to acute tubular necrosis and is usually reversible. We report 4 cases of definitive renal failure secondary to administration of cisplatin (CDDP). Three women and one man, mean age 40 +/- 8 years (24 to 64 years), at onset of dialysis are reported. They had received 1 to 4 courses of CDDP for an endometrial carcinoma (n = 2), a breast carcinoma or a thymoma. The mean total dose of CDDP was 447 +/- 169 mg (160 to 900 mg). There was no additional nephrotoxic drug. Before treatment serum creatinine concentration was normal (77 +/- 7 mumol per liter) in all patients. In 2 cases dehydration (due to vomiting and use of mannitol) occurred during CDDP treatment. One patient was treated 30 days after a nephrectomy. At the onset of dialysis, renal ultrasound was normal. In 3 cases dialysis was necessary within 15 days following chemotherapy. In one case renal function deteriorated progressively to end stage renal failure 12 months after CDDP treatment. Dialysis was performed in 3 cases by hemodialysis and in one patient by peritoneal dialysis. All patients remained more than 6 months on dialysis. Three patients died from their cancer. One patient, being considered cured from his thymoma, is currently being evaluated for a kidney transplantation. Our observations outline the potential severity of CDDP nephrotoxicity. Systemic hydration with serial serum creatinine measurements are mandatory during and after CDDP administration these patients.
