Twenty-four children with cancer and localized herpes zoster were randomized to receive either topical polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] or a saline placebo. Solutions containing 1.0 or 2.5 mg of drug per ml were applied to the lesions every 3 h, seven times a day for 7 consecutive days. Serial, standardized color photographs were used to evaluate the progression of lesions and maximum percentage of dermatome involvement. In patients receiving poly(I:C), the median days of new lesions after therapy was 2.0 days as opposed to 3.5 days in placebo-treated patients. This difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, the total median days of lesions and percentage of dermatome involvement were similar in both groups, as were complications. Neither the concentration nor the total dose of drug was related to the outcome of infection. We conclude that topical poly(I:C), as used in this study, was of no benefit in treatment of localized herpes zoster.
