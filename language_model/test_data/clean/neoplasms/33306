Rapidly detectable and easily accessible markers of tumor cell death are needed for evaluating early therapeutic efficacy for immunotherapy and chemotherapy so that patients and their physicians can decide whether to remain with a given therapeutic strategy. Currently, image-based tests such as computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging are used to visualize the response of a patient's tumor, but often these evaluations are not conducted for weeks to months after treatment begins. While serum levels of secreted proteins such as carcinoembryonic antigen and prostate specific antigen are commonly monitored to gauge tumor status during therapy and between image evaluations, the levels of these proteins do not always correlate well with the actual tumor response. In laboratory studies, it has been shown that tumor cells undergoing apoptosis can release cellular components into cell culture media such as cytochrome c, nucleosomes, cleaved cytokeratin-18 and E-cadherin. Studies of patient sera have found that these and other macromolecules can be found in circulation during cancer therapy, providing a potential source of material for monitoring treatment efficacy. In the future, analysis of biofluids from severe combined immunodeficiency mice bearing patient tumor specimens treated with a targeted therapy such as Apo2L/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand will be useful in the preclinical identification of therapy response markers. In this review, the current status of the identification of serum markers of tumor cell apoptosis is provided, as well as a discussion of critical research questions that must be addressed and the considerations necessary when identifying a marker that reflects true clinical outcome.
