Metastatic tumor cells of epithelial origin present in effusions from human serous cavity fluids (ascites or pleural fluid) were examined for their intermediate-sized filament types by using antibodies to keratin, vimentin, and desmin in the indirect immunofluorescence technique. Solid epithelial tumors (both primary carcinomas and their metastases) contain keratin intermediate-sized filaments exclusively. However, when these cells are present in ascitic or pleural fluid, they also express vimentin, which occurs in a fibrillar organization. The possible effects of this additional, but temporary, cytoskeleton on metastatic growth or aggressiveness (or both) are discussed.
