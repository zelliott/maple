Ibandronate is an experimental intravenous bisphosphonate under study for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis and skeletal complications of bone metastases, as well as hypercalcemia of malignancy. To review the data on this drug, PubMed/MEDLINE was searched for pertinent studies in English; data from January 1986-October 2005 were reviewed. In preclinical studies, ibandronate was an extremely potent bisphosphonate compared with its predecessors and was active in all animal models of human postmenopausal and corticosteroid-associated osteoporosis. Similar to other bisphosphonates, ibandronate exhibits antitumor activity and prevents or reduces bone metastases. Forty to fifty percent of the dose is bound to bone; renal clearance of unchanged drug accounts for 70% of total body clearance. Early clinical trials demonstrated efficacy and tolerability of intravenous ibandronate in the prevention or treatment of postmenopausal and corticosteroid-associated osteoporosis when administered once every 3 months. Intravenous ibandronate also reduces skeletal complications of bone metastases, including pain, although the cumulative dose used is much higher than that used in osteoporosis, as the drug is administered every 3-4 weeks. Single doses of intravenous ibandronate are probably also effective in the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy. The major tolerability issue with intravenous bisphosphonates is renal safety, thus the drugs generally require infusion (e.g., 0.25 hr for zoledronic acid, 2-24 hrs for pamidronate). However, intravenous ibandronate can be administered by bolus injection over a few minutes without an elevated risk of nephrotoxicity. The experimental intravenous dosage is 2 mg every 3 months for treatment or prevention of osteoporosis, and 2-6 mg every 3-4 weeks or in a single dose for treatment of bone metastases or hypercalcemia of malignancy, respectively. Ibandronate can be used in the presence of severe renal impairment with proper dosage adjustment. The drug will be an interesting addition to the available drugs for osteoporosis, bone metastases, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Studies of intravenous ibandronate as an adjunctive treatment for cancers that tend to metastasize to bone are under way. Whether intravenous ibandronate will be a therapeutic advance is best answered by randomized, controlled trials. These are ongoing and should provide data with which to make better-informed choices concerning intravenous bisphosphonates.
