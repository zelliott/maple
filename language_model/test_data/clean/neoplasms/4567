To provide an overview of access devices used to treat cancers through the arterial, peritoneal, and intraventricular body systems.

Short-term and long-term devices have been developed over the last 35 years for cancer treatment. Although less amenable to standard methods of therapy, the various access devices available to access the arterial, peritoneal, and intraventricular systems have provided a safe and reliable means for drug therapy. Access devices assist in delivering high concentrations of drugs directly to the center of the tumor. Complications and toxicities are inherent with these devices from the drug therapy as well as the device. Nursing assessment can provide early identification of potential problems and implementation of appropriate interventions.

As the availability of these devices increases, so must the nurse's knowledge base to provide optimal safe care. Oncology nurses are challenged to know the differences between the devices, the device of choice for the individual patient, insertion procedures, and maintenance protocols.
