Confirmatory factor-analytic models are used to examine gender biases of individual items of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale. In samples containing 708 cancer patients and 504 caregivers of the chronically ill elderly, two CES-D items are identified as producing biased responses in comparisons of male and female respondents. Three additional CES-D items are excluded on the basis of other psychometric problems, yielding a subset of 15 CES-D items that capture almost all the information of the original 20-item CES-D scale but are free of any gender bias. Gender differences in mean levels of depressive symptomatology are significantly reduced, but not eliminated, when the 15-item scale is used.
