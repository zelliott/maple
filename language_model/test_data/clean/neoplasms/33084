Glucocorticoids can inhibit solid tumor growth via downregulation of tumor-associated inflammation/angiogenesis. In this minireview we describe the possible mechanisms of glucocorticoid action in tumor growth inhibition. We also present an overview of the current status of tumor-targeted glucocorticoid delivery. It appears that long-circulating liposomes are the only targeting system currently being explored for this purpose.
