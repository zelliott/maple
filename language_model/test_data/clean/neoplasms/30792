The degree of psychosocial distress experienced by 15 cancer patients with newly diagnosed metastatic disease and their spouses was investigated. Of interest were mean changes over the six-month interval following diagnosis, and correlations between partners at 0, 3, and 6-7 months. The Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS) and the Family Environment Scale (FES) were used to quantify adjustment. Several PAIS subscales exhibited increasing distress over time for patients: Social Environment (p = 0.004), Vocational Environment (p = 0.028), and Psychological Distress (p = 0.029). FES Conflict increased over time (p &lt; 0.005), while Intellectual Cultural Orientation declined (p = 0.02), both for spouses only. Of 24 patient-spouse PAIS correlations (7 subscales plus a global scale, at three times), 7 (29%) were 0.70 or greater (ps &lt; 0.01). Of 30 FES correlations, 17 (57%) were 0.7 or higher (ps &lt; 0.01). These results suggest that some stresses increase over time, and that spouses and patients share a similar perceived level of distress. Health professionals must address the psychological distress of the spouse as well as the patient.
