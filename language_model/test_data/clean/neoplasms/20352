Modern imaging methods are very important in the management of patients with cancer and of their disease. It is vital that clinicians treating them understand the relevance of different imaging techniques for specific applications, so that the best choice can be made to aid diagnosis and monitor response to treatment. This review briefly covers the development and principles of the diverse imaging methods available, from the discovery of x-rays by RÃ¶ntgen in 1895 to the recent techniques of magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography. The authors endeavour to point out the strengths and weaknesses of each method, using clinical examples where appropriate. Finally, future developments are discussed. It is hoped that this review will aid clinicians diagnosing and treating cancer patients to choose the most suitable imaging method for their patients from among the vast array available.
