Experimental studies with hemic neoplasia in the bay mussel indicated that the condition can be transmitted allogeneically with intact whole cells and cell-free homogenate. A differential pathogenesis of the disease in mussels receiving the two different inocula supports the argument that actual cell transplantation occurred. In addition to the first demonstration of the infectious nature of the disease with cell-free homogenates, it was also shown that the disease is transmitted by cohabitation. Remission of the disease occurred in some mussels indicating individual variation in recognition mechanisms.
