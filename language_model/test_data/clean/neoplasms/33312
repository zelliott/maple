Cerebrovascular disorders, including brain infarction, brain hemorrhage, and cerebral venous thrombosis, can occur as an early sign of cancer, but typically occur late in the clinical course. These disorders are due to a variety of pathogenic mechanisms, including coagulation disorders associated with the cancer, invasion or compression of vessels from tumor in or adjacent to the brain, and the adverse effects of cancer therapy. The appropriate therapy for these cerebrovascular disorders is empiric in most instances, because as yet there are no prospective treatment trials for them. A review of the existing literature reveals that improvement in patient quality of life and prevention of further cerebrovascular events can be obtained in some clinical situations.
