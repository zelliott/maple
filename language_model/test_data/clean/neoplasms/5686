Over a four year period, hypothenar split-thickness skin grafts were used to resurface a variety of fingertip and other hand defects in 27 patients. All patients achieved uncomplicated primary wound healing with minimal donor site morbidity. At one year follow-up, there was no evidence of late wound breakdown or fissuring of the wounds treated with hypothenar skin grafts.
