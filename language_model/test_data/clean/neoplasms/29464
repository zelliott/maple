the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer adversely affects their prognosis. Several autopsy- and population-based studies have clearly shown a negative impact of VTE on patient outcome in cancer patients.

an up-to-date review of VTE prophylaxis and treatment in cancer patients is provided with some insights on areas of uncertainty to be answered in the near future. Particular attention is paid to recent cohort studies, randomized clinical trials and consensus guidelines.

cancer patients at a higher risk for VTE may be identified with five variables easily available before initiation of chemotherapy. Long-term treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) demonstrated a superior efficacy over vitamin K antagonists. The intensity and duration of anticoagulant therapy should be tailored to the risk of VTE recurrences or bleeding in an individual patient.
