Thromboembolism is the most common complication in patients with malignant diseases. The recent studies have indicated that the pathogenesis of thromboembolism in cancer is associated with the hemostatic alternations induced by cancer cells and cancer-stimulated mononuclear cells: injury to the endothelial lining of blood vessels, activation of blood coagulation and depression of anticoagulant function. Although thromboembolism is generally observed in patients with advanced cancer, it may occur in patients with occult cancer. In the treatment of thromboembolism, the administration of low molecular heparin has been introduced recently, in addition to the immediate and intensive treatment of cancer.
