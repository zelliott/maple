Upon coculture of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in the presence of irradiated autologous tumour cells, the PBL can be sensitized to the tumour (or perhaps more correctly resensitized), as shown by in vitro cytotoxic properties. The cells can be proliferated in the presence of interleukin-2, radiolabelled with 111In and injected back into the cell donor. Using this technique, tumour deposits were localized in five out of seven patients. Possible techniques for increasing the specificity of this form of adoptive immunocytotherapy are pointed out.
