The objectives of the All Ireland Fatigue Surveys are: A) to learn more about the nature of cancer patients' fatigue; B) to explore the impact that fatigue has on the lives of these patients; C) to determine physicians' and nurses' perceptions of fatigue in patients; and D) to find the current level of management of cancer fatigue in Ireland. In two surveys, one involving 109 physicians and another involving 160 nurses, the vast majority of respondents reported that they believe nausea to be the side effect of most concern to their cancer patients. In contrast, 41% of 143 patient respondents to a third survey reported that fatigue was the side effect that had the greatest impact on them. Patients indicated that fatigue affected them physically, mentally, emotionally, and economically. Yet, approximately half the patients who reported their fatigue to their physician or nurse received no treatment to relieve their fatigue. The number one recommendation made to patients who did receive treatment to help reduce their fatigue was rest/relaxation, even though research suggests that exercise can be of greater benefit. Thus, it appears that cancer patients' fatigue has been largely under-recognized and poorly managed or ignored. With the formation of interdisciplinary groups of health care professionals focused solely on cancer fatigue, efforts are under way on the island of Ireland to address this too long misunderstood and neglected aspect of cancer patients' lives.
