Cancer initiation and progression is causally connected to genome and epigenome deregulations. Epigenetic deregulations (such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA-based modulation) have been increasingly reported in tumorigenesis and different chromatin-modulating enzymes have been discovered and classified and their aberrations connected to cancer. A better insight into alterations occurring on chromatin enzymes and their impact in cancer thus represents a crucial step in exploiting epigenetic targeting in cancer prevention and treatment.
