This essay describes my thoughts on the role of CAM in cancer and was provoked by some ugly scenes when I was debating the subject at Kings College London. I conclude that when one analyzes what CAM truly has to offer compared with the best of conventional medicine, then CAM does more harm than good. However it is up to modern medical practitioners to raise their game in order to prevent practitioners of alternative medicine slipping into the gaps left unattended by our profession.
