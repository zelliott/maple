The difficulties encountered by investigators in conducting behavioral research with oncology patients have received little attention in the literature. This article provides a practical guide to problems that might be anticipated in the planning and conduct of behavioral research.

Problems include subject accrual and retention, development of a multidisciplinary research team, control of confounding variables, psychosocial instrumentation issues, and acceptance of the need for behavioral research. Methodological and feasibility issues are examined. Strategies for addressing the issues are presented.

Successful behavioral research in oncology requires firm grounding in clinical practice. Clinicians can improve the quality of research and thus, the scientific base for practice by joining or facilitating multidisciplinary research efforts.
