It has long been appreciated that aneuploidy - in which cells possess a karyotype that is not a multiple of the haploid complement - has a substantial impact on human health, but its effects at the subcellular level have only recently become a focus of investigation. Here, we summarize new findings characterizing the impact of aneuploidy on protein quality control. Because aneuploidy has been associated with many diseases, foremost among them being cancer, and has also been linked to aging, we also offer our perspective on whether and how the effects of aneuploidy on protein quality control could contribute to these conditions. We argue that acquiring a deeper understanding of the relationship between aneuploidy, disease and aging could lead to the development of new anti-cancer and anti-aging treatments.
