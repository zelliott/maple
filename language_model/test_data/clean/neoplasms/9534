This review provides an overview of a selection of the most pertinent molecular pathways that link cancer and aging and focuses on those where recent advances were most important. When organizing the bulk of information on this subject, I became aware of the fact that the most evident partition, namely, mechanisms that influence aging and mechanisms that influence cancer occurrence, is difficult to apply. Most mechanisms explaining the aging process are also those that influence carcinogenesis. Mechanisms that are described in tumor suppressor pathways are also contributors to the aging process. From an intuitive point of view, there are phenomena that have traditionally been contributed to aging others to cancer-inducing factors and they are presented herein.
