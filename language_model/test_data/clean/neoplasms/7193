Statistical analysis of life expectancy is important in assessing population health and its characteristics and in studying human diseases and natural population changes.  Life tables are constructed and statistical analysis is performed retrospectively on data accumulated over a 3-year (1973-1975) period.  The data were supplied by the Office of Cancer Prevention and Treatment of the Ministry of Health, which originated from 24 provinces, representing an accumulated population of 2.04 billion, with a total mortality of 15.29 million.  Results show that life expectancy in China has greatly improved since Liberation.  Thus, in 1935, the average life expectancy for Nanjing residents was under 35 years.  In 1951, the average life expectancy for male and female residents of Shanghai were 42.74 and 46.76 years respectively.  But for the 1973-1975 period, the average Chinese life expectancy was 63.62 years for males and 66.31 years for females, with higher life expectancy for coastal provinces than for inland provinces.  Cardiovascular diseases (excluding arteriosclerotic heart diseases), malignant tumors, and cerebrovascular diseases were the major causes of death in regions with higher life expectancy, while respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, and diseases of the newborn were the major causes of death in regions with lower life expectancy.
