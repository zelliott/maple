The past several years have seen demonstrable progress in the therapy of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Liposomal anthracyclines and paclitaxel have been found to be highly effective chemotherapeutic agents for this disease. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of KS have led to the consideration of various new experimental agents. Two antiangiogenesis agents, TNP-470 and thalidomide, have been determined to induce some responses in KS, and others are now in early clinical trials or in preclinical development. Oral 9-cis retinoic acid has been shown to have anti-KS activity, and preliminary studies suggest that a urinary protein found in preparations of human chorionic gonadotropin also has activity. Effective anti-HIV treatment has been shown to affect the growth of KS, and the discovery of a new herpesvirus as a causative agent for KS has offered new potential targets for attack.
