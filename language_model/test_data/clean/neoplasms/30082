Assisted reproductive technologies are increasingly being used to treat infertility. Male adolescents with cancer are particularly encouraged to bank semen to preserve fertility before beginning chemotherapy or radiotherapy. We evaluated the feasibility of semen preservation in 12 to 17-year-old patients with cancer.

We retrospectively collected data from the sperm banking database at our institution for the years 1995 to 2009. Outcomes measured were histological diagnosis, success rate, sperm concentration and sample volume.

A total of 180 patients with a mean age of 16.1 years (range 13.2 to 17.9) were referred for cryopreservation during the study period. Underlying diagnoses included lymphoma (64 patients), leukemia (50), bone tumors (18), testicular tumors (13), soft tissue sarcoma (13), brain tumor (6), germ cell tumors (6) and other cancers (10). Of the patients 119 (66%) successfully banked sperm. A total of 26 patients did not attend their appointment. Of those who attended 15 (10%) were unable to provide a sample and 20 (13%) had azoospermia. A total of 20 patients died after banking sperm and their specimens were subsequently destroyed.

Cryopreservation of semen of acceptable quality for future use in assisted conception is feasible for most adolescents from age 13 years onward.
