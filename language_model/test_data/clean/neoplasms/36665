The frequency and severity of neurologic symptoms in children with systemic cancer is unknown. The authors reviewed the records of children with systemic cancer for whom a neurologic consultation was requested between 1993 and 1996. The 157 patients had 161 malignancies and 205 consultations. Leukemia (59) and lymphoma (34) were the most common malignancies. The 68 solid tumors included neuroblastoma (13), Ewing's sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (10 each). In contrast to adults, in whom back pain and altered mental status are the most common reasons for neurologic consultation, headache (33) and seizures (29) were the most common symptoms in children. Structural lesions were present in 84% of patients with headache and focal deficit and in 14% of patients with isolated headache. Structural disease was identified in 37% of children with seizures. Neurologic signs were caused by complications of cancer therapy in 70 instances and to direct tumor invasion of the nervous system in 60. In 71 consultations, neurologic symptoms could not be attributed to cancer or its treatment. The spectrum of neurologic symptoms in children with cancer differs from adults and requires the consulting neurologist to have a thorough knowledge of childhood cancer and its effects on the nervous system.
