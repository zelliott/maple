This article presents a summary of the health status of the disadvantaged populations in the United States, with specific regard to the incidence, treatment, and mortality of cancer. It begins with an historical overview of health care for the poor in this country, and continues with an explanation of the risk factors prevalent, if not inherent, in the life-style associated with low socioeconomic status, such as poor diet, cigarette smoking, and ignorance of preventive health measures and screening techniques. It includes a discussion of the different types that are overrepresented in this population and of the barriers to preventive care and treatment that still exist. The most important of these is decreased access to continuous medical care because of a lack of health insurance and an overdependence on emergency room treatment for all health care. The final section reviews solutions that have been preferred by physicians, nurses, lawmakers, public health workers, and community advocates for the poor. The most important parts of the solution are patient education for preventive health care, disease warning signs, and screening techniques and an overhaul of the present system of providing health care to ensure equal access and treatment for all members of the society.
