Metastasis is one of the most harmful aspects of malignant neoplasm. Interaction of tumour cells with normal cells such as tissue macrophages may generate reactive oxygen species, which would affect various aspects of tumour metastasis. Reactive oxygen species cause damage to both tumour and normal cells and some of them, especially hydrogen peroxide, can also act as intracellular second messengers at sublethal concentrations to increase the transcription of various genes, which can then accelerate the proliferation of tumour cells in metastatic colonies. Therefore, eliminating hydrogen peroxide is one approach to inhibiting tumour metastasis. In this article, the roles of reactive oxygen species in tumour metastasis are reviewed, and the strategies to inhibit tumour metastasis by the targeted delivery of catalase, an enzyme that detoxifies hydrogen peroxide, are discussed.
