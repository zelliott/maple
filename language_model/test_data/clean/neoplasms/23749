Randomized 64 children ages 5 to 13 years with newly diagnosed cancer to either a Social Skills Training experimental treatment group or a School Reintegration standard treatment group. Children who received explicit training in social skills reported higher perceived classmate and teacher social support at the 9-month follow-up in comparison to pretreatment levels, while parents reported a decrease in internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and an increase in school competence. Methodological improvements for Phase III clinical trials are addressed.
