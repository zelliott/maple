Aneuploidy and chromosomal instability are major characteristics of human cancer. These abnormalities can result from defects in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which is a surveillance mechanism for accurate chromosome segregation through restraint of the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Here, we show that a CUE-domain-containing protein, CUEDC2, is a cell-cycle regulator that promotes spindle checkpoint inactivation and releases APC/C from checkpoint inhibition. CUEDC2 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 during mitosis. Depletion of CUEDC2 causes a checkpoint-dependent delay of the metaphase-anaphase transition. Phosphorylated CUEDC2 binds to Cdc20, an activator of APC/C, and promotes the release of Mad2 from APC/C-Cdc20 and subsequent APC/C activation. CUEDC2 overexpression causes earlier activation of APC/C, leading to chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy. Interestingly, CUEDC2 is highly expressed in many types of tumours. These results suggest that CUEDC2 is a key regulator of mitosis progression, and that CUEDC2 dysregulation might contribute to tumour development by causing chromosomal instability.
