In a prospective study of mortality in a large group of Scottish diabetic patients, ischaemic heart disease was responsible for 51% of deaths, with the diabetic relative risks of death being 3.8, 2.7 and 2.2 for the age groups 45-64, 65-74, and 75 years and over, respectively. The diabetic relative risks for mortality from all causes were 5.5, 2.3, 1.7, 1.3 for age ranges 15-44, 45-64, 65-74, and 75 and over, respectively. The all cancer mortality rate is not reduced in diabetic individuals.
