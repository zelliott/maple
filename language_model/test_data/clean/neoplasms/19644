Pediatric liver transplantation has evolved over the last two decades into an effective and widely accepted therapy for infants and children. Currently, these high-risk patients achieve 85 to 90% one-year patient survival and an excellent quality of life. This paper reviews the special features of the pediatric recipient, the surgical innovations developed to be able to offer them a transplant (reduced size, live donor, split, and auxiliary partial transplantation), the most significant issues in anesthetic, immunosuppressive and postoperative care in children, as well as a global picture of the results. Additionally, the experience of the Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez is presented, as the largest and most successful series of pediatric liver transplantation in the country, where the first successful live donor liver transplantation and the first simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation in a child were performed.
