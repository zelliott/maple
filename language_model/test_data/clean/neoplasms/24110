Great interest in predictive testing for hereditary cancer syndromes has been reported. Prior research has focused on testing for specific hereditary syndromes and/or among individuals at high risk for positive carrier status. Given anticipated expansion of both the range of hereditary syndromes for which testing will be available, as well as the clinical settings in which testing will occur, assessment of interest in hereditary cancer risk testing and notification in the general public is warranted.

As part of an annual statewide telephone survey, adults' (N = 654) interest in hereditary cancer risk testing and notification was assessed.

Interest in both risk testing (82%) and risk notification (87%) was high. Logistic regression analyses indicated that disinterest in risk notification was associated with female sex, performance of fewer health protective behaviors, and better perceptions of personal health. Disinterest in risk testing was associated with these same variables as well as older age, less concern over developing cancer, and a more extensive history of cancer in first degree relatives.

In the absence of risk-reducing behaviors with demonstrable efficacy, hereditary risk testing programs may have difficulty attracting the interest of those at greatest risk for carrier status. In contrast, many individuals at low risk for positive carrier status might seek testing, perhaps as a means of seeking reassurance regarding their low hereditary risk.
