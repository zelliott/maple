Response rates for candidemia treated with standard-dose fluconazole (400 mg/day) are approximately 70%. Higher doses of fluconazole have been recommended for susceptible dose-dependent Candida isolates. Herein, we describe the outcome of 20 patients with solid tumors and candidemia treated with high-dose fluconazole (HDF) at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (1998-2002).

Patients were identified either by searching the microbiology laboratory database or through direct referral from primary oncology services to the Infectious Diseases Consultative Services. A retrospective review of cases was performed. HDF was defined as &gt; or =600 mg/day.

Five patients were treated with 600 mg/day, whereas 15 patients received 800 mg/day. Only one patient was neutropenic. The median APACHE II score at the onset of candidemia was 12 (range 6-24). The most common species identified were Candida albicans (eight patients, 40%) and Candida parapsilosis (seven patients, 35%). Of 19 patients whose quantitative data were available, eight (42%) had high-grade candidemia [&gt; or =200 colony forming units (CFU)/ml]. Fifteen (83%) of 18 isolates were fluconazole susceptible, and two (both Candida glabrata) were fluconazole resistant (MIC 64 each) in vitro. Nineteen patients (95%) responded to HDF therapy. The only HDF failure occurred in a patient with C. glabrata (MIC 64.0) infection. The other patient with C. glabrata (MIC 64.0) infection responded to HDF. Central venous catheters were removed from all patients with &gt; or =10 CFU/ml candidemias. All patients with high-grade candidemias responded to HDF. The median duration of HDF therapy was 16 (range 6-42) days. No significant toxicity occurred.

Although our data are limited, HDF appears to be well tolerated and may be associated with higher response rates than standard-dose fluconazole in a selected group of patients with solid tumors and candidemia caused by species that are susceptible to this triazole.
