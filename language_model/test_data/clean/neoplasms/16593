Hsp70 family member mot-2/mthsp70/GRP75/PBP74 was shown to bind to the tumor suppressor protein p53. In this study, by in vivo coimmunoprecipitation of mot-2 with p53 and its deletion mutants, the mot-2 binding site of p53 was mapped to its C-terminal amino acid residues 312-352, a region of p53 that includes its cytoplasmic sequestration domain. These data demonstrate that cytoplasmic sequestration and inactivation of p53 by mot-2 occurs by its binding to the cytoplasmic sequestration domain. Therefore, perturbation of mot-p53 interactions can be employed to abrogate cytoplasmic retention of wild-type p53 in tumors.
