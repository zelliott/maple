Acrylamide (ACM) has recently been found in fried and baked foods, suggesting widespread public exposure. ACM is an industrial chemical that causes neurotoxicity in humans and an increase in benign tumors of the endocrine system of laboratory rats. The U.S. EPA and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have designated ACM as a probable human carcinogen based on the bioassay data and evidence for a DNA reactive mechanism. We report here an assessment of the published epidemiological data with regard to exposure to ACM. The results of an epidemiology mortality study of heavily exposed workers published in 1999 failed to reveal any increase in total cancer in this workforce. The average total exposure in the exposed group was equivalent to over 100% of the estimated average lifetime dietary intake, assuming a U.S. diet. However, this epidemiologic information had limited power to detect modest increases in specific tumors of the type reported in the rodent studies. Although the mortality study could not have picked up the small increases in cancer or in specific cancer types predicted by EPA's linear extrapolation model, research on biochemical and physiological mechanisms suggests that EPA's assessment overstates the potency, and therefore, the risk from foods and other sources of exposure may be lower than previously anticipated.
