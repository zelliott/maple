Childhood chronic diseases, especially cancer, are of growing concern. Research has focused on 2 developmental periods, prenatal and postnatal. While it is hypothesized that chemical contaminants in the physical environment may play a role in the development and exacerbation of many chronic diseases, the role of environmental exposures in the etiology of these conditions remains uncertain. This can be somewhat attributed to the fact that it is very difficult to efficiently link chronic health effects with environmental exposures that are likely to have occurred temporally and spatially distant from diagnosis. This study explored the utility of linking childhood cancer cases with their birth certificate data as a method for increasing the number of geo-referenced data points available for linking health effect data with environmental monitoring data. This would begin to quantify the transiency of 1 subset of the population, and provide a basis for characterizing and estimating potentials for exposure to numerous environmental contaminants during prenatal and postnatal periods. A total of 441 unduplicated cancer diagnosis records of children who were both born and diagnosed with cancer in Wisconsin between 1995 and 2002 were linked with birth records to explore the variability between address at birth and diagnosis. The majority of records were matched to a birth record file (81.0%). Of these matched records, 86% moved &lt;1 mile from birth to time of diagnosis. The results suggest that administrative and public health surveillance data can be used to quantify transiency. Data from the sample tested indicate that during the given time period children do not move far from their birth homes, suggesting minimal changes in exposure potential related to residence location from birth to diagnosis. This background is useful for future epidemiological investigations linking environmental factors with chronic health effects.
