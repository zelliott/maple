The purpose of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of pemetrexed with folate and vitamin B12 supplementation (FA/VB(12)) in Japanese patients with solid tumours and to investigate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. Eligible patients had incurable solid tumours by standard treatments, a performance status 0-2, and adequate organ function. Pemetrexed from 300 to 1,200 mg m(-2) was administered as a 10-min infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle with FA/VB(12). Totally, 31 patients were treated. Dose-limiting toxicities were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation at 700 mg m(-2), and infection and skin rash at 1,200 mg m(-2). The MTD/RD were determined to be 1,200/1,000 mg m(-2), respectively. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (grade (G) 3:29, G4:3%), leucopenia (G3:13, G4:3%), lympopenia (G3:13%) and ALT elevation (G3:13%). Pemetrexed pharmacokinetics in Japanese were not overtly different from those in western patients. Partial response was achieved for 5/23 evaluable patients (four with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and one with thymoma). The MTD/RD of pemetrexed were determined to be 1,200/1,000 mg m(-2), respectively, that is, a higher RD than without FA/VB(12) (500 mg m(-2)). Pemetrexed with FA/VB(12) showed a tolerable toxicity profile and potent antitumour activity against NSCLC in this study.
