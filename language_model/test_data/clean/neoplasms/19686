Although there are several studies on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in childhood cancer survivors (CCS), the association between MetS components and serum adipocytokine level has not been elucidated.

The charts of 49 patients (27 male, 22 female) who had attended the CCS clinic of the Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University Hospital, between April 2009 and March 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Median age was 10.7 years, and the median interval since the completion of chemotherapy was 5.1 years. The diagnosis of MetS was made based on the Japanese criteria for either children or adults.

Three (6.1%) of 49 patients fulfilled the criteria for MetS, and 28 (57.1%) had at least one component of MetS. High leptin level was seen in 18 patients (36.7%), and low total adiponectin level was seen in 20 (40.8%). The number of patients with high leptin was correlated with body mass index z-score (&gt;2.0), abdominal circumference/height (â‰¥0.5), diastolic blood pressure and fasting blood sugar. The number of patients with low total adiponectin was correlated with systolic blood pressure and triglyceride. When the patients were divided into three groups based on the number of positive MetS components (0, 1 and 2-4), leptin and adiponectin tended to be higher and lower in the third group, respectively.

Adipocytokines may play a role in the pathogenesis of MetS occurring in CCS. It is recommended that adipocytokines be evaluated together with MetS components at the CCS follow-up clinics.
