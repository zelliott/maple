The first joint meeting of the International Society for Cellular Oncology (ISCO) and the European Workshop on Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics of Solid Tumors (EWCMST), organized by Bauke Ylstra, Juan Cigudosa and Nick Gilbert, was held from 4 to 8 March, 2012 in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. This meeting provided a novel and unique opportunity to jointly present the latest updates on the genetics of cancer and its implications for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy, now and in the future. Various aspects were highlighted, including the identification of effective therapeutic targets, the role of cellular senescence in tumor development and therapy, chromosome translocations in leukemias and solid tumors, mechanisms underlying fragile sites and chromosome instability, tumor-associated 'omics' landscapes, genetic and epidemiologic risk factors, the role of tissue and cancer stem cells, angiogenesis and the tumor micro-environment, and the epigenetics of cancer. In this report, new insights and clinical advancements related to these various topics are provided, based on information presented at the meeting.
