FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51, also called FKBP5) belongs to a family of immunophilins, FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs). FKBP family members are targets for drugs such as rapamycin. Although FKBP51 shares characteristics with other FKBPs, it also has unique features, especially the role in its regulation of important signaling pathways such as the AKT kinase/protein kinase B pathway. In this review, we will focus on the function of FKBP51 as a scaffolding protein in the regulation of AKT activation and, in turn, its role in tumorigenesis and response to chemotherapy.
