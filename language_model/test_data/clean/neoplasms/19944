In the course of searching potential antitumor agents from a library of chalcones synthesized under microwave irradiations, the brine shrimp lethality (BSL) assay and a 3D structure-activity relationship (3DQSAR) studies were followed by the antitumor evaluation of most potent analogues.

The objective of the current study was to effectively use the BSL assay for the identification of potential cytotoxic analogues from a set of compounds.

We applied the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and devised 3DQSAR on 33 synthesized chalcones leading to prediction of five related compounds with improved activity. The scope of BSL assay for the prediction of antitumor potency was tested through the in vitro antitumor studies against six human tumor cell-lines, docking studies and the tubulin-polymerization assay.

The newly designed compounds 34-38 displayed very promising cytotoxic potency. From our results, the BSL toxicity, antitumor efficacy and docking outcomes could be easily co-related.

The study draws a very good relationship between a simple, inexpensive, and bench-top BSL assay and the antitumor potential of the cytotoxic compounds. Devising the CoMFA analysis helped in designing chalcones with improved cytotoxic potential as displayed through their BSL and cytotoxic activity against human tumor cell lines. The studies are noteworthy as such comprehensive studies were never performed before on the BSL assay. The present studies widen the scope of the BSL model that may prove quite helpful as a preliminary screen in the antitumor drug designing and synthesis expeditions.
