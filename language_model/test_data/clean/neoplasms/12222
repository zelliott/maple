Family physicians take pride in addressing the totality of a patient's experience of disease and are skilled in a multidisciplinary approach to care. As such, they have an important role to play in managing adult cancer pain. Although 75% to 90% of cancer patients could receive adequate pain relief from routine pharmacologic therapies delivered by family physicians, pain continues to be undertreated in this population. Pain is a global experience affecting the whole person. Our role as patient advocates and educators makes us well suited to participate in the current national attempt to redress the lack of attention to this important component of suffering. This article reviews commonly seen cancer pain syndromes, with specific recommendations concerning assessment, reassessment, management, and indications for consultation.
