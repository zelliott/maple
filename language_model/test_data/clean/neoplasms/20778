Immunotherapy of cancer is entering into a new phase of active investigation both at the pre-clinical and clinical level. This is due to the exciting developments in basic immunology and tumour biology that have allowed a tremendous increase in our understanding of mechanisms of interactions between the immune system and tumour cells. This review briefly summarizes the state of the art in basic tumour immunology before discussing the clinical applications of the new concepts in the clinical setting. Clinical approaches are diverse but can now be based on strong scientific rationales. The analysis of the available clinical results suggests that, despite some disappointments, there is room for optimism that both active immunotherapy (vaccination) and adoptive immunotherapy may soon become part of the therapeutic arsenal to combat cancer in a more efficient way.
