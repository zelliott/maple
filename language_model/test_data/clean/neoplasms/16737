Rates for pediatric cancer in the Greater New Orleans area were compared with rates from the National Cancer Institute's SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) Program. The same patterns observed nationally were seen in New Orleans over a 10-year period. Rates were comparable with the exception of cancers of the brain and central nervous system for which New Orleans children displayed higher rates. Using the large number of cases in the SEER Program, three etiological patterns of childhood cancer were apparent based on the age at diagnosis.
