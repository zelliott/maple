Recognition of the alterations of host defense allows a rational approach to preventing associated infections. One of the most effective strategies for preventing infection in the granulocytopenic patient is the combined use of oral non-absorbable antibiotics, laminar air-flow room reverse isolation with strict housekeeping techniques, low microbial diet, sterile water, and topical antiseptics and antibiotics. The prohibitive cost, however, warrants that this system be restricted to research settings. The suppression of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and fungi and the preservation of colonization resistance with such combinations as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and nystatin show promise in preventing infection in the granulocytopenic patient. Prevention of infection in neutropenic patients also requires attention to simpler but very effective measures such as immunizations, antimicrobial prophylaxis against intracellular and nonbacterial pathogens in high-risk patients, limiting invasive diagnostic and monitoring procedures, hand-washing by all personnel between visiting patients, oral hygiene, low microbial diets, axillary and perianal swabbing, and care with venipunctures and marrow aspirates. Finally, while the recommendations for prevention of infection are likely to continue to change with resulting improvement in patient care [92, 93], a tabulation summarizing current practices can be established based on our current knowledge (Table 1).
