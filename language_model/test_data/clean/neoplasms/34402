Peripheral blood lymphocytes from a total of 300 subjects including normal controls and patients with malignant and non-malignant disorders were investigated to determine their ability to agglutinate with Poly-l-lysine 3400 (PAL-test). A high level of association between clinically evident cancer and a positive reaction was confirmed. Lymphocytes from 72 of 90 patients with malignant diseases as well as 33 of 140 patients with non-malignant processes showed positive reactions. All healthy controls were negative. The positive evidence of the PAL-test amounted to over 80%. The results and possible mechanisms of the PAL-test are discussed.
