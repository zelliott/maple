In a primary health care district in southern Sweden, a programme was launched to treat terminally ill cancer patients in their own homes, on the lines of the hospice mode. The quality of life of these patients has been found to be improved, and the cost to the community to be less than that of institutionalised hospital care. Other patient categories that might benefit from this form a care are those with AIDS, severe neurological diseases, or chronic cardiac or respiratory insufficiency.
