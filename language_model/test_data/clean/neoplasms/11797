A murine macrophage-like cell line P388D1 (PD1) and its subline PD2 were studied for mediator production and also for tumorigenic properties. When PD1 cells were cultured in a medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, the culture supernatants exhibited potent interleukin 1 (IL1) activity (also termed lymphocyte-activating factor). IL1 activity produced in unstimulated cultures was predominantly of a low-molecular-weight species (mol wt, 13,000-16,000), but in PD1 cultures stimulated with 10-20 microgram lipopolysaccharide/ml a major IL1 activity was associated with a substance(s) of 65,000-75,000 in molecular weight. The PD1 cell line was nontumorigenic in normal female, syngeneic, inbred DBA/2J mice but produced progressively growing tumors in animals that had been immunosuppressed by 450-rad whole-body X-irradiation and treatment with antithymocyte serum. Inoculation with PD1 failed to produce tumors in athymic nude mice, and the spleens of nude mice that rejected PD1 grafts contained significant levels of a theta-positive cell population(s). PD2, a nonadherent and nonphagocytic subline of PD1, produced very little IL1 but instead produced a potent lymphocyte-inhibiting factor in vitro. The PD2 cell line was highly tumorigenic in syngeneic DBA/2J hosts. These results indicated a direct association between tumorigenicity and the type of mediators produced by these murine macrophage cell lines.
