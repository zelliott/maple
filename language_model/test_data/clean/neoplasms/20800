The electrochemical treatment (EChT) of tumours implies that tumour tissue is treated with a continuous direct current through two or more electrodes placed in or near the tumour. The treatment offers considerable promise of a safe, simple and relatively noninvasive anti-tumour therapy for treatment of localised malignant as well as benign tumours. Although more than 10,000 patients have been treated in China during the past 10 years, EChT has not yet been universally accepted. The reason for this is the lack of essential preclinical studies and controlled clinical trials. Uncertainties regarding the destruction mechanism of EChT also hinder the development of an optimised and reliable dose-planning methodology. This article reviews the collected Chinese and occidental experiences of the electrochemical treatment of tumours, alone and in combination with other therapies. The current knowledge of the destruction mechanism underlying EChT is presented along with different approaches towards a dose planning methodology. In addition, we discuss our view of different important parameters that have to be accounted for, if clinical trials are to be initiated outside of China.
