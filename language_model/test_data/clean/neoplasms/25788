The Pediatric Cancer Quality of Life Inventory-32 (PCQL-32) has been developed to be a standardized assessment instrument to assess systematically pediatric cancer patient's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes. Multidimensional serial measurement of pediatric cancer patients' HRQOL in Phase III randomized controlled clinical trials is increasingly being recognized as an essential component in evaluating the comprehensive health outcomes of modern antineoplastic treatment protocols. The 32-item PCQL-32 short form was empirically derived from the PCQL long form (84-87 items), which was administered to 291 pediatric cancer patients and their parents during various stages of treatment. The feasibility (percentage of missing values per item) and range of measurement [percentage of minimum (floor effect) and maximum (ceiling effect) possible scores] was calculated for the five PCQL-32 scales and the total scale score. Feasibility for the PCQL-32 was very good, with less than .01% missing values. Range of measurement was full, with no ceiling effects (higher symptoms/problems) and low to moderate floor effects (lower symptoms/problems). The PCQL-32 demonstrated very good feasibility and range of measurement. In its short form, the PCQL-32 is practical for Phase III clinical trials. Future studies will test the utility of the PCQL-32 as a brief serial measure for monitoring the HRQOL outcomes for children and adolescents with cancer.
