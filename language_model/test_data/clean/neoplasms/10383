Four novel quinonoid compounds are evaluated for their apoptotic potential against three cancer cell lines, i.e. MCF-7, HeLa and MG-63. APOPercentage assay was used for the screening of the compounds and it was established that the apoptotic potential of these compounds is cell line specific. The compound 2-(1',4'-benzoquinon-2'-yl)-5-hydroxy-7-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (S4) was found to be most active, which has a potential to kill approximately 99% of HeLa cancer cells in vitro after 72h at a concentration of 10microM. The compound's ability to induce specific markers of apoptosis in HeLa cells is further confirmed by DNA fragmentation and cell cycle assays.
