In multiracial and multicultural Singapore, patients are exposed to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) from both eastern and western cultures. Although studies have shown that CAM usage is highly prevalent among cancer patients, no study on the prevalence of CAM in Singaporean adult cancer patients had been published.

403 adult cancer patients treated at the Ambulatory Treatment Unit of National Cancer Centre Singapore completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire.

Median age of patients was 56 years old (range 22-84). Fifty-six percent of patients reported CAM usage and the most commonly used CAM include Traditional Chinese Medicine, bird's nest and special diet. CAM use was found to be associated with race, education level and prior CAM use before cancer diagnosis. Fifty-four percent of respondents informed their oncologists regarding CAM usage and 66.4% of oncologists were agreeable for CAM usage. However, most patients (63%) did not verify information on CAM before usage and a majority of patients taking CAM felt it was effective.

Majority of adult cancer patients used CAM and it is important for health-care professionals to keep abreast of research on CAM, to actively illicit information regarding usage and to provide appropriate advice and counseling.
