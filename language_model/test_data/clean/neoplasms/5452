Many studies show that chronic fatigue is the most frequently reported symptom related to cancer and its treatment. In order to evaluate the problem in Sweden, a questionnaire was mailed to 442 registered nurses in the autumn of 1995 with the aim of determining cancer nurses' views of the nature and causes of cancer-related fatigue and which, if any, nursing interventions they employed in the management of this problem. The response rate was 49%. The responses showed that these nurses regarded fatigue as the most common symptom in cancer patients, but there were few established nursing interventions. Also, nurses wanted further education and tools for evaluation of fatigue, its causes and treatment.
