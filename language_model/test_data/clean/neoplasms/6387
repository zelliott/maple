Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is an important complication in cancer patients taking intravenous BPs (BPs). In most cases, BRONJ is associated with an oral surgery procedure involving jaw bone. Currently, BRONJ management remains controversial, and there is no definitive standard of care for this disease. In fact, several articles in the recent literature discuss treatments that range from topical to surgical treatment, without definitive conclusion about treatment. A clinical study was conducted on 32 patients treated with i.v BPs for oncologic pathologies affected by BRONJ. The patients were treated by resection of the necrotic bone with primary closure of the mucosa over the bony defect using plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF). Orthopanoramic and computed tomography were performed before and after surgery. No intraoperative complications were observed, and all 32 cases were treated successfully. Our data on the use of PRGF demonstrate positive results for this surgical treatment. PRGF may enhance vascularization and regeneration of osseous and epithelial tissues.
