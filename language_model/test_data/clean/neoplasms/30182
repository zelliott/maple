On the centennial of the birth of Luigi Di Bella, the desire to memorialise, at least in part, his thoughts has prompted us to write this tribute, in the hope that one day his dreams may come true. Throughout his research for a treatment of cancer, he deemed it necessary to employ a complex array of substances that, by acting centripetally on neoplastic cells, could in turn be capable of affecting, either simultaneously or sequentially, the myriad of biological reactions supporting their lives. Hence, not a substance but a method (Di Bella Method, DBM). These brief hints at some aspects of Prof. Di Bella's multifaceted scientific vision are aimed not only at reasserting the truth, but also at giving a modest contribution to a novel and free direction in experimental and clinical science.
