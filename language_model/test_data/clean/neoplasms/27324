Access to information on cancer prevention and treatment is often difficult for ethnic or low socio-economic groups. This study aimed to ascertain level of knowledge about cancer, and breast cancer in particular, in Spanish women from low socio-economic groups participating in literacy schemes. A study specific questionnaire was administered to 541 women All participants were married with a median of 2 children, and a total family income of less than 10,000 euros per year. The main themes covered: understanding of and access to screening, knowledge about cancer risk, diagnosis and prognosis. The majority of these women (66%) feel they have no control over getting cancer and 26% report that it can be caught from others. Most believe that a mammogram is the best method of diagnosis (87%) but a minority (14%) agree with the statement that breast cancer can be caused by breast feeding. In general, younger women are better informed and more optimistic about prognosis. In Spain there are problems in disseminating information about cancer to lower social-economic groups. These results confirm that more cancer education needs to be directed to low income and socially deprived groups.
