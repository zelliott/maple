O-glycosylation is the post-translational process whereby carbohydrate is added to hydroxylated amino acids of proteins. The major O-glycosylation pathway in animal cells is involved in the synthesis of oligosaccharides linked by N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine residues in 'mucin-type' proteins or their analogs. In this review, we discuss the evidence for the cellular localization of the biosynthetic steps in this pathway and propose a simplified, consensus version. We also propose variations of the simple pathway to account for its heterogeneity and variability in different cell types and differentiation states.
