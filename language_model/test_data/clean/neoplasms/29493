A plasmid encoding the Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) protein of Newcastle Disease Virus (pHN) was tested for its capacity to stimulate innate anti-tumor activity in tumor-bearing mice. We observed that application of the pHN plasmid at the ear pinna site (i.e.) of mice induces higher levels of systemic interferon-Î± and reduced tumor growth in the prophylactic mammary carcinoma DA3 tumor model in comparison to application of a control plasmid not encoding the HN protein. Analysis of the tumor microenvironment revealed a significant increase in NK cell infiltration and decrease in infiltration of CD11b(+)Gr-1(high) myeloid cells bearing the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) phenotype after vaccination with the pHN DNA compared to a control DNA. Finally, innate immunity and partially type I IFN responses were proved important for the reduction of s.c. RMA-S tumor growth after pHN vaccination, as shown with the use of RAG2(-/-) and RAG2(-/-)IFNAR1(-/-) mice. These data demonstrate that triggering innate immunity by pHN application at the ear pinna of mice modulates the immune cell compartment in the tumor microenvironment and reduces tumor growth. This highlights thus the potential adjuvant activity of the HN gene in tumor therapy.
