Stable Isotopes are nontoxic, naturally occurring elemental surrogates that are fully compatible with live organisms, including humans in a clinical setting. The ability to enrich common compounds with rare isotopes such as carbon ((13)C) and nitrogen ((15)N) is the only practical means by which metabolic pathways can be traced, performed by following the fate of individual atoms from the source molecules to products via metabolic transformation. Changes in regulation of pathways are therefore captured by this approach, which leads to deeper understanding of fundamental biochemistry of cancer compared with non-cancerous cells, which can lead to new diagnostic tools.
