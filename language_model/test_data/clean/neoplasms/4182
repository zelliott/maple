Tissue platinum (Pt) levels were measured in tumor-bearing patients treated with either cisplatin or carboplatin. Cisplatin was given by intra-arterial, intraperitoneal, and intravenous (iv) administrations. After death, vertebrae and intervertebral disks were removed from eight human subjects, and livers and kidneys were removed from the half of them. When cisplatin was administered intraperitoneally, Pt of the liver was higher than that of the kidney, and a high content of Pt was detected in the vertebra by comparing with the other administration methods. At the intra-arterial administration of cisplatin, Pt was mainly accumulated in the kidney. At the iv administration of cisplatin, a high level of Pt was found in the vertebra and intervertebral disk, especially at the highest value at 10.31 micrograms/g in the intervertebral disk of one case, whereas a low level of Pt was detected in the liver. On the contrary, it was found that the iv administration of carboplatin did not result in high accumulations of Pt in the liver, kidney, intervertebral disk, and vertebra. Therefore, Pt is accumulated in different organs, depending on the way cisplatin is administered, but Pt is accumulated least in them by the administration of carboplatin.
