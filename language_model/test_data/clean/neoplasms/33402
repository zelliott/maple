The perception of chemoprevention lies still in its infancy. Intervention, to slow down, arrest or reverse the process of carcinogenesis, by the use of either natural or synthetic substances individually or in combination therapy has emerged as a promising and pragmatic medical approach to reduce cancer risk. Pentacyclic lupane-type triterpenes exemplified by lupeol [lup-20(29)-en-3b-ol], are principally found in common fruit plants such as olive, mango, fig, etc. Although, lupeol exhibits an array of biological activities like anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic, anti-mutagenic and anti-malarial activity both in in vitro and in vivo systems yet, extensive exploration in regard to establish its role as chemopreventive compound is warranted. Interest in developing lupeol based potent anti-neoplastic agents, has led to the discovery of a host of highly active derivatives exhibiting greater potencies and better therapeutic indices. This review asserts on the chemopreventive prospects of lupeol and reveals potential chemoprevention drug targets, central to which are the cell cycle regulatory pathway genes and tries to explain the mechanism operating behind its action.
