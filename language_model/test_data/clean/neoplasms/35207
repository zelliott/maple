The role of opportunistic fungi (OF) in modern human pathology is discussed in connection with the increased incidence of mycotic infections caused by these organisms. Due to a complex of biological properties, OF are able to survive both in the environment and in human body, exhibiting their pathogenic potential when the body defenses are compromised. The highest frequency of infections caused by OF is encountered in the presence of risk factors (immunodeficiencies, endocrinopathies, oncological and hematological diseases, organ transplantation, antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy, infancy and pregnancy). The spectrum of lesions caused by OF encompasses practically all organs and systems. Being a secondary process, mycotic infection may either have no influence on the primary process, or aggravate it. In most severe cases it may overbalance the importance of the underlying disease. Cytohistological methods play a special role in the diagnosis of mycotic infections, as they are able to reveal the invasive process, evaluate its extent and the characteristics of host defense responses.
