The life expectancy of women currently exceeds that of men by almost seven years, yet women spend approximately twice as many years disabled prior to death as their male counterparts. The diseases that account for death and health care utilization in older women (heart disease, cancer, stroke, fracture, pneumonia, osteoarthritis, cataracts) are also major contributors to disability. This paper reviews the scientific evidence that supports specific recommendations for older women that may prevent or delay these conditions for as long as possible. Risk factors for falls and fractures should be assessed and, where possible, modified. Adequate intakes of calcium, vitamin D, fruits, and vegetables should be encouraged. Weight should be monitored and weight loss discouraged for most women. Screening for B12 deficiency is recommended. Engaging women in a shared decision-making process about the use of hormone replacement therapy for longterm prevention of heart disease and fractures is important, as is regular screening for breast and colo-rectal cancer. Women should be encouraged to engage in enjoyable physical activities, including walking, for 30 minutes daily. These interventions have the potential to delay the onset and improve the course of many chronic conditions that prevail in later life.
