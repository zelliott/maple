Children with cancer and nonmalignant hematological disorders may require speech pathology (SP) support; however, limited evidence is available describing prevalence and severity of swallowing/feeding and communication impairments in this population. A retrospective chart review of 70 children referred to SP at the newly formed Queensland Children's Cancer Centre was conducted to describe the prevalence and severity of swallowing/feeding and communication dysfunction, and the association between impairment, oncology and hematology diagnosis, and service utilization (time and occasions of service). Swallowing/feeding disorders were the most commonly observed impairments at initial assessment (58.6%). Children with central nervous system tumors (P = .03) and nonmalignant hematological disorder (P = .03) had significantly higher rates of feeding impairment than other oncology and hematology diagnostic groups. Children with central nervous system tumors had the highest rates of oral phase (P = .01) and pharyngeal phase (P = .01) dysphagia (swallowing disorder). No significant difference was found between diagnostic groups for intensity of SP service delivery. Prospective research is required to examine prevalence and severity of disorders, and service utilization in a more established clinic, and to investigate interactions between cancer treatment and swallowing/feeding and communication dysfunction.
