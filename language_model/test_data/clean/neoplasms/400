The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not attitudes of medical students toward the cancer patient are as negative as their attitudes toward the chronically ill patient. A questionnaire designed to measure student attitudes toward cancer was administered to 122 medical students. Two versions of the questionnaire were developed. One version referred specifically to attitudes toward cancer patients while the second version assessed attitudes toward patients in general. Significant differences were found between student attitudes toward cancer patients and patients in general. Support was found for the existence of negative attitudes in the treatment of cancer patients. Implications of these findings and teaching modifications are discussed.
