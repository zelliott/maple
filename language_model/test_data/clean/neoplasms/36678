The potential association between implants and malignancy has been discussed in the literature, but never as a cause of loosening of joint arthroplasty.

The records of all patients who underwent revision arthroplasty at our institution between 1992 and 1995 were reviewed.

Among 93 patients who underwent revision hip arthroplasties, 11 (11.8%) had a history of previous malignancy. At surgery, in 2 of these patients, metastasis was found to be the cause of loosening in the affected hip.

When revision hip arthroplasty is considered, patients with a history of malignancy require attenuated pre-, intra-, and postoperative workup. Management algorithm in such cases is proposed.
