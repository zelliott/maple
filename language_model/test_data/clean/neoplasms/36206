To prospectively evaluate quality of life (QoL) evolution after a classic pulmonary metastasectomy or after an isolated lung perfusion (ILuP) metastasectomy.

QoL was prospectively recorded in 35 consecutive patients (27 classic metastasectomy; 8 ILuP) The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer C30 and lung cancer -13 QoL Questionnaires were administered before surgery and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively (MPO).

After a classic metastasectomy, a temporary increase in dyspnea (1 MPO p = 0.03 3 MPO p = 0.01), coughing (3 MPO p = 0.01), fatigue (1 MPO p = 0.01, 3 MPO p = 0.02), thoracic pain (1 MPO, p = 0.02), shoulder dysfunction (1 MPO p = 0.03, 3 MPO p = 0.02) as well as an impaired physical (1 MPO p = 0.01, 3 MPO p = 0.04) and role functioning (1 MPO p = 0.01, 3 MPO p = 0.01) was reported the first 3 months after surgery. Six months after surgery, all domains returned to baseline. After ILuP metastasectomy, all QoL functioning and symptom scores, except for coughing complaints (1 MPO p = 0.03, 3 MPO p = 0.04) and shoulder dysfunction (1 MPO p = 0.04, 6 MPO p = 0.04), returned to baseline at 1 month after surgery. No significant differences were seen when QoL evolution was compared between classic and ILuP metastasectomy with the exception of a higher burden of thoracic pain (6 MPO p = 0.04, 12 MPO p = 0.01), shoulder dysfunction (6 MPO p = 0.04, 12 MPO p = 0.02), and dysphagia (6 MPO p = 0.04, 12 MPO p = 0.02) 6 and12 months after ILuP.

All QoL domains returned to baseline at 6 months after a classic metastasectomy. After ILuP, only increases in coughing and shoulder dysfunction were reported. In comparison classic metastasectomy patients, ILuP patients report more thoracic pain, shoulder dysfunction, and dysphagia.
