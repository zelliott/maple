A proportionate mortality study of deceased white male workers in the pattern and model making trades was conducted. Death certificates were obtained for 1257 death benefit-eligible members of the Pattern Makers' League of North America who had died in the years 1972-1978, and age-adjusted proportionate mortality was calculated using 1975 United States white male death rates. For the entire nationwide union, statistically significant excess proportions of deaths were observed due to colon cancer (proportionate mortality ratio, PMR = 167) and to brain tumors (PMR = 211). A statistically significant excess proportion of deaths due to colon cancer (PMR = 163) and to leukemia (PMR = 200) were observed among the members of the predominantly wood shop locals. Nonsignificant excess proportions of cancer deaths occurred at a number of other anatomical sites. Predominant occupational exposures included wood and plastic dusts and epoxy resins in wood shops and cutting oil mists and solvent vapors in the metal shops. These results suggest the need for better work practices in this industry while more definitive studies are completed.
