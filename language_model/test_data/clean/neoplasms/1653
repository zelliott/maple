With the vast technological and informational resources increasingly available from investments in "genomics," toxicology and much of biological science, is faced with previously undreamed of opportunities and equally daunting challenges. The ability to generate the large quantities of data becoming routinely available could not be imagined a decade ago. The complexities of data analysis are increasingly the rate-limiting element in scientific advances. The expectations that these large scientific investments will reduce the incidence of human disease and improve health are very high. An emphasis on genetic variation and Toxicogenetics is expected to yield risk estimates for specific rather than average individuals and individuals with varied lifestyles and complex patterns of exposure. Examples from studies of polymorphic variation in DNA repair genes in the healthy population and cancer risk highlight the complexity and challenges of incorporating genetic variation into quantitative estimates of risk associated with environmentally relevant exposures. Similar issues exist in selecting the animal models most appropriate for predicting human risk from environmental exposures to toxic agents.
