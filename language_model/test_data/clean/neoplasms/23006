Cryosurgery (in situ freezing) had been efficaciously employed for the treatment of malignant neoplasms. In situ freezing of a number of tissue has been demonstrated to constitute an antigenic stimulus (comparable to that obtained through the parenteral administration of antigen) capable of generating a specific immunologic response against autologous antigens of the frozen tissue, ergo, cryostimulation, However, if cryosurgery is to be employed not only for ablation of tumor, but also as a possible means of engendering an immunologic response to tumor (primary, as well as secondary, i.e., metastases), ergo, cryoimmunotherapy, several factors must be given careful consideration. It is with the further elucidation of these factors and the continuing endeavor to establish criteria for evaluating the candidacy of the cancer patient for cryoimmunotherapy and their postoperative responsiveness that have been reviewed, assessed and updated.
