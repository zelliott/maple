Autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a therapeutic option for the treatment of lymphohematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors. Despite the intensive cytoreductive therapy, however, the rates of tumor recurrence after autologous BMT remain unacceptably high. Current studies suggest that the administration of cyclosporine (CsA) disrupts the reconstitution of self-tolerance following autologous BMT leading to the induction of an autoimmune graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Studies in a rat tumor model and preliminary clinical trials suggest that this autoimmune or autologous GVHD provides a significant antitumor effect. Moreover, the antitumor effect of autologous GVHD can be enhanced by administration of gamma-interferon, which upregulates the antigen recognized by the autoreactive effector cells of autologous GVHD. These studies indicate that the induction of an autoimmune GVHD after autologous BMT may be a promising immunotherapeutic approach for treatment of certain neoplastic diseases.
