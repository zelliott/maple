Thin needle biopsy of a suspected tumor will usually yield material amenable to cytologic examination and sufficient for diagnosis. Sixty children with suspected solid malignant tumors were subjected to this procedure. The masses biopsied were in bone, abdomen, mediastinum, tongue, pharynx, soft tissue, and peripheral lymph nodes. The diagnostic yield was 66% on first biopsy and rose to 93% on repeated biopsies. The diagnostic accuracy was 97% in malignant tumors with histologic confirmation. There were no proved false-negative diagnoses, and two (3%) false-positive (for malignancy) diagnoses. All patients were followed up. There were no complications of note.
