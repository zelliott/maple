The initial promise of monoclonal antibodies as major therapeutic agents in human epithelial cancer has not been realized. Inaccessibility of cells in solid tumors due to factors such as the nature of the vascular endothelia and high pressure in the tumor are primarily responsible for the failure of antibody therapy. Although new strategies employing recombinant antibodies and immunoglobulins designed to actively engage the immune system may prove beneficial, micrometastatic tumor cells (at the stage of minimal residual disease) are likely to be the only suitable targets for antibody therapy. The diagnostic approaches to identify and characterize these cells and their use for prognosis and monitoring adjuvant immunotherapy is discussed.
