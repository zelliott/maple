A quantitative electrophoretic method was developed for evaluating sera from dogs with naturally occurring malignant tumors. Electrophoretic migration ratios (EMR) were devised to standardize characteristic protein components and to analyze alterations in mobility of these protein components, using a computerized densitometric technique. Sera values from dogs with lymphosarcomas, osteosarcomas, and mammary tumors were compared, using conventional methods of statistical analysis. Results indicate a statistical difference existed between mean values of EMR and alpha2-globulins of sera from dogs with tumors and those values from normal dogs. In addition, unique EMR and concentration of protein components were identified for dogs with lymphosarcomas, osteosarcomas, and mammary tumors.
