During metastasis, cancer cells breach the basement membrane and migrate through the stroma mostly composed of a network of collagen I fibers. Cell migration on 2D is initiated by protrusion of the cell membrane followed by formation of adhesions that link the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Cells then move forwards by exerting traction forces on the adhesions at its front and by disassembling adhesions at the rear. In 2D, only the ventral surface of a migrating cell is in contact with the ECM, where cell-matrix adhesions are assembled. In 3D matrices, even though the whole surface of a migrating cell is available for interacting with the ECM, it is unclear whether discrete adhesion structures actually exist. Using high-resolution confocal microscopy we imaged the endogenous adhesome proteins in three different cancer cell types embedded in non-pepsinized collagen type I, polymerized at a slow rate, to allow the formation of a network that resembles the organization of EMC observed in vivo. Vinculin aggregates were detected in the cellular protrusions, frequently colocalizing with collagen fibers, implying they correspond to adhesion structures in 3D. As the distance from the substrate bottom increases, adhesion aggregates become smaller and almost undetectable in some cell lines. Using intravital imaging we show here, for the first time, the existence of adhesome proteins aggregates in vivo. These aggregates share similarities with the ones found in 3D collagen matrices. It still remains to be determined if adhesions assembled in 3D and in vivo share functional similarities to the well-described adhesions in 2D. This will provide a major step forward in understanding cell migration in more physiological environments.
