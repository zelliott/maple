Hypolipidemias can be divided in primary, familial and hereditary forms and symptomatic forms which may accompany other diseases. The primary hypolipidemias (abetalipoproteinemia, hypobetalipoproteinemia and analphalipoproteinemia) are very rare. Severe hypolipidemia can be found in some peoples (e.g. the Masai). This article is chiefly devoted to secondary hypolipidemias such as those associated with malabsorption, malnutrition and maldigestion including protein-losing gastroenteropathy, with liver diseases, endocrine diseases (hyperthyroidism, hirsutism) and anemia. Finally, the hypolipidemias secondary to the formation of autoantibodies against HDL and LDL in M-gradient, carcinoma and rheumatoid arthritis are briefly reviewed.
