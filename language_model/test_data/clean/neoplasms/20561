The aim of the research was the analysis of epidemiological situation of neoplasm in Pomerania Voivodship in 1999 compared with situation in Poland. Neoplasms are the second cause of deaths in Poland. Only cardiac and circular system diseases are more frequent cause of deaths. The situation of cardiac and circular system mortality has positively changed and the number of circular deaths has decreased. On the contrary, the number of neoplasms deaths has increased. Especially, as far as neoplasm are concerned, Pomerania Voivodship's situation is not good. Main trends in epidemiological situation of cancers in Pomerania Voivodship are similar to the situation in Poland, however standardized mortality and incidence rates are higher than average in Poland. In Pomerania Voivodship standardized mortality rates are very high, for females the highest in Poland, for males the second in row of Polish voivodships. In the structure of registered new cases of cancer in Pomerania Voivodship we observe high percentage of multi-sites neoplasms in comparison with data for Poland. The reason of this is undoubtedly connected with the coding system used in Pomerania Voivodship. The presented results indicate the need searching for the factors causing the situation and create programs to eliminate them. The programs must concentrate on early diagnosis of cancers as well as heath promotion and natural environment preservation.
