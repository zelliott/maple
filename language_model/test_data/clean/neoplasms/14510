After reviewing basic technical considerations, we discuss some applications of flow cytometry in French laboratories. This methodology is used in several areas: oncology, cellular pharmacotoxicology, molecular biology and genetics, immunology, as well as cellular biology and physiology. We also examine the evolution of this technique in two directions: on the one hand, the appearance of increasingly sophisticated instruments; on the other, the development of less expensive and less complicated apparatuses principally directed at clinical applications.
