Multiprotein complexes figure prominently in all cellular processes. Disrupting formation of these complexes can modulate key cellular pathways and offers new possibilities for therapeutic intervention. A new study illustrates an efficient approach for developing high-affinity mimics that inhibit protein-protein interactions.
