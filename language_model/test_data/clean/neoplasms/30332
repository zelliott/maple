The results of these studies coincided with domestic and foreign literature. X-ray, CT and MRI findings were compared with postoperative assessment histological data. Usefulness of x-ray, CT and MRI studies amounted to respectively 57,1±6,5%, 85,0±3,7% and 75,1±5,1%. This, in turn, shows the great role of CT in diagnosis of benign bone tumours and tumour-like formations.
