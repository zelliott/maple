Despite extensive progress in the scientific understanding of pain in humans, serious mismanagement and undermedication in treating acute and chronic pain is a continuing problem. This study was designed to examine the barriers to adequate pain management, especially as they might be associated with community size and medical discipline.

A 59-item survey was used to measure physicians' attitudes, knowledge, and psychologic factors that contribute to pain management practices.

Overall, a significant number of physicians in this survey revealed opiophobia (prejudice against the use of opioid analgesics), displayed lack of knowledge about pain and its treatment, and had negative views about patients with chronic pain. There were significant differences among groups of physicians based on size of geographic practice area and medical discipline.

New educational strategies are needed to overcome these barriers and to improve pain treatment in routine medical practice. The effect of practice milieu must be taken into consideration.
