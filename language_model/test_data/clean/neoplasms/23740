Positron emission tomography is a powerful tool for the absolute quantification of injected positron emitting radiotracer concentration within tissues in vivo. Very detailed spatiotemporal data can be obtained without biopsy sampling. Most chemotherapeutic agents can be labelled with a positron emitter, and human tissue and tumour pharmacokinetics can be obtained non-invasively. Its main limitations are the inability to discriminate metabolites, the short half-life of the isotopes used and the specialized equipment required. Despite this, PET has the potential to make a major contribution in the study of the pharmacokinetics of anti-cancer drugs.
