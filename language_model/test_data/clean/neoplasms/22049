Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal, neoplastic disorders of hematopoietic tissue that convey a guarded prognosis, but physicians vary in whether they refer to MDS as a "cancer" when discussing the diagnosis with patients. Because of past ambiguity about whether MDS is truly a malignancy, confusion about MDS terminology is widespread. Additionally, patients who carry one of the dubious cancer-specific health insurance policies are usually not eligible for financial benefits when they receive a diagnosis of MDS. Likewise, patients with MDS who have been led to believe they do not have a form of cancer by their primary physician may become upset when seeing another health care provider who does refer to MDS in this way. Here, I discuss evidence supporting broader consideration of MDS as a form of malignant neoplasia - i.e., cancer - as well as some of the relevant practical issues.
