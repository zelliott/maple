In this study the prognostic significance of a set of quality of life measures was tested with regard to mortality regardless of its cause, cardiovascular mortality, cancer mortality and mortality from other causes. From the population register of Gothenburg, Sweden, a sample was drawn consisting of one third of all 60-year-old men. The 945 men who met the criteria were invited to a medical examination. Information on the occurrence of 30 symptoms and 15 measures of well-being was obtained by questionnaire. Mortality data were obtained through official registers, death certificates and medical records. Of the symptoms at 60, breathlessness, cough, depression, bad appetite and feeling cold, all were significantly related to mortality during 15 years of follow-up. Of the well-being variables, the same was true of perceived health, physical fitness and appetite. This means that the quality of life has a strong bearing not only on the present life situation for these men but also for their future health.
