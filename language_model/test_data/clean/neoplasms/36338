Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis has been considered as a useful approach to explore the mechanisms of complex diseases, such as cancer. To date, many proteins have been reported to involve in the development of cancer. Exploration of cancer proteins in the human PPI network may provide important biological information to uncover molecular mechanisms of cancer. Here, we have explored network characteristics (including degree, betweenness, clustering coefficient and shortest-path distance) of cancer proteins of the human nuclear and tyrosine kinases receptors network (NR-RTK) constructed in our earlier work. We found that the network topology of cancer proteins in this network have some specific features. Relative to the non-cancer proteins, the cancer proteins have likely higher degree, higher betweenness, similar clustering coefficient and similar shortest-path distance. Finally, we found that the cancer proteins were involved mainly in signalling pathways which dysfunction is directly related to cancer onset. These findings are helpful for cancer candidate protein prioritization and verification, and identification of key pathways involved in cancer disease.
