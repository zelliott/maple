The aberrant vascular architecture in solid tumors is the key limiting factor known to ameliorate hypoxia and increase circulating anticancer drugs, thus resulting in resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in tumor treatment. Previous experiments have reported hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) that are effective to improve tumor oxygenation, thereby serving as potential agents target-oriented to the hypoxic tumor. Herein, we draw the hypothesis that HBOCs combined with an anticancer drug may increase oxygen bioavailability and anticancer drug retention in solid tumors and in turn contribute to enhanced sensitivity of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This novel drug will bring a new breakthrough in the field of the development of anticancer drugs and reveal the alternative clinical use of HBOCs in tumor treatment.
