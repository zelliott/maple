Surgery is an important part of the multidisciplinary treatment of solid malignant tumours in childhood. This article gives an update on the types and numbers of tumour operations in Paediatric Surgical Service, Department of Surgery, Rikshospitalet. The presentation is restricted to the surgical part of the treatment; data on chemotherapy and irradiation are not included.

Epidemiological data are presented for all patients treated surgically for malignant - or potentially malignant tumours during the 20 years from 1985 to 2004 in our department. Survival data have been checked with the Public Registry (Folkeregisteret).

341 operations have been performed in 310 patients. 58% of the patients came from the regional health enterprise for southern Norway, where Rikshospitalet is located, and 42% came from the other 4 Norwegian health regions. Since 1993, 30 of 203 patients have been referred from the other 4 regional hospitals. There was no perioperative mortality, but 3 patients died during the first postoperative month. 85% of the patients were alive in January 2006. The survival rates for the individual tumours ranged from 100% for ovarian tumours and 98% for Wilms' tumour to 62% for neuroblastoma.

The Paediatric Surgical Service at Rikshospitalet has operated solid malignant tumours in children from all parts of Norway. A large spectrum of tumours have been treated without operative mortality.
