Using AUC-based dosing compensates for variations in renal function between and within individual patients. It does not adjust for other factors such as previous chemotherapy, previous radiotherapy, or performance status. One empiric method to adjust for these factors would be reduction of the ideal AUC. However, because AUC-based dosing accounts for variations in renal function, this would not be an appropriate method to adjust dosing based solely on renal function changes.
