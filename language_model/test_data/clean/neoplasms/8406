Although many questions remain about the clinical use of hemopoietic growth factors, it is remarkable how much information has been gained in such a short time. There is enormous interest in these agents among physicians from a variety of specialties--all providing new ideas for potential studies. As the supplies increase, many new trials can be opened. It is important to design these studies with due regard to the results of in vitro and in vivo preclinical experiments--preferably after discussion with experimental hematologists--or vital information will be missed. There can have been few more exciting developments in clinical medicine in the recent past than the availability of the hemopoietic growth factors and, hopefully, it will not be long before the preliminary trials are completed and these agents are accepted for routine use to the benefit of a large number of patients.
