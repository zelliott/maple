Both the provitamin beta-carotene and natural vitamin A and its derivatives (the retinoids) are being proposed as potential chemopreventive agents. The biochemistry and pharmacology of vitamin A suggest a number of mechanisms whereby carcinogenesis can be affected. Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated an increased relative risk of cancer for people with low vitamin A intake or low-to-normal serum retinol values. Chemoprevention trials in humans are only now beginning. In the interim, daily consumption of vitamin-A-containing foods may be a "prescription" worth following.
