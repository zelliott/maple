The 5-year experiences of a center for pediatric oncology in a children's university hospital are reported. Currently (1-1-1975) 60 of 135 treated leukemic and 88 of 152 treated tumor patients are living. 1974, there were in the average 34 ambulatory complete blood counts per week, and in addition 263 bone marrow and 196 ambulatory lumbar punctures per year. The standardized routine of an outpatient visit is described. Advice for parents and family physicians are given. A standardized diagnostic approach for M. Hodgkin as a prototype is proposed, and a standardized therapy for Wilms' tumor. Of 24 thus treated children with Wilms' tumor 16 ("67 p.c.") survive, included 7 of 15 ("47 p.c.") with metastasized disease (observation time 21-71 months). Current treatment of 49 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia resulted in continuous complete remission of 22 patients ("45 p.c.") (observation time 1-4 years), but 6 dead in complete remission due to infection. The need for specialized treatment centers with skilled persons is emphasized.
