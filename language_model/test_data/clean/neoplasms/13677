To study the usefulness of detection of telomerase activity in the diagnosis of malignant tumors.

Modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) was employed to examine telomerase activity in 283 malignant tumor tissues, 42 adjacent tissues and 61 benign tumor tissues.

Of the 283 malignant tumors and 42 adjacent tissues, telomerase was positive in 264 (93.3%) and 11 (26.1%), respectively. Only 4 of the 62 (6.6%) benign tumors were telomerase positive.

Telomerase activity may be used as tumor marker in the diagnosis of malignant tumors.
