A 17-year-old Quarter Horse mare developed rapidly progressive, bilateral, firm enlargements of both mammary glands, ventral abdominal edema, dyspnea, and neurologic signs. The horse was euthanatized, and a carcinoma of the mammary gland was diagnosed at necropsy. Microscopically, normal glandular parenchyma was replaced by neoplastic nodules, and the tumor had metastasized to most visceral organs and throughout the musculoskeletal and central nervous systems. The tumor had a solid pattern, with microglandular differentiation, and numerous syncytial sheets.
