The successful dissemination of the Cancer Control Demonstration Projects for Farmers depends not only on the effectiveness of the grants funded under this program but also on factors external to the grants. In this article, three health-related external factors are examined: the cancers amenable to prevention and control, intervention methodologies, and the organization of rural health care. Changes between 1989 and 1996 in each of these factors and the effects of these changes on the dissemination of grantee findings to public health and medical practitioners are described. Suggestions are offered on actions that the National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health can undertake to increase the likelihood of adoption of grantee findings.
