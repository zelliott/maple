The activity of etoposide (VP-16) has been demonstrated to be schedule-dependent. Several studies have been conducted on the efficacy and safety of different schedules of VP-16 both in adults and in children, but the optimal schedule has not been determined.

In the current study, the feasibility and effectiveness of prolonged oral VP-16 in children with high-risk malignancies were evaluated. Between April 1995 and February 1999, 15 pretreated patients with high-risk tumors received oral VP-16. The schedule of therapy was oral VP-16 50 mg/m2/day for 10 consecutive days and 1-week interval between cycles. Therapy was stopped after 1 year of treatment or at time of progressive disease or possible surgery. All patients had received parenteral VP-16 in their earlier chemotherapy.

Twelve patients were evaluable for tumor response. After 2 to 4 months of treatment, one patient had complete remission (CR), two had partial response (PR), two had minor response (MR), two had mixed response (MxR), three had stable disease (SD), and two had progressive disease (PD). A useful palliative effect was noted in patients with stable disease. In three patients, oral VP-16 was administered for maintenance therapy. After an average follow-up of 27.5 months (range, 7-41 months), five patients are alive without disease (in three, total surgery was performed after VP-16 therapy) and three patients are alive with disease. Six patients died of progressive disease, and one died of promyelocytic leukemia. One patient had Grade 34 thrombocytopenia; in the remaining patients, no acute toxicity was observed during treatment.

This schedule of oral VP-16 produced CRs, PRs, and MRs in medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, teratocarcinoma, and ependymoma. Stable disease was observed in three patients, one with an Askin tumor, one with medulloblastoma, and one with hepatoblastoma. Given the possible leukemogenic risk, this schedule should be used as a palliative form of therapy or in patients with poor prognosis..
