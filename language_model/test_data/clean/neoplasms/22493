High-content tumor cell migration assays in 3-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix are a powerful tool for modeling and understanding the biology of this critical step in the process of metastasis. Currently available methods offer very limited throughput and are not amenable to studies of comparative pharmacology or small-scale screening. The authors present an automated approach to high-content tumor cell migration assays. A standard screening-sized plate with an array of microchannels was designed and constructed from common thermoplastics. After filling the channels with 3D matrix, cells were placed at one end of the channel, and migration into the channel was monitored via an imaging system. All liquid-handling steps were performed by standard liquid-handling robotics. Tumor cell migration in the channel was truly 3D and correlated with metastatic potential. The information-rich data from these assays were used to rank the potency of compounds inhibiting migration through 3D collagen as well as to gain additional insights into the compounds' activities related to cell health. This approach is compatible with a variety of multiparametric, morphological, and/or kinetic readouts.
