Bazex's acrokeratosis paraneoplastica is a clinically well-defined entity consisting of a distal erythemato-squamous eruption and nail dystrophy. It is always associated with neoplasia, mainly squamous carcinomas of the upper digestive and respiratory tracts; therefore, Bazek's acrokeratosis is considered to be a specific marker of internal malignancy. Two new cases of this syndrome are reported. The first was in a 41-year-old man with a squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus, the second in a 73-year-old man who presented with a transitional cell bladder carcinoma, an association not previously reported.
