The aim of this study is to describe the role of the GP in the care of one specified cancer patient per GP and to explore the GP's knowledge about that patient's disease and treatments. A further aim was to evaluate the effects of an extended information routine, including increased information from the specialist clinic to the GP. Twenty GPs were selected for a semi-structured interview about a patient randomised either to an extended GP information routine or to standard information. The results suggest that GPs are commonly involved in the care of cancer patients, particularly in the diagnosis of the disease but also during the period of treatments and follow-up. The information from the specialist clinic to the GP is insufficient in standard care. The extended information routine increased the GPs' knowledge about the disease and treatments and facilitated their possibilities to determine patients' need for support. However, this did not affect the extent of contacts with the patient.
