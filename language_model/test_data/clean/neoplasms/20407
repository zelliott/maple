Numerous data concerning nucleolar organizer region (NOR) structure and function in normal and pathological human cells are analysed. The contents of argentophilic nucleolar proteins vary in the cells tested. The silver-stained test is closely connected with cellular proliferative potentials and differentiation status of the cells. This test also depends on the level of tumor cell malignancy and seemed to be very useful for megakaryocyte and cardiomyocyte studies. In summary, the NOR silver-staining approach is of great value for both fundamental cytological investigations and wide medical practice.
