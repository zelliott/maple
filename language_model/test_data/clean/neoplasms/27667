The association between linear IgA dermatosis and neoplasia has been the subject of several publications which suggest that the association is not fortuitous. We report a new case in which a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was associated with a linear IgA dermatosis and underline the need for full evaluation in search of an associated neoplasia. However, the neoplasia-LAD association is not a true paraneoplastic syndrome since the two pathologies seldom follow a parallel course.
