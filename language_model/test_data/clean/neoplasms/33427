I portray health-related research outcomes in an arts-informed representation that disrupts the traditional discursive-scholarly format of journal writing to privilege better the participants' accounts and communicate these experientially. The representation uncovers meaning through alternative ways of communicating and conveys the ineffable quality of music in a manner that may be understood through and beyond words. This expands the convention of health-related research outcomes, including ways of knowing, what can be known and how this can be represented. I elaborate my intentions for this experiential report, discuss theoretical underpinnings of this methodology and describe a music therapy support group model.
