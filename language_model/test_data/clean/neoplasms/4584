Treatment of cardiomyopathy has to take into account correction of etiology or improvement of aggravating factors. Management of cardiomyopathy is not basically different from treatment of classic heart failure. Some drug as amlodipine or miscellaneous beta-blockers might be more effective in cardiomyopathy. Heart transplantation remains the main surgical treatment of end stage cardiomyopathy while other procedures (cardiomyoplasty, ...) are still under assessment.
