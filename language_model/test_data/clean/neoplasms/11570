Rapid (6 min washing step) and reliable methods for determining uridine kinase and pyrimidine phosphoribosyltransferase activities were devised. These procedures, consisting of a spotting technique on DEAE-discs followed by washing and elution, permitted the consistent recovery of about 90% of the nucleoside 5'-phosphate esters formed from radioactive precursors, either uridine or 5-fluorouracil, respectively. Of these precursors, less than 2% were retained on the discs. Direct counting of the discs (without elution), filtration by either gravity or suction, and the use of so-called activation of discs have not proved advantageous.
