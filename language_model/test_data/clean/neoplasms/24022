The authors analyze the experience gained in noninvasive transcutaneous monitoring of blood gases ptkO2 and ptkCO2 (MICROGAS device, Contron, France) in 33 oncological patients during surgery with irradiation of the operation wound (n = 13) under conditions of total intravenous anesthesia (TIA) with artificial ventilation of the lungs with a hypoxic respiration mixture (FiO2 10%) and during surgery for breast cancer under TIA with spontaneous respiration (n = 20). Transcutaneous monitoring was found to be a sensitive rapidly reacting method, more informative than pulsed oximetry, for intraoperative hypoxyradiotherapy with long-distance monitoring of a patient; under such conditions it can be the only possible method for monitoring the preset level of pO2. The results of measuring ptkO2 and ptkCO2 are close to the values in the arterial blood.
