The evaluation of the genetic implications of increasing exposure to genotoxic agents poses one of the most difficult epidemiological issues faced by biomedical scientists. Mutation epidemiology is a term referring to studies aimed at estimating the rates of spontaneous as well as environmentally induced somatic and germinal mutations in humans and the assessment of their impact. In this article, studies of the mutagenic effects of ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents are reviewed and discussed in light of the limitations inherent in these kinds of investigations. Estimating the risk of mutational damage is a young science. Further technological developments promise better assessments than can presently be offered.
