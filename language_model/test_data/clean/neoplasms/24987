Abstract Exogenous antioxidants may influence endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity. We observed in healthy women (n = 95) that higher plasma α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, sum of plasma carotenoids, and fruit and vegetable intake were associated with lower plasma extracellular-superoxide dismutase activity. In women with a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer (n = 62), we observed no associations. Our observation that plasma extracellular-superoxide dismutase activity was inversely associated with plasma carotenoids and fruit and vegetable intake in healthy women, but not in women with a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer, suggests that the associations between exogenous and endogenous antioxidants may differ in health and disease.
