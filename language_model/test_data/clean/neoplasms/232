We have previously shown that sera from many hypothyroid patients stimulated adenylate cyclase activity as measured by serum bioactive TSH concentrations produced by FRTL-5 cell line. This TSH-stimulating activity did not correlate with serum immunoreactive TSH. IgG fractions of these sera did not stimulate FRTL-5 cells. The present study was, therefore, undertaken to investigate the thyroid stimulating activity of sera from patients with non-thyroidal illness. Studies were performed in 36 patients with various non-thyroidal illness. In these patients, serum concentrations of T4, free thyroxine, T3, and TSH were determined. In addition, sera were incubated with FRTL-5 cells or porcine thyroid cells in primary culture in the presence of 0.4 mM MIBX, and medium cAMP concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Sera obtained from some patients with various non-thyroidal illness increased cAMP concentrations in culture media of FRTL-5 cells as well as that of porcine thyroid cells. The thyroid stimulating effects of sera were not disease specific and significantly correlated inversely with serum T3 and T4 concentrations. Serum TSH concentrations in these patients were within the normal range even by the newly developed ultrasensitive assay. Although the nature of substance(s) present in sera of patients with low T3 syndrome which stimulates thyroid adenylate cyclase is not entirely known, it is conceivable that there exist mechanisms independent of TSH to compensate the decreased serum T3 levels in low T3 syndrome.
