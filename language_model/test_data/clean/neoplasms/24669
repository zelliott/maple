The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) are a family of proteins which share common structural domains, and extensive research has shown that they have central roles in DNA repair, telomere biogenesis, cell signaling and in regulating gene expression at both transcriptional and translational levels. Through these key cellular functions, individual hnRNPs have a variety of potential roles in tumour development and progression including the inhibition of apoptosis, angiogenesis and cell invasion. The aims of this review are to provide an overview of the multi functional roles of the hnRNPs, and how such roles implicate this family as regulators of tumour development. The different stages of tumour development that are potentially regulated by the hnRNPs along with their aberrant expression profiles in tumour tissues will also be discussed.
