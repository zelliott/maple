Dramatic clinical results have been obtained in malignant melanoma and sarcoma using hyperthermic limb perfusion in combination with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and melphalan (L-PAM). In order to extrapolate these results to systemic treatment, a preclinical research program was initiated to study the interactions of hyperthermia, TNF, and L-PAM. Based on these results, a Phase I clinical trial of whole body hyperthermia (WBH) and L-PAM was initiated and completed. Clinical results obtained were consistent with initiating two second generation studies: a) a Phase II study of WBH and L-PAM for malignant melanoma; b) a Phase I study of WBH, TNF and L-PAM. Both of these studies are currently active at the University of Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Center. The following review summarizes the laboratory and clinical data obtained to date regarding this systemic multi-modality treatment approach.
