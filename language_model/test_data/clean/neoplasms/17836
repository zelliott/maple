Initially identified as a group of auxiliary protein factors involved in transcriptional regulation by steroid hormone receptors as well as by other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) have since then been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of other transcription factors which are important components of very different signaling pathways. Members of the SRC family have been shown to interact with myogenin, MEF-2, transcriptional enhancer factor (TEF), NF-kappaB, AP-1, STAT, p53, and E2F1, suggesting that SRC coactivators participate in diverse cellular processes. Recent evidence indicates that various post-translational modifications play critical roles in determining the final transcriptional output and specificity of SRC coactivators. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge concerning post-translational modifications, dynamic interplay between different modifications, and patho-physiological relevance of the modifications of SRC proteins.
