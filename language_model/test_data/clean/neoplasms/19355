It is assumed that oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) from activated neutrophil granulocytes may contribute to pathology of tumors. ROS are crucial in neutrophil-mediated tumor cell lysis. The present study is focused on the oxidative burst and antitumorous activities of neutrophils when challenged with Walker carcinoma W256. Survival and tumor growth dynamics were monitored in vivo, while tumor cell proliferation when mixed with neutrophils was studied in vitro together with the generation/release of neutrophil respiratory burst products, primarily 1O2. Neutrophils were collected upon Sephadex injection. The survival of Sephadex injected animals was slightly improved, while their tumors grew less than in controls. The presence of tumor cells in vitro activated neutrophils to produce singlet oxygen similar to phorbol ester. Neutrophils from Sephadex-bearing animals diminished tumor cell proliferation in vitro (measured by 3H-TdR incorporation), while neutrophils from Sephadex and the tumor-bearing animals did not show such activity in vitro. Our results confirm that in the case of rapidly growing tumors such as murine W256 carcinoma neutrophils have antitumorous effects in the early phase of tumor development.
