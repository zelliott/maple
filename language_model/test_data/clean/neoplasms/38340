Genetic research offers great potential for early treatment and the prevention of numerous diseases. As technology continues to advance, ethical, legal, and social challenges continue to present themselves. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) looks to protect an individual's genetic information from employer and insurance discrimination while encouraging Americans to take advantage of genetic testing to prevent and prepare for potential diseases. GINA will do more than stamp out a new form of discrimination: it will help the United States be a leader in a field of scientific research that holds as much promise as any other in history.
