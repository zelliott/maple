Altered concentrations of serum proteins and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) often accompany malignant diseases. Free fractions (fu) of apazone and warfarin were measured by equilibrium dialysis in serum samples obtained from 31 patients with cancer and 18 control subjects. Mean fu values of both drugs were significantly higher in the patient group. Multivariate analysis showed albumin, NEFA, and AAG for apazone and albumin, NEFA, and age for warfarin accounted for 60% and 63%, respectively, of interpatient variation in bound/free drug concentration ratios in the group of patients with cancer. The interactions of apazone and warfarin with AAG were further characterized; the more avid site had association constants of 4.5 X 10(5) and 2.3 X 10(5) L/mol, respectively. Finally, it is strongly suggested that when hypoalbuminemia is present and a drug binds to AAG with an affinity constant comparable to or higher than that to albumin, then fu will become dependent on the concentration of AAG.
