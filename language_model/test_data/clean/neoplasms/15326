ICO-63, new monoclonal antibodies (MCAB), used for immunodiagnosis, were produced by the standard hybridoma technique ICO-63 MCAB reacted with 50% granulocytes, 20% thrombocytes and endothelial cells, whereas they did not react with peripheral blood mononuclear cells, thymocytes and erythrocytes. The molecular weight of ICO-63 MCAB-identified antigen was about 100 kD. ICO-63 MCAB reacted with 12 out of 15 neuroblastomas, with some solid tissue sarcomas and melanomas, but did not react with tumours of the epithelial origin.
