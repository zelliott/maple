Despite development and introduction of new and innovative drugs, a large number of malignant diseases are associated with unfavourable prognosis. In recent years, considerable progress in cancer treatment has been obtained by the application of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells.

This review provides an overview and summary of recent advances in adoptive immunotherapy strategies in cancer treatment using CIK cells. A selective literature search has been performed.

The application of CIK cells as adoptive immunotherapy plays an important role in cancer treatment. Combining CIK cells with other conventional and established therapy options represents an innovative approach and will hopefully provide new insight for the future.
