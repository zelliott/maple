Many studies utilizing combined hyperthermia (HT) and radiation therapy (XRT) in the treatment of advanced or recurrent malignancies have reported a correlation between some measure of the minimum temperature achieved and outcome. Previous reported studies at Stanford have demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the duration of local control and Tmin, the mean over treatments of the minima of (a) measured intratumoral temperatures in fields which contained diffuse or nodular tumours, or (b) measured interstitial temperatures in fields treated for microscopic residual disease. Recently, T90, the mean of the temperatures above which 90% of all measured intratumoral temperatures fall, has been proposed as an alternative characterization of the efficacy of the HT treatment that reportedly has a superior correlation with outcome. To test this hypothesis, T90 was computed by two different methods for three groups of patients treated at Stanford with XRT-HT for superficially located tumor recurrences. Tmin was found to be strongly correlated with T90 calculated by both methods. All three thermal parameters correlated with complete response at 3 weeks and with local control, although Tmin usually demonstrated the strongest correlation.
