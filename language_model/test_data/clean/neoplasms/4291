A retrospective cohort mortality study was carried out in 20 industrial factories in the Local Health Unit Bologna Sud (Emilia Romagna, Italy), where different rubber and plastics products were manufactured. The cohort consisted of 925 subjects (578 males and 347 females) employed for at least six months continuously; follow-up was between the beginning of operation of each factory, ranging between mid fifties and mid seventies, and 31 December 1989. For those exposed more than one year cause specific Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) were computed using regional rates for comparison, 90% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated assuming the Poisson distribution. Among the 748 subjects employed for more than one year (457 males and 291 females) there were no lost to follow-up, 54 individuals were dead (41 males and 13 females) and for three subjects the cause of death was unknown. The results showed that all causes mortality was above expectancy in the total cohort (SMR = 123; 54 Obs; 90% CI = 97-154), among males (SMR = 117; 41 Obs; 90% CI = 89-152) and females (SMR = 143; 13 Obs; 90% CI = 85-228). Increased mortality for all malignant tumours was observed in the total cohort (SMR = 150; 25 Obs; 90% CI = 104-209) and for both genders. All nine lung cancer cases were observed among males, the SMR was equal to 218 and was statistically significant; seven cases occurred at duration of exposure less than 10 years and six at latency up to 20 years. The interpretation in terms of causality of the present investigation is limited by the small number of observations and by exposure definition solely in terms of employment in the study factories; nonetheless the results are indicating the existence, in this group of rubber and plastics product makers, of an adverse health effect which deserve further investigation.
