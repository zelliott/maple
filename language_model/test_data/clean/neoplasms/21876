Pure multiplicative noise-induced stochastic resonance, which appears in an anti-tumor system modulated by a seasonal external field, is studied by using theoretical analyses of the generalized potential and numerical simulations. For optimally selected values of the multiplicative noise intensity stochastic resonance is observed, which is manifested by the quasisymmetry of two potential minima. Theoretical results and numerical simulations are in good quantitative agreement.
