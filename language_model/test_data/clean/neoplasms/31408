This study updates lymphopoietic cancer (LHC) mortality statistics and other major causes of death through 1992 for 13,188 petrochemical researchers employed between 1964 and 1986. Significant deficits of deaths were observed for all causes, all cancers, ischaemic heart disease and all external causes. The subcategory of 'all other LHC' was elevated among males in an exposure class containing scientists and engineers. This finding was statistically significant based on national but not state comparison rates. Poisson regression analyses showed that increasing exposure classes were not associated with LHC, but a relationship was noted for total years worked. A non-significant increase in breast cancer among females was also observed but was concentrated among the lowest exposure class. This study and other similar investigations suggest various subcategories of LHC deaths are marginally elevated among chemical researchers and engineers. Evidence for a work-related LHC hazard for this population, however, has not been identified.
