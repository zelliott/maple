Human epithelial cells that had grown out from a maxillary carcinoma were examined for their responsiveness to putative growth-controlling factors in a serum-free medium. Among the factors examined, bovine brain acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) at 1 to 10 ng/ml significantly promoted DNA synthesis of the cells in the presence of 5 U/ml heparin, whereas type beta transforming growth factor inhibited it in a dose-dependent manner. Fetal bovine serum at 0.6% inhibited DNA synthesis of the cells by approximately 15%, but no significant influence was observed at higher concentrations up to 10%. Epidermal growth factor, bovine pituitary gland FGF and basic FGF exhibited no significant effect on DNA synthesis of the cells. The present result suggests that acidic FGF, a known mitogen for endothelial cells, is also mitogenic for human epithelial cells derived from maxillary carcinoma.
