According to this study, the immunological function was aberrant in cancer patients with Spleen-deficiency syndrome. The TII cell in normal persons (n = 26) was 30, 86 +/- 9.70% (means +/- S) and in these cases (n = 43) was 22.62 +/- 9.92%, P less than 0.002. The cytotoxicity of NK cell in patients (n = 59) was 17.65 +/- 10.58%, in normal controls (n = 43) was 25.51 +/- 14.10%. The combining ability of NK cell in patients (n = 48) was 39.11 +/- 19.43%, the normal persons (n = 41) was 55.88 +/- 17.94%. It showed that the immune function of the cancer patients with Spleen-deficiency syndrome were markedly lower than that of normal persons. The serum IgA in saliva of patients (n = 37) was 0.44 +/- 0.17 microgram/ml. It was much higher than that of normals' (n = 24, 0.30 +/- 0.06 microgram/ml), P less than 0.001. Some patients' NK cell function and the level of level of SIgA in saliva were recovered to normal after treatment of Shengxue Tang which could strengthen the Spleen and replenish the Kidney. These studies proved that the TCM played an important role for modulating immune function in treating cancer patients.
