Oxidative stress may be defined as an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant defense system. It is now known that oxidative stress is involved in most of pathological states and diseases. ROS and other oxidants can cause oxidation of lipids, proteins and DNA with following tissue damage. Toxic products of oxidation proceed cytostatic effects causing membrane damage and lead into cell death via apoptosis or necrosis. The redox status of the cell is maintained by antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismuthase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and other substances such as glutathione, vitamins E, C and A, which provide to eliminate ROS.
