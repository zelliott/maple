The completion of the Human Genome Project and the achievement of similar goals in other organisms have generated a huge amount of free available information with high potential in biomedical sciences. However, the identification of the DNA sequence was only a starting point for genomic research. This research has been facilitated by the development of new powerful genomic tools that allow the use of the wide amount of genomic information generated to address new biological and biomedical questions. One of these widely accepted and accessible technologies is DNA microarrays. Although the most popular use of DNA microarrays is gene expression profiling, due to the continuous advances in microarray technologies, scientists have also successfully used them for multiple applications, including genotyping, re-sequencing, DNA copy number analysis and DNA methylation. In short, DNA microarrays are changing the way cancer research scientists are addressing different biological questions and will allow the translation of genome research to clinical practice.
