The interaction between OX40 and OX40L plays an important role in antigen-specific T-cell expansion and survival. While OX40 is expressed predominantly on T-lymphocytes early after antigen activation, OX40L is expressed on activated antigen presenting cells and endothelial cells within acute inflammatory environments. We discuss here how ligation of OX40 by OX40L leads to enhanced T-cell survival, along with local inflammatory responses that appear critical for both effective T-cell mediated responses and chronic immune pathologies. We describe how interventions that block or mimic the OX40-OX40L interaction can be applied to treat autoimmune diseases or enhance anti-tumor immune responses. The clinically relevant properties of these agents emphasize the importance of this particular TNFSF-TNFSF in health and disease.
