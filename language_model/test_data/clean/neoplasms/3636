Multiple factors, including personal and cultural values, physical and medical factors, and various healthcare systems' forces, influence the place of death of patients with cancer. The purpose of this retrospective chart audit study was to examine the influence of sociodemographic factors, family support, patient functioning, and care needs on the place of death for patients with cancer served by a home care program in Taiwan. Among the 264 study patients, 182 (69%) died at home and 82 (31%) died in the hospital. Significant differences were found between patients dying at home or in a hospital predominantly in the categories of patient functioning and care needs. From the multivariate logistic regression model, home care patients with cancer who were never rehospitalized, who received more home care visits, and who were referred to home care services at the greatest functionally dependent status and with pain were more likely to die at home. Overall, this model could accurately classify 78% of the place of death, which is higher than other published studies. Understanding factors that influence place of death of terminally ill patients with cancer allow healthcare professionals to modify healthcare systems and tailor effective interventions to help patients die at the place they prefer.
