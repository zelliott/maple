Dendritic cells (DCs) are powerful antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that have attracted attention in recent years from the viewpoint of DC vaccine therapy against cancer. However, the existence of a strongly immunosuppressed state in cancer-bearing individuals inhibits DC maturation, which is one of the problems facing anti-cancer DC vaccine therapy. Protein-bound polysaccharide K (PSK), which is extracted from the cultured mycelium of Coriolus versicolor (Fr.) Qu√©l, is used as an anti-cancer agent in Japan. PSK is reported to improve the immunosuppressed state and might be associated with DC maturation directly. We examined the effect of PSK on the maturation of DC derived from CD14-positive cells obtained from human peripheral blood monocytes using a negative selection method. CD14-positive cells cultured in the presence of PSK significantly increased the expression of HLA class II antigen and CD40; significantly increased the number and expression of CD80-, CD86- and CD83-positive cells; decreased Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran uptake, augmented IL-12 production; augmented the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction; and induced antigen-specific cytotoxicity. These results indicate that PSK promotes both the phenotypic and functional maturation of DC derived from human CD14-positive mononuclear cells. The clinical significance of the combined use of PSK in DC vaccine therapy remains for study.
