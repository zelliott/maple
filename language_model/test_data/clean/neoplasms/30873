To improve the continuity of care and to better coordinate psychosocial care, the Psychosocial Oncology Program at the Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital developed a psychosocial summary flow sheet. The objectives of the pilot project evaluation were: (a) to examine preparation to use the flow sheet prior to its implementation, (b) to gather information on how staff used the flow sheet, and (c) to determine how its design and implementation could be improved. The charts of all the patients on the units participating in the pilot project were examined and a questionnaire was sent to all staff involved with patient care on these units. The results of the evaluation indicated that the psychosocial summary flow sheet was perceived to be an asset to psychosocial care and could be implemented hospital-wide. Based on the evaluation, a number of changes were made in its design and a strategy for hospital-wide implementation was planned.
