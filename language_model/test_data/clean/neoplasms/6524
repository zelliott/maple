Natural killer (NK) cells have been implicated as first line of defence mechanism for carcinogenesis in humans. A lot of studies of depressed NK activity in patients with malignancies have supported this. Two major problems, however, in these studies are the choice of normal controls and target cells. To study this problem, peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) of sixty-six normal subjects from young and elderly, males and females were tested for NK function against twenty target cell lines with a microcytotoxicity assay. The result was shown that no sex or age difference existed with respect to NK function, except for a slight but significant decreased in NK activity of young female to K562 target cells. Target cells were divided into four groups by their NK sensitivity, namely, high, moderate, low and refractory sensitive. In general, NK activity of healthy persons is considered to remain stable and polyspecific in our results.
