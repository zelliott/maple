The aim of this study was to assess the overall progress against cancer in Austria by analysing changes in age-adjusted mortality rates from 1970 to 1996. For the years 1970 to 1996, age-adjusted rates for all malignant neoplasms and for selected sites were calculated for men and women, according to year, age and sex. The number of cancer deaths were obtained from the Austrian Central Statistical Office--age-adjusted mortality rates of all malignant neoplasms decreased in men between 1971 and 1996 by 13% (from 289.1 to 251.4 deaths per 100,000), and in women between 1970 and 1996 by 19.1% (from 276.6 to 223.7 deaths per 100,000). Among older people (&gt; or = 55 years) the mortality decreased by 13% in men and by 17% in women; among younger people (&lt; 55 years) by 12% and 30%, respectively. The decrease in total cancer mortality is promoted by three tumour sites (the leading causes of cancer deaths in 1970). In both sexes, the decrease of stomach cancer mortality had the major impact, followed by colorectal cancer in women and by lung cancer in men. The observed changes in mortality are primarily related to changing incidence and early detection, rather than improvements in treatment. Unfortunately, there is evidence that prevention is losing ground in Austria. The implementation of the well-established knowledge of cancer prevention and the strengthening of preventative research is urgently needed.
