Much research interest has been shown in recent years for the development of molecular diagnostic strategies based on the analysis of DNA/RNA molecules that are present in the plasma/serum of human subjects. Reported applications include the diagnosis, prognostication or monitoring of malignancies and pregnancy-associated complications. While researchers have speculated that cell death is a potential mechanism that leads to the release of DNA/RNA into the circulation, studies have demonstrated that indeed increased amounts of plasma DNA and RNA could be detected in patients sustaining acute traumatic injuries. The degree of plasma DNA elevation correlated with the severity of injury. Similarly, plasma DNA concentrations have been shown to correlate with indices of prognostic significance in patients with acute stroke. It is expected that new diagnostic markers based on plasma RNA detection could be developed for the evaluation of acute pathologies.
