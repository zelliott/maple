Four platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes with sugar-conjugated bipyridine-type triazole ligands, [Pt(II)Cl(2)(AcGlc-pyta)] (3), [Pd(II)Cl(2)(AcGlc-pyta)] (4), [Pt(II)Cl(2)(Glc-pyta)] (5), and [Pd(II)Cl(2)(Glc-pyta)] (6), were prepared and characterized by mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, (1)H- and (13)C-NMR, IR as well as UV/VIS spectroscopy, where AcGlc-pyta and Glc-pyta denote 2-[4-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl]ethyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (1) and 2-[4-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl]ethyl β-D-glucopyranoside (2), respectively. The solid-state structure of complex 6 was determined by single-crystal X-ray-diffraction analysis. These complexes exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity against human cervix tumor cells (HeLa) though weaker than that of cisplatin.
