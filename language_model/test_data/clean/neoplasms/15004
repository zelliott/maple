Genetic instability is known as a cause of oncogenesis. Though Rad18 is reported to function in a post replication mismatch repair system, the relation between the status of Rad18 and human tumorigenesis has not been described so far.

Mutation analysis of 34 human cancer cell lines and 32 non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues were performed by RT-PCR SSCP. Expression level of Rad18 was measured by real time RT-PCR. Stable transfectant was constructed for in vitro study.

No mutation was found in both cancer cell lines and NSCLC tissues. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 302 was detected in 51.5% of the cell lines and 62.5% of NSCLC tissues. Interestingly, Rad18 was homozygously deleted in a pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line PC3. Furthermore, there was no difference in the expression level of wild type Rad18 and Rad18 with SNP. The growth, cell morphology, sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs and in vitro DNA repair activity between wild type Rad18 and Rad18 with SNP revealed to have no difference in vitro.

Though the frequency of SNP was tended to be higher in NSCLC patients than healthy volunteers (57.7%), as the difference was not significant, we have concluded that there is no relation between Rad18 SNP and lung cancer development.
