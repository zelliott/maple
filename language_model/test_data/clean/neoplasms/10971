There are large numbers of people suffering from simultaneous coronary heart disease and ischaemic heart disease who remain under home palliative care. When concentrating on oencological palliative treatment, there exists sometimes a tendency to forget about the possibility of deterioration in the general condition of a patient with cardio-vascular system dysfunctions. Deterioration in the patient's condition and persistent somatic complaints are frequently interpreted as progress in neoplastic disease or side effects of the employed therapy. It frequently leads to unnecessary discontinuation of palliative oencological treatment. Severe general condition of most patients limits the possibility of ischaemic heart disease diagnosis. It is also impossible to perform stress tests. Resting ECG is a simple and relatively inexpensive diagnostic method, possible to be performed at home by the patient's bed. Basing on a medical survey and an analysis of ECG record, diagnosis of deterioration in CHNS is very successful. The management of a patient with advanced neoplastic disease coexistent with ischaemic heart disease demands careful oencological and cardiologic treatment. ECG examinations carried in the patient's bed constitutes a crucial element of diagnostics in deteriorating coronary heart disease and in heart rate disregulations in patients under home palliative care.
