The objectives and realizations of the EORTC are described. The activities of the treatment branch are centralized at the EORTC Data Center located in Brussels. Approximately 6000 patients are included every year within clinical trials run by EORTC, involving active participation of more than 2000 physicians distributed in 350 institutions in Europe. 80% of patients included in EORTC trials are located in EC countries. Recently, new cooperative groups have been created in order to study cancers in elderly, tumors related to AIDS as well as invasive fungal infections in cancer patients. New perspectives and further developments include cost evaluations of new therapeutic modalities in oncology as well as quality of life of cancer patients. Furthermore, EORTC promotes the creation of a meta-analysis unit. A fellowship program to allow training of medical doctors and statisticians at the EORTC Data Center including scientists coming from Eastern and Central Europe is also encouraging. Every year, EORTC activities lead to at least 40 publications and more than 80 scientific communications allowing rapid diffusion of the results of researches performed.
