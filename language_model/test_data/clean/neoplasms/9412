Sir2, an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, extends the lifespan in diverse species from yeast to flies. Mammals have seven homologs of Sir2, SIRT1-7, which affect aging and metabolism and which are potential targets for pharmacologic intervention. We identified SIRT2, which preferentially deacetylates tubulin and histone H4, as a downregulated protein in gliomas due to its epigenetic aberration. We herein discuss the role of SIRT2 in the mitotic checkpoint function and show that it may be as a potential target of anti-cancer drugs.
