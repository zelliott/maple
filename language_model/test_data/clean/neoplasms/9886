The behaviour of prekallikrein (PKK), factor XII, high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and kallikrein-inhibitor (KK-I) in 367 patients with various diseases is described. Malignancies lead to elevation of factor XII and KK-I, and reduction of PKK. The effect is more pronounced in patients with metastases. In renal diseases also one or more of the above mentioned parameters are abnormal. Defects requiring dialysis treatment significantly impair the contact factors. In this group low levels of PKK, Factor XII and HMWK and increased KK-I are common. In chronic renal disease patients, only F XII and KK-I are elevated, whereas PKK and HMWK are normal. Kidney transplantation leads to a rise in KK-I and reduction of PKK and HMWK. The values almost normalize few days after the operation. Factor XII, slightly increased immediately after transplantation, remains high in long term transplant recipients, whereas HMWK falls below normal. In liver disease patients, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver and coma, PKK is reduced. In cases with acute hepatitis PKK raises with recovery. Cirrhosis and coma lead to low HMWK and factor XII concentrations. KK-I is mostly affected during acute hepatitis, and is then highly increased. Our results clearly demonstrate that the biologic activity of one or more of contact factors is affected in many diseases.
