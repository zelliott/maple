Optical imaging using near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence provides new prospects for general and oncologic surgery. ICG is currently utilised in NIR fluorescence cancer-related surgery for three indications: sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping, intraoperative identification of solid tumours, and angiography during reconstructive surgery. Therefore, understanding its advantages and limitations is of significant importance. Although non-targeted and non-conjugatable, ICG appears to be laying the foundation for more widespread use of NIR fluorescence-guided surgery.
