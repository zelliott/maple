Several studies have shown that place of death is affected by many parameters. Our objective was to describe for the first time where patients with cancer die in Greece and what has changed between 1993 and 2003. We acquired data on all deaths that were attributed to cancer in Greece in the years 1993 and 2003, and compared these data to the changes in the location of death in the total population. In 1993, approximately 50.7% of men and 50.9% of women cancer patients died in hospital, while in 2003, the respective percentages were 57.3% and 56.1%. The results indicate a trend toward a larger proportion of hospital deaths over this interval. This should be taken under consideration for future planning of end-of-life care in Greece.
