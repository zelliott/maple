The anti-nuclear cross reactivity of the monoclonal anti-actin antibodies M 372/809 was studied in some detail. The reactivity against a number of nuclear constituents was examined in the ELISA test and the capacities of these constituents to block the M 372/809 anti-nuclear and anti-actin reactions were evaluated in indirect immunofluorescence tests against tissue sections and monolayer cultures of fibroblasts and Vero cells. The repetitive polynucleotides polyinosinic and polyguanylic acid and their deoxyanalogues, actin and vimentin, were found to have the antigenic epitope. The epitope was covered or otherwise inactivated in the presence of polycytidylic acid. Using the M 372/809 antibodies as a reagent, carcinoma cell nuclei were found commonly to have an affinity for polyinosinic and polyguanylic acid. This was seldom noted with non-neoplastic cells.
