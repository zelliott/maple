We have traditionally pushed the limits of conservative candidate criteria for heart transplantation. We have been gratified by our results in the aged, the diabetic, and the mortally ill. Our inclusion of patients with malignant disease underscores our philosophy to include patients as candidates for transplantation for whom the procedure has reasonable expectation of success. We report here our early results of heart transplantation in 11 patients with malignant disease. Our survival rate in this group is 100%, and all patients are leading active lives with no evidence of recurrent or metastatic tumor. Immunosuppression protocols were adjusted on an individual basis determined by the chemotherapy dosage, duration, and relation to transplantation. Whenever possible a 1-year disease-free interval after completion of adequate cancer therapy is desired before transplantation.
