We used an antibiotic lock technique with vancomycin in combination with urokinase in 10 consecutive eligible children with Gram-positive catheter-related bacteremia persisting after appropriate intravenous antibiotics. Treatment was successful in sterilizing all colonized central venous catheters, avoiding device removal and delay of further chemotherapy. The antibiotic lock technique may represent a safe and effective therapeutic option in patients with selected, uncomplicated catheter-related bacteremias resistant to systemic antimicrobial therapy, particularly when maintaining a venous access is mandatory.
