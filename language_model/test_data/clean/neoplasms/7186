Long-term studies of large populations of pill users have provided valid data for consideration when evaluating the risks and benefits of pill usage.  Although cardiovascular problems are rare, they may be serious, even fatal.  About 5.7 of 100,000 pillusers in the U. S. die annually due to cardiovascular complications (majority in those over 35 years of age who have other risk factors such as heavy smoking).  The cancer-pill question is still unresolved, but it appears that the pill may interact synergistically in women with multiple sex partners, placing them at greatest risk for development of premalignant cervical diseases.  On the other hand, the pill appears to have a protective effect against cancers of the uterus and ovaries, and against nonmalignant breast tumors and cysts.  Incidence of breast cancer, however, does not appear to be altered.  Benign liver tumor hemorrhages occur in 3 to 4 women/million among those using the pill 5 years or more.  Benefits of pill use include reduction of occurrence of ovarian cysts, benign breast diseases, duodenal ulcers, rheumatoid arthritis and iron deficiency anemia.  It also regulates the menstrual cycle, reduces risk of pelvic inflammatory diseases, lessens the incidence of acne, and even reduce ear wax.  As no contraceptive method is problem-free, patients must be helped in making wise contraceptive decision, and options must include prescription of oral contraceptives.
