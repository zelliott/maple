Ezrin is a cytoskeletal protein involved in tumor growth and invasion. However its prognostic value for survival in patients with solid tumor remains controversial.

Several databases were searched, including Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases. The endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS). The pooled hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated employing fixed- or random-effects models depending on the heterogeneity of the included trials.

Twenty-seven eligible trials involving 4693 patients were ultimately identified. A summary hazard ratio (HR) of all studies and sub-group hazard ratios were calculated. The combined HR suggested that a positive Ezrin expression had an impact on overall survival (OS) [1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60-2.39; P&lt;0.001] in all eligible studies and progress free survival (PFS): (2.30 95% CI 1.0-3.61; P = 0.001). Similar results were also observed in subgroup analysis, according to tumor types, regions, patients' number and publication year.

Our findings suggested that Ezrin protein expression might be a factor for a poor prognosis in patients with solid tumor. So large well-designed prospective studies are now needed to confirm the clinical utility of Ezrin as an independent prognostic marker.
