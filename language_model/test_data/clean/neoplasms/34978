Its well recognized association with numerous diseases plus the limitations of our usual diagnostic tests may occasionally cause difficulty. In the oncology patient there are a number of common medical problems associated with the development of pleural effusion which frequently coexist with the malignancy. Pleural effusion may be a presenting or late sign of cancer, and when recurrent can be a vexing symptomatic problem. Fortunately, an increasing number of effective diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are available which, when judiciously applied, facilitate our approach.
