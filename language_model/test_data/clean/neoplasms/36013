The Community Cancer Control Outreach Program (CCCOP) is a community-academic partnership aimed at developing and implementing a cancer control outreach, research, and training program in Puerto Rico. The CCCOP surveyed 56 partners to assess their awareness, training needs, and use of resources related to evidence-based programs (EBPs). Despite relatively high levels (70 %) of confidence in adopting EBPs, there were low levels of awareness (37 %) and use (25 %) of existing EBPs resources. Respondents' who had used EBPs resources were more likely to have positive beliefs about EBPs than nonusers (p&lt;0.05). Training needs were high among respondents and no significant differences were found between those who had and had not used existing EBPs resources. These findings can guide the development of training tools and technical assistance to increase the use of EBPs for Latino audiences.
