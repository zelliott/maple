The development of therapeutic cancer vaccines is impacted by immunosuppressive elements in the tumor microenvironment. Most immunogenic cancer proteins are "self," therefore, peripheral tolerance contributes substantially to tumor immune escape. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) actively modulates both inflammation and tolerance induction. Combining vaccination with agents that disarm TGFbeta will enhance vaccine efficacy.
