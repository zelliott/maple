The purpose of this article is to familiarize nurses with how new genetic technologies and discoveries are being incorporated into various phases of clinical oncology practice. The scope of this article is broad to provide an overview of the of ways in which cancer prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, treatment, and gene therapy are evolving due to advances in the molecular biology of cancer. We use specific examples to demonstrate the use of genetic information to achieve these objectives and to illustrate principles and strategies that may be applied to a variety of cancers.
