Recent complicated advances towards the blueprinting of the altered molecular networks that lie behind cancer development have paved the way for targeted therapy in cancer. This directed a significant part of the research community to the development of specialized targeted agents, many of which are already available or in clinical trials. The prospect of patient-tailored therapeutic strategies, although very close to becoming a reality also raises the level of complexity of the therapeutic approach. This review summarizes the functions, in vivo expression patterns and aberrations of factors presently targeted or representing potential targets by therapeutic agents, focusing on those implicated in death receptor-induced apoptosis. The authors overview the regulation of these factors and death receptor-induced apoptosis by classical oncogenes (e.g., RAS, MYC, HER2) and their effectors/regulators, most of which are also being targeted. In addition, the importance of orthologic systemic approaches in future patient-tailored therapies are discussed.
