Cancer pain management is expected to become more important because of the growing number of cancer patients in the years to come. To improve cancer pain relief requires understanding and adequate application of the WHO three-step analgesic ladder. Selective cox-2 inhibitors have efficacy in decreasing side effects. Tramadol and a new type of transdermal fentanyl patch that provides 24-hour sustained release of fentanyl is commercially available to alleviate pain. New anti-seizure drugs such as Gabapentin and Pregabalin can be used for neuropathic pain and cancer pain as analgesic adjuvant drugs. They allow simple use than with palliative drugs so far. Palliation of cancer pain requires a multi-discipline approach for intensive management of symptoms.
