Nine cancer patients who were treated at other medical facilities were referred to the Kohka Public Hospital (KPH) to receive further cancer treatment or terminal care. Of these patients, 7 were men and 2 were women, and their mean age was 58.8 years. All the patients had unresectable cancer invasion or metastases. Their Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was either 3 or 4. Six of the 9 patients were first admitted to KPH and then discharged to home care. Two of these 6 patients died at home. The other 4 patients were ultimately re-admitted. The problem was that prognosis was not predicted accurately in some of these patients. Two of the 9 patients were managed by home care and died on days 8 and 13 after the initiation of home care. One patient returned to the previous hospital with the hope of receiving further treatment and palliative care. Patient information had to be available at presentation to all persons involved in the management of the patient and we had to prepare for patient care. Additionally, patients should be informed about serious conditions and poor prognosis without delay.
