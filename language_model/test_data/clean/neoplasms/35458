This article discusses the contribution made by viral infections to the global burden of cancer. The greatest impact of virally-induced cancers is felt in the developing world--in those countries that experience greatest difficulty in meeting the costs of vaccination programmes. Support by wealthier nations for vaccination programmes, organised through the World Health Organization, could have an enormous impact on the global burden of disease and specifically on cancer incidence.
