We now know that genomic instability contributes to cancer. The zebrafish mosaic eye assay developed by George Streisinger takes advantage of the organism's transparency to provide an excellent assay for detecting somatic mutation. This assay allowed us to identify zebrafish mutants with increased frequencies of somatic mutation and spontaneous cancer. Here, we have described details of mutagenesis, the basis and practical use of the mosaic eye assay, and the histological methods used to study genomic instability mutants and cancer susceptibility. These techniques should prove useful to other zebrafish researchers, as they are broadly applicable to many other biological investigations of embryos, larvae, and adult zebrafish.
