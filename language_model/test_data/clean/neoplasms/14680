We have treated eight patients with various tumours producing hCG or AFP with the high risk gestational choriocarcinoma regimen EMA/CO. Marker response was seen in two of three tumours producing AFP and in all of five tumours producing hCG. Three further patients were treated with EpPt/OMB, a regimen used in relapsed germ cell tumors. All responded biochemically. All complete biochemical responses were accompanied by anatomical response. These responses may reflect particular sensitivity in the marker producing tumours and marker measurements would identify this subgroup. These findings do not preclude the possibility that these cytotoxic regimens may have activity against a wide range of solid tumours.
