Based on a result suggesting that the frequency of the Trp-P-2-sensitive persons in patients suffering from cancers at digestive tract is higher than in healthy persons when the sensitive person is defined as the person whose SCE frequency in peripheral lymphocytes induced by in vitro treatment with Trp-P-2 is more than 2 sigma above the mean of the SCEs of healthy population under the identical assay conditions. The possibility to detect the cancer predisposition is discussed.
