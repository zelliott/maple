Mistletoe (Viscum album) was introduced in the treatment of cancer in 1917. Today, extracts from the plant are used in adjuvant cancer therapy mainly as injections. The most important active agents are lectins, which have cytotoxic and immunostimulating effects. Mistletoe extracts have low toxicity. No fatal side effects have been reported. More than 40 clinical studies have been carried out, mainly at the Lukas Klinik in Switzerland and the Ludvig Boltzmann-Institute in Austria. Most of these studies claim that mistletoe has a positive effect, but were of poor methodological design. Therefore, in the light of our own positive experiences, we recommend a randomized multicentre study to evaluate the effect of mistletoe in cancer treatment.
