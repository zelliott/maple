We review the most recent and significant results published in the field of magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), in particular data relating to the use of bacterial magnetosomes in magnetic hyperthermia for the treatment of tumours. We review different methods for cultivating MTB and preparing suspensions of bacterial magnetosomes. As well as the production of magnetosomes, we also review key data on the toxicity of the magnetosomes as well as their heating and anti-tumour efficiencies. The toxicity and efficiency of magnetosomes needs to be understood and the risk-benefit ratio with which to evaluate their use in the magnetic hyperthermia treatment of tumours needs to be measured.
