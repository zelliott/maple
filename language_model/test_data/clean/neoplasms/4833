The increasing complexity of cancer care makes organisation of clinical decision-making one of the key elements in high-quality cancer care. The great number of professionals involved in this disease means that communication and co-ordination among such professionals is of pivotal importance. The prospect of an organised multidisciplinary care is highlighted for its ability to move from a sequential model of care to progress towards an inclusive process led by a multidisciplinary team. Scientific evidence shows that such a perspective contributes to improved survival and quality of life of cancer patients. In the context of highly frequent, costly and clinically complex cancer diseases, the priority is to develop a different approach to its management, based on the expertise of professionals and teams by tumour location. The organisation and management of many hospitals, however, does not generally reflect this dimension. The process of care is based on very rigid hospital services which restrict cross-communication. This hinders a redistribution of responsibilities of the professionals with the greatest potential to improve clinical effectiveness. The present paper shows the difficulty in developing a model of integrated professional cooperation and identifies the different models of implementation of multidisciplinary care, using cancer as an example, in the context of the Spanish National Health System.
