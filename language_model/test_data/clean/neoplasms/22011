Within the framework of the Automated Childhood Cancer Information System (ACCIS), time trend analyses for childhood cancer were performed using data from 33 population-based cancer registries in 15 European countries for the period 1978-1997. The overall incidence rate based on 77,111 cases has increased significantly (P&lt;0.0001), with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 1.1%. The rising trend was observed in all five geographical regions and in the majority of the disease groups (in order of AAPC): soft tissue sarcomas (1.8%), brain tumours, tumours of the sympathetic nervous system, germ-cell tumours, carcinomas, lymphomas, renal tumours, and leukaemias (0.6%). No change was seen in incidence of bone tumours, hepatic tumours and retinoblastoma. The increased incidence can only partly be explained by changes in diagnostic methods and by registration artefacts. The patterns and magnitude of these increases suggest that other factors, e.g. changes in lifestyle and in exposure to a variety of agents, have contributed to the increase in childhood cancer in the recent decades.
