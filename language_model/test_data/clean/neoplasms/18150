Published data regarding the association between the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) T1349G (Asp148Glu) polymorphism and cancer risk show inconclusive results. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, we performed a meta-analysis of 27 published studies that included 12 432 cancer cases and 17 349 controls. We used odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the strength of the associations. The overall results suggested that the variant genotypes were associated with a moderately increased risk of all cancer types (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01-1.18 for TG versus TT; OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.00-1.18 for GG/TG versus TT). In the stratified analyses, the risk remained for studies of colorectal cancer, European populations and population-based studies. Although some modest bias could not be eliminated, this meta-analysis supported that the APE1 T1349G polymorphism is a low-penetrance risk factor for cancer development.
