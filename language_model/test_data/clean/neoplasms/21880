We report on a simple model of spatially extended antitumor system with a fluctuation in growth rate, which can undergo a nonequilibrium phase transition. Three states as excited, subexcited and nonexcited states of a tumor are defined to describe its growth. The multiplicative noise is found to have opposite effects: The positive effect on a nonexcited tumor and the negative effect on an excited tumor.
