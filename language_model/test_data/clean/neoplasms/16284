Prostaglandins are potent lipid molecules that affect key aspects of immunity. The original view of prostaglandins was that they were simply immunoinhibitory. This review focuses on recent findings concerning prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the PGD2 metabolite 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ2, and their divergent roles in immune regulation. We will highlight how these two seminal prostaglandins regulate immunity and inflammation, and play an emerging role in cancer progression. Understanding the diverse activities of these prostaglandins is crucial for the development of new therapies aimed at immune modulation.
