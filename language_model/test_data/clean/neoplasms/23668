The Cancer Information Service (CIS) has been in existence for over 15 years. During that period, lessons have been learned that have been used to increase the effectiveness of the network. This paper lists 12 of those lessons, covering issues such as giving sophisticated medical information; reaching diverse target audiences; using the mass media; developing systems needed for quality assurance, research, and information technology; and nurturing a local-national partnership. The paper also discusses major accomplishments of the program and lists recommendations for meeting the challenges to be faced by the CIS in the future.
