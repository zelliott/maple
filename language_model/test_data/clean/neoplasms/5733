One hundred and nine patients suffering from various malignancies underwent 285 apheresis procedures for PBPC collection. A median of two leukaphereses (range: 2-5) resulted in median numbers of 4.6 x 10(8) MNC/kg, 14.1 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg, and 6.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg. Preleukapheresis peripheral blood CD34+ cells correlated significantly with collected CD34+ cells/kg (r = 0.94; p &lt; 0.0001) and with CFU-GM/kg (r = 0.52; p &lt; 0.0001). A value &gt; 4 x 10(4) CD34+ cells/ml was highly predictive for a collection yield &gt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg harvested by a single leukapheresis. Sixty patients were evaluated for hematologic reconstitution and engrafted in a median time of 10 days for WBC &gt; 1.0 x 10(9)/l (range: 7-21 days), 10 days for ANC &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/l (7-20) and 11 days for PLT &gt; 20 x 10(9)/l (7-62). Reinfused CD34+ cells/kg correlated significantly with hematologic engraftment (r = 0.44-0.52 and p &lt; 0.006-0.001) as well as CFU-GM/kg (r = 0.36-0.44 and p &lt; 0.007-0.001). A progenitor cell dose &gt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg or &gt; 8.0 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg led to a significantly faster recovery for WBC, ANC, and PLT when compared with patients receiving &lt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg or &lt; 8.0 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg. We conclude that rapid hematopoietic engraftment after high-dose therapy and PBPC reinfusion correlates well with a progenitor cell dose &gt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg or &gt; 8.0 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg, and that above a preleukapheresis threshold of 4 x 10(4) CD34+ cells/ml a PBPC autograft containing &gt; 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg can be collected by a single leukapheresis. We suggest that patients recovering from myelosuppression should be monitored for CD34+ cells in serial blood samples to determine the course of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells. This issue will help to define the optimal time point to start apheresis and to predict a PBPC autograft harvested by a single leukapheresis, which will lead to rapid and stable hematopoietic reconstitution following transplantation.
