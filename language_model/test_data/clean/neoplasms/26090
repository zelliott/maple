Purified Colisan produces instantaneous lysis of paramecia and amoebae, and blebbing of paramecia, rat mast cells and ascites tumour cells. Colisan liberates histamine from mast cells. It also suppresses competitively the bradykinin-provoked contraction of the guinea-pig ileum. Most of these effects are not shared by staphylococcus-haemolysin. The results suggest a rapid change of the permeability of the cell membrane as the mechanism of all the diversified biological actions of Colisan.
