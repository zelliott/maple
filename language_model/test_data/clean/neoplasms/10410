The SF-36 Health Survey and the Quality of Life Questionnaire, which was designed for this study, were used. Survivors' scores on most subscales of SF-36 were similar to those of controls, despite some difficulties in their daily activities. They perceived self as more susceptible to health problems, but also more mature and grounded. Generally, they seem to adapt well and focus on the positive aspects of their cancer experience, which enhances the meaning and quality of their life.
