Patients requiring frequent blood sampling and/or frequent intravenous fluid administration can be difficult to manage clinically once peripheral veins become exhausted. Not only can peripheral vascular access be difficult in these patients, but patients begin to dread the attempts at blood sampling and intravenous line placement more than the chemotherapy regimen.At Howard University Hospital, several different types of commercial vascular access devices have been employed that afford reliable and dependable use in cancer patients requiring chemotherapy and blood monitoring. With the increased use of these devices, one unpleasant aspect in the management of the cancer patient, that of repeated attempts at vascular access, can be eliminated.
