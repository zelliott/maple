The number of people living with cancer in the UK is increasing by 3.2% per year. The current system of follow-up is not meeting needs and this will worsen if the number of people living with cancer continues to increase at this rate. Emerging models of aftercare show that care needs should be assessed at key transition points and care plans developed to reflect the levels of risk. We cannot afford to double the workforce to meet future needs, so we will have to do things differently. Over the next two years Macmillan Cancer Support will be piloting four new roles across the UK and will later publish the full evaluation results.
