The purpose of this article is to illustrate the spectrum of common benign intraarticular and extraarticular disorders associated with focal (18)F-FDG uptake in the shoulder and pelvic areas in oncology patients referred for PET/CT.

A wide spectrum of benign musculoskeletal disorders associated with focal FDG uptake may be detected in cancer patients. This incidental uptake usually does not seem to be a clinically significant finding, but it can affect quality of life.
