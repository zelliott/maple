Opportunities for cancer prevention in adolescents range from limitation of sun exposure to the use of human papillomavirus vaccines. Those who develop malignant disease experience longer waiting times for diagnosis and treatment than do children, especially when referred to adult treatment centers, and they are less frequently enrolled in clinical trials. More attention to developmentally appropriate psychological support, enhancement of compliance/adherence, health promotion, and palliative care is needed. Improving cancer surveillance and control in adolescents in North America will require co-ordinated national efforts, involving pediatric and adult health care providers, institutions, and multiple levels of government.
