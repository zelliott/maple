A study was made of the in vitro effects of recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) on breast, prostate, cervix and colon cancers. Tumour growth was assessed using a soft agar clonogenic assay. Stimulation of megakaryocyte numbers was seen in liquid culture following 10 ng/ml PEG-rHuMGDF. The same concentration led to no significant difference in colony-forming efficiencies for 22 of 25 tumour samples. A significant reduction in colony-forming efficiencies was seen for the remaining 3 specimens. These results suggest that PEG-rHuMGDF will not stimulate tumour growth in vivo.
