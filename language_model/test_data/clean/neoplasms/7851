In intraoperative radiation therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation contamination outside the useful field by as much as physically feasible. Additionally, a uniform dose is clinically desirable across the tumor volume. A study of the Medical College of Ohio applicators indicates that the radiation contamination outside the field can be as high as 18% of the central axis dose. The effects of the photon collimator setting on the magnitude and energy of the radiation contamination are discussed and means are presented for reducing this unwanted radiation. The dose nonuniformity across the field is found to be virtually independent of the photon collimator setting and is shown to be mostly due to the transparent applicator wall. The clinical significance of the findings is discussed.
