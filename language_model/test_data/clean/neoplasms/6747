Eight patients with secondary leukemia and specific cytogenetic abnormalities involving inversion of chromosome 16, or translocations between chromosomes 15 and 17, or 8 and 21, are presented. Seven of them (87%) achieved complete remission with chemotherapy. The occurrence of these karyotypes, which is unusual in secondary leukemia, and the favorable response to chemotherapy are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of the disease.
