Carminomycin chemotherapy of the patients with malignant tumors is often complicated with cardiopathy which is sometimes assymptomic and registered only electrocardiographycally. Chemotherapy on the background of reparative regeneration stimulators from the series of synthetic pyrrimidine derivatives, such as methyluracyl for oral use and a soluble salt of methyluracyl for parenteral administration significantly decreased the rate of the cardiotoxic complications and promoted a decrease in their level. The use of methyluracyl and its soluble salt did not decrease the therapeutic effect of carminomycin. Methyluracyl and its soluble salt may be recommended for prophylaxis of cardiotoxic complications in chemotherapy of malignant tumors with carminomycin.
