Over the period 1986 to 1989, 53 cancer patients were identified with catheter-related Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Septic thrombosis was diagnosed in 12 (23%) patients and was suspected in another 3 (6%). Of the 12 patients, five developed deep-seated infections (septic emboli, endocarditis, meningitis, abscess), compared with 2 of the 38 other patients with no septic thrombosis (p &lt; 0.01). Fever persisted for more than three days after antibiotic initiation in 52% of the patients with complications (septic thrombosis and/or deep-seated infections), compared with 19% of those without complications (p &lt; 0.02). Of the three patients with complications who were treated for 14 days with intravenous antistaphylococcal antibiotics, two relapsed; in contrast, all of the nine patients with complications who were treated for more than 14 days (mean 4 weeks) were cured, and none relapsed (p &lt; 0.05). Of the nine patients with complications who were treated with a long course of therapy, only one required surgery. The possibility of septic thrombosis and/or deep-seated infections should be considered in all cancer patients with catheter-related Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and if present, the condition should be treated with appropriate intravenous antibiotics for at least four weeks.
