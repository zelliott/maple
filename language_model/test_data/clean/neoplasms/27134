Habitual physical activity and exercise are associated with the mortality rate and significantly contribute to the prevention and/or amelioration of aging-related diseases including metabolic disorders, atherosclerosis, cancer, and dementia. Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases that have emerged as key regulators of many functions including metabolism, cell growth and apoptosis, as well as control of the aging process. Recent studies have demonstrated that some types of exercise affect the expression and activity of sirtuins in several tissues. This review focuses on the effects of exercise on sirtuins and also their putative role with regard to the effects of exercise on preventing aging- related diseases.
