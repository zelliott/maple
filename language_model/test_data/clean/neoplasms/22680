Recent advances in understanding the role of eukaryotic translation initiator factor 4E (eIF4E) in tumorigenesis and cancer progression have generated significant interest in therapeutic agents that indirectly or directly target aberrant activation of eIF4E in cancer. Here, we address the general function of eIF4E in translation initiation and cancer, present evidence supporting its role in cancer initiation and progression, and highlight emerging therapeutics that efficiently target hyperactivated eIF4E. In doing so, we also highlight the major differences between these therapeutics that may influence their mechanism of action.
