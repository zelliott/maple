Treating cancer by targeting its vasculature is a recent conceptual revolution. The use of newly discovered potent antiangiogenic factors has confirmed the anti-growth and anti-metastatic efficiency of anti-angiogenic therapy in a variety of experimental solid tumour models. Using gene transfer technique to deliver anti-angiogenic molecules in vivo is becoming a widely accepted new approach. This review summarizes the biological basis, current situation and development trends of this new therapy, as well as its promising perspectives in cancer treatment.
