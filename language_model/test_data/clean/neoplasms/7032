Lysosomes, with their arsenal of degradative enzymes are increasingly becoming an area of interest in the field of oncology. The changes induced in this compartment upon transformation are numerous and whereas most are viewed as pro-oncogenic the same processes also render cancer cells susceptible to lysosomal death pathways. This review will provide an overview of the pro- and anti-oncogenic potential of this compartment and how these might be exploited for cancer therapy, with special focus on lysosomal death pathways.
