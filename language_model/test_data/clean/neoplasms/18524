Vascular angiogenesis is regulated by a number of cytokines of which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A/and its receptor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) play an indisputable role. Similarly lymphangiogenesis is regulated by VEGF-C and its receptor VEGFR3. Currently for treating vasculogenesis diseases such as proliferative retinopathies and cancer, a number of anti-VEGF-A therapies are approved for clinical use. Although clinical efficacies achieved are remarkable, they are found to be transitory in nature, followed by restoration of anti-VEGF therapy resistant angiogenesis. Recently the regulatory role of VEGF-C in initiating and potentiating neo-angiogenesis has been uncovered. Although the interactive nature of VEGF-A and C is known, the dynamics of their expression under knockdown conditions is yet to be established. Here in this study we have utilized siRNA to knockdown both VEGF-A and C either independently or in combination. Analysis of VEGF-A and C expression (only in cancer cell lines MCF7, A549 and H460 but not in the ocular cell line RPE19) has shown enhanced expression levels of VEGF-C with increase in knockdown of VEGF-A. However, VEGF-C knockdown has resulted in decreased expression levels of VEGF-A both in RPE19 and MCF7 cells in a dose dependent manner. In addition, VEGF-C knockdown also resulted in decreased expression of RhoA. Further, knockdown studies of RhoA even with supplementation of VEGF-C or A has resulted in decreased endothelial cell proliferation and stress fiber formation, indicating that VEGF-C does promote angiogenesis via RhoA mediated pathway.
