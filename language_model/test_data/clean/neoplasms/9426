Complementary and alternative medical practices (CAM) are being used by increasing numbers of children with cancer.

Recent surveys report CAM use prevalence rates of 24-90% in children with cancer. Interest in supporting children through the side effects or stress of conventional treatment has been described as one of the major motivating factors for the use of CAM therapies. Research is difficult secondary to the complexity of the therapies and lack of standardization. However, several research studies investigating CAM therapies for supportive care in children with cancer are ongoing. Information on several studies in progress through the Children's Oncology Group and other institutions will be reviewed.

The progress made in the development of these studies demonstrates that CAM therapies can be investigated for their supportive care roles in the therapy of children with cancer.
