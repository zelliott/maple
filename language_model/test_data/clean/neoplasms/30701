Since the first successful procedure in 1954 kidney transplantation has become a standard therapy of end stage renal disease. The knowledge of immunoregulation and immune response of the body has enabled people to recognize acute rejection of organs. HLA-testing and organ exchange on basis of HLA-compatibility are extremely important for a successful kidney transplantation. A shortage of organs is limiting the further increase of transplantations. Chronic rejection is in most cases the reason for late graft failure. Further investigations to develop new immunosuppressive drugs and to clarify immunological processes underlying chronic rejections are necessary in the future.
