In this qualitative study the self-care practices of children with cancer and the dependent-care practices of their parents were examined. These practices were organized according to self-care requisites presented in Orem's theory of self-care. The intent of this examination was to determine the competency of participants, identify where self-care deficits occurred, and decide what nursing interventions were needed. A purposive sample of 9 children and 18 parents were interviewed to determine their experiences with cancer. Content analysis was conducted using a deductive approach to code and analyze the data according to Orem's universal, developmental, and health-deviation self-care requisites. NVivo qualitative analysis software was employed for data analysis. The findings of this study revealed that participants were competent agents, performing many practices in the areas of universal and developmental self-care requisites. Participants performed far fewer practices regarding health-deviation self-care requisites and interferences with development, however, indicating a need for supportive-educative nursing interventions in these areas. Future research should examine participants' operations and specific nursing interventions to support those operations.
