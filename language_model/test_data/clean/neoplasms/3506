Src tyrosine kinase is a critical signal transducer that modulates a wide variety of cellular functions. Misregulation of Src leads to cell transformation and cancer. Heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are another group of signaling molecules that transduce signals from cell-surface receptors to generate physiological responses. Recently, it was discovered that G alpha s and G alpha i could directly stimulate Src family tyrosine kinase activity. This novel regulation of Src tyrosine kinase by G proteins provides insights into the adenylyl cyclase-independent signaling mechanisms involved in ligand-induced receptor desensitization, internalization and other physiological processes.
