A mail survey of 30,650 dentists and 30,547 chairside assistants grouped according to occupational exposure to inhalation anesthetic and sedatives in the dental operatory indicated increased general health problems and reproductive difficulties among respondents exposed to anesthetics. For male dentists who were heavily exposed to anesthetics, the increase in liver disease was 1.7-fold, kidney disease was 1.2-fold, and neurological disease was 1.9-fold. For wives of male dentists who were heavily exposed to anesthetics, the increase in spontaneous abortion rate was 1.5-fold. Among female chairside assistants who were heavily exposed to anesthetics, the increase in liver disease was 1.6-fold, kidney disease was 1.7-fold, and neurological disease was 2.8-fold. The increase in spontaneous abortion rate among assistants who were heavily exposed was 2.3-fold. Cancer rates in women heavily exposed to inhalation anesthetics were increased 1.5-fold but this finding was not statistically significant (P = .06). Separate analysis of the data for disease rates and birth difficulties by type of inhalation anesthetic indicates that in both dentists and chairside assistants chronic exposure to nitrous oxide alone is associated with an increase rate of adverse response.
