In 38 preoperative patients the production of urea was estimated and cell-mediated immunity was measured. Ten patients were catabolic and had negative skin tests, all of them were inoperable. Fifteen patients were catabolic and had positive skin tests, five patients were inoperable. Twelve patients were not catabolic and had positive skin tests, two were inoperable. One female patient was not catabolic and had negative skin tests, but was operable. The catabolic state can be assessed by the urea production rate and one can give prognostic and trophotherapeutical indications in correlation with the degree of cellular immunity.
