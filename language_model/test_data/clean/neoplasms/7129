The potential role of antibodies and T lymphocytes in the eradication of cancer has been demonstrated in numerous animal models and clinical trials. In the last decennia new strategies have been developed for the use of tumor-specific T cells and antibodies in cancer therapy. Effective anti-tumor immunotherapy requires the identification of suitable target antigens. The expression of tumor-specific antigens has been extensively studied for most types of adult tumors. Pediatric patients should be excellent candidates for immunotherapy since their immune system is more potent and flexible as compared to that of adults. So far, these patients do not benefit enough from the progresses in cancer immunotherapy, and one of the reasons is the paucity of tumor-specific antigens identified on pediatric tumors. In this review we discuss the current status of cancer immunotherapy in children, focusing on the identification of tumor-specific antigens on pediatric solid tumors.
