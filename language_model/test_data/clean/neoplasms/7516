Biomaterials have many uses in medicine and surgery but success in their use is often difficult to achieve. In this paper some of the deatures that contribute to the success or failure of biomaterials are discussed in relation to a hypothetical implant situation. The phenomena of biomaterial-tissue interfacial reactions, wear, prosthesis instability, infection, hypersensitivity and carcinogenesis are considered. Emphasis is given both to the causes and clinical significance of these phenomena and interpreted in terms of the furture prospects for the biomaterials.
