Genetic instability is the driving force of the malignant progression of cancer cells. Recently, replication stress has attracted much attention as a source of genetic instability that gives rise to an accumulation of mutations during the lifespan of individuals. However, the molecular details of the process are not fully understood. Here, recent progress in understanding how genetic alterations accumulate at telomeres will be reviewed. In particular, two aspects of telomere replication will be discussed in this context, covering conventional semi-conservative replication, and DNA synthesis by telomerase plus the C-strand fill-in reactions. Although these processes are seemingly telomere-specific, I will emphasize the possibility that the molecular understanding of the telomere events may shed light on genetic instability at other genetic loci in general.
