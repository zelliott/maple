The immune status and state of health of individuals were estimated by luminescence microspectral analysis of immunocompetent blood cells were estimated. The approach consists in the computer analysis of the distribution of luminescent characteristics of nuclear blood cells stained with acridine orange on a phase plane in the coordinates of intensities of green and red fluorescence bands. The method provides information on the tension of the immune system and types of pathological processes. The following pathological processes can be identified: acute, progressing and prolonged chronic pathologies, neuroendocrine and oncologic diseases, allergic and autoimmune disorders.
