Patient-specific factors and knowledge of drug therapy direct CS and analgesia practices for oncology patients undergoing interventional radiologic techniques. Nurses caring for oncology patients in this setting must understand the effects of cancer on anatomic structures and physiologic functions. Variability in responses to pain and drug therapy observed among oncology patients necessitates the need for highly individualized plans of care that sometimes deviate from standard CS and analgesia procedures. Therefore, sedation and analgesia policies that apply to oncology patients must include flexible dose ranges for drugs such as opioids and benzodiazepines and guidelines for titrating these drugs to optimal effects. Although frequent assessments of pain using subjective reports remain the most valid indicators of adequate pain control, familiarity with radiologic interventions and responses of anatomic structures to various types of noxious stimuli allows the nurse to anticipate aspects of procedures known to be painful. Attention to symptom management both during and after the procedure is critical because patients with progressive cancer may present with significant physical and psychological alterations. In summary, CS and analgesia practices for oncology patients are based on sound pharmacologic principles and influenced by myriad factors that can be considered only in the context of the patient's own uniqueness and experiences.
