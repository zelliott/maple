Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is a major ingredient of the dried extract of licorice roots; its antitumor activity is low compared to other members of the triterpenoic family. For example, oleanolic acid, betulin or betulinic acid are more cytotoxic with a pronounced activity for tumor cells. GA, however, is easily to earn, cheap and shows apoptotic effects on tumor cells--like the other triterpenoic acids. These facts bring GA and derivatives in the focus of our scientific interest. Here we tried to improve the poor cytotoxicity of GA by simple derivatization. Thus, we selected various glutamyl and aspartyl substituents for the synthesis of C(3) esters of GA methyl ester. A short (3-5 steps) synthesis was elaborated that allowed to access more effective compounds. One compound, methyl 3Î² 3-(O-benzyl-L-glutamyl)-11-oxo-olean-12-en-30-oate (5), having a glutamyl substituent with a benzyl protected side chain showed up to 67-fold higher cytotoxicity and an up to 140-fold better selectivity towards tumor cells than parent GA. All compounds were evaluated by a sulforhodamine B assay as well as by a trypan blue test and extra acridine orange/ethidium bromide tests for apoptosis.
