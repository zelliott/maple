The multidrug resistance (MDR) associated 170kd glycoprotein (P170) is expressed at a low level in normal and malignant cells, but in the latter it becomes frequently overexpressed after chemotherapy. This study evaluated P170 expression in normal blood mononuclear cells after and during cancer chemotherapy.

P170 was detected by immunocytochemistry with two monoclonal antibodies (MRK-16 and JSB-1).

P170 expression was low in all samples before, during and after chemotherapy.

Cancer chemotherapy did not enhance P170 expression in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The mechanisms enhancing P170 expression are likely to be more operative in tumor cells than in normal cells.
