Second Life (SL) is emerging as a repository of health information. The purpose of this study was to determine the number of places and groups that offer specific health information in SL. A retrospective analysis of SL places and groups was conducted for cancer. Findings indicate that more cancer information is available from groups than specific places in SL. All current and future cancer information will need to be evaluated for reliability and efficacy.
