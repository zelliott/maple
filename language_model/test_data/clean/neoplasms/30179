This study aims to compare the emotional indicators and depressive symptom levels of 6- to 12-year-old children with and without cancer. The sample included 20 children with cancer and 20 healthy children of similar ages and gender. Data were collected by using the Child Introduction Form, Children's Depression Inventory, the Human Figure Drawing test, and children's drawings. The results showed that the depressive symptom levels of children with cancer were significantly higher than those of healthy children. Impulsivity, mistrust, and anger were observed significantly more in children with cancer (P &lt; .05). Although anxiety was equal in the two groups, shyness was observed more in the cancer group, though the difference was not significant (P &gt; .05). The emotional indicators of both groups of children did not have an effect on their depression scores.
