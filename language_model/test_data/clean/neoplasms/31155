There are numerous psychosocial problems with home care for terminal cancer patients. We studied one case from the viewpoint of providing support for cancer patients and their families. Psychosocial problems are important for the life of cancer patients and their families. The cancer diagnosis and the terminal stage have different levels of psychosocial concerns. We must consider effective intervention with such psychosocial support. (1) The team delivery of health care in oncology is more crucial than ever. (2) Social work plays a key role. (3) We should strive to understand the roles of other members of teams. (4) Members of a support team should take turns in providing care according to the psychosocial conditions of the patients. (5) Sympathy and a broad social outlook are required of medical staff members.
