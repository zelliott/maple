Implantable vascular access devices (IVADs), or implantable ports, have been used for patients with cancer for more than 20 years. Although these devices have greatly improved infusion access for this population of patients, complications may still occur. Nurses working with oncology patients who have IVADs must be aware of possible problems for these patients, as well as the importance of early assessment and intervention. The diagnosis of cancer and potential treatments for this disease may make these patients at higher risk for complications associated with the use of IVADS.
