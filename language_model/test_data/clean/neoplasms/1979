Various human tumor tissues contain different growth factors. In some cases progression of tumors is paralleled by elevated levels of these substances in blood or in tumor tissue. There is evidence that these growth promoting peptides might stimulate tumor growth. The growth of most tumors was associated with insulin-like substances (MW 45,000). We isolated and purified a substance immunologically cross-reactive with insulin (SICRI) from human melanoma. We found the molecular weight of affinity purified SICRI to be approximately 120,000. Our in vitro experiments with human renal carcinoma cells and growth factors suggest an important role of these molecules in tumor progression.
