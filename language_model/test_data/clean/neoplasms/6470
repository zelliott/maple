With respect to F344/DuCrj and Slc: Wistar rats, both widely used in Japan, it was found that there is a close similarity in the changes of body weights and survival rates, and in the organ distribution and incidence of spontaneous tumors. To examine the degree of homozygosity between F344 and Slc: Wistar strains, tumor transplantation and skin grafting were performed. The bladder carcinomas that originated from F344/DuCrj rats grew subcutaneously in the other F344 strains and Slc: Wistar rats, but did not grow in the other Wistar-derived strains. The skin grafts between F344/DuCrj or F344/NSlc and Slc: Wistar rats were accepted, but those between F344/DuCrj or Slc: Wistar and the other Wistar-derived strains were rejected. These results suggest that Slc: Wistar rats cannot be distinguished genetically from the F344 strain of rats.
