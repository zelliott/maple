Lichen sclerosus is a chronic skin condition that most commonly affects the anogenital skin of postmenopausal women. The aetiology of the condition is multifactorial. The most common presenting symptom is itching. Lichen sclerosus has a characteristic appearance. Diagnosis is made with vulvar biopsy. Treatment is important and the regimen most often includes topical corticosteroid ointments. Lifetime surveillance of the skin is imperative because of the increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in patients with lichen sclerosus.
