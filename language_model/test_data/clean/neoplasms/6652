The influence of surgical stress on the natural killer (NK) activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients with carcinoma of the lung or gastrointestinal system was studied. The peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patients showed a marked decrease in NK activity against K-562 cells as target cells 1-2 days after surgery. The activity remained lowered for 2 weeks after thoractomy and for 1 week after laparotomy. No appreciable suppression of NK activity was observed with normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes preincubated with postoperative patient sera. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained postoperatively from patients lost NK activity after ultraviolet irradiation, without any detectable loss of viability. Such irradiated mononuclear cells showed inhibition of NK activity after a 24-hour preincubation with peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal subjects. Similar suppressive activity was demonstrable in a fraction of mononuclear cells with adhesiveness to plastic petri dishes, while non-adherent cells had no such activity. When added immediately to the cytotoxicity assay system without the 24-hour preincubation, patient mononuclear cells caused no inhibition of NK activity, whereas adherent cells from normal subjects enhanced NK activity. The findings seems to indicate that, following surgical stress, plastic dish-adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells become deprived of NK helper activity and exert suppression, thus causing postoperative depression of NK activity.
