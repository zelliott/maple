Twenty-five years after the publication of the first report on gene transfer in vitro in cultured cells by the means of electric pulse delivery, reversible cell electroporation for gene transfer and gene therapy (DNA electrotransfer) is at a crossroad in its development. Present knowledge on the effects of cell exposure to appropriate electric field pulses, particularly at the level of the cell membrane, is reported here as an introduction to the large range of applications described in this book. The importance of the models of electric field distribution in tissues and of the correct choice of electrodes and applied voltages is highlighted. The mechanisms involved in DNA electrotransfer, which include cell electropermeabilization and DNA electrophoresis, are also surveyed. The feasibility of electric pulse for gene transfer in humans is discussed taking into account that electric pulse delivery is already regularly used for localized drug delivery in the treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous solid tumors by electrochemotherapy. Because recent technological developments have made DNA electrotransfer more efficient and safer, this nonviral gene therapy approach is now ready to reach the clinical stage. A good understanding of DNA electrotransfer principles and a respect for safe procedures will be key elements for the successful future transition of DNA electrotransfer to the clinics.
