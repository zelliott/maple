Anemia represents a common finding in cancer patients, especially at an advanced stage. Anemia has an impact on the quality of life and at the same time seems to markedly limit the disease control that can be achieved with radiotherapy. The results of a series of clinical studies published in the last decade allow some general observations: 1. the administration of erythropoietin, especially if associated to ferrous sulfate is able to increase hemoglobulin levels in cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy (combined with concomitant chemotherapy); 2. erythropoietin stimulation of hemoglobin in anemia decreases the need for blood transfusion in cancer patients; 3. tumor response to radiation therapy appears to be enhanced by erythropoietin-induced hemoglobulin increase. Further clinical studies are required for assessment of indications, identification of optimal administration modalities, cost-analysis of this promising therapy for patients undergoing radiation therapy.
