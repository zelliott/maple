The aims of this paper are twofold: to closely study tobacco and alcohol consumption among the adult population in the Autonomous Community of Murcia and to observe the relation between such habits and the morbidity of the population polled.

We study 1,128 patients admitted to the Virgen de la Arrixaca Hospital, the centre of reference in this Community, in 1992. The survey is done in all the hospital departments on patients and eighteen years and over.

37.4% of the persons polled are smokers, and 67.4% consume alcohol. The prevalence of smokers decreases with age: 57.4% of the patients aged under 30 years are smokers, compared to 14.7% of those aged over 70 years. The prevalence of tobacco-related malignant tumours is 0.6% in the non-smokers, and 8.0% in the smokers and ex-smokers with a consumption of more than 10 cigarettes/day. The prevalence of malignant tumours in the digestive organs is 7.9% in patients consuming alcohol daily and 1.8% in non-drinkers.

We note a decrease in tobacco consumption in the patient population, which is in line with the decrease in tobacco consumption in the general population of Spain as stated in the literature. Wine is the preferred drink of the study population overall, and beer in those aged under fifty years.
