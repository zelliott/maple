Extracellular release of acid thiol proteinase activity by prereplicative and neoplastic epithelial cells was studied in serum-free, chemically defined media (CDM) in vitro. Cells isolated from urinary bladder of male bullfrogs and endometrium of ovariectomized rats each showed preferential secretion of cathepsin B-like (CB) activity within 30 min after exposure to carcinogenic nitrosamines (5 X 10(-4) M) or to mitogenic estrogen 1 X 10(-9) M), respectively. In contrast, release of such proteinase, and stimulation of cell proliferation were far less extensive in rat preputial gland cells treated with estradiol-17 beta. Striking secretion of CB was characteristic of neoplastic, but not noncancerous, epithelial cells from human ectocervix. Neoplastic cells with divergent rates of cell-to-cell aggregation were separated by a filtration method. Those cells with high rates of intercellular aggregation also exhibited higher rates of cell proliferation in CDM, as well as in soft gels, and a greater level of CB release than corresponding cancer cells with a relatively low degree of intercellular adhesion. Brief treatment of neoplastic cervical epithelial cells with liposomes containing entrapped leupeptin, a potent inhibitor of CB activity, elicited a sharp reduction in both cellular thiol proteinase activity and cell growth as compared to appropriate controls. These data indicate that mobilization of lysosomal CB activity in prereplicative and malignant cells may play a significant role in the promotion of cell proliferation.
