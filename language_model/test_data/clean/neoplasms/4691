This study aimed to determine whether cancer patients report different information-seeking behaviors (ISBs), investigate why they searched for information, and determine the relationship between their ISBs and their socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics. The authors also explored the relationship between ISB and participation in the medical decision-making process as well as the patients' health state.

A sample of 4270 French cancer survivors aged 18 or older was interviewed at 2 years following diagnosis. Rather than deciding a priori who should be considered an information seeker, the authors chose to statistically define the different ISBs using cluster analysis.

The authors identified 4 distinct profiles: Stereotypical high-information seekers and acquainted seekers are generally highly educated. They search for information due to their own motivation or because they are close to the medical profession. Constrained information seekers are characterized by a low socioeconomic status. They perceive themselves as "dropouts" of the health care system. Finally, the general information seekers did not systematically resort to any specific ISB. The authors show that after adjustment, belonging to a specific ISB was associated with the likelihood of participating in the medical decision-making process and, more surprisingly, with health state.

A key finding of this study is that social disparities are significantly associated with the different ISBs. If these relationships are found in other samples, it would further support the need for medical teams to pay more attention to patients with lower levels of education, particularly in health care systems that have acknowledged equality as a founding principle. The clusters determined in this study offer a potential theoretical framework that can be used in future studies.
