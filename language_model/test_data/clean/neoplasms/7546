The frequency of various cancers among Indian immigrants in Kenya was compared to corresponding data among native Africans and Indians in the regions of India from which most of the studied population originally migrated. The Kenyan Indians do not have the cancer pattern of their home country nor do they have the cancer pattern of indigenous Africans. They have instead, like Europeans and North Americans, a higher risk of cancer of the lung, breast and the large intestine. It is suggested that this is related to enbironmental factors and variations in living habits.
