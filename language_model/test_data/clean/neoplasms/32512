Post-translational modification of proteins is an important regulatory event. Numerous biologically active peptides that play an essential role in cancerogenesis contain an evolutionary conserved proline residue as a proteolytic-processing regulatory element. Proline-specific proteases could therefore be viewed as important "check-points". Limited proteolysis of such peptides may lead to quantitative but, importantly, due to the change of receptor preference, also qualitative changes of their signaling potential. Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV, EC 3.4.14.5, identical with CD26) was for many years believed to be a unique cell membrane protease cleaving X-Pro dipeptides from the N-terminal end of peptides and proteins. Subsequently, a number of other molecules were discovered, exhibiting various degree of structural homology and DPP-IV-like enzyme activity, capable of cleaving similar set of substrates. These comprise for example, seprase, fibroblast activation protein alpha, DPP6, DPP8, DPP9, attractin, N-acetylated-alpha-linked-acidic dipeptidases I, II and L, quiescent cell proline dipeptidase, thymus-specific serine protease and DPP IV-beta. It is tempting to speculate their potential participation on DPP-IV biological function(s). Disrupted expression and enzymatic activity of "DPP-IV activity and/or structure homologues" (DASH) might corrupt the message carried by their substrates, promoting abnormal cell behavior. Consequently, modulation of particular enzyme activity using e.g. DASH inhibitors, specific antibodies or DASH expression modification may be an attractive therapeutic concept in cancer treatment. This review summarizes recent information on the interactions between DASH members and their substrates with respect to their possible role in cancer biology.
