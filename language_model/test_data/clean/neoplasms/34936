Relief for the often complex suffering of far advanced disease is part of the therapeutic challenge of oncology. Effective practice has been shown to be possible in a variety of settings, including the patient's own home, but a limited number of special centres have been essential resources for research and teaching. Basic principles have been defined and are being interpreted in many situations and cultures. With the fundamental aim of enabling patients to live to the maximum potential in physical ability, relationships and personal choice, they include family support both before and after a patient's death. Symptom control must be the first essential, carried out by an experienced clinical team working together with its nursing and other professional members. Continuity of care will be made possible by co-operation with a Home Care Programme. Research and analysis will give an objective basis enabling such a team to meet the demands of the multi-disciplinary teaching that has been a major aim of the hospice movement. A search for meaning should be recognised in both patients and staff.
