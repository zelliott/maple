Vascular endothelium is the layer of cells that line blood vessels and serve as the primary barrier between the blood and the tissues. These cells play many important functions such as regulation of the vascular tone, blood flow and pressure control, maintaining the balance between thrombosis and fibrinolysis, participation in immune system reactions and new blood vessels formation. Disturbance in any of these functions may contribute to the development of different diseases such as for e.g. hypertension, atherosclerosis and deep vein thrombosis, as well as cancer.
