B cells have recently been appreciated as paracrine mediators of solid tumor development. Their ability to influence various hallmarks of cancer development, aside from antigen presentation, can be attributed to the diversity of soluble mediators they express, including cytokines and immunoglobulins, that can act directly and indirectly on the diversity of leukocyte subsets that infiltrate developing tumors, evolving neoplastic cells, as well as select T cell populations in secondary lymphoid organs and within tumor stroma. Herein, we review the literature supporting these interactions and discuss novel approaches to ameliorate protumoral B cell effects for anti-cancer therapy.
