Perfusion computed tomography (CTP) has shown great potential in diagnosing tumours and evaluating and predicting treatment response and has been the subject of numerous experimental and clinical studies. Its increasing availability and simplicity allow it to be performed alongside morphological imaging to complete the evaluation of neoplastic lesions. The aim of this paper is to describe our personal experience and review the literature on the applications of CTP in tumours of different body regions, with particular regard to fields of development for new research. Increased clinical application is desirable, especially in relation to a wider use of antiangiogenic drugs. Additional and ideally multicentre studies are necessary to define the role of this technique.
