Sensitive, specific methods have been developed that allow quantitative measurements of the metabolites of carcinogen metabolites and of DNA and protein adducts in humans exposed occupationally, environmentally and endogenously to genotoxic agents. The interrelationship between exposure to carcinogens, host risk factors and the responses of biomarkers has been examined in cross-sectional, ecological and case-control studies which provided new insights into the causes of cancer and the mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The identification of hitherto unknown DNA-reactive chemicals formed in the human body from dietary precursors and of carcinogenic components of complex mixtures has increased the possibility of establishing causal relationships in etiology. The identification of individuals and subgroups heavily exposed to carcinogens has led to the development of measures for avoiding or decreasing exposure to carcinogenic risk factors. New, ultrasensitive methods for measuring DNA adducts allow the quantification and structural elucidation of specific DNA damage in humans arising from oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation (LPO), which have been found to be the driving forces in several human malignancies. Background DNA damage in "unexposed" individuals has been shown unequivocally to be due to LPO products, and a significant interindividual variation in adduct levels has been shown in individuals with comparable exposure to carcinogens. Thus, pharmacogenetic variants with higher susceptibility to carcinogenic insults, due to genetic polymorphism in xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, have been characterized by a combination of genotyping and measurements of macromolecular adducts. Dosimetry has been used in human studies to evaluate the efficacy of interventions with chemopreventive agents like ascorbic acid, dietary phenols and green tea. Advances in the application of selected biomarkers in human studies are reviewed and illustrated by examples from the author's research conducted during the past two decades.
