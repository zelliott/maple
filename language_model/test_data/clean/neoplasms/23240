With the recent development of integrated positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) scanners, new possibilities for quantitative molecular imaging of cancer are realized. However, the practical advantages and potential clinical benefits of the ability to record PET and MRI data simultaneously must be balanced against the substantial costs and other requirements of such devices. In this review, we highlight several of the key areas where integrated PET-MRI measurements, obtained simultaneously, are anticipated to have a significant impact on clinical and/or research studies. These areas include the use of MR-based motion corrections and/or a priori anatomical information for improved reconstruction of PET data, improved arterial input function characterization for PET kinetic modeling, the use of dual-modality contrast agents, and patient comfort and practical convenience. For widespread acceptance, a compelling case could be made if the combination of quantitative MRI and specific PET biomarkers significantly improves our ability to assess tumor status and response to therapy, and some likely candidates are now emerging. We consider the relative advantages and disadvantages afforded by PET-MRI and summarize current opinions and evidence as to the likely value of PET-MRI in the management of cancer.
