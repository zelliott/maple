Over the past decade, marked progress in support techniques has been made in patients with cancer. In addition to improvement in pain and infection control, the ability to control chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting has improved greatly. Studies have demonstrated that serotonin type 3 receptors play an important role in mediating this side-effect. Several new agents, with excellent efficacy and few side effects have now been developed and are available clinically. Results of trials with these agents, and with newer investigative approaches are discussed.
