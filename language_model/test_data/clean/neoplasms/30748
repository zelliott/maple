To determine the potential efficacy and dose-limiting toxicity of taxotere, a hemisynthetic inhibitor of tubulin depolymerization.

Fifty-eight patients were administered taxotere in this phase I clinical trial as a 6-hour or a 2-hour infusion repeated every 21 days. Forty patients received 181 courses on the 6-hour infusion schedule, and 18 patients received 105 courses on the 2-hour infusion schedule.

Neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity on both schedules. The maximally tolerated dose was 100 mg/m2 on the 6-hour infusion schedule and 115 mg/m2 on the 2-hour infusion schedule. The most prominent nonhematologic toxicities included mucositis (more prominent on the 6-hour infusion schedule), transient rash (more common on the 2-hour infusion schedule), and alopecia. Hypersensitivity reactions were seen in five patients. There was no evidence of neurotoxicity or cardiotoxicity. One partial response was noted on the 6-hour infusion schedule (one in refractory breast cancer) and four additional partial responses were noted on the 2-hour infusion schedule (two in adenocarcinoma of the lung, one in refractory breast cancer, one in cholangio-carcinoma). In addition, 10 patients had minor responses. Pharmacokinetic studies showed plasma concentrations of taxotere declined in a triexponential manner, with a terminal half-life of 11.8 hours.

The recommended starting dose for phase II taxotere trials is 100 mg/m2 administered as a 2-hour infusion, repeated every 21 days. Taxotere is a promising antineoplastic agent worthy of extensive phase II testing in patients with a variety of malignancies.
