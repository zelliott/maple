Due to numerical, socio-psychological, economic and geographic factors, not all tumor patients can be followed exclusively by specialized oncologic institutions. Institutionalized, well organized cooperation between private physician, community hospital and regional cancer center is mandatory in affording every patient speedy and adequate investigation and treatment. One model of regional oncologic cooperation which has been realized successfully for some years now in Eastern Switzerland is presented. Decentralized oncologic consulting clinics open for in- and out-patients are the cornerstone of this system, which guarantees the same quality of management for the tumor patient in hospital or at home and requires the active participation of family doctors.
