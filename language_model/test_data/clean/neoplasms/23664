Morphogenesis of tumour lesions produced by photodynamic therapy (PDT) includes a direct cytotoxic effect, lesions due to the disturbance of microcirculation, lesions by the activated inflammatory cells and cytokines released by these cells (tumour necrosis factor, histamine, prostaglandins). Ultrastructurally, the cell death is due to the cell membrane and nucleus apparatus damage by active oxygen forms and biomolecular radicals.
