The ubiquitin-proteasome system is an important regulator of cell growth and apoptosis. The potential of specific proteasome inhibitors to act as novel anti-cancer agents is currently under intensive investigation. Several proteasome inhibitors exert anti-tumour activity in vivo and potently induce apoptosis in tumour cells in vitro, including those resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. By inhibiting NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, proteasome inhibitors may also prevent angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo and further increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to apoptosis. Proteasome inhibitors also exhibit some level of selective cytotoxicity to cancer cells by preferentially inducing apoptosis in proliferating or transformed cells or by overcoming deficiencies in growth-inhibitory or pro-apoptotic molecules. High expression of oncogene products like c-Myc also makes cancer cells more susceptible to proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitors varies between cell types but often occurs following an initial accumulation of short-lived proteins such as p53, p27, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members or activation of the stress kinase JNK. These initial events often result in a perturbation of mitochondria with concomitant release of cytochrome c and activation of the Apaf-1 containing apoptosome complex. This results in activation of the apical caspase-9 followed by activation of effector caspases-3 and -7, which are responsible for the biochemical and morphological changes associated with apoptosis.
