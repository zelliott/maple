The metabolic changes in cancer cachexia appear to be mediated by a complex network of proinflammatory cytokines, neuroendocrine hormones, neurotransmitters, eicosanoids, and tumor-derived factors produced by the body in response to the tumor and by the tumor itself. The relative importance of these various mediator pathways in relation to either the anorexia or hypermetabolism associated with weight loss in cancer remains to be fully elucidated. Our current understanding suggests that proinflammatory mediators may indeed be a valid target for therapeutic intervention. Trials attempting to modify the inflammatory response to cancer with the hope of improving appetite and reversing catabolism and perhaps thereby improving qualityof life and survival are currently underway.
