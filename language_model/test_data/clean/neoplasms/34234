Peptichemio (PTC) was utilized in various advanced and disseminated tumors in children. With the schedule that was used, toxicity was mild. Immediate side effects included anaphylactoid reactions which required close supervision of the patient during infusion of the drug. PTC proved efficacious in advanced neuroblastoma. In patients with bone metastases, PTC has a prompt analgesic effect which seems to occur independently of any antitumor action.
