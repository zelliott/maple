Radiation oncologists recognize a continuing need to improve the radiation dose distribution between a cancer and the surrounding normal tissue. A most promising method of accomplishing this goal is the use of charged particle beam irradiation, the clinical use of which has been investigated for the past 40 years. Since the first clinical studies began at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1954, more than 5,000 patients have been treated with protons, using accelerators designed for physics laboratories. Superior results are reported for the control of selected diseases by the ten facilities which are currently investigating proton radiation therapy. The findings have resulted in expansion plans in several of these facilities, and in the formulation of plans for two new facilities. We report on the planned development of a new facility at Loma Linda University, which has contracted with Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory for the design and fabrication of a 250 MeV synchrotron and its beam transport and delivery systems. This facility will be the first in the world to employ a proton accelerator dedicated to medical service and research. As such, it will be available as an international resource to develop and improve the modality.
