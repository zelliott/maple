Women's (N = 200; 41-95 years) knowledge of mortality risks and their perceived general risk, personal risk, control, and preventability of coronary heart disease (CHD) and breast, colon, and lung cancer were examined. Middle-aged (MA) women were more accurate in their mortality knowledge for MA men than for MA women and were more accurate for MA than for older (OA) men and women. OA women, in contrast, were least accurate in their mortality knowledge for OA women compared with all other target groups; only 34% knew that CHD is the leading cause of death in OA women. Participants also overestimated a woman's risk of death from breast cancer and underestimated the risk from lung and colon cancer. Ratings of perceived risk, control, and preventability varied as a function of disease. OA women in particular appear to lack knowledge regarding women's risk of major diseases. Results have implications for women's health behaviors and medical decisions.
