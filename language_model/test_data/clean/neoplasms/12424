Bragg published curves for ionization of air by radium alpha particles in December 1904 demonstrating that ionization density increased sharply near the end of range. The accepted view was that ionization would decrease exponentially with depth. This depth dose pattern is the basis for the dose distributional advantage of charged particles relative to photons.
