To test the influence of changes in membrane fatty acid composition on the radiation response of mammalian cells, human LDV cells were cultured in medium containing delipidated serum supplemented with either oleic or linoleic acid. Analysis of lipid extracts of the cells by gas liquid chromatography showed that, after 3 or more days growth in oleic or linoleic acid supplemented media, there were substantial overall increases in the proportion of oleate and linoleate, respectively, in the cellular lipid. Smaller absolute changes were measured in nuclear phospholipid, which was found to be low in unsaturated phospholipid compared to the rest of the cell. Fluorescence polarization measurements using diphenylhexatriene indicated an increased membrane fluidity in cells grown in the presence of excess linoleic acid and to a lesser extent for oleic acid. The clonogenic capacity of the cells after irradiation in air or nitrogen was not altered by any of these membrane compositional changes. The lack of effect on radiation sensitivity, in contrast to that reported for bacteria (E. coli K1060), is consistent with the fact that little or no change was brought about in the nuclear membrane composition, since evidence from partial cell irradiation experiments indicates that the cell nucleus is the sensitive target for cell killing by ionizing radiation. The ability of the cell to maintain a low level of unsaturated phospholipids in its nuclear membrane may be an important general defence mechanism against free radical damage to chromatin mediated by lipid peroxidation.
