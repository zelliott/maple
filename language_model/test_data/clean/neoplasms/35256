Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) belong to a group of mammalian immunoglobulin-related glycoproteins. They are involved in cell-cell recognition and modulate cellular processes that range from the shaping of tissue architecture and neovascularization to the regulation of insulin homeostasis and T-cell proliferation. CEACAMs have also been identified as receptors for host-specific viruses and bacteria in mice and humans, respectively, making these proteins an interesting example of pathogen-host co-evolution. Forward and reverse genetics in the mouse now provide powerful novel models to elucidate the action of CEACAM family members in vivo.
