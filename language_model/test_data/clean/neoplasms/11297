Patients with tumour disease are in particularly stressful situation at all times. The aim of the present study was to find what proportion of patients on a surgical oncology ward would also benefit from psycho-oncological care.

Within a period of 6 months (IIIrd and IVth quarters of 2004) 406 of our tumour patients were questioned with the aid of a method (Po-Bado) developed specifically for use with such patients.

According to this inquiry, it can be assumed that 41.4% of tumour patients are in need of professional psycho-oncological support. Patients who are in hospital for diagnostic procedures to confirm or exclude the suspicion of tumour disease have a greater need for such support (48.7%) than do patients who have been admitted for a scheduled operation (37.3%). Correlations were found between the need for this therapy and different disease situations. The prevalence of need was highest among patients with a second tumour, in whom it was 66.7%. The type of tumour disease also had an influence whether psycho-oncological care was indicated. The study revealed that patients with malignant soft-tissue tumours (49%) and patients with tumours of the upper digestive organs (48.7%) find the mental stress more difficult to cope with than patients who are in hospital for treatment of malignant skin tumours (31.8%) or malignant tumours of the mammary gland (38.7%).

These results suggest that an adequate psycho-oncologic diagnostic at the start of a stationary stay are reasonable. This is a precondition for a well-directed psycho-oncologic intervention in order to enhance the disease accomplishment but at the same time the target-oriented supply of psycho-oncologic care in hospitals is a limited resource.
