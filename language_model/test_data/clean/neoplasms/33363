The importance of communication in close, personal relationships has been well-documented. At the end of life, communication, social relationships, and spirituality seem to have greater importance. Some studies suggest that the quality of life at the end of life (QOLEOL) involves these components.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the communicative acts of love, gratitude, and forgiveness, and to explore the extent to which the communicative acts, social well-being, and spiritual well-being predict the overall QOLEOL when controlling for physical symptoms.

Cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational design.

A convenience sample of all adult hospice patients, aged 35-80, with a cancer diagnosis, residing in their private home in a community setting, was recruited from a large, non-profit hospice program in the midwestern United States.

Patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) social/family well-being subscale, the JAREL Spiritual Well-Being tool, an investigator-designed tool to measure communicative acts, and the global, single-item QOL indicator of the QUAL-E.

Strong, positive correlations among social and spiritual well-being, communicative acts, and QOLEOL were found (p &lt; 0.01). Spiritual well-being most significantly predicted the QOLEOL, explaining 53.5% of explained variance in the QOLEOL. Although not statistically significant, the communicative acts of love and gratitude made a small contribution to the overall model. The communicative act of forgiveness did not perform well.

The knowledge gained through this investigation laid the groundwork for future studies in identifying the importance of explicitly assessing relationships and supporting patients and families in their communication. In order to learn more about this phenomenon and establish a foundation for intervention, confirmation is required regarding the connections between the spiritual and social domains, the relationships between the specific communicative acts and the QOLEOL, as well as establishment of valid measurement approaches.
