The informed consent of patients is ethically and legally required for all medical practice. The disclosure of information to cancer patients is one of the most important issues mostly in oncological practice. Because most patients now want to know the truth about their diagnosis and prognosis, the ability to discuss the cancer diagnosis, disease recurrence, or treatment failure, and to solicit patients' views about resuscitation or hospice care, are important verbal skills for oncologists and other oncology care providers. If clinicians involved in cancer care are able to well communicative with patients, these ones and their families can achieve a good level of quality of life and psychological adjustment. Moreover, the ability to clearly articulate a treatment plan or elicit patient preferences for treatment are prerequisite to informed consent. Despite these imperatives, clinicians do not routinely receive training in key communication skills that could enable them to accomplish these tasks. Disclosure of information needs to be individualized, and social and cultural background has to be taken into consideration. This review considers deficiencies in the conduct of key communication tasks and their consequences. The reasons for these deficiencies are explored and guidelines to resolve these issues and to further new alternative methods are proposed.
