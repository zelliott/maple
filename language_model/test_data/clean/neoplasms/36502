During the period from September 1990 to March 1992, 155 nerve blocks were performed for 125 patients as part of the clinical management of pain due to malignant disease. The efficacy, in terms of pain score reduction, and spontaneously reported side effects secondary to these procedures were prospectively audited. Neural blockade was undertaken in accordance with strict clinical criteria, and medication was optimized with the aim of achieving maximum analgesia with minimum side effects at all times. Pain was assessed before the block, 24 hours after the block and at follow-up (two to six weeks) using visual analogue scores or verbal rating scales. All patients were audited. The total (all patients, all blocks) median (lower-upper quartile) pain score dropped from 8 (6-10) cm before the block to 2 (0-4) cm at 24 hours after the block (p &lt; 0.05) and to 1 (0-4) cm at follow-up (p &lt; 0.005). A concomitant reduction in analgesic requirements was observed. The incidence of serious side effects was low (two patients in this series). The results indicate the usefulness of these techniques for patients in the palliative care setting.
