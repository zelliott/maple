Curcumin, a natural yellow pigment of turmeric, has become focus of interest with regard to its role in regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs are metal-dependent endopeptidases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix. MMPs are involved in chronic diseases such as arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, psoriasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cancer, neuropathic pain, and atherosclerosis.

Curcumin regulates the expression and secretion of various MMPs. This review documents the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory activity of curcumin on various diseases viz., cancer, arthritis, and ulcer. Finally, the steps to be taken for getting potent curcuminoids have also been discussed in the structure-activity relationship (SAR) section. From this review, readers can get answer to the question: Is curcumin a potential MMPI candidate?

Numerous approaches have been taken to beget a molecule with specificity restricted to a particular MMP as well as good oral bioavailability; however, nearly all the molecules lack these criteria. Using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling and virtual screening, new analogs of curcumin can be designed which will be selectively inhibiting different MMPs.
