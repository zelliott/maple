Paralleling increasing life expectancy, the number of cases of cancer in our population is also on the increase. The question as to whether chemotherapy for the treatment of a tumor in the elderly is appropriate or not, and if so what doses are required, depends in particular on the potentially increased toxicity of the drug in the old patient. The consequence is that alternative substances may have to be sought. When planning treatment, however, additional factors have to be taken into account, such as the possibility of differences in the physiology of the tumor in the elderly, the general state of health of the patient, the presence of concomitant diseases, possible interactions with other medications, and the patient's social environment.
