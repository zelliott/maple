A blood test is described which is often positive in diverse disease states. In this test washed patient lymphocytes are incubated with histone or albumin. Early aggregation indicates that the patient might have inflammatory, malignant, or other disease, while absence of aggregation is the pattern found in normals. The test is called the lymphocyte aggregation blocking (LAB) test. Positive results when testing cancer patients were 86%, normals 14%, and non-malignant hospitalized patients were 50%. Lymphocyte aggregation was not an active process mediated by added protein. All washed lymphocyte suspensions will aggregate in the test conditions, whether, from normals, cancer or non-cancer patients if no protein is added. Normals' lymphocyte suspensions are prevented from aggregating by the added histone or albumin.
