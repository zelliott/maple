Hyaluronic acid concentrations were measured by a laser nephelometric assay in serum samples from 50 patients with advanced disseminated neoplasm and 50 healthy controls matched for age and sex. The identity of hyaluronic acid was confirmed by a combination of electrophoretic and enzymatic techniques. The mean serum hyaluronic acid concentration for the control group was 1.09 mg/l, with a range of 0-4 mg/l. The mean concentration for patients with neoplastic disease was 10.38 mg/l, with a range of 0-100 mg/l. Sixty two per cent of the patients with disseminated neoplasm had serum hyaluronic acid concentrations above the control range. There was no correlation between the increased concentration of hyaluronic acid and tumour type, serum bilirubin, serum alkaline phosphatase, or serum urea concentrations. There was a higher incidence of hypercalcaemia in patients with increased hyaluronic acid concentrations, but the correlation between hyaluronic acid and calcium concentrations was not significant. In view of the possible role of hyaluronic acid in cellular differentiation and morphogenesis the finding of increased hyaluronic acid concentrations in patients with advanced neoplastic disease may be of fundamental importance in cancer biology.
