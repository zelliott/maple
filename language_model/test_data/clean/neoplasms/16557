Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic analysis that allows identification of genomic changes by comparing the copy number of DNA sequences in cells of tested tissue and the reference specimen. CGH is based on competitive suppressive in situ hybridization of two differently labeled DNA probes (tested and reference, karyotypically normal, fluorochrome-labeled DNAs) with metaphase chromosomes of a healthy subject. First described by Kallioniemi et al. in 1992, the CGH assay has been widely used for identification and characterization of both numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities in cells of different tissues at various pathological conditions in humans, especially in tumor diseases. We discuss the specific features and quality control of comparative genomic hybridization, its advantages and limitations in detection of genomic imbalance and the prospects for development of this technology.
