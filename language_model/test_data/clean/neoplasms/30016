Non-invasive detection and monitoring of lethal diseases, such as cancer, are considered as effective factors in treatment and survival. We describe a new disease diagnostic approach, denoted "reactomics", based upon reactions between blood sera and an array of vesicles comprising different lipids and polydiacetylene (PDA), a chromatic polymer. We show that reactions between sera and such a lipid/PDA vesicle array produce chromatic patterns which depend both upon the sera composition as well as the specific lipid constituents within the vesicles. The chromatic patterns were processed through machine-learning algorithms, and the bioinformatics analysis could distinguish both between cancer-bearing and healthy patients, respectively, as well between two types of cancers. Size-separation and enzymatic digestion experiments indicate that lipoproteins are the primary components in sera which react with the chromatic biomimetic vesicles. This colorimetric reactomics concept is highly generic, robust, and does not require a priori knowledge upon specific disease markers in sera. Therefore, it could be employed as complementary or alternative approach for disease diagnostics.
