If a continuous radiation with a maximum energy of more than 10.55 MeV is used in radiotherapy, there is an activation of tissue. A radiation exposure of the staff may be connected with this activity induced by the nuclear photon effect. The consequences for routine radiotherapy are demonstrated by the examples of a betatron 42 MeV and a linear accelerator Clinac 20.
