Social class differences in cancer patient survival have been reported for most cancer types and for a number of countries. The etiology of these differences has been studied less thoroughly and less systematically than social class differences in cancer occurrence. Stage of disease at diagnosis appears to be the most important factor contributing to the social class differences in cancer patient survival. This has been observed most clearly for gastrointestinal and gynaecological cancers. Social class differences in survival are generally wider for patients diagnosed with cancer at local stages than for those diagnosed with cancer at advanced stages. The reasons why cancers are more frequently diagnosed at a local stage in high than in low social classes in not properly understood at the moment. Of other potential contributing factors, the role of treatment and psychosocial factors has scarcely been studied. Biological indicators of tumour aggressiveness have failed to explain the social class differences.
