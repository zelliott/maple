Changes in the degree of fluorescence polarization in the fluorescent cytoplasm of lymphocytes from patients with malignant diseases, patients with nonmalignant diseases, and normal donors were investigated by the fluorescence polarization technique. In order to confirm Cercek's cancer test, two kinds of parameters, the degree of fluorescence polarization of lymphocytes stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and cancer basic protein, were obtained for each person. Patients with malignant diseases were easily differentiated from the others without exception by an index, the response ratio of the degree of fluorescence polarization. Usefulness of this technique was confirmed for the detection of cancer-bearing patients.
