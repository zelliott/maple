Today, a wide range of efficient analgesic and non-analgesic drugs for the treatment of back pain are available. However, drugs should never be the only mainstay of a back pain treatment program. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) are widely used in acute back pain. NSAIDs prescribed at regular intervals are effective to reduce simple back pain. The different NSAIDs are effective for the reduction of this pain. They have serious adverse effects, particularly at high doses, in the elderly, and on long-term administration. The new cyclooxygenase II-inhibitors have less gastrointestinal complications. But the long-term experiences are limited up to now. Considerable controversy exists about the use of opioid analgesics in chronic noncancer pain. Many physicians are concerned about the effectiveness and adverse effects of opioids. Other clinicians argue that there is a role for opioid therapy in chronic noncancer pain, e. g. especially in chronic low back pain. There is a low incidence of organ toxicity in patients who respond to opioids. The incidence of abuse and addiction is likewise relatively low. The potential for increased function and improved quality of life seems to outweigh the risks. However, there is a lack of randomised controlled trials (RCT) on opioid therapy in a multimodal pain treatment approach. Clinical experience and some studies suggest administration of sustained release opioids because of better comfort for the patient and less risks for addiction. The opioids should be selected due to the specific side effects of the different drugs. For patients with pre-existing constipation transdermal fentanyl should be preferred. Antidepressant medications have been used for the treatment of chronic back pain, though there is only little scientific evidence for their effectiveness. There is no evidence for the use of antidepressants in acute low back pain. Trials of muscle relaxants for patients with acute back pain have used a wide range of agents, e. g. benzodiazepines. They mostly reduce acute back pain, but they have significant adverse effects including drowsiness and psychological and physical dependence even after relatively short treatment. Benzodiazepines are not indicated in the treatment of chronic back pain. Drugs are sometimes necessary for the patients to begin and persevere a multimodal treatment program. Drug therapy should be terminated as soon as other treatment strategies succeed. Unfortunately, no studies exist evaluating the place of analgesics within a multimodal treatment program.
