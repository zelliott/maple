To contribute to a better understanding of the utility of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90R; L. Derogatis, 1983) with bereaved samples, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted on SCL-90R responses of 97 parents 2 years after the death of their child from cancer.  The factor analysis revealed one significant factor that accounted for 30% of the variance in this administration.  This factor included many items that reflected the theme of somatic complaints.
