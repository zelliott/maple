The condensed version: Thiolated glycol chitosan can form stable nanoparticles with polymerized siRNAs through charge-charge interactions and self-cross-linking (see scheme). This poly-siRNA/glycol chitosan nanoparticles (psi-TGC) provided sufficient inâ€…vivo stability for systemic delivery of siRNAs. Knockdown of tumor proteins by psi-TGC resulted in a reduction in tumor size and vascularization.
