Cancer cachexia is a complex syndrome characterized primarily by diminished nutrient intake and progressive tissue depletion that is manifest clinically as anorexia and host weight loss. The gradual loss of host protein stores is central to this process. This review outlines the techniques that have been used to evaluate human amino acid metabolism, their application in patients with cancer cachexia, and possible therapeutic interventions designed to overcome alterations in host protein and amino acid metabolism associated with malignant cachexia. The techniques of nitrogen balance and 3-methylhistidine excretion provide indirect estimates of overall nitrogen metabolism and skeletal muscle myofibrillar protein breakdown. Measurement of circulating amino acid concentrations, particularly when combined with assessment of arterial-venous differences and regional amino acid balance allows for investigation of interorgan amino acid metabolism. One of the most significant advances in in vivo amino acid metabolic research has been the development of labeled amino acid tracer studies to evaluate whole body and regional amino acid kinetics. The use of stable and unstable amino acid isotopes in these techniques is reviewed in detail. Virtually all of these techniques have now been employed in the evaluation of human cancer cachexia. The results of studies evaluating amino acid concentrations, regional amino acid balance, and 3-methylhistidine excretion are summarized. The use of regional and whole body kinetic studies in cancer cachexia are reviewed extensively. Most investigators have observed increased rates of whole body protein turnover, synthesis, and catabolism in both weight-stable and weight-losing cancer patients. Some studies have suggested a relationship between the extent of disease and the degree of aberration in amino acid kinetic parameters. Investigators have attempted to reverse some of these alterations by provision of substrate (nutritional support) or administration of specific pharmacologic or anabolic agents such as hydrazine sulfate, insulin, growth hormone, and beta-2 agonists. The role of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in cancer and its effects on protein and amino acid kinetics and tumor growth are addressed. The possible benefits of specific amino acid nutritional formulations with increased branched chain amino acids, arginine, and glutamine are reviewed. Although many of these approaches appear promising, significant impact on clinically definable parameters remains to be demonstrated. A better understanding of the underlying protein catabolic mechanisms of cancer cachexia will likely lead to more effective therapies to reverse the protein calorie malnutrition associated with cancer cachexia.
