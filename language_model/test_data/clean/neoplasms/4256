In a case control study, serum levels of thrombopoietin (TPO) were determined by a sandwich ELISA in 20 patients (median age, 7 years; range, 2-56 years) with various malignancies who received high-dose chemotherapy and a stem cell rescue operation. The patients received two different transplant modalities: (a) 12 patients received purified autologous peripheral blood CD34+ cells; and (b) 8 patients received cells in the CD34(-) fraction, which still contains many CD34+ cells. No significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to the duration required to achieve an absolute granulocyte count of &gt;0.5 x 10(9)/liter, the duration of dependence on platelet transfusion, or the number of platelet transfusions. In both groups, the serum TPO levels were inversely correlated with the circulating platelet count. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that significant determinants of the serum TPO level included the circulating platelet count (standardized regression coefficient = -0.5179), transplantation with cells in the CD34(-) fraction (0.2414), solid tumor (0.1420), and the age of the patient (-0.1236; r2 = 0.3021; P &lt; 0.0001). These results suggest that the mode of stem cell support (ie., the presence of accessory cells in the inoculum), age, or the type of preceding chemotherapy affects serum TPO levels after transplantation.
