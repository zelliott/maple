Corticoids are well known for their immunosuppressive properties. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an intrinsic antiinflammatory peptide in immune diseases, originally identified as cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor. We examined the effect of hydrocortisone sodium succinate (HSS) on the production of IL-10 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs from healthy volunteers and cancer-burden patients were preincubated separately with or without HSS for 1 h, then stimulated with 5 microg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Production of IL-10 by human PBMCs was detected with LPS stimulation and its production was higher in cancer-burden patients than in normal volunteers, although this was not statistically significant. HSS suppressed production of IL-10 by LPS-stimulated PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner both in normal volunteers and in cancer-burden patients. These results indicate that, in addition to their antiinflammatory properties, corticoids act to restore the immunosuppressive states even in cancer-burden states.
