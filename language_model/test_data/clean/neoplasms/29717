Cancer chemotherapy is an established therapeutic modality capable of achieving cures, either alone or in combination with surgery and radiation therapy. New drugs and therapeutic approaches with potent effects on both tumor and normal host tissues are being introduced into clinical use. Clinical management of the patient with cancer, however, continues to be based upon established principles. Knowledge of these principles will guide the clinician in the appropriate use of the growing list of effective chemotherapeutic agents. Although standard therapy for specific tumors will undoubtedly change during the next few years, future therapy will still be founded on fundamental concepts and basic principles of tumor biology and clinical oncology.
