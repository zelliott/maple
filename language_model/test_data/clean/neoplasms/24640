The biggest challenge facing us today in cancer control and prevention is the identification of novel biomarkers for detection and improved therapeutic interventions to reduce mortality and morbidity rates. Biomarkers are important indicators to inform us of the physiological state of the cell at a specific time. It is now clear that malignant transformation occurs by changes in cellular DNA and protein expression with subsequent clonal proliferation of the altered cells. The affected genes and their expressed protein products or biomarkers are those involved in the normal growth and maintenance of the cancerous cells. These biomarkers could prove pivotal for the identification of early cancer and people at risk of developing cancer. Altered proteins or changes in gene expression in malignant cells may lead to the expression of tumour antigens recognised by host immune system. In this review we discuss current research into the molecular technologies making possible the global genomic-wide analysis of changes in DNA (genotyping), RNA expression (transcriptomics) and protein expression (proteomics) that have accelerated the rate of new biomarker/tumour antigen discovery. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of cancer an approach that harmoniously integrates the various 'omic' platforms are key to unraveling the complexity 'needle-in-a-haystack' quality of biomarker/tumour antigen discovery.
