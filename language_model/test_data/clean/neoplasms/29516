Tumor-related proteases such as urokinase-type plasminogen (uPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and cathepsin D (cath-D) are involved in the prognosis of breast cancer (BC) and promote the metastatic process. We investigated the relationship between these proteases and their prognostic significance according to the ER status.

uPA, PAI-1, and cath-D levels were prospectively measured in tumor from 316 patients with primary BC. The distribution and relationship between these proteases and ER subsets were analyzed as well as the prognostic significance.

Quantitative levels of uPA, and PAI-1 were higher in ER-patients (p&lt; 0.001) whereas no difference was observed for cath-D levels in ER subsets (p = 0.96). In patients with a positive and highly positive ER status, a high cath-D level was associated with a poorer prognosis. Patients in the highly positive ER group experienced poorer survival in the group with a high PAI-1 level compared to the group with a low PAI-1 level. In ER+ patients, cath-D (p= 0.02) and the tumor size (p= 0.03) were independent factors for OS.

The prognostic significance of proteases is modulated by the ER status. Cath-D and PAI-1 could identify a high-risk group with an adverse outcome in ER+ patients.
