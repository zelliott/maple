An 11 gold atom (undecagold) cluster was covalently attached to specific sites on Fab', F(ab')2 and whole IgG molecules such that each carried 11-33 gold atoms without significant loss of native immunospecificity. Gold cluster labeled 17-1A monoclonal F(ab')2 antibody fragments showed 80% immunoreactivity compared to native antibody fragments in binding to human colon carcinoma cells in vitro. Radioactive gold in vivo biodistributions in nude mice with human tumors are also reported. By using clusters, potentially a larger destructive payload can be carried per antibody.
