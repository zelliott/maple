The Ommaya reservoir is an implantable device which allows percutaneous intraventricular administration of preservative-free morphine sulfate. Use of this device in select cancer patients has worked well in providing pain control when conventional methods have failed. Using an Ommaya reservoir is not without complications, and patients may experience side effects of morphine, but most of these effects can be controlled. Teaching begins early so the patient can be discharged with a dose and schedule which provide pain control, and the responsible family member can be proficient in administration. Home care and follow-up are necessary to assure pain control and absence of complications.
