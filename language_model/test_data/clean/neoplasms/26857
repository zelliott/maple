Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is of high relevance in oncology. Only a minority of professionals feel competent in CAM. Our aim was to provide a strategy for establishing evidence-based counseling on CAM in oncology in the German health system.

We performed a systematic search of the literature on patient counseling concerning CAM. Of 811 articles identified in this search 51 met our inclusion criteria. Data from these articles were analyzed and adapted to the needs of German patients by a group of experts of the DEGRO ("Deutschen Gesellschaft für Radioonkologie") and the German Cancer Society. In the next step a strategy about how to integrate evidence-based counseling on CAM at cancer centers and oncological institutions was developed.

First, evidence-based recommendations on CAM counseling were derived. The core of our strategy combines two levels of information provision: level 1 will be oncologists, radiotherapists and other specialists and level 2 oncological CAM experts. The latter group will serve as trainers and backup for complicated or advanced questions and for individual counseling of patients with complex needs. Professionals in level 1 will be offered special training.

Evidence-based counseling on CAM is not only possible but also mandatory in order to meet patient information needs. Our proposal would allow for integrated counseling available at all oncological institutions and guarantee a high quality. Furthermore, provision of information on two different levels allows the effective use of resources (manpower and financing).
