This phase 1b study determined the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of trametinib in combination with gemcitabine. Secondary objectives included assessment of clinical activity and steady-state pharmacokinetics.

Adults with advanced solid tumours, adequate organ function and Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) â©½ 1 were eligible. Once-daily oral trametinib (1mg, 2mg, 2.5mg) was escalated in a 3+3 design with standard gemcitabine dosing (1000 mg/m(2) IV Days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles). During expansion, trametinib 2mg was combined with gemcitabine. Pharmacokinetics samples were collected on Day 15 pre-dose and 1, 2, 4 and 6h post-dose; tumour assessments were repeated every two cycles.

Between 8/2009 and 11/2010, 31 patients (pancreas = 11, breast = 6, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) = 4, other = 10) were treated. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in each cohort, and included febrile neutropenia, transaminase elevation and uveitis. The RP2D was declared as trametinib 2mg daily with standard gemcitabine dosing. Common grade 3/4 toxicities at the RP2D included: neutropenia (38%), thrombocytopenia (19%) and transaminase elevation (14%). Of 10 patients with measurable pancreatic cancer, three partial responses (30%) were documented; two additional patients achieved objective responses (breast, complete response (CR); salivary glands, partial response (PR)). Pharmacokinetics suggested no change in exposures of either drug in combination.

Administration of trametinib at its full monotherapy dose of 2mg daily in combination with standard gemcitabine dosing (1000 mg/m(2) IV Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days) was feasible. Though most toxicities were manageable, the addition of trametinib may increase gemcitabine-associated myelosuppression. Future studies of this combination will require monitoring to maintain dose and schedule.
