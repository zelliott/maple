Hospice ward at Matsuyama Bethel Hospital opened in April 2000. The hospice care has been provided for inpatients and outpatients. We considered a system that should be established to allow patients and their families to choose from in-hospital care, outpatient care and home care. The hospice consultation for outpatients opened in April 2004. The terminal cancer patients who are within 6 months of remaining days were hospitalized to the hospice ward. After making the hospice consultation for outpatients, hospice care services have been provided for terminal cancer patients including those with more than 6 months of remaining days under the coordination of palliative care for outpatients and inpatients.
