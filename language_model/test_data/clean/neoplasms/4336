Nutritional problems often result from malignancies and aggressive multimodal treatment. Early identification of reliable risk factors associated with malnutrition and need for nutritional support is necessary for development of preventative approaches. Nutritional and treatment-related characteristics were examined for 173 pediatric oncology patients referred for nutritional support and a comparison sample of 43 patients matched on treatment protocol and/or diagnosis who had never been referred for nutritional support. Abnormally low serum albumin levels, poor oral intake, mucositis, prior radiation therapy, and increased gastrointestinal toxicity were significantly more frequent among referred than non-referred patients. A discriminant function analysis indicated that poor oral intake was the single best predictor of need for nutritional support. Patients with solid tumors were more nutritionally depleted at the time of referral; all bone marrow transplant patients received nutritional support. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors required nutritional support for longer time periods. We conclude that routine documentation of poor oral intake (i.e., observation of change in a child's eating patterns) is the most reliable indicator of children who eventually require nutritional support and who may benefit from interventions that could delay or prevent nutritional problems. Prophylactic interventions should be tailored to meet the specific needs of individual diagnostic groups.
