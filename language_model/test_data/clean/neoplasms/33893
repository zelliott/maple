Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpesvirus associated with lymphoid and epithelial cell tumors, encodes several proteins that exploit the ubiquitin-proteasome system to regulate latency and allow the persistence of infected cells in immunocompetent hosts. Further modifications of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis by activated cellular oncogenes contribute to malignant transformation. A detailed understanding of these processes may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for EBV-associated cancers.
