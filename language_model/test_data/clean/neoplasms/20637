Although the knowledge exists to relieve cancer pain, inadequate pain relief persists as an international health problem. The World Health Organization has recommended a threefold strategy to improve cancer pain management: health policy, drug availability, and education. Yet major barriers to effective cancer pain management exist in every country of the world. Effective strategies to improve pain management must be based on an understanding of the issues in individual countries. This report evaluates cultural and other factors influencing cancer pain management in the Republic of South Africa. This ethnographic field study included multiple methods of data collection: analysis of documents, participant observation, focused interviews, and in-depth interviews of informants (n = 33) who represented multiple stakeholders in a variety of settings. Cultural beliefs and practices form the context for understanding cancer pain and how it is managed. Cultural variability exists regarding cancer as a disease, pain expectations, pain tolerance, pain expression, and health care practices. Key factors that influence how pain is managed included standards, knowledge, resources, communication and the patient-provider relationship, and teamwork and professional relationships. The existence of these factors promotes effective pain management, whereas their absence creates a barrier to achieving this aim.
