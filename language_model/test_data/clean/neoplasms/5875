To provide an overview of the clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and oncologic implications of the cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes that occur predominantly in patients with solid tumors.

A review was performed of the literature identified by a comprehensive MEDLINE search.

Diverse cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes may be associated with underlying tumors. They include musculoskeletal disorders (clubbing, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, dermatomyositis, and multicentric reticulohistiocytosis), reactive erythemas (erythema gyratum repens and necrolytic migratory erythema), vascular dermatoses (Trousseau's syndrome), papulosquamous disorders (acanthosis nigricans, tripe palms, palmar hyperkeratosis, acquired ichthyosis, pityriasis rotunda, Bazex's syndrome, florid cutaneous papillomatosis, the sign of Leser-Tr√©lat, and extramammary Paget's disease), and disorders of hair growth (hypertrichosis lanuginosa acquisita). The clinical manifestations of these dermatoses may precede, coincide with, or follow the diagnosis of cancer. The presence of a cutaneous paraneoplastic syndrome is often associated with a poor prognosis.

Cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes are specific constellations of mucous membrane and/or skin abnormalities that are caused by an underlying tumor. Since they may be the presenting sign of an occult cancer, cognizance of their features and clinical implications are of considerable importance. Individuals with these syndromes should have a thorough workup for an associated malignancy.
