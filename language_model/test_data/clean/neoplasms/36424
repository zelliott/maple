Mortality rates of two cohorts of asbestos friction product (FP) workers were studied in comparison with the population of the adjoining towns over periods of 20 and 40 years respectively. The second cohort was subdivided into 3 subcohorts exposed to chrysotile asbestos (CA), vulcanization and/or polymerization vapours and gases (VPGV) and asbestos bakelite (AB) or asbestos rubber (AR) dusts. In the first cohort no deaths from lung cancer were recorded, even though the total tumour mortality was higher than in the general population. In the second cohort an excess tumour mortality was observed in the first subcohort for stomach cancer only. In the other two subcohorts the expected rates were higher for all the tumour sites. Following intraperitoneal injection of CA, AB and AR dusts, malignant tumours developed in 31.5% of the rats which received CA, and in about 10% of the rats which were injected with AB and AR dusts. Also, the mean longevity of CA-treated animals was significantly lower than in the other two groups. Thus, the carcinogenic risk was real in the group of FP production workers with significant CA exposure only.
