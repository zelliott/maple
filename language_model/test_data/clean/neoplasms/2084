The role of oxygen in influencing the spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation mechanism in liquids has been known for decades. However, no concerted effort has been made to find a correlation between relaxation rates and oxygen dissolved in cell water. A procedure has been developed that allows both in vitro and in vivo measurement of oxygen tension in tumors and helps to calculate spin-lattice relaxation rate.
