The safety, tolerance and analgesic efficacy of multiple oral doses of butorphanol tartrate for the long-term treatment of cancer pain were evaluated in this open study. Thirty-five patients were treated with various doses (1 to 12 tablets per day) for 4 to 147 days. The median pain relief was fair, good, very good or excellent in 51% of the patients and poor in 49% of the patients. Global assessments were very similar. No clinically significant changes in blood pressure, weight, blood and urine chemistries were observed. Seventeen patients reported side-effects (only sedation and dry mouth) ranging from mild to severe.
