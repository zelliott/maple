Eighteen pediatric oncology inpatients had 21 Hickman right atrial catheters placed for total venous access; 16 patients received parenteral nutrition. Mean duration of catheterization was 43 +/- 29 (SD) days. Four catheters had to be removed for infection or clotting. The catheter-related sepsis rate was 10%. Serious catheter-related complications were no more frequent in this population than in patients receiving only parenteral nutrition via Broviac or pediatric Broviac catheters.
