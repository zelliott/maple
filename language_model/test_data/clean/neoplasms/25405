The number of long term survivors of childhood cancer is increasing and these patients and their families benefit from the social worker's attention to their immediate as well as future needs and concerns. Periods of extended remission can be differentiated in terms of the demands made on family and patient at each juncture. Since long term survival is still a recent phenomenon, reports of clinical observations and research are limited. Some typical reactions are discussed with suggested social work interventions. A developmental approach to the patient is desirable.
