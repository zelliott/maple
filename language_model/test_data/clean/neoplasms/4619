The serum amyloid A (SAA) protein is an acute phase protein that is synthesized under the regulation of inflammatory cytokines during both acute and chronic inflammation. It is suggested that the SAA increases correlate with many types of carcinogenesis and neoplastic diseases. Th changes in SAA in serum could therefore indicate the progress and malignancy of the disease, as well as the host responses. The present paper reviewed the rationale of using SAA as potential cancer biomarker in clinical diagnosis, including the contribution and involvement of SAA in cancer growth and development. Then we discussed the current applications of SAA in diagnosis and tracing of different types of cancers. Finally the proteomics techniques, especially the SELDI-TOF MS to identify SAA in serum from patients were appreciated as an important manner in clinical diagnosis.
