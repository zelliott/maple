Thromboembolism is one of the most common causes of death in cancer patients. Among the most frequent thrombotic complications in patients with cancer are disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and thrombocytosis. Clearly, these complications arise as tumor cells interact with almost all components of the hemostatic system including platelets. Platelets participate in tumor progression by contributing to the metastatic cascade, protecting tumor cells from immune surveillance, regulating tumor cell invasion, and angiogenesis. Platelets contain one of the largest stores of angiogenic and mitogenic factors and the tumor vasculature is leaky, which allows platelets to come in contact with the tumor and deposit multiple angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thrombin to tumor cells, which in turn contributes to tumor progression. This article reviews the recent literature on how platelets contribute to tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis.
