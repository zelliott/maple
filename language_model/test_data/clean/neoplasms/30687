This article focuses on appropriate patient selection for and management of patients selected for continuous spinal infusional opioid therapy. Patients with cancer-related pain who have undergone sequential strong opioid drug trials, who have intractable, unmanageable side effects, and who have undergone a successful spinal opioid efficacy trial are candidates for implantable spinal infusional therapy. Patients with noncancer-related chronic pain, who have failed all conventional syndrome-specific therapies before neuroablative surgical procedures, including sequential strong opioid drug trials, who have intractable, unmanageable side effects, and who have undergone successful spinal opioid efficacy trial are deemed candidates for implantable spinal infusional therapy. Patients with chronic noncancer-related pain and patient with cancer-related pain who have life expectancies greater than 3 mo all have implanted programmable infusion pumps. Patients with cancer-related pain who have life expectancies less than 3 mo have implanted permanent epidural catheters connected to external pump systems. Management guidelines for complications of therapy broadly categorized as surgical, mechanical, and pharmacologic are presented.
