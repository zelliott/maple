In recent years, targeted agents have rapidly evolved as effective tools in the clinical management of a broad range of malignant diseases. These agents disrupt molecular mechanisms and signaling modules that drive the malignant phenotype in defined subsets of malignancies. Beyond the intended cellular targets crucial to tumor growth and progression, these agents also affect signal transduction in normal cells and tissues. The resulting adverse events and their clinical management continue to change, as newer agents with an ever-increasing target spectrum are developed. We provide a succinct overview of dermatologic toxicities arising from the targeting of receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream effectors. Emergent insights into the pathomechanisms involved and the use of this knowledge base to alleviate cutaneous adverse events are discussed.
