To define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide with filgrastim (r-met-HuG-CSF) in patients with advanced solid tumors and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

Thirty-five patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled in stages I and II. Twenty-one patients were treated in stage I in sequential cohorts of at least three patients at increasing dosage levels of cyclophosphamide and epirubicin, for up to six cycles every 21 days. At the completion of stage I, a MTD for epirubicin was established. Fourteen patients were treated in stage II, in cohorts of three or more. The epirubicin dose remained constant at the MTD dosage from stage I. Cyclophosphamide was further dose-escalated to establish its MTD. Twenty-one patients with previously untreated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated in stage III with the MTD established in the prior stages.

The MTD in stage I was epirubicin 150 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m2 with cumulative neutropenia as the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Cumulative thrombocytopenia prevented further dose-escalation of cyclophosphamide in stage II. The stage III regimen consisted of six, 21-day cycles of epirubicin 150 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m2, vincristine 2 mg, and prednisolone 100 mg for five days with filgrastim support. Nineteen of twenty-one patients (90%) completed six cycles of treatment, eight (38%) without dose reduction. Common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 4 neutropenia (neutrophil nadir &lt; 0.5 x 10(9)/l) was documented in 85 of 118 cycles (72%). Neutropenic fever was documented in 17 of 21 patients (81%) on at least one occasion. Severe thrombocytopenia (&lt; 25 x 10(9)/l) was seen in fourteen of 118 cycles (12%) and increased with cycle number. There was no significant non-hematological toxicity.

Significant dose-escalation of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide was possible with filgrastim support. The MTD achieved was approximately double that of standard-dose therapy. This study forms the basis of an ongoing randomized study evaluating dose-intensification in intermediate grade NHL.
