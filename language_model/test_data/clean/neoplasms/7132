Cancer genome projects are now being expanded in an attempt to provide complete landscapes of the mutations that exist in tumours. Although the importance of cataloguing genome variations is well recognized, there are obvious difficulties in bridging the gaps between high-throughput resequencing information and the molecular mechanisms of cancer evolution. Here, we describe the current status of the high-throughput genomic technologies, and the current limitations of the associated computational analysis and experimental validation of cancer genetic variants. We emphasize how the current cancer-evolution models will be influenced by the high-throughput approaches, in particular through efforts devoted to monitoring tumour progression, and how, in turn, the integration of data and models will be translated into mechanistic knowledge and clinical applications.
