Disease prevention through dietary management is a cost-effective approach to promoting healthy aging. Fats, cholesterol, soluble fiber, and the trace elements copper and chromium affect the morbidity and mortality of CHD. Decreasing sodium and increasing potassium intake improves control of hypertension. Calcium and magnesium may also have a role in controlling hypertension. The antioxidant vitamins A and beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, and the trace mineral selenium may protect against types of cancer. A decrease in simple carbohydrates and an increase in soluble dietary fiber may normalize moderately elevated blood glucose levels. Deficiencies of zinc or iron diminish immune function. Adequate levels of calcium and vitamin D can help prevent senile osteoporosis in both older men and women.
