This review has summarized the status of organ site cancer imaging as applied to tumor detection, staging, and posttreatment follow-up. More general questions which have not been addressed include those related to the following: (1) the problem of providing more adequate training of radiologists in the specific challenge of cancer imaging; (2) how to increase the awareness of oncologists as to the specific indications and applications of tumor imaging procedures and enhance joint communication between radiologists and clinicians in the planning of the imaging procedures; and (3) how to stimulate the radiology and oncology communities to establish imaging standards and recommended procedures for specific tumor imaging challenges. Hopefully, an appreciation of the complex challenge of cancer imaging will result from these and subsequent discussions.
