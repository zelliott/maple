A confluence of recent observations has indicted the Ras-family G-proteins RALA and RALB as key offenders in the subversion of core biological systems driving oncogenic transformation. Here, we will focus on current developments highlighting the pivotal contribution of Ral proteins to the regulatory framework supporting tumorigenesis, and evaluate mechanistic connections between Ral effector activation and generation of this framework.
