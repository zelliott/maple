Variant isoforms of CD44 have been strongly implicated in malignant transformation and cancer metastasis. To ascertain the pattern of expression of these isoforms in human normal, fetal and tumor tissues (breast carcinomas, renal cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, colon carcinomas, non-Hodgkin-lymphomas, neuroblastomas and brain tumors), we generated monoclonal antibodies against CD44 variant regions. Monoclonal antibodies were produced against variant regions encoded by exons 4v, 6v and 9v. CD44 variant isoforms are expressed on normal epithelial cells in a different pattern. Regions of epithelia that expressed the highest levels of the variant isoforms were those with a high rate of cell division. CD44 variant isoforms were not expressed by all investigated tumors (not by malignant melanomas, brain tumors and neuroblastomas). It is interesting that the expression of CD44 isoforms in non-Hodgkins lymphomas and colon carcinomas shows possibly a correlation with malignancy.
