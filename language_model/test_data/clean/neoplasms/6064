The growing population of adults living with a history of cancer in the United States mandates attention to quality of life and health in this group, as well as to the implementation of evidence-based interventions to address psychosocial and physical concerns at completion of medical treatments and beyond. The goals of this article are to document the need for attention to psychosocial domains during the re-entry and later phases of the cancer survivor trajectory, offer an overview of current evidence on efficacy of psychosocial interventions during those phases, and offer suggestions for application and research regarding post-treatment psychosocial care.
