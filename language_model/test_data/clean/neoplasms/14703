Additional epidemiologic studies and a systematic program of carcinogenicity testing of materials are necessary to demonstrate that the electronics industry is free of cancer risks. Screening of new and existing materials for mutagenic activity is needed before these materials are introduced into the workplace. Materials found to possess mutagenic activity should be more extensively tested in animals so that their carcinogenic potential can be defined. Those found to be carcinogenic in animals should be regarded as though they are carcinogenic to humans.
