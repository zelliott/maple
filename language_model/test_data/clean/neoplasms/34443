Regeneration of bone marrow following radiation only was investigated using 111Indium as a bone scanning agent. Factors which influence local marrow regeneration are dose, age of the patient, and the total amount of the marrow which was irradiated. Time effects are not demonstrated in this study, except to the extent that most regeneration did occur within the first 12 months following irradiation. The most striking finding is the effect of the irradiation volume. Apparent inconsistencies in earlier reports concerning the dose effect could be explained by this effect alone.
