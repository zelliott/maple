1-(Beta-d-ribofuranosyl)-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one (zebularine) corresponds structurally to cytidine minus the exocyclic 4-amino group. The increased electrophilic character of its simple aglycon endows the molecule with unique biologic properties as a potent inhibitor of both cytidine deaminase and DNA cytosine methyltransferase. The latter activity makes zebularine a promising antitumor agent that is hydrolytically stable, preferentially targets cancer cells, and shows activity both in vitro and in experimental animals, even after oral administration.
