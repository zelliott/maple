Permanent and removable interstitial implantation techniques using absorbable and unabsorbable sutures are described. Most of these techniques can be performed in the clinic easily and quickly with basic instruments: needle holder, needle book, and hemoclips. Specifically, Ir192 (74-4 day half life, 300-610 keV, and 6.0 cm. hvl in tissue) nylon ribbon and I125 (60 day half life, 27-35 keV,  and 2.0 cm. hvl in tissue) Vicryl sutures are described. A major advantage of the I125 over the Ir192 see (other than the fact that it can be permanently implanted and needs less radiation protection) is that the patient does not remain highly radioactive for as long a period due to hte extremely low I125 energy and may be allowed to leave the hospital. Both nuclides have the advantage of a long shelf life, making their use practical and economically feasible.
