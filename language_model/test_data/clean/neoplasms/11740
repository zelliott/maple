Thirty-nine patients with 40 refractory malignant effusions (26 pleural and 14 peritoneal) were treated locally with a nonviable mycobacterial vaccine. The vaccine was administered into the effusion and consisted of BCG cell wall skeleton and trehalose dimycolate attached to oil microdroplets. A dose range of 150--3000 microgram was tested. The overall response rate was 44.0% (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) and was not clearly dose-related. The response rates for each site were 13.6% (CR) and 31.8% (PR) for pleural effusions and 33.3% (CR) and 8.3% (PR) for peritoneal effusions. Toxic effects consisted of fever (40%), serosal pain (37.5%), and increased effusion (27.5%) and were not clearly dose-related. Gastrointestinal toxic effects were seen in 50% of patients treated for peritoneal effusions. Response correlated with prior exposure to BCG vaccine or tuberculosis, and with a febrile response to vaccine administration. This vaccine has a therapeutic effect on both pleural and peritoneal effusions.
