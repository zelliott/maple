We treated terminal malignant tumor cases with the immunopotentiator OK-432 and determined the absolute numbers of neutrocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subpopulations, carrying out the SU-PS and PPD skin tests. After the start of therapy, SU-PS test changed to positive in one-third of the patients. The SU-PS -responder patients showed an increase in lymphocytes and Leu 11A-positive cells, and an elevation of the OK T4/T8 ratio two weeks later. In the SU-PS-nonresponder group, OKT4-positive cells declined, while OKT8-positive cells increased with time. That is, the OKT4/T8 ratio remained low throughout the test period. In the SU-PS-responder group, OK-432 therapy was found to prolong the survival period.
