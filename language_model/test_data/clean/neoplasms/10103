Cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic drugs are efficacious in malignancies. This trial was undertaken to evaluate the toxicity of a novel regimen combining docetaxel and lenalidomide.

Patients with advanced solid tumors were eligible. Docetaxel was administered on day 1, and lenalidomide was given on days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle. Since significant myelosuppression occurred, pegfilgrastim was added on day 2. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as &gt;or=grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, grade 4 neutropenia with fever, or grade 4 anemia or thrombocytopenia.

Thirty-three patients were enrolled. DLTs included neutropenia, nausea/vomiting, and dyspnea. Of the evaluable patients, 69% had stable disease, and 3% had partial response.

This regimen was well tolerated and provided stable disease in the majority of advanced cancer patients. The recommended phase II dosing is docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1, lenalidomide 25 mg on days 1-14, and pegfilgrastim 6 mg on day 2, given every 3 weeks.
