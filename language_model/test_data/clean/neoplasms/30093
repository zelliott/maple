The proapoptotic death receptor DR5 has been studied extensively in cancer cells, but its action in the tumor microenvironment is not well defined. Here, we uncover a role for DR5 signaling in tumor endothelial cells (ECs). We detected DR5 expression in ECs within tumors but not normal tissues. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with an oligomeric form of the DR5 ligand Apo2L/TRAIL induced apoptosis in tumor ECs, collapsing blood vessels and reducing tumor growth: Vascular disruption and antitumor activity required DR5 expression on tumor ECs but not malignant cells. These results establish a therapeutic paradigm for proapoptotic receptor agonists as selective tumor vascular disruption agents, providing an alternative, perhaps complementary, strategy to their use as activators of apoptosis in malignant cells.
