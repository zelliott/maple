PDZ domains are very abundant protein interaction domains widespread in nature. A large amount of evidence has underscored the importance of the PDZ interactions in the control of intracellular pathways whose abnormal regulation may lead to the development of several pathologies. This series of minireviews covers different aspects of human PDZ-containing proteins, underlining and discussing new concepts and findings.
