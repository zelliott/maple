All vertebrates possess a series of genes which are homologs of the oncogenic genes of acute transforming retroviruses. Two lines of evidence suggest that these genes may play a role in the development of human malignancy: (1) DNA from a variety of human tumors transforms NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and the transforming genes from a number of carcinomas, sarcomas, and hematological malignancies have been identified as members of a family of genes, the ras family, closely related to the oncogenic genes of the Harvey and Kirsten murine sarcoma viruses; and (2) correlations exist between the chromosomal localizations of certain oncogenes and the chromosomal breakpoints in specific translocations and deletions in certain human malignancies. In three separate hematological malignancies, alterations in more than one oncogenic gene may be involved in the neoplastic process.
