Immune stimulation or interferon administration induces indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and GTP cyclohydrolase activity in humans, resulting, respectively, in tryptophan degradation to kynurenine and in neopterin production. To determine if similar effects result from interleukin 2 (IL-2) administration, plasma tryptophan and urinary kynurenine and neopterin were measured in patients undergoing a phase 1 toxicity trial of recombinant IL-2 given by daily bolus or continuous i.v. administration for 7 days at doses of 1 x 10(5) to 1 x 10(7) units/m2/day. Significant dose-dependent decreases in plasma tryptophan levels and corresponding increases in urinary kynurenine and neopterin were observed. These metabolic effects of IL-2 are probably mediated by induction of gamma-interferon production, although elevated levels of gamma-interferon were not found in the sera of these patients. In view of the indispensable role of tryptophan in synthesis of protein, niacin, and serotonin, we suggest that some of the toxic side effects may be the result of this loss of tryptophan. Since these metabolic changes were detected at relatively low doses of IL-2, these assays provide a highly sensitive means for monitoring in vivo metabolic responses to IL-2 therapy.
