Between 1989-92, 19 patients were transferred from the Department of Oncology to their homes for terminal care. Their care providers were questioned retrospectively. 16 responded. They all recommended other families with cancer patients to care for these patients at home. 14 reported feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, burn-out, insecurity or loneliness. Their most important contacts were nurses from the municipal home care service and the oncologists. Small children were not reported to limit the possibility of care at home. Family and friends were the best source of support during the period following the bereavement.
