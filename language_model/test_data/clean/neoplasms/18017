Australian researchers have contributed significantly to the understanding of DC biology and clinical application over the past 25 years. Active DC research programs are in place in all major centers, pursuing the key questions of DC phylogeny, physiology and clinical applicability. Pre-clinical and clinical research include the pathophysiology of DC in malignancy, autoimmunity, chronic viral infection, chronic renal failure and transplantation medicine. In addition, Australian laboratories have uncovered some of the subtle complexities of DC subsets, often utilizing novel investigational tools discovered in their laboratories. Above all, Australian DC research has benefited from the existence of a potent culture of active collaboration, which has led to key interactions between cellular immunologists, clinician scientists and clinical researchers. These collaborations have led to the emergence of DC research programs that extend from in vitro and animal models of DC biology through each step of clinical translation and into active clinical trials.
