For the past 15 years, the orthopaedic oncology service at the author's institution has used a computer system to aid in the treatment of patients. The system currently uses a DOS or at times a Windows-based program known as FOXPRO which originally was created by an independent company and now is part of the Microsoft systems. This presentation describes the components of this system and defines its use in patient treatment including demographics, office and surgical records, fiscal issues, and research.
