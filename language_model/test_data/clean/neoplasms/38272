Rural cancer patients are often disadvantaged in access to psychological services. We reviewed remote counselling research for psychological support using telephone, videoconferencing, and the Internet as a potential solution. Telephone counselling is the most extensively researched, while there are encouraging findings in emerging research about videoconferencing and Internet-based psychological care. Where no face-to-face psychological service exists, these technologies are promising, yet unproven. Less variable methods are needed to better assess the technology and therapeutic approach for stronger evidence.
