The effect of dose and schedule of continuous i.v. rIL-2 infusions on leucocyte subset counts, activation status of CD56+CD3- natural killer (NK) and CD3+ T lymphocytes, and cytolytic activities of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was studied. A single 4-day course of rIL-2 in escalating doses (0.9-11.5 x 10(6) U/m2 per day) was given to 18 patients with various types of metastatic cancer. The serum IL-2 concentration during rIL-2 therapy ranged between 23 and 64 U/ml and was proportional to the administered rIL-2 dose, as was the rebound lymphocytosis following therapy. Before therapy, the CD56+CD3- NK cells expressed low levels of the p75 chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) and virtually no IL-2R(p55). Most CD3+ T cells were IL-2R(p55-,p75-). Between 2 and 4 days following therapy, i.e. at the time of lymphocytosis, the percentage of CD56+,CD3- NK cells among the lymphocytes had increased proportional to the administered rIL-2 dose. The levels of IL-2R(p75) expression by the CD56+,CD3- NK cells had increased. The percentages of CD3+ T cells expressing IL-2R(p55), HLA-DR and CD45RO had increased proportional to the administered rIL-2 dose. The level of lymphokine- activated killer (LAK) activity against Daudi cells was also positively correlated with rIL-2 dose. Subsequently, seven patients received 4-weekly cycles of rIL-2 (2.9-4.4 x 10(6) U/m2 per day) during 4 consecutive weeks. This schedule led to marked increments in lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, and to increased cytolytic activities compared with pretreatment. We conclude that CD56+,CD3- NK and CD3+ T cells are activated differentially by continuous i.v. rIL-2 proportional to dose and duration of treatment.
