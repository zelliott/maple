The regulation of c-Jun transcriptional activity by Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has become a paradigm for understanding how mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signalling pathways elicit specific changes in gene transcription through selective phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factors. Selective phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK is determined by a specific docking motif in c-Jun, the delta region, which enables JNK to associate physically with c-Jun. Analogous MAP kinase docking motifs have subsequently been found in several other transcription factors, indicating that this is a general mechanism for ensuring specificity of signal transduction. Genetic and biochemical studies in mice, flies and cultured cells have provided evidence that signals relayed by JNK through c-Jun regulate a range of cellular processes including cell proliferation, tumourigenesis, apoptosis and embryonic development. Despite these advances, in most cases, the genes or programs of gene expression downstream of JNK and c-Jun, which control these processes, have not been defined. Here, we review the current understanding of the molecular basis and biological consequences of JNK signalling via c-Jun and highlight some of the mechanistic issues, which remain to be resolved.
