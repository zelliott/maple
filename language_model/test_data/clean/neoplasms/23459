Tumor cells can induce certain cytokines and soluble receptors that have a suppressive effect on the immune system. In this study, we showed that an extracellular portion of a membrane-bound ligand of CD40 (soluble CD40 ligand; sCD40L) was significantly elevated in the serum of cancer patients compared with healthy donors. In addition, PBMCs from cancer patients had a relatively larger population of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), defined as CD33(+)HLA-DR(-) cells, and these cells expressed higher levels of CD40. T-cell proliferation and IFN-Î³ production decreased when stimulated T cells were cocultured with an increased amount of autologous MDSCs. The addition of recombinant monomeric sCD40L enriched MDSCs and had an additive inhibitory effect on T-cell proliferation. PBMCs cultured in vitro with sCD40L also showed an expansion of regulatory T cells (CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+)), as well as induction of cytokines, such as IL-10 and IL-6. Moreover, sCD40L-induced enrichment of programmed death-1-expressing T cells was greater in cancer patients than in healthy donors. Preexisting sCD40L also inhibited IL-12 production from monocytes on activation. These data suggest that the higher levels of sCD40L seen in cancer patients may have an immunosuppressive effect.
