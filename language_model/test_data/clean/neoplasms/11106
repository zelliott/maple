Cancer patients at the end of life take numerous medications. However, it has not been assessed what proportion of patients take unnecessary medications and which patients are at risk for doing so.

Cross-sectional survey of medications utilized by terminally ill ambulatory cancer patients, with the aim of identifying medications considered unnecessary as per explicit criteria. The criteria took into account whether drugs could benefit patients with terminal cancer.

Among 87 patients, 21 (24%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 15.6-34.5%) were taking at least one unnecessary medication, the most common being gastric protectors. In multivariable analyses, patients with Charlson Comobidity Indexâ‰¤1 (OR: 4.49, CI95% 1.32-15.26; p=0.01) or whose medication list had not been reconciled by physicians (OR: 6.38, CI95% 1.21-33.40; p=0.02) were more likely to use an unnecessary medication.

Patients with advanced cancer take many medications considered unnecessary. Medication reconciliation should be performed routinely for these patients.
