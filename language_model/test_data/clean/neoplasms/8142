The assessment of the acceptance of the diets served at the hospital allows the introduction of adjustments to improve the quality of the service provided to hospitalized patients by preventing the complications derived from incorrect nutrition and enhancing their stay in hospital. The goal of the present study was to analyze the acceptance of the menus offered by the Hospital's catering service.

Menus provided by the catering service of the "Sant Joan de Reus" University Hospital.

A total of 160 tray meals consumed were assessed, all chosen at random and corresponding to standard diets and special diets, including puréed food. The assessment was made by two dieticians in the hospital's kitchens. A visual scale was used with the following scores: 0 for a full plate, 1 for residual food amounting to over 75%, 2 from 50% to 75%, 3 more than or equal to 25% and 4 for empty plates.

A total of 68 trays containing a standard diet were analyzed, together with 34 containing special diets and 41 with puréed food. The remains on 36 different courses from the standard diet were analyzed. The mean acceptance score was 3.01 +/- 1.30 in the case of the first courses, 3.24 +/- 1.11 in second courses and 3.53 +/- 0.96 for the desserts. As for special diets, a total of 27 different courses were analyzed. The mean acceptance score was 2.87 +/- 1.38 in the case of the first courses, 3.02 +/- 1.27 in second courses and 3.49 +/- 1.22 for the desserts. The first courses of puréed diets received the worst score of all the dishes served, although the overall mean score was good, 2.76 +/- 1.5.

In general, a good level of acceptance has been observed for the set meals served in the hospital. Knowing which courses have lower acceptance scores allows changes to be proposed to the hospital menus, with their replacement by others with foreseeably better acceptance.
