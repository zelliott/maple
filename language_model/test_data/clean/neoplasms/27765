Twenty-three consecutive malignant effusions from 19 patients submitted for cytologic examination were analyzed for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) content and for DNA analysis by flow cytometry. The study was undertaken to determine if the addition of DNA analysis would improve the sensitivity of cytologic diagnosis and CEA assay. CEA examination was performed on Papanicolaou-stained smears and hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained cell blocks. Final diagnoses were correlated with histologic examination (four patients), clinical and radiologic studies, and follow-up. The malignant effusions in 19 patients were secondary to carcinoma of the breast (5), lung (5), ovary (1), endometrium (1), mucinous carcinoma of the colon (1), unknown primary (1), extraovarian papillary carcinoma (1), mesothelioma (2) and large cell lymphoma (2). The sensitivity of cytologic diagnosis was 100% and specificity 100%. DNA aneuploidy, defined as the presence of two separate peaks in the histogram, was present in 7 of 23 fluids (sensitivity, 30%). Four fluids had insufficient cells for analysis, and one histogram showed debris (following chemotherapy). DNA aneuploidy was detected in effusions secondary to carcinoma of the breast (4), lung (1) and lymphoma (2). Using 5 ng/mL as the cutoff, the sensitivity of CEA was 68%. DNA analysis of cells in malignant effusions is less sensitive than cytologic diagnosis, and CEA assay and is not recommended for routine use in the diagnosis of malignant effusions.
