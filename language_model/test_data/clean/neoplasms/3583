MDX-H210 is a Fab'xFab' bispecific antibody (BsAb) constructed chemically by crosslinking Fab' mAb 520C9 (anti-HER-2/neu) and humanized Fab' mAbH22 (anti-CD64).

This was a phase I dose-escalation study of intravenous MDX-H210 (1-70 mg/m(2)) combined with subcutaneous IFN-gamma, 50 microg/m(2) given 24 h before the BsAb, both drugs being given three times a week for 3 weeks. The major objectives of the study were to define the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MDX-H210 when given with IFN-gamma on this schedule.

The study group comprised 23 patients (19 female, 4 male; median age 51.5 years, range 25-72 years) with advanced HER-2/neu-positive cancers (19 breast, 3 prostate and 1 lung). Inspection of the log plasma MDX-H210 concentrations-time data for both days 1 and 17 of treatment revealed monoexponential decay in the majority of patients with adequate concentration-time data points. The MDX-H210 T(1/2) ranged from 2.9 to 21.9 h. The MDX-H210 C(max) on day 1 (means+/-SD) increased from 0.30+/-0.22 microg/ml at the 1-mg/m(2) dose tier to 86.91+/-6.46 microg/ml at 70 mg/m(2). Equivalent day-17 values were 0.27+/-0.30 microg/ml increasing to 147.85+/-40.23 microg/ml. The MDX-H210 T(max) occurred at or after the end of the infusion for all treatments. The mean MDX-H210 total body clearance (Cl) was in the range 0.01-0.34 ml/min per kg and the mean MDX-H210 apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vd(ss)) in the range 20-170 ml/kg, compatible with distribution primarily limited to the intravascular space. MDX-H210 T(1/2) increased with dose (ANOVA P=0.001) and Cl decreased with dose (ANOVA P=0.006). There were no significant changes in MDX-H210 C(max), AUC, Cl or Vd(ss) between day 1 and day 17.

MDX-H210 pharmacokinetics appeared saturable over the dose range 1-70 mg/m(2), and there was no significant change in MDXH210 pharmacokinetics over the course of the study, or evidence of excessive accumulation of MDX-H210 on this multiple dosing schedule. When MDX-H210 was combined with IFN-gamma, the estimated MDX-H210 pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to the published data for single-agent MDX-H210.
