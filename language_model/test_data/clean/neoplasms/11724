Medical imaging benefitted from major technological advances during the decade of the 1970s. These newly evolving procedures have been accused of significantly adding to health care expenditures and confusing clinicians in the selection of the appropriate examination. The purpose of this presentation is to place these new technologies in their current perspectives, emphasizing the advantages and limitations of each. To illustrate the appropriate imaging technique, decision trees will be developed for each major anatomic site. In many instance, the complementary rather than competitive nature of these imaging studies will become apparent. Average national charges for these procedures will be shown to illustrate the impact of cost on these decisions. Each imaging decision must still be individualized to the patient and disease, as well as the institution's equipment and professional expertise.
