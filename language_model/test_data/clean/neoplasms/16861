A mortality of 41 percent has so far been recorded from 2.779 cases on the AIDS register. Surgical problems were found to arise only in the terminal stage, when gastro-intestinal, anorectal, pulmonary, neurological, and haematological manifestations have to be expected. Surgical intervention is indicated in situations of massive bleeding, perforations, and mechanical ileus. Opportunistic infections have proved to give rise to the development of gall-bladder empyema and CMV-induced ulcerations. The risk of infection run by medical personnel as well as prophylaxis against AIDS infection of people in contact with HIV infected individuals are described in great detail.
