Although a growing body of evidence suggests a link between diabetes and cancer, it is not clear whether diabetes independently increases the risk of cancer. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the association between pre-existing diabetes and total and site-specific cancer risk based on a pooled analysis of eight cohort studies in Japan (&gt;330 000 subjects). We estimated a summary hazard ratio by pooling study-specific hazard ratios for total and site-specific cancer by using a random-effects model. A statistically increased risk was observed for cancers at specific sites, such as colon (hazard ratio; HR = 1.40), liver (HR = 1.97), pancreas (HR = 1.85) and bile duct (HR = 1.66; men only). Increased risk was also suggested for other sites, and diabetes mellitus was associated with an overall 20% increased risk in total cancer incidence in the Japanese population. The association between these two diseases has important implications for reiterating the importance of controlling lifestyle factors and may suggest a possible strategy for cancer screening among patients with diabetes. Studies continuously investigating the risk factors for diabetes are also important.
