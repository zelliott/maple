Acromegaly is a rare disorder characterized by excess secretion of growth hormone (GH) generally caused by a pituitary macroadenoma and associated with reduced life expectancy if the disease is untreated. This article covers the recent available evidences published on octreotide , the first somatostatin analog introduced into clinical practice for the medical treatment of acromegaly.

This article discusses i) pharmacology of somatostatin and octreotide; ii) biochemical effects of regular octreotide and long-acting repeatable formulation; iii) tumor shrinkage effects of octreotide in acromegaly; iv) impact of octreotide on acromegalic clinical manifestations and chronic complications; v) safety of octreotide and vi) place of octreotide in the guidelines for acromegaly treatment. Full-text articles in the English language were selected from a PubMed search spanning 1984 - 2013, for keywords including 'octreotide,' 'acromegaly,' 'GH,' 'IGF-I,' and 'tumor shrinkage.' Reference lists in selected papers were also used to broaden the search.

Octreotide is a mature drug with a consolidated favorable benefit versus risks profile in the treatment of acromegaly.
