A capillary gas chromatographic method is described for the determination of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) in the urine of normal human and cancer patients. Morning urine after acid hydrolysis is cleaned up on a silica gel column and derivatized with trifluoroacetic-anhydride. Creatinine in human urine is used as internal standard. Recoveries of polyamines are 96.7% putrescine, 102.6% spermidine (Spd), and 98.7% spermine. SD of the method for Spd is 1.949 +/- 0.041 (micrograms/mg creatinine, mean +/- SD, n = 5). The results show that the mean level of polyamines in cancer patients urine is much higher than that in normal human urine. The mean of total polyamines in the normal human and the cancer patients is 2.01 and 44.74, respectively (g/mg creatinine).
