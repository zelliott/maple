Incidence rates for a number of cancers in urban Shanghai, China, have been changing markedly. Herein we update the trends using population-based data from the Shanghai Cancer Registry for 1972-1994. During 1993-1994, cancers of the lung, stomach, and liver were the 3 leading forms among men, with age-adjusted (world standard) incidence rates of 50.9, 39.2, and 26.5 per 100,000 person-years, respectively, followed by cancers of the colon (12.4) and esophagus (10.0). Among women, cancers of the breast (27.5), stomach (19.1), and lung (17.7) were the most common tumors, followed by cancers of the colon (11.3) and liver (9.4). Over the 23-year period, the rate for all cancers combined, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, decreased from 247.5 to 215.2 among men and from 173.6 to 154.0 among women. However, trends for individual forms of cancer varied considerably. Rates doubled for cancers of the colon and biliary tract in both sexes, and they increased substantially for cancers of the brain and nervous system, kidney, pancreas, prostate, corpus uteri, female breast, and ovary, and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Rates for cancers of the lung and rectum changed little. Rates declined by at least one-half for cancers of the esophagus and cervix, with notable decreases also for cancers of the stomach and liver. Some of these trends may reflect variations in diagnostic or screening practices, although changes in lifestyle and other environmental exposures are likely to play important roles. Further epidemiologic research in China is needed to identify risk factors influencing the cancer incidence trends.
