Epigenetic changes occurring during the development of organisms can be altered by the presence of synthetic substances in the environment, resulting in developmental reprogramming and disease. The occurrence of such changes supports the theory that diseases might be cured by altering the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, either directly by modifying the control of the misregulated genes that cause a disease, or indirectly by 'reprogramming' cells toward a 'normal' gene expression pattern. Launched drugs that inhibit DNA methyltransferases or histone deacetylases and lead to epigenetic changes are currently in use for the treatment of cancer. In addition, recent advancements in the understanding of epigenetic mechanisms involved in tumor development and neurodisorders have enabled new approaches for the development of specific epigenetic therapies.
