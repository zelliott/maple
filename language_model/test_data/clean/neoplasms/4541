8 years after the beginning of a german state financed project concerning the psychosocial care of children with cancer and their families 52 german children's oncology units were asked about their present psychosocial staff. The situation of psychosocial care in children with cancer is very good, as most of the staff are employed on a long term basis, financed by the german health insurance companies.
