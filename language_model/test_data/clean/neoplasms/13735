Surgery and radiotherapy provide the basis for local and regional control of cancer. The cancer patient has special characteristics that have implications for anesthesia. Tumors may involve the airways and affect ventilation, hemodynamics and intracranial pressure. Remote tumors can occur in endocrine cancer and in paraneoplastic syndromes. Other systemic complications of the cancer patient include hemostatic changes, immunosuppressant anemia and altered metabolism. Radiotherapy causes changes with anesthetic implications when treatment is directed at the head and neck, mediastinum, lung or surgical area. Chemotherapy is associated with non-specific toxic effects such as mucositis, aplasia and immunosuppression, alopecia and vascular injury; in addition, each chemical has other more specific toxic effects. Chemicals that are toxic for the heart and lungs have the greatest implications for anesthesia. Preoperative assessment should ascertain the effects caused by both the tumor and its treatment. Preparation for surgery includes improving nutrition and possibly inserting a venous port. Management during surgery depends on type of intervention and the patient's physical status, as they will determine the need for invasive monitoring and vessel access. The patient can be given antiemetic and antithrombotic prophylaxis. Important issues in postoperative care are the need for adequate analgesia; provision of early nutrition; antibiotic, antithrombotic and antiemetic prophylaxis; and prevention of ulcers caused by pressure.
