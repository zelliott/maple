The effects of conventional systemic chemotherapy are very modest, while the side-effects are very severe. Thus, intratumoral chemotherapy emerges as a new adjuvant treatment modality due to its several potential advantages. However, most researchers currently select only single cytotoxic drug as model drug at present studies, while ignore the combination administration. So, we hypothesize whether we can integrate the advantages of combination chemotherapy and intratumoral chemotherapy to achieve good antitumour effectiveness and minimal systemic side-effects and resistance. We propose that several drugs based on the cancer cell cycle are reserved in the microsphere-gel. Firstly, cell cycle specific agents (CCSA) are encapsulated into microspheres, then cell cycle non-specific agents and CCSA-loaded microspheres are dispersed into pre-gel solution. Eventually the goal of sequential, intermittent and combination chemotherapy is achieved. Therefore, the hypothesis has the potential application to treat cancer owing to its advantages of targeting effect, high efficiency, low side-effects and resistance, convenience.
