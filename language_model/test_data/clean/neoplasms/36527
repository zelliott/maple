A total of 51 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains had been isolated over a year from patients with tumor diseases in the National Institute of Oncology in Bratislava. All strains were subjected to serotyping; in 45 strains quantitative susceptibility to selected antibiotics was determined by the microdilution method. When comparing susceptibility of individual serotypes, resistance of strains belonging to serotype O12 to a number of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside and quinolone antibiotics was found. In addition, resistant strains occurred even among serotype O4 and polyagglutinating strains. The resistant strains as causative agents of nosocomial infections may represent a serious risk particularly for patients of oncological wards.
