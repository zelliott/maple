Originally described for its capacity to induce hemorrhagic necrosis of transplantable tumors in mice, TNF-alpha also exerts cytotoxic effects against some tumor cell lines in vitro. It is now known that TNF is an essential mediator of cellular immunity and a wide variety of biological activities of TNF in vitro and in vivo has been reported. TNF is an important mediator of inflammation and is involved during the pathogenesis of several auto-immune, infectious or cancer diseases. While some immunomodulatory properties of TNF have at least been partially elucidated, the biochemical basis of TNF cytotoxic action remains largely unknown. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of TNF susceptibility have yet to be clarified. Clinical studies with recombinant TNF as an anticancer agent are encouraging. Multiple phase I and phase II trials have been carried out without major therapeutic effect. In fact, TNF resistance and TNF-induced systemic toxicity are two major limitations for the use of TNF as an antineoplastic agent. The clinical application of human TNF remains an area of active research and innovative approaches such as gene therapy need to be elaborated. The elucidation of the process of lysis and the modulation of TNF resistance are crucial to the future development of TNF and its use in antitumor therapy.
