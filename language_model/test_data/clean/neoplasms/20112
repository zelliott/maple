Hereditary cancer syndromes are generally produced by the inheritance of a single mutant gene. New tools have been developed that enable research workers to locate the defective genes responsible for the inherited forms of cancer. Once a disease gene has been localized, it may be possible to identify individuals who have inherited the disease gene before cancer develops.
