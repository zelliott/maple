The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction of heat and chemotherapy in experimental whole body hyperthermia (WBH). A vascular technique of extracorporeal perfusion was employed to rapidly elevate body temperature in rabbits carrying the transplantable VX-2 carcinoma. Hyperthermia (greater than 41 degrees C) was achieved in a mean time of 28 minutes. Tumor-bearing rabbits receiving WBH alone exhibited poor mean survival (14 days) relative to untreated tumor-bearing animals (32 days) and the group receiving IV Cis-platinum alone (50 days) (NS, p less than .05 respectively). WBH with Cis-platinum was intermediate in terms of mean survival (30 days, NS) between the WBH alone and Cis-platinum alone groups. In this experimental model we have determined WBH to be a detrimental form of cancer therapy. Its action appears to enhance tumor proliferation, resulting in rapid animal demise. In light of these findings a reevaluation of clinical WBH may be warranted.
