This study measures quality of palliative care in 181 family members (i.e. spouse, child) to cancer victims with terminal disease 1 month after the time of death. The specific aim was to explore the underlying factor structure and dimensionality of the 20 items of the FAMCARE Scale, measuring family satisfaction with health care given to the patient and to them. The results from a factor analysis, a Mokken Scaling Program analysis, and a reliability analysis, showed that 19 out of the 20 items form a strong one-dimensional scale. Since the scale is one-dimensional, the possibility of reducing the number of items should be explored in future research. Our recommendation is to measure satisfaction with care 1-2 months after the death of the patient. One should also explore the possibilities of measuring satisfaction with care prospectively as an integral part of the palliative care program.
