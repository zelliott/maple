One of the prime nutritional concerns in cancer patients is cachexia and deteriorating nutritional status. Cachexia can occur as a result of either treatment or the tumor itself. The progressive malnutrition ultimately affects performance status and organ function. Tolerance to treatment may thus be decreased, which, in turn, may adversely affect toxicity and response. In addition, the deleterious effects of malnutrition on the immune system can increase susceptibility to infection. The weakness and fatigue related to muscle wasting and changes in metabolism affect physical appearance, leading to a loss of self-esteem. Thus, the vicious cycle of cachexia severely impacts on every aspect of daily life. Providing nutritional support and effective treatment may reverse the cachexia. Studies involving caloric supplements alone have not been encouraging. Conversely, studies using megestrol acetate have shown that cancer patients gain weight and that their sense of well-being improves. However, the mechanisms of weight gain remain unknown, and further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms by which appetite is stimulated or catabolism is inhibited or both. Nursing interventions to stimulate appetite and promote greater food intake, coupled with the use of agents that alter metabolism, such as megestrol acetate, may reverse the trend of cachexia and thus provide an increased sense of well-being and improved quality of life.
