We have shown tumor-targeting and antitumor activities of an attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis in various tumor models. Meanwhile, host factors, including innate and adaptive immune responses, play roles in Salmonella-induced antitumor activity. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is identified as a signaling receptor for lipopolysaccharide derived from Gram-negative bacteria. However, the detailed mechanism of the S. choleraesuis-induced antitumor immune response via TLR4 remained uncertain.

Herein, we used wild-type C3H/HeN mice and TLR4-deficient C3H/HeJ mice to study the role of TLR4 in the antitumor immune responses induced by S. choleraesuis.

The amounts of S. choleraesuis were cleared more rapidly from the normal organs in C3H/HeN mice than those in C3H/HeJ mice. Tumors in C3H/HeN mice treated with S. choleraesuis were significantly smaller than those treated with PBS. By contrast, in TLR4-deficient mice, there was a slight difference in inhibition of tumor growth. Meanwhile, we found that S. choleraesuis significantly up-regulated IFN-gamma, IFN-inducible chemokines CXCL9 (MIG), and CXCL10 (IP-10) productions in C3H/HeN mice, but not in C3H/HeJ mice. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of the tumors revealed less intratumoral microvessel density, more infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and cell death in C3H/HeN mice after S. choleraesuis treatment compared with those in C3H/HeJ mice. The interaction between TLR4 and S. choleraesuis seemed to polarize the T-cell response to a T helper 1-dominant state.

These results suggest TLR4 may play an important role in the molecular mechanism of S. choleraesuis-induced host antitumor responses.
