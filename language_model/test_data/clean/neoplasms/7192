Contraindications to the use of estroprogestational agents must be critically and completely evaluated before any oral contraceptive (OC) prescription.  Antecedents of cholestasis during pregnancy, jaundice, vascular lithiasis, hepato-cellular adenomas, or viral hepatitis are sure contradindications to OC use because of possible hepatic pathology, while antecedents of thromboembolic or cardiovascular accidents are contraindications because of the possible cardiovascular pathology.  In the adolescent and premenopausal women any irregularities in the menstrual cycle would advise against OC prescription, just as any form of benign or malignant gynecological tumor would be a contraindication at any age.  Prescription of OC is contraindicated in patients under treatment with several kinds of analgesics, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, barbiturates, and tranquilizers, since such drugs usually interfere with the contraceptive action of OCs.  Another absolute contraindication to OC treatment is pregnancy, even if it is not proven that OC treatment immediately before or during pregnancy can increase the risk of teratogenic effects.  OCs can diminish the volume and duration of lactation in breastfeeding women; it is also possible that steroids and their metabolites can pass into maternal milk in minimal doses.  The most important factors of risk are smoking, especially in women over 40, hypertension, hyperlipemia and diabetes, whether latent or real.  It must be remembered, however, that risk of maternal mortality in Western Europe is 5-35/100,000 births, while risk of mortality because of OC treatment is only 3/100,000.
