A 50-year-old man with psoriatic arthropathy was examined for a painful mass in the left cubital fossa. The clinical findings indicated a tumor or infection. Computed tomographic scanning and bone scintigraphy also raised the possibility of a malignant lesion. Surgical exploration revealed that the mass was a chronically inflamed bicipitoradial bursa adherent to the biceps tendon. This is a rare condition, with only a handful of cases described in the literature. This is the first scintigraphic case reported. The imaging features of the bursa are discussed in terms of the anatomy.
