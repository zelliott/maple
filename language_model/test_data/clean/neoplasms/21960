The tumor microenvironment comprises many cell types including infiltrating immune cells such as lymphocytes, endothelial cells and a complex stroma consisting mainly of fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are heterogeneous and consist of Thy-1+ and Thy-1- subsets that define different biosynthetic and differentiation potential. They produce mediators linked to carcinogenesis and metastasis, including Cox-2 and PGE2, both of which are also increased in most cancers. This review will highlight the emerging role of the complex fibroblastic stroma in establishing a microenvironment supporting malignant transformation, tumor growth and attenuation of host anti-tumor immune responses.
