The first year of running a new continuing Care Unit for patients with malignant disease demonstrated the importance of continuity of care in their management after curative measures have ceased to be appropriate. This was achieved by regular home visiting by Unit ataff, liaison with home care services and the promise of readmission whenever necessary. As a consequence good relationships with patients, relatives and community services were built up, the average duration of in-patient stay was reduced to 19.6 days and more effective episode care was possible, this being integrated with an understanding of the overall problem.
