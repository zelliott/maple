Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a multifunctional cytokine, which plays a role in growth-promotion and differentiation, regulates calcium and bone metabolism, induces acute phase proteins and causes cachexia in organisms with neoplastic disorders. Moreover, LIF participates in the induction of inflammation, and therefore represents an important pathogenic factor of many disorders. The multifunctional properties of LIF have become of special interest to investigators from different disciplines of medicine.
