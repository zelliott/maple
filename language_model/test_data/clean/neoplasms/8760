We conducted a prospective cohort study in a single tertiary hospital with the aim of assessing predictors of multidrug-resistant bacteremia in 307 cases of febrile neutropenia in adult patients with cancer. On multivariate analysis using stepwise logistic regression, age (P = .009), duration of neutropenia (P = .022), and presence of an indwelling central venous catheter (P = .022) were associated with bloodstream infection by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
