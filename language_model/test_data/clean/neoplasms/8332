As a result of a major social and demographic transition, Colombia is currently undergoing major changes in disease-specific mortality rates, including an increasing burden of cancer death. The current article described some aspects of the evolution of cancer mortality in Colombia and, in particular, highlighted the trends for the most common causes of cancer death in Colombia.

Cancer deaths registered in the national mortality database from 1981-1996 were used to obtain age-standardized mortality rates by gender and site using the world standard population. The estimated annual percentage change was obtained by fitting a simple log-linear model to the rates in the last decade of recorded data, to gauge recent and near-future cancer mortality trends.

Between 1987 and 1996, the most common causes of cancer death were gastric carcinoma (17% of all cancer deaths), followed by lung (10.5%), prostate (6.2%), cervical (6%), and colorectal carcinoma (5.4%). There were observed declines in mortality trends noted in both genders for gastric carcinoma. Trends in lung carcinoma appeared to be reaching a plateau among men, but increased among women. There were apparent increases in rates of death from colorectal carcinoma for both genders, and from prostate carcinoma for men. Cervical carcinoma appeared to be increasing moderately.

The authors reported that mortality rates from the most common malignancies are increasing, indicating that effective strategies for cancer control need to be put into immediate practice. To monitor and evaluate future trends, the provision of high-quality data also needs to be addressed.
