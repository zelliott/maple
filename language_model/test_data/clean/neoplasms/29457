To explore the effect of Chinese drugs for supporting essence and strengthening Pi ( SESP) combining with chemotherapy on the quality of life (QOL) in the children with solid tumor.

Using a digital table, 146 children with solid tumor were randomized into two groups, 77 in the control group and 69 in the treated group. They received conventional chemotherapy, but to the patients in the treated group, SESP were administered additionally. The patients' scores of QOL and adverse reaction occurred were compared.

The states in the treated group were superior to those in the control group. Statistical analysis showed that in the first year, the two groups were different in terms of somatic function, systemic symptoms, and general status (P&lt;0.05) and also in the occurrence of adverse reaction (P&lt;0.01). In the second year, the difference was shown in aspects of somatic function and adverse reaction occurrence (P&lt;0.05).

Chinese drugs for SESP combining with chemotherapy could raise tumor patients' QOL by improving their somatic function and clinical symptoms.
