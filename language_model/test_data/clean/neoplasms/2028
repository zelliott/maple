Hospice is a program which aims at increasing the quality of life of terminally ill cancer patients. For this purpose the following four factors are important. (1) Symptom control: If patients have pain and other uncomfortable symptoms, they cannot experience life to the fullest; therefore the quality of life for them retrogresses to a low level. (2) Good communication: Good and meaningful communication between patient and family, patient and staff, and family and staff is the key. (3) Individualized care: Even if patients become very weak, they still have ability to do certain things. It is very important for staff to find out the level of the patient's ability so that they can give the patient opportunities to utilize the ability remaining. (4) Spiritual care: If patients have fear of death, concerns about life after death, guilt feelings, etc., assistance and care from the chaplain becomes important.
