There is evidence that anthracyclins may affect the heart and ventricular function. This cardiac toxicity is frequent and serious. It is the first study in Morocco to investigate the frequency of anthracyclins cardiotoxicity. It has for objective to analyze the cardiotoxicity connected to anthracyclins, these risk factors as well as the echocardiographic parameters, which deteriorate prematurely. We led a forward-looking study between October 2008 and December 2009. With 90 patients followed in the service of oncology-radiotherapy and put under chemotherapy with anthracyclins. We conducted a study of various ultrasound parameters of cardiac function, before with anthracyclins, the third cure of chemotherapy, then in the 6th cure of treatment. Only 70 patients have been assessable. Average age was of 47 years (20-68 years); 91% were female. The cardiac function was preserved in 40% of the cases. Among our patients, 56% developed a decrease moderated in light of the cardiac function and 4% of cases developed a severe cardiotoxicity. The echocardiographic parameter most significant in our series was LVEF, followed by TEI index. We found a cardiotoxicity was strictly correlated with the cumulative dose, anthracyclins type and associated comorbidity. The anthracyclins cardiotoxicity is quite common in our series, which requires more thorough preventive measures including monitoring by echocardiography.
