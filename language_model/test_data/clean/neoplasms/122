This article reviews the two most common hormones that act as tumor markers, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and prolactin, and the two most common oncofetal proteins, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and alpha-feto-protein (AFP). Assays for these markers are discussed in terms of their methodologies and performance in the clinical setting.
