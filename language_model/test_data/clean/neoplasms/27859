Of them only seven cases were younger than 18 years of age, ranging from 6 to 17 years, and they were all caused by mediastinal tumor. The underlying malignancy included malignant lymphoma in 4, teratocarcinoma in one and unknown in 2.

Two of them expired 4 months and 2 years after treatment, respectively.
