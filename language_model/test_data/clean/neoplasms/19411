The study of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) is one of the fastest growing areas of neuropharmacology. The Fifth International Meeting on Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors, held September 18-23, 2005, in Taormina, Sicily, Italy, encompassed more than 80 oral presentations and 70 poster presentations. The role of mGluRs in various physiological and pathological conditions, such as learning and memory, modulation of sensory inputs, control of movement, schizophrenia, anxiety, seizures, addiction to drugs, neurodegeneration and developmental regulation of synaptic circuits, was discussed.
