A broad view of genetic susceptibility in humans suggests that high-penetrance hereditary genes cause a number of relatively uncommon tumours in the familial setting, while common cancers are Influenced by multiple susceptibility loci. Early investigations of the latter category focused on the role of genes In the metabolism of carcinogens (activation, detoxification) while current and planned studies extend to genes with diverse mechanisms involving DNA repair, cell cycle control, nutrient metabolism and other processes. The present report considers some methodological issues pertinent to the study of the common genes, focusing in particular on the selection of appropriate candidates for study.
