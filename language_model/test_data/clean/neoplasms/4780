The MYC oncogene contributes to the genesis of many human cancers. Recent insights into its expression and function have led to therapeutic opportunities. MYC's activation by bromodomain proteins could be inhibited by drug-like molecules, resulting in tumor inhibition inÂ vivo. Tumor growth can also be curbed by pharmacologically uncoupling bioenergetic pathways involving glucose or glutamine metabolism from Myc-induced cellular biomass accumulation. Other approaches to halt Myc on the path to cancer involve targeting Myc-Max dimerization or Myc-induced microRNA expression. Here the richness of our understanding of MYC is reviewed, highlighting new biological insights and opportunities for cancer therapies.
