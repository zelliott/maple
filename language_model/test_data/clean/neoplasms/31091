The authors explored changes in dietary behavior, nutrition knowledge, and parental support among inner-city, low-income, Hispanic American families. Thirty-eight families were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week, culture-specific dietary intervention or be in a control group. Results showed that parental support was related to changes in diet, nutrition knowledge, and attendance for both mothers and children. Dietary behavior changes (e.g., reduction in dietary fat) were seen only in the treatment group. Distribution of health-related pamphlets to the control group may have promoted cognitive changes (e.g., increased nutrition knowledge) seen in this low-literacy sample. Further research is needed to document behavioral changes after ethnic-specific interventions and the maintenance of those changes over time.
