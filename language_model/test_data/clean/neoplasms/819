To collect data on the prevalence of various types of cancer pain in a sample of children with cancer, and to implement the WHO Analgesic Ladder in the management of pain in pediatric cancer.

Eighty four pediatric patients suffering of cancer pain were studied during the period 2001-2006. Patients were requested to rate their global intensity of pain on 0-100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS 0 = no pain, 100 = maximum pain). Pain management was performed in accordance with the WHO Analgesic Ladder for cancer pain. Patients were followed up weekly for three weeks.

Of the 84 pediatric children with cancer, pain was nociceptive in 26 (31%), neuropathic in 12 (14.3%) and mixed in 46 (54.8%). Almost 7 (8.3%) of patients were on WHO step 3 at baseline. Thereafter the WHO step 3 increased; first week visit 36 (43%) patients; second week visit 58 (69%), and third week 69 (82.1%). At baseline, 40 (47.6%) patients took NSAID only, 2 (2.4%) patients took adjuvant, while 38 (45.2 %) patients took combination of NSAID and adjuvant treatment. There was statistically significant (p = 0.000) reduction in VAS as time progressed.

Cancer pain in pediatric age group can be well managed in accordance with the WHO Analgesic Ladder. Aggressive symptoms and control of treatment of related side effect are also needed to ensure successful implementation and the WHO Analgesic Ladder.
