The leukocyte migration inhibition test in agarose technique was standardized as far as possible. The greatest interassay variance is not more than 10%, the greatest intraassay variance less than 5%. The test was carried out as a two-step technique in a homologous system. Such variances have not been obtained when an autologous system was used. Myelin basic protein was used as antigen. Migration inhibitions greater than 43% were measured in 66% of the controls (22 healthy persons, 22 patients with non malignant diseases), 30% of the patients with malignancies showed migration inhibitions of more than 43% (36 tumor patients without evidence of disease, 27 patients with tumors in progression). These results may reflect a stimulation of the lymphocytes by using myelin basic protein as antigen under the conditions we have used.
