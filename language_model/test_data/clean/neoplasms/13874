The authors examined, using biochemical, cultivation and cytological methods, ascites in 94 patients. They divided the patients into four groups: group 1 (36 patients)--malignant ascites, group 2 (35 patients)--cirrhotic ascites, group 3 (11 patients)--cardial ascites, group 4 (12 patients)--nephrogenic ascites. The authors tried to differentiate malignant ascites from non-malignant, based on biochemical parameters. As the composition of ascites is influenced by some factors (diuretics, dialysis) the authors recommend the use of biochemical analyses of ascites in clinical practice.
