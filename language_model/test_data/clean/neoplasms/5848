Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions play important roles in development and malignancy. Here we discuss molecular events in the control of such transitions: changes in cellular adhesion components, action of oncogenes and tyrosine kinase receptors, as well as activation of transcription factors. In development, epithelial-mesenchymal transitions take place in a temporally and spatially controlled manner, whereas in tumors these changes are highly uncontrolled. Loss of epithelial character is typically observed late in progression of human carcinomas, and correlates there with the acquisition of invasive and metastatic potential.
