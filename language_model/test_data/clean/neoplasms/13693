Since in a home care nurse station the arrangement of personnel is planned to carry out patient's home care in accordance with the individual patient's Care Plan, to provide palliative home care to end-stage cancer patients who frequently require extraordinary visits, it is necessary to employ full-time nurses. On the other hand, to make ends meet there must be at least two full-time nurses for every seven end-stage cancer patients in a home care nurse station monthly. However, a home care nurse station taking care of seven end-stage cancer home patients monthly is very rare. According to these circumstances only several special home care nurse stations are able to provide palliative home care to end-stage cancer patient; thus, palliative home care for such patients is generally provided by hospital or doctor's office staff members. Therefore, if the authorities concerned intend to accelerate to care the end-stage cancer patient at home, several additional charges which are able to be claimed in ordinary home care nurse station must be able to be claimed in hospital or doctor's office in the same way.
