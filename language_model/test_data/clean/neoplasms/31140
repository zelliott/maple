The spectrum of cancers advanced by AIDS is disputed. To supplement the register-based investigations, we have studied the occurrence of non-AIDS-defining malignancies in a closely followed population of AIDS patients. The population comprises 255 patients fulfilling CDC's clinical AIDS definition, representing 91% of all adult AIDS patients from Oslo 1983-1995. Full autopsy was performed on 73% of the 211 fatal cases. Adding patients with CD4 cell counts below 200 cells/mm3 to match the US AIDS definition, the population increases to 344, including 225 deceased. The expected number of cancer cases was calculated from age- and sex-specific cancer incidence rates for Oslo 1988-1992. The number of non-AIDS-defining cancers was six (clinical CDC criteria) or eight (US AIDS definition), compared to expected numbers of 0.54 and 1.0, respectively. At autopsy, four of eight cases showed extensive tumor dissemination with involvement of the heart. These observations suggest that (at least some) non-AIDS-defining cancers occur at increased rates and show aggressive growth pattern in AIDS.
