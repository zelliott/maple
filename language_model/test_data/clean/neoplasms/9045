Nanoencapsulation of anticancer drugs improves their therapeutic indices by virtue of the enhanced permeation and retention effect which achieves passive targeting of nanoparticles in tumors. This effect can be significantly enhanced by active targeting of nanovehicles to tumors. Numerous ligands have been proposed and used in various studies with peptides being considered attractive alternatives to antibodies. This is further reinforced by the availability of peptide phage display libraries which offer an unlimited reservoir of target-specific probes. In particular landscape phages with multivalent display of target-specific peptides which enable the phage particle itself to become a nanoplatform creates a paradigm for high throughput selection of nanoprobes setting the stage for personalized cancer management. Despite its promise, this conjugate of combinatorial chemistry and nanotechnology has not made a significant clinical impact in cancer management due to a lack of using robust processes that facilitate scale-up and manufacturing. To this end we proposed the use of phage fusion protein as the navigating modules of novel targeted nanomedicine platforms which are described in this review.
