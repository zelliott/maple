Relatively recent recognition of the particular needs of those who are terminally ill has directed attention to the most humane approaches to the provision of care. The strengths and weaknesses of a number of models for the delivery of terminal care, such as hospital-based programs, freestanding facilities, home care services, and day care programs, are reviewed and the relevant research literature is critically evaluated with respect to methodology and findings. Although many shortcomings in research design and a lack of comparability between studies are noted, the data on hospice care generally indicate positive outcomes. Future research considerations are proposed.
