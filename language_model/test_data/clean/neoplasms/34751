Most parents of children with cancer have dual primary goals: a primary cancer-directed goal of cure and a primary comfort-related goal of lessening suffering. Early introduction of palliative care principles and practices into their child's treatment is respectful and supportive of these goals. The Individualized Care Planning and Coordination Model is designed to integrate palliative care principles and practices into the ongoing care of children with cancer. Application of the model helps clinicians to generate a comprehensive individualized care plan that is implemented through Individualized Care Coordination processes as detailed here. Clinicians' strong desire to provide compassionate, competent, and sensitive care to the seriously ill child and the child's family can be effectively translated into clinical practice through these processes.
