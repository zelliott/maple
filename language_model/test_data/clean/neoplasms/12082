This report concerns the in vitro reactivity of lymphocytes obtained from regional (draining) lymph nodes, distant nodes and peripheral blood against autochthonous spontaneous neoplasms. Tumors, blood and lymph nodes were collected aseptically prior to necropsy. Primary tumor cultures were established. Viable tumor cells were first incubated with media or autologous sera and then various numbers of lymphocytes were added. The mixtures were rotated for 60 minutes and then plated. Two and/or five days later cultures were terminated and viable target cells counted. The results of the tests were similar regardless of the lymphocyte source utilized. In vitro tumor cell cytotoxicity by high numbers (1000:1 lymphocytes to tumor cells) of any autologous lymphocytes and interference of such reactivity by autologous sera were demonstrated. Low numbers (100:1) of any lymphocyte source lead to tumor growth stimulation. Animals with spontaneous neoplasms are probably the best model for the study of human clinical oncology. Our data demonstrate that in these animals lymphocytes obtained from regional nodes were not unique in their reactivity to tumors. It is possible that early in the disease the draining node may play a vital role in initiation of host response; however, later its importance probably diminishes.
