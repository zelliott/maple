Delays between the onset of symptoms, consulting the doctor and the diagnosis are important periods for the success of oncologic treatment. They may depend on the patient's socio-economic status, qualification, relationship with the doctor and the health care system.

Hundred and ten cancer patients were questioned about their age, social status, qualifications and experiences on delay in the diagnostic procedures and frequency of regular attendance by their family doctors.

It was found that 67% of the patients visited the family doctor only when they had symptoms. At the time of the onset of symptoms, 45% of the patients visited family doctors. In case of symptoms suggesting cancer, a longer delay was observed in men than in women; 44% of men while 50% of women were diagnosed within one month. The longest delay was observed in a small proportion of patients over 60 years of age with university degree, while the shortest periods were reported in those with secondary school and university degrees. Patients with low income were overrepresented in all delay categories.

Family physicians may play an important role in the primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of tumors but these advantages are not exploited in the relationship between family doctors and their patients.
