Flavone acetic acid (FAA) is an antineoplastic agent that has undergone extensive study in Phase I trials. Concentration-dependent plasma protein binding has been demonstrated in vitro at concentrations of total drug that are achieved in vivo. Moreover, dose-dependent total systemic clearance has been described when FAA has been administered as a short iv infusion. When administered as a prolonged 24-hr infusion, total FAA (bound plus unbound) plasma pharmacokinetics are well described with a first-order two-compartment model. However, measurement of unbound FAA intra- and post-intravenous infusion in eight patients revealed a twofold increase in fraction of FAA unbound in plasma intrainfusion. We attempted to fit pharmacokinetic structural models of varying complexity to the unbound concentrations alone and simultaneously to the unbound and bound FAA plasma concentrations. The data were adequately described only by a model that incorporated simultaneous saturable plasma protein binding and a Michaelis-Menten process for elimination. A comparison among models is presented, as well as pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for FAA in children. These clinical data are consistent with predictions of the clearance model in which both saturable protein binding (resulting in a dynamically increasing unbound fraction) and saturable elimination (resulting in gradually decreasing unbound intrinsic clearance) are operative.
