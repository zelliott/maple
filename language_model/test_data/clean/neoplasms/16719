This paper proposes an exploration of interfaces between discourse, knowledge and experience of cancer within the life story of a patient suffering from cancer. This life story was collected in the context of a study in clinical anthropology on the cancer experience conducted within a French-speaking population of cancer patients in the province of Qu√©bec, Canada. The theoretical model was based upon the cultural hermeneutic approach of Good and Good. Perspectives for clinical practice are suggested concerning the status of popular medical knowledge in modern clinical culture, and the gap between patient experience and the discourse about cancer.
