Proteasome antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in two of the 45 (4.4%) patients with lung cancer, 0 of the 39 patients with breast cancer and six of the 51 (11.8%) patients with ovarian cancer. Six of the 47 (12.8%) patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis had proteasome antibodies, as well as two of the 100 (2%) blood donors. Significant higher odds ratios compared to the blood donors were found for the patients with ovarian cancer (OR: 6.4; 95% CI: 1.1-68) and multiple sclerosis (OR: 7.1; 95% CI: 1.2-74). There was no association between proteasome antibodies and metastases or onconeural antibodies. The antibodies showed reactivity to 23, 25 and 27 kD proteins of the 20S proteasome using Western blot. The increased prevalence of proteasome antibodies in patients with ovarian cancer or multiple sclerosis may reflect cellular damage and release of intracellular antigens. Whether the antibodies take part in the clearance of released proteasomes and thus participate in the pathogenesis of cancer or autoimmune disease is not known.
