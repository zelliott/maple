We examined plasma antigen levels of tissue factor (TF) in 95 cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), to investigate the role of TF in DIC. A significant elevation of plasma antigen levels of TF was observed in cases of DIC associated with cancer. However, no such significant elevation was observed in cases of DIC associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), acute leukemia except APL, blastic crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), sepsis or fulminant hepatitis. No significant elevation of TF was observed in patients without DIC, except 4 cases of cancer who developed DIC thereafter. Plasma antigen levels of TF were higher in both cases of DIC with renal failure and chronic renal failure without DIC than its levels in those without renal failure. Therefore, plasma antigen levels of TF in DIC patients with renal failure were considered to be carefully estimated. The levels of TF were decreased with the clinical improvement in some cases of DIC but were further increased or remained at high levels in patients who showed no improvement of DIC. Thus, plasma antigen levels of TF is an important marker to predict the development and/or prognosis of DIC, especially in patients with cancer.
