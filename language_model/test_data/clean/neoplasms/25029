Palliative care is an interdisciplinary and holistic approach aimed at alleviating suffering from physical, psychosocial, and spiritual issues in progressive, advanced disease. Progressive fatigue and anorexia-cachexia syndrome can contribute to loss of physical function in the palliative cancer patient, to the detriment of overall quality of life. Physical activity is one potential intervention, which may address these needs in the palliative cancer patient. There is preliminary evidence that at least some palliative cancer patients are willing and able to tolerate physical activity interventions, with some patients demonstrating improvement in select supportive care outcomes postintervention. Methodologically rigorous studies and consensus on common definitions are required to advance this area of research.
