Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) belongs to the group of proteins called molecular chaperones protecting normal and tumour cells against many stressors such as hyperthermia, several commonly used chemotherapeutics as well as other apoptotic stimuli. Our study was designed to determine whether heat shock and drugs like cisplatin, etoposide and quercetin have an effect on the expression of heat shock protein 27 in tumour cells such as: HeLa (cervical cancer), Hep-2 (larynx cancer), A549 (lung cancer) and also in normal human skin fibroblasts (HSF) cultured in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) conditions. Our results indicate that Hsp27 expression is drug- and cell-type specific and depends on the culture model as well. HeLa, Hep-2 and HSF cell cultured in 3D model appeared to be more resistant to stimulatory or inhibitory effects of the applied drugs than cells cultured in 2D model. Only A549 cells cultured in 3D culture model appeared to be more susceptible and reacted to drugs and heat treatment with increased Hsp27 expression.
