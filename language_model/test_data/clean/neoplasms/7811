From 1977 to 1982, 62 patients with various advanced malignant solid tumors were treated by HD-MTX-CFR therapy and totally 129 courses were given. Majority of the patients suffered from malignant lymphoma (10), osteogenic sarcoma (11), lung cancer (16), esophageal cancer (3), breast cancer (3) and malignant melanoma (4). All were confirmed by cytology or pathology except one primary liver cancer. There were clinically measurable lesions in 59 patients for evaluation of the treatment, and 3 osteogenic sarcoma patients without metastasis were given a postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. 33 out of 62 had received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy before. Dose of MTX ranged from 2 to 3 gm per course in most patients and dose of CF, from 9 to 12 mg every 6 hours for 3 days. 2 (3.4%) patients achieved complete remission (1 osteogenic sarcoma and 1 malignant lymphoma) and 8 (13.6%), partial remission (1 osteogenic sarcoma, 5 malignant lymphoma, 1 esophageal cancer and 1 breast cancer) with a total response rate of 15.9%. No response was observed in all 16 lung cancers. The main side effects of HD-MTX-CFR therapy were leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevation of SGPT, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, skin rash, fever and fatigue. All patients were followed more than 3 years. 4 patients are still alive (9, 9, 4 and 7 years, respectively), including 3 osteogenic sarcoma patients who received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and 1 mycosis fungoides.
