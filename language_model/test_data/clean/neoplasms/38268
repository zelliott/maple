The recent advancements in stem cell (SC) biology have led to the concept of regenerative medicine, which is based on the potential of SC for therapies aimed to facilitate the repair of degenerating or injured tissues. Nonetheless, prior to large scale clinical applications, critical aspects need to be further addressed, including the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SC-based treatments. Most problematic among the risks of SC-based therapies, in addition to the possible rejection or loss of function of the infused cells, is their potential neoplastic transformation. Indeed, SCs may be used to cure devastating diseases, but their specific properties of self-renewal and clonogenicity may render them prone to generate cancers. In this respect, 'Stemness' might be seen as a two-edged sword, its bright side being represented by normal SCs, its dark side by cancer SCs. A better understanding of SC biology will help fulfill the promise of regenerative medicine aimed at curing human pathologies and fighting cancer from its roots.
