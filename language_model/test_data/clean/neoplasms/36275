Cancer as a psychological trauma can result in development of psychopathological disorders (e.g. depression), and also positive changes experienced in numerous domains of life (e.g. greater appreciation of life). Cognitivists tried to explain the potential traumatic impact of the adversities with the phenomenon that most of the people's world concepts are full of positive illusions and they mostly lack the idea that tragedies can occur also with them. However, this naive worldview can be altered by a trauma in a negative way. Moreover, according to the theory of cognitive adaptation certain positive illusions (perception of personal control, self-enhancement, unrealistic optimism, search for meaning) become even more activated by traumatic life events helping the adjustment to the adversity. More recently, researches have succeeded in proving the role of positive illusions in maintaining mental and physical health. The aim of the present study is to review the potential psychological consequences of cancer as a trauma and to display the schema-changes of trauma victims through the phenomenon of positive illusions.
