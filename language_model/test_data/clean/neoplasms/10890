The boundaries of medical science in the treatment of cancer are constantly extending. Developments of existing treatments, innovative approaches, new discoveries, and more targeted therapeutic options are translating into practice. With advances come increasing costs, often of a magnitude that stretches finite financial resources. When decisions about funding are made on behalf of a population, standardized processes and methods are needed in order to produce robust guidance in a fair, consistent, and transparent way. The challenges of making these difficult decisions are brought into particularly stark relief when potentially life-extending treatments for patients with a short life expectancy are appraised. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) produces guidance on the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of medicines compared with current standard practice. Approximately 40% of the technologies appraised by NICE are indicated for cancer, and the majority of these are pharmaceuticals, mostly biological agents. This article provides an overview of the current role of NICE in making new technologies for cancer available in England and Wales. This includes a summary of experiences with end-of-life treatments and the supplementary advice regarding such treatments that was issued by NICE to its decision-making committees in 2009.
