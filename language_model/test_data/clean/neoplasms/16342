Breathlessness represents a significant problem for the person with advanced cancer. Uncontrolled breathlessness ranks highly in terms of uncomfortable symptoms experience, causing pain and distress to the patient and resulting in significant anxiety to their carers. The key to the provision of effective care lies in the informed application of the nursing process, underpinned by a sound knowledge base in relation to the nursing management of breathlessness. Theoretical knowledge enables nursing staff to offer appropriate interventions for the management of breathlessness in collaboration with other members of the multidisciplinary team. This article will discuss the cause and management of breathlessness in the person with advanced cancer; the discussion focuses on the application of research-based interventions and the evaluation of clinical outcomes in a UK clinical governance context.
