To understand fully how a woman copes with cancer, researchers must examine the relational context in which a woman lives, copes, and meets the demands of a life-threatening illness. This paper presents preliminary findings of a study involving thirty-four mothers who have cancer. Survey methods involving a questionnaire were used to look at the relationship of the factors of mutuality, silencing the self schemas, and relationship-focused coping to the psychosocial adaptation to cancer. The findings indicated a significant correlation between silencing the self schemas and health care behaviors. Correlations between mutuality and quality of life approached statistical significance. Based on these findings, suggestions for social work practice with cancer patients and their families are made.
