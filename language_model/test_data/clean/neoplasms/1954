Five cancer patients experienced satisfactory pain relief for periods of 3-156 days using continuous transdermal delivery of the narcotic fentanyl. The patients, aged 16-68 years, had all been experiencing pain and were either unable to take oral analgesic medications or these agents were ineffective in controlling pain. Doses were adjusted to individual patient needs and varied from 75 micrograms/h to 350 micrograms/h (median = 225 micrograms/h). Plasma fentanyl levels reflected the administered dose and remained constant throughout the treatment. Transdermal delivery of narcotics provides a new option for the cancer patient unable to achieve satisfactory analgesia with oral medications.
