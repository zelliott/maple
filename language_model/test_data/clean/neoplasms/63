For the purpose of clarifying the relation between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a follow-up study of 1,614 HBV carriers (910 males and 704 females) was conducted at Kure National Hospital from 1970 to 1984. During the follow-up period (40.3 months on average), 247 HBV carriers died. Deaths from HCC and liver cirrhosis (LC) numbered 99 of 168 males (58.9%) and 38 of 79 females (48.2%), the chi-square test revealing no sex difference. Of 142 deaths from malignant neoplasm, HCC accounted for 52 of 96 males (54.2%) and 19 of 46 females (41.3%), the chi-square test again revealing no sex difference. The adjusted odds ratio of death from HCC among HBV carriers (1,614) with respect to HBV non-carriers (176,909) in this hospital during the study period (14-years) was 9.52 (males 7.94, females 13.39). The expected number of deaths was calculated based on the population of Hiroshima Prefecture (1978-1980) as a standard. The adjusted O/E (observed number/expected number) ratio of death from HCC was 6.66 for males and 12.13 for females, and the adjusted O/E ratio of death from LC was 5.41 for males and 11.02 for females. These findings suggest that HBV is a high risk factor of both HCC and LC, and, unlike the general population, female HBV carriers may have a rather higher risk of death from HCC and LC than male HBV carriers.
