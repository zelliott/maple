Recent studies have identified new melanoma antigens that are recognised by CD4(+) T cells. Analysis of tumour-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses may lead to the development of optimal anti-cancer vaccines that can induce an orchestrated effort of tumour-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the fight against cancer.
