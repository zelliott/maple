The effect of gamma radiation was studied on routine stained chromosomes from lymphocytes of children born to Hodgkin's disease patients after cancer therapy (CP) in comparison to children from healthy parents (HP). Irradiation (0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 1.50 Gy) of the whole blood was performed in culture medium. Metaphases were obtained from 52-h cultures. Chromosomal aberrations were used as an endpoint. Aberrations of both chromosomal and chromatid types were scored in 150-200 metaphases for estimation of spontaneous level of cytogenetic injuries and in 100 metaphases of induced one. It is found that chromosomes of CP children are more radiosensitive than chromosomes of HP ones, the spontaneous frequency of chromosome aberrations being equal in both groups.
