A concept is substantiated that the most common feature of all malignant tumors would be their interference with host metabolism inducing various biochemical, endocrine, and immune disturbances of the host homeostasis which underlies certain neoplastic syndromes. The capacity of malignant tumors to exert hypoglycaemic pressure on the host functioning as a chronic stress factor leads to the activation of the hypothalamus-hypophysis system along with the stimulation of endogenous glucose formation from amino acids and glycerol, an energy-consuming process. The compensatory role of the stimulated lipolysis supplying, in addition to glycerol, free fatty acids and ketone bodies for host tissues as energy sources is emphasized. The adaptative nature of reduced insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in the tumor-bearing host facilitating the synergistic effect of glucagon, catecholamines, and glucocorticoids counteracting hypoglycaemic pressure of the tumor is suggested. A general scheme of relationships between the disturbances of the host homeostasis and their trigger mechanisms is outlined.
