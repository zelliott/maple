The California Tumor Registry, in which 71,215 cases have been entered, provides data for professional and public education which is specific to the state. It has suggested leads for epidemiological investigation of cancer. Participating agencies are assisted in maintaining adequate follow-up systems through annual listing of cases by the State Department of Public Health and removal from the list of cases in which death occurs. Among the first cases analyzed, the diagnosis was confirmed microscopically in 70.6 per cent. Only 36.2 per cent of patients had visited a physician within two months after onset of symptoms. Survival of patients with cancer is compared with their expectancy calculated from life-tables, thus taking account of deaths from causes other than cancer.
