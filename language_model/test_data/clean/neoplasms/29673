The presence of intracellular keratin was examined in 230 human neoplasms using indirect immunofluorescence on fresh frozen, acetone-fixed sections. The use of antikeratin antibodies raised in rabbits against human callus and purified by affinity chromatography proved to be a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method of demonstrating keratin. Epithelial tissues and epithelial-derived neoplasms were found to contain keratin, whereas tissues and neoplasms of mesenchymal, lymphoreticular, or neural crest origin did not contain intracellular keratin. This technic is a useful adjunct for the surgical pathologist in the diagnosis of poorly differentiated neoplasms. Its application either confirmed, modified, or in several instances, changed the original light microscopic impression. The modified or changed diagnoses were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.
