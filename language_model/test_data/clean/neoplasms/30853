Hospitalization and intravenous (IV) broad-spectrum antibiotics are the standard of care for all febrile neutropenic patients with cancer. Recent work suggests that a low-risk population exists who might benefit from an alternate approach.

A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed comparing oral ciprofloxacin 750 mg plus clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours with IV aztreonam 2 g plus clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours for the empiric outpatient treatment of febrile episodes in low-risk neutropenic patients with cancer.

The oral regimen cured 35 of 40 episodes (88% response rate), whereas the IV regimen cured 41 of 43 episodes (95% response rate, P = 0.19). Although the cost of the oral regimen was significantly less than that of the IV regimen (P &lt; 0.0001), it was associated with significant renal toxicity (P &lt; 0.05), which led to early termination of the study. Overall, combining its safety and efficacy, the IV regimen was superior (P = 0.03).

This prospective study suggested that outpatient antibiotic therapy for febrile episodes in low-risk neutropenic patients with cancer is safe and effective. Better oral regimens are needed.
