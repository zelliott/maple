Clinical development of SN38, the active metabolite of camptothecin-11 (CPT-11), has been hampered due to its poor solubility. We have developed a novel polymer-drug conjugate, EZN-2208, made by linking SN38 with a multiarm polyethylene glycol via a glycine linker.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of EZN-2208 was tested using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay. The therapeutic efficacy of EZN-2208 was evaluated in various xenografts, including an in vivo-selected CPT-11-refractory model. Tumor and blood concentration of EZN-2208, CPT-11, and SN38 was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography.

In vitro, EZN-2208 was 10- to 245-fold more potent than CPT-11 in a panel of human tumor cell lines. In xenograft models of MX-1 breast, MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic, or HT-29 colon carcinoma, treatment with either a single dose or multiple injections of EZN-2208 was more efficacious (and in some cases produced tumor eradication for &gt;16 weeks) compared with CPT-11 at their respective maximum tolerated doses or corresponding dose levels (P &lt; 0.01). Most interestingly, EZN-2208 showed marked antitumor activity in animals that developed resistance to an 8-day course of CPT-11 treatment, as well as outperformed CPT-11 as second-round therapy in mice initially sensitive to CPT-11. EZN-2208 had prolonged circulation in the blood compared with CPT-11, resulting in high tumor exposure. This resulted in higher and longer-lasting tumor exposure of free SN38 in mice given EZN-2208 compared with those given CPT-11.

Preclinical data suggest that EZN-2208 may be a promising anticancer agent in a wide variety of clinical settings, including tumors refractory to CPT-11 treatment.
