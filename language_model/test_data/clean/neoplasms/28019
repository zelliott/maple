Cancer genetic services, typically provided by clinicians with expertise in both oncology and genetics, include cancer risk assessment and education, facilitation of genetic testing, pre-and post-test counseling, provision of personally tailored cancer risk management options and recommendations, and psychosocial counseling and support services. All oncology providers should obtain basic information on the family cancer history of their patients to determine the likelihood of hereditary cancer risk as well as possible indications for providing brief or comprehensive cancer genetic counseling. Those who choose to provide these services themselves must be familiar with the complex issues of genetic counseling and testing, and be aware of the time and expertise required to adequately deliver these services. Genetic nurses and genetic counselors with master's degrees function as valuable members of a comprehensive cancer genetic service; they are trained to independently collect and confirm medical and family history information, perform risk assessments, offer patient education regarding cancer and genetics, and provide supportive counseling services for patients and families. It is hoped that specific risk interventions will significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from familial forms of cancer. This review outlines the process of cancer genetic counseling and defines the roles of the cancer genetic counselor and the function of the cancer genetics specialty clinic. The possible medical and legal implications for failing to obtain adequate family history information are reviewed, and the issues of genetic discrimination are discussed.
