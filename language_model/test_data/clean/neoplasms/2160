Thirty-eight permanent central venous catheters were introduced in 28 children as part of the intensive chemotherapeutic treatment for malignant disease. These catheters were employed partly for administration of medicine and partly for sampling blood for control. The total duration of life with a catheter was 7,303 days. On an average, 27 chemotherapeutic agents were administered, 172 supplementary injections and 56 blood samples were performed via the central venous catheter per child. In the present investigation, a frequency of infection of 0.27/100 catheter days was found and an incidence of non-infectious complications resulting in removal of the catheter or adjustment of the catheter of 0.16/100 catheter days. The authors consider that employment of a permanent central venous catheter in paediatric oncology represents considerable progress and that this should be employed in all children to be submitted to prolonged treatment with cancer chemotherapy.
