Anti-albumin antibodies previously described by different authors in viral hepatitis were also investigated in patients with other diseases. Significant titers of such antibodies could be detected -- by passive hemagglutination reactions using a system of bovine serum albumin-coated sheep red blood cells and human sera -- not only in viral hepatitis, but also in infectious mononucleosis cases and in patients with different forms of cancer. Onto-phylogenetic considerations on the significance of these antibodies for different stages of the process of cell de-differentiation or for disorders of intercellular contacts under the action of some viral agents are discussed.
