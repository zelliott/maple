Results of a Phase I study led our group to the conclusion that a radiant heat system provides a safe and effective method of inducing 41.8 degrees C whole body hyperthermia (WBH) which is suitable for combination therapy. The review to follow summarizes our progress in combining WBH with other cancer-treatment modalities, including ionizing irradiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
