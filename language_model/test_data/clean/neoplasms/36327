Cell adhesion mediated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) constitutes essential life phenomenon. In inflammation, immunity, infection, thrombosis, tumor metastasis and wound healing, cell adhesion comes into being the basic physiological and pathological process. Intervening with cell adhesion has been the important therapeutic and prophylactic strategies for diseases. Accumulated evidence has indicated that plant polysaccharides especially those exacted from Chinese traditional and herbal drugs displayed various pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, anti-infection, immunomodulation, cardiovascular protective effects and so on. In this paper, the research progress of plant polysaccharides on cell adhesion is reviewed.
