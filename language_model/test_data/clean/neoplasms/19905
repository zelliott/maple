Ever since its discovery 20 years ago, caspase-2 has been enigmatic and its function somewhat controversial. Although many in vitro studies suggested that caspase-2 was important for apoptosis, demonstrating an in vivo cell death role for this caspase has been more problematic, with caspase-2-deficient mice showing limited, tissue-specific cell death defects. Recent results from different laboratories suggest that at least one of its physiological roles in animals is to protect against cellular stress and transformation. As such, loss of caspase-2 augments tumorigenesis in some mouse models of cancer, assigning a tumour suppressor function to this enigmatic caspase. This review focuses on this seemingly non-apoptotic function of caspase-2 as a tumour suppressor and reconciles some of the recent findings in the field.
