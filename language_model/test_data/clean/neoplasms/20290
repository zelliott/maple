Efforts to understand pain associated with terminal illness have been guided traditionally by the biomedical model in which psychological and environmental factors are considered incidental and not causally significant influences of pain. More recent conceptualizations of pain, however, recognize that pain can be affected by a variety of factors including mood, beliefs about pain, past learning, as well as physical perturbations. This development has led to assessment strategies that are more comprehensive, multidimensional, and less singularly aligned with a biomedical model. The greatest amount of attention to pain among the terminally ill has focused on cancer patients. Thus, in this paper we will describe a comprehensive, multi-dimensional assessment of cancer pain. Information regarding cancer and cancer pain is first presented and then a strategy for comprehensively assessing cancer pain is outlined. Recent developments in the assessment of cancer pain are briefly reviewed.
