Lymphocytes from 180 patients with a variety of malignant diseases were collected and fused with a human myeloma-derived line, LON-LICR-HMy2/CAM1. A total of 162 hybridomas was obtained. Only B lymphocyte markers were found on the surface of the fusion products. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a stably increased DNA content in the hybridoma cells. Some hybridoma supernatants were found to contain new Ig chains. Anti-tumour binding activity was found in 12 supernatants.
