Depression is a risk factor for poor quality of life and mental adjustment to cancer. This research aims to evaluate the course of mental adjustment to illness of cancer patients with anxious-depressive symptoms who receive antidepressant therapy (ADT).

Eighty oncological patients with and without depressive symptoms were divided into three groups. Group 1: 30 depressed cancer patients who underwent ADT with SSRI; Group 2: 30 depressed cancer patients who refused ADT; Group 3: 20 non-depressed cancer patients. Patients were evaluated at tO and 4 (tl) and 12 (t2) weeks later through: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), and MINI-MAC.

HDRS and HARS mean scores were stable and under threshold across the study only in Group 3; at t2 they improved in Group 1 and worsened in Group 2. The improvements in anxiety and depression scores were associated with ADT and related to the changes in Mini-MAC helpless-hopeless, anxious preoccupations, cognitive avoidance and fighting spirit dimensions.

The improvement of mental adjustment to illness is directly related to the decrease of anxious-depressive symptoms among depressed cancer patients under antidepressant therapy.
