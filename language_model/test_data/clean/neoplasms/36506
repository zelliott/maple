Over a six-month period, 47 patients (9.8% of admissions) died within 48 hours of admission to St Christopher's Hospice and were included in this study. There was a high prevalence of symptoms on admission but many were amenable to treatment, even in the short time available. Respiratory symptoms were commonest and the most difficult to control. The majority of the patients required an opioid, although only low doses were needed. Almost all the relatives had no regrets about the place of death. Hospice staff felt that a number of patients transferred from hospital should not have been moved. The study confirmed the value of short terminal admissions to patients and families and suggested areas for further action.
