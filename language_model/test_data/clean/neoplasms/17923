The study of cancer cell chemotaxis on two-dimensional surfaces in vitro has relevance to the diverse migratory behaviours exhibited in vivo that involve a directed path. These may include translocation along collagen fibres, invasion into the basement membrane and across stroma, intravasation and extravasation to arrive at a secondary destination designated for cancer cell colonization. Chemotaxis invariably denotes the ability of cells to sense gradients, polarize, adhere and deadhere to substrate, and translocate in the right direction. Amongst these, the sensing function is perhaps the unifying aspect of different migration styles, permitting the cells to resolve its orientation and path. This review examines the decision-making processes that take place during chemotaxis and illustrates that a universal mechanism is involved. In various cell types from Dictyostelium to neutrophils, there are some unifying principles that dictate sensing and how the putative leading edge and trailing end of cells are determined. Some of these principles have recently been applied in the study of cancer cell chemotaxis albeit different pathways are substituted. In amoeboid-like cancer cells, local excitation of the EGFR/PLCgamma/cofilin pathway and parallel, global inhibition of cofilin by LIMK occur to promote the asymmetric distribution and amplification of these internal signals in response to an external EGF gradient.
