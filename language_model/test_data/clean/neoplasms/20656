Plasma-membrane-enriched particles isolated from the tissues of malignant tumors of different sites are shown to accumulate ATP under the influence of polypeptide growth factors and cytokines whose receptors have a tyrosine kinase activity. Polypeptide growth factors, such as EGF, FGF, NGF, TNF, insulin, and the cytokine IL-2, were studied on the accumulation of adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) by the preparations of plasma-membrane-enriched particles isolated from the target tissues of human malignant tumors. The tumor (transformed) cell plasma membranes of the lung, bowel, stomach, pancreas, as well as the cells of neurinoma and a retroperitoneal extra-organ malignant tumor (leiomyosarcoma) are demonstrated to be able to synthesize ATP from inorganic phosphate and ADP under aerobic conditions human with the participation of the cyanide-insensitive proton phoric NADH-bound transversely oriented chain. Signal-stimulated accumulation of plasma membranous ATP was found to increase in the tissues in malignant transformation as compared to that in normal tissues. Experiments using selective inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (tyrphostin-25, quercetin) indicated the involvement of plasma membranous signal-transducing ATP in the activation of receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors.
