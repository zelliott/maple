Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine with pleiotropic effects on the immune system. Systemic IL-2 treatment has produced durable responses in melanoma and renal cancer patients, but unfortunately this is effective only in a fraction of patients. Moreover, IL-2 treatment also engenders serious side effects, which limit its clinical utility. It is now appreciated that IL-2 not only stimulates NK and effector T cells but also has a critical role in the generation and maintenance of regulatory T cells, which act to dampen immune responses. Thus, successful immunotherapy of cancers using IL-2 has to address two fundamentally important issues: (1) how to limit side effects yet be active where it is needed, and (2) how to preferentially activate effector T cells while limiting the stimulation of Tregs. Strategies are now being developed to address these critical obstacles that may lead to a renaissance of IL-2 therapy.
