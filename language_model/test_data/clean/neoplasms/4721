A key concern for young patients with cancer and survivors is the desire to parent a child. With infertility being a well-established long-term effect of many oncologic regimens, patients who want to have children often become distressed when faced with the possibility of losing their fertility. Several organizations have recommended that oncology professionals discuss options for fertility preservation when planning treatment; however, this does not routinely occur. Oncology nurses play a significant role in filling this practice gap by identifying patients who are interested in future parenting and ensuring they get the information and referrals they need to decide whether to pursue fertility preservation. This article outlines the available options, challenges in discussing fertility, and strategies to incorporate fertility education into practice.
