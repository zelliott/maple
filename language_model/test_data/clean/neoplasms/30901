Dosimetry data arising from a decade of radioimmunotherapy are summarized along with techniques utilized to arrive at the reported dose estimates. Generality of the MIRD methodology allows it to serve as a vehicle for the calculation of solid tumor dosimetry although several limitations exist. Nonstandard geometries of solid tumors will ultimately necessitate determination of absorbed fractions for the individual tumors. Several approaches currently under investigation are described. For reasons of practicality, solid tumor dosimetry estimates continue to use the assumption of homogeneous activity distribution in a source organ, accounting for either all radiation or only nonpenetrating radiation. As computation tools become available for incorporating inhomogeneous cellular level data, the currently used "average dose" as an index of tumor sterilization will likely be replaced with a statistical distribution based on the number of viable cells in the tumor volume. Estimates of a tumor control dose would be based upon a linear extension of dose coupled with a threshold dose for cell sterilization.
