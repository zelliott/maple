The efficacy of antibiotic treatment of port-associated bloodstream infection without device removal has not been systematically studied. We analyzed the outcome of 43 consecutive port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients. Etiologies included Staphylococcus epidermidis (30) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Antibiotics were given through the port for a median of 11 days. Four ports were removed within 72 hours. In 36 (92%) of the remaining 39 episodes, there was a response to antibiotic therapy (defervescence and negative blood culture). In 78% of episodes in which there was a response (excluding two in which the catheters were removed because of mechanical problems), the infections were cured without port removal. Two of the four relapses were cured with a second course of antibiotics. The cure rate was 92% for S. epidermidis infections and 67% for S. aureus infections. Thus, the majority of port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients can be cured without device removal.
