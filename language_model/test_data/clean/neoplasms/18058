Mammalian phospholipase D (PLD), a signal transduction-activated enzyme, hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to generate the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline. Genetic and pharmacological methods have implicated PLD and its product PA in a wide variety of cellular processes including vesicle trafficking, receptor signaling, cell proliferation and survival. Dysregulation of these cell biologic processes occurs in a diverse range of illnesses including cancer. This review summarizes PLD regulation and function and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in disease settings.
