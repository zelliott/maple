Angiogenesis has been a central theme of oncologic research for several years. Recently, improved understanding of its mechanisms has led to the development of several antiangiogenic agents. Some have demonstrated their effectiveness in large randomized studies; however, no antiangiogenic agent has yet been approved for treatment in combination with radiotherapy. Numerous preclinical studies and a few small clinical trials have recently reported encouraging results. The objective of this article is to review the concept of targeted antiangiogenic agents and the early clinical results of their use in combination with radiation therapy.
