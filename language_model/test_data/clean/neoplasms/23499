Focus groups were held involving physicians, medical social workers, and nurses of 6 cancer centers, and the collected data were qualitatively analyzed. A total of 19 categories were examined. They were related to 1 )education for medical health care professionals about palliative care, 2 )public education about palliative care, 3 )specialized palliative care service, and 4 ) constructing a community palliative care network. Additionally, 7 categories related to medical and social systems were analyzed.
