In the present study, we report the synthesis and human growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) specific tumor targeting properties of a dendrimer conjugated to anti-HER2 mAb (monoclonal antibody) conjugate. The polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer generation five (G5) was labeled with alexaFluor 488 and conjugated to anti-HER2 mAb. The binding and internalization of the antibody-conjugated dendrimer to HER2-expressing cells was evaluated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Uniquely, the conjugate demonstrated cellular uptake and internalization in HER2-expressing cells as compared to free antibody. The time course of internalization and blocking experiments with free antibody suggest that the rapid and efficient cellular internalization of the dendrimer-antibody conjugate was achieved without alterations in specificity of targeting. Animal studies demonstrated that the conjugate targets HER2-expressing tumors.
