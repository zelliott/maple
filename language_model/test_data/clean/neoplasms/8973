Bacteremia is the most frequent infectious complication during neutropenia in patients receiving autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The objective of this study was to analyze the incidence, characteristics, risk factors, and outcome of bacteremia during the early period after ASCT. A total of 720 patients undergoing ASCT in two observational prospective consecutive multicenter studies of the Programa Español para el Tratamiento de las Hemopatías group were analyzed. Bacteremia occurred in 20 % of patients. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was the most frequent (66 %) among the gram-positive agents and Escherichia coli (49 %) among the gram-negative agents. Multivariate analysis showed that the length of neutropenia &lt;1 × 10(9)/L (more than 9 days) [relative risk (RR) of 2.6, p &lt; 0.001] was the sole risk factor for overall bacteremia. We identified the length of neutropenia &lt;1 × 10(9)/L (more than 9 days) (RR 4.98, p &lt; 0.001) and the use of prophylactic fluoroquinolones (RR 0.46, p &lt; 0.01) as specific risk factors for gram-negative bacteremia. Risk factors for gram-positive bacteremia were the use of total parenteral nutrition (RR 1.92, p &lt; 0.01) and deep neutropenia (&lt;0.1 × 10(9)/L), with duration over 5 days (RR 1.67, p &lt; 0.027). Bacteremia showed an increased morbidity with no impact on neither overall nor infectious related mortality. The identification of such risk factors may be helpful to implement prophylactic and therapeutic risk-adapted strategies to reduce the incidence of bacteremia in ASCT.
