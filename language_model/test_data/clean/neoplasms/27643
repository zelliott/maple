The incidence and prevalence of cancer will continue to rise in the elderly. Malignancies can present differently and have altered courses in the elderly. Heterogeneity exists within the geriatric population, and chronologic age alone should not be used to exclude older cancer patients from consideration for standard diagnostic therapeutic approaches. Early detection of malignancies in the aged remains a problem, and geriatric screening issues are discussed.
