The occurrence of malignant tumors in leprosy patients was studied in 252 autopsied cases. Malignant tumors were found in 33 out of 110 autopsy cases from 1962 to 1971, and in 51 out of 141 autopsy cases from 1977 to 1989 (until July). In 1974, a lepromatous case with Kaposi's sarcoma was autopsied. The incidence of malignant tumors in our 252 cases were 33.7% (85 out of 252). Carcinoma of the alimentary system was most common: stomach, liver and large intestine, in that order. There was an increased number of hepatocellular carcinoma closely related to liver cirrhosis. Carcinoma of the lung has increased remarkably in leprosy patients quite recently. Malignant lymphoma was the most common of the nonepithelial malignant tumors, and four of these cases were seen in lepromatous leprosy patients. Eight cases showed double or triple cancers; seven of these were autopsied during 1977 to 1989. Further studies should be done to ascertain which types of leprosy showed the highest incidence, and which sex showed more frequent malignant tumors.
