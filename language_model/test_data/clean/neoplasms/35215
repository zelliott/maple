This article gives an overview of the quantitative pathologic techniques used today, with special emphasis on interactive morphometry and its application in the clinical setting. At present, stereologic calculations may be necessary, but in a diagnostic setting have only rarely proved to be essential. The reproducibility of the measurements is discussed in relation to the definition of the particles and staining methods. A number of technical factors that cause random errors are mentioned, such as quality of the slides, magnification, definition of the particles to be measured and measuring protocol. Large-scale experiments have revealed that the means of nuclear morphometric and certain stereologic features are reproducible, such as in the volume percentage of epithelium, the surface densities of glands and the mitotic activity index. The diagnostic applications of the standard deviation and shape factors of nuclear quantitative features require additional precautions, however. Having quantified cell and tissue features, multivariate analysis may result in a better discrimination of two or more groups under study. The quantitative pathologic examination of cells and tissues can provide important diagnostic and prognostic information. Quantitation in pathology is especially useful in so-called continuous lesions, in which interobserver and intraobserver disagreement is considerable. An important requirement of diagnostic morphometry is object selection by a skilled pathologist; the use of morphometry as a black box can result in dramatic errors. The criteria used for a morphometric classification rule that can be used for clinical applications are summarized. Quality control of the whole measuring system is essential. Application of these techniques for more than six years in diagnostic pathology has repeatedly corrected previous qualitative diagnoses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
