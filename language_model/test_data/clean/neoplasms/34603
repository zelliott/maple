The detrimental effect of a helpless coping response on the quality of life of cancer patients is well documented. Helplessness is significantly related to emotional distress. There is also evidence that this coping response is an independent prognostic factor associated with a significantly increased risk of disease recurrence and death. These findings highlight the need to develop specific strategies to enable patients to overcome helplessness. Recent research in patients with advanced cancer indicates that emotional distress appears to be caused by low levels of positive effect. Consequently, attention should be paid to the much neglected study of positive psychological states such as fighting spirit and resilience. In the meantime, some suggestions-based on clinical experience-of inducing and fostering positive effect in our patients are outlined.
