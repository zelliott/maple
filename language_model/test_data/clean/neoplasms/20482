The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) is a ubiquitous multifunctional tyrosine kinase that has an important role in normal cell growth and development. However, abnormal stimulation of IGF-IR signaling has been implicated in the development of different types of tumors. The strong antiapoptotic activity of IGF-IR has been recognized as critical in IGF-I-dependent tumorigenesis, however, the impact of other IGF-IR functions, such as regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion are also increasingly acknowledged. Here, on the model of breast cancer cells, we discuss how IGF-IR-dependent regulation of intercellular adhesion may affect cell survival, resistance to antiestrogens, and invasion.
