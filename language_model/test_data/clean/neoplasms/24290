Carboplatin (CBDCA), an analogue of cisplatin, exhibits reduced toxicity but wide interpatient variability of its pharmacokinetic parameters. Individualization of the CBDCA dose is therefore necessary. Although various formulas have been developed for this purpose, major side effects have been reported on CBDCA administration by short-term infusion (0.5 or 1 h). We therefore propose a new schedule of CBDCA administration. Instead of a dosing method based on the estimation of renal function when a classic administration schedule is used, we propose a pharmacokinetic dosing method (Bayesian method), whereby CBDCA is given by continuous infusion for 120 h. First, CBDCA was given to 21 patients to determine the population pharmacokinetic parameters of carboplatin. Then, on the basis of total platinum plasma concentration measurements and Bayesian estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters, it was possible to individualize the CBDCA dose within the first 24 h of the infusion. This new protocol for CBDCA administration was evaluated in 36 new patients (60 courses). Three theoretical end points at the end of the infusion were considered. For a given theoretical end point, 20 courses were taken into account. The theoretical end points (i.e., 1, 1.5, and 1.8 mg/l) were compared with the concentrations measured at the end of the infusion, which were 0.99 +/- 0.10, 1.41 +/- 0.13, and 1.72 +/- 0.20 mg/l, respectively. This Bayesian dosing method can easily be used in clinical practice, and the determination of predictive performances has shown that the method is precise and unbiased. With no more toxicity or practical difficulties than those produced by other methods, and with acceptable tolerance, it was possible to reach a median dose that was 20% higher than the usual dose (484 +/- 190 mg/m2 as compared with 400 mg/m2). In conclusion, this new schedule of CBDCA administration appears to be interesting in terms of tolerance. However, new studies are required to confirm that this new scheme leads to equal or better efficacy than the classic protocol.
