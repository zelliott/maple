Mixed infections were observed in oncological patients irrespective of the tumor or infectious process localization. 25-30 per cent of the pathological materials from such patients were contaminated with bacterial associations. The number of the associates ranged from 2 to 5 depending on the pathological material tested. Therapy of infectious complications due to pathogen associations should stem from analysis of many factors, i.e. properties of the isolated or likely pathogens, individual characteristics of the patients, compatibility of the drugs used and their pharmacokinetic features.
