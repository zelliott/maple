Leukocyte adhesion is needed for a number of leukocyte functions like immunoglobulin synthesis, T and NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, phagocytosis by granulocytes, and cellular accumulation in inflamed tissue. Several cell surface molecules involved in leukocyte-leukocyte and leukocyte-target cell interactions have recently been identified and characterized. Both the polypeptide and carbohydrate portions are important in leukocyte interactions. It is becoming increasingly apparent that it is possible to interfere with the normal functions of the leukocyte adhesion glycoproteins, and such applications may become important in medicine.
