The peanut agglutinin (PNA) receptors isolated from a tumor cell line could elicit antitumor activity by an active immunization. We report here the results of active immunization with a human PNA receptor glycoprotein on the tumor progression of cancer patients. A remarkable regression of cancer and a prolonged life span in patients were obtained after active immunization with a tumor cell-associated carbohydrate antigen.
