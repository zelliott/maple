The Physician Data Query (PDQ) is a computerised medical database aimed at communicating cancer-related information through computer technology. PDQ has been distributed in Europe since 1988 and in the U.S. since 1985. A study aimed at evaluating whether PDQ had reached a wide medical community was conducted among European PDQ distributors in 1992 as part of an evaluation of PDQ use and impact. Results indicate that PDQ promotion was limited and that several countries were underserved. A preference was expressed for on-line systems. It was found that PDQ access was limited by the requirement of special equipment, by subscription costs and by language barriers. Subscribers were found mainly in the countries with the highest number of distributors. Among a total 12,205 reported subscribers, only 20% were physicians. The proportion of physicians subscribing to the system was, therefore, low (range 4-39.7/10,000). Altogether 453 searches (range 0-213) and 84.5 h of connection time (range 0-52.5) were reported per month for Europe. It is obvious that additional investigation is needed to further evaluate the impact of PDQ on clinical practice.
