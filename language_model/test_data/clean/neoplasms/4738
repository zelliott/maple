The emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies has led to dramatic advances in cancer genome studies. The increased efficiency and resolution of next-generation sequencing greatly facilitate the detection of genetic, genomic, and epigenomic alterations, such as single nucleotide mutations, small insertions and deletions, chromosomal rearrangements, copy number variations, and DNA methylation. Comprehensive analysis of cancer genomes through approaches of whole genome, exome, and transcriptome sequencing has significantly improved the understanding of cancer biology, diagnosis, and therapy. The present study briefly reviews the recent pioneering studies on cancer genome sequencing and provides an unprecedented insight into the landscape of genomic alterations in human sporadic cancers.
