Throughout the past years, permanent cure has become the realistic goal of treatment in a great number of children with cancer. As therapy is aggressive, various late effects of treatment have to be considered. The long-term survivors of 668 children with cancer treated at the Dept. of Pediatrics, University of Mainz, were analyzed for: their present clinical and neurological status, sensory function, impaired skeletal growth, risk of cardiomyopathies, renal functions after treatment for Wilms' tumors, chronic hepatitis, endocrine disorders, electroencephalographic abnormalities, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities, death as a late consequence of tumor therapy, risk of second malignant neoplasias, and their psychosocial and intellectual situation. As a general result, the number of possible late consequences is great. Cancer treatment of children should be restricted to specialized teams at pediatric tumor centers. This is important concerning an optimal therapy as well as long-term care in view of prevention and early detection and treatment of late sequelae of tumors and treatment.
