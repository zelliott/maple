The present study was aimed at assessment of a degree of regional differences in hospitalized morbidity in Poland for some of diseases considered to be related to environmental contamination and its relationship with general environmental characteristic of the regions. The performed analysis has shown that however in recent years there have been substantial differences in the discharge rates between provinces of Poland, these differences are not well explained by differences in general environmental factors. The possible reasons of these results have been discussed.
