Angiogenesis inhibitors for the treatment of cancer have now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, and in 28 other countries including China. Clinical application of this new class of drugs is informed by certain principles from angiogenesis research. Oncogenic mutations initiate tumorigenesis, but angiogenesis is necessary for expansion of tumor mass. Two angiogenesis inhibitors have been developed that have a broad spectrum of anticancer activity, yet virtually no side effects. Endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors act as tumor suppressor proteins. The angiogenic response in vivo is based on the genetic background of the host. Several types of angiogenesis inhibitors reveal a biphasic, U-shaped curve of efficacy. "Antiangiogenic chemotherapy" is a novel approach to the treatment of drug resistance.
