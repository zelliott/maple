Cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid can provide vital diagnostic information, particularly in inflammatory and neoplastic disorders of the nervous system. Not only can the cause of a pleocytosis be established but cytological abnormalities can also be detected in cases where the cell count is normal. Monoclonal antibodies can be used for the characterisation of leukaemic cells.
