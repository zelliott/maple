Chronic renal failure heightens the risk of malignancy. We therefore examined lymphocytes from 44 uremic patients and 24 normal controls for chromosome abnormalities and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) rate. This is the first report of SCE in uremia. Uremia was found to increase structurally abnormal chromosomes and elevate the rate of SCE. These cytogenetic changes in uremia may play a role in the heightened risk of cancer.
