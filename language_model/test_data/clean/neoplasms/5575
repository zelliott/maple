The efficacy and toxicity-related results of non-standard irradiation used in the combined treatment of 129 children with solid tumors were evaluated in 1986-1993. Immediate response (complete or partial regression) was registered in 89.3% of cases of sarcoma of Ewing, 76.8%--rhabdomyosarcoma and 76.7%--other tumors. Local recurrence was observed in 4 and late-onset complication of radiation injury in 10 patients. The actuarial 5-year survival was 54.3, 52.1 and 41.2% in Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and other tumor groups, respectively.
