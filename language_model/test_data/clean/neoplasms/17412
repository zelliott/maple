Exfoliative, abrasive and aspiration cytology were increasingly relied upon for tissue diagnosis of tumours. The established histological stains for the differentiation of mucin and non-mucin-secreting tumours are not ideal for alcohol-fixed cytology smears and a more reliable cytological technique for the preservation and staining of intra-cellular acidic mucins using Alcohol Alcian Blue 8GX is presented.
