Emmprin/CD147 is a cell membrane glycoprotein that belongs to the Ig superfamily and is involved in numerous physiological and pathological systems. Through its ability to interact with multiple partners within the cell surface and its potential to regulate the expression of several targets within the cell, emmprin may have different functions depending on the cell or tissue type. However, its role in tissue remodeling remains the most clearly demonstrated. Emmprin is able to induce, in the same cellular model, both the matrix metalloproteinases and the serine protease urokinase plasminogen activator, whose concerted action in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during various physiopathological situations has been reported. In addition, emmprin also promotes myofibroblasts' differentiation and tissue contraction through the induction of alpha smooth muscle actin, thus expanding on the mechanism by which emmprin remodels ECM.
