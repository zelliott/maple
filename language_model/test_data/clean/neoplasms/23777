Four-hourly temperature charts relating to 63 febrile neutropenic episodes in 32 patients were assessed for a circadian distribution to the onset of fever (&gt; 37.5 degrees C) using the Edward's test. A highly significant distribution was found with the maximum incidence of febrile events between the hours of 5 p.m. and midnight (acrophase 9.30 p.m.). Patients were 5.53 times more likely to develop fever at 9.30 p.m. that 9.30 a.m.
