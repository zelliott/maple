A new natural spiro compound 3,4-dehydrotheaspirone and the known arctiol [1β,6α-dihydroxy-4(14)-eudesmene] were isolated from Juniperus brevifolia. Arctiol is reported for the first time in the Juniperus genus. Their structures were established by 1D, and 2D NMR and MS spectra. Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of 1 and several secondary metabolites 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 previously isolated by our group from J. brevifolia were evaluated and some SAR has been established. The 18-hydroxydehydroabietane (4) displayed great antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines tested, namely HeLa, A-549 and MCF-7. Compound 4 also presented a significant bactericidal effect against Bacillus cereus at different concentrations tested.
