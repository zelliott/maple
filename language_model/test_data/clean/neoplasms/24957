Translational control is one of primary regulation mechanisms of gene expression. Eukaryotic translational control mainly occurs at the initiation step, the speed-limiting step, which involves more than ten translation initiation factors [eIFs (eukaryotic initiation factors)]. Changing the level or function of these eIFs results in abnormal translation of specific mRNAs and consequently abnormal growth of cells that leads to human diseases, including cancer. Accumulating evidence from recent studies showed that the expression of many eIFs was associated with malignant transformation, cancer prognosis, as well as gene expression regulation. In the present paper, we perform a critical review of recent advances in understanding the role and mechanism of eIF action in translational control and cancer as well as the possibility of targeting eIFs for therapeutic development.
