The satisfactory management of pain associated with neoplastic disease is one of the most difficult problems encountered by the clinician. Adequate knowledge of the pathophysiology of pain, the cause and presentation of different pain types, and the mechanisms of action of medications is necessary for sound clinical decisions. Effective pain management has a profound impact on the patient's quality of life and may reduce suffering.
