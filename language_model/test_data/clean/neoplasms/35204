The association of malignancy with thrombotic disorders of the arterial and venous systems is well described. To date, however, there are only 23 published case reports of digital gangrene associated with malignancy. During a prospective evaluation of over 700 patients with finger ischemia, there were five patients with finger gangrene associated with malignancy. Detailed clinical and laboratory evaluation, including detailed immunologic survey and hand angiography, allowed establishment of the precise mechanisms responsible for vascular occlusions in each patient. Three mechanisms were identified: arteritis, hyperviscosity, and hypercoagulability. Digital gangrene associated with malignancy is a rare condition, the mechanism for which can be deduced by careful diagnostic evaluation.
