Unconventional therapies are increasingly accepted and used by professionals and lay persons. In this study, we analyzed correlations between sociodemographic variables of cancer patients, their disease and use of unconventional therapies. In an oncological out-patient department we collected the data relevant for the study objectives by means of a questionnaire. The sample comprised of 154 persons. The younger age group, married individuals and those in mid level occupational positions had more experience with unconventional therapies. The strongest predictors for usage were "age", length of illness" and "being able to go to work or to do house work". Doctors should be familiar with these methods in order to support their oncologic patients. As unconventional therapies will be used more often research should be intensified.
