Adler et al., in a paper appearing in Nature Genetics, exploited the intersect of genetic information from expression profiles with that from array comparative genomic hybridization in human breast cancers to identify genes that may induce the transcription of the prognostic "wound response" expression signature. The amplification of two genes, MYC and CSN5, appeared to be correlated with the wound response cassette. In vitro validation showed that the wound signature could be induced in MCF10A cells only when MYC and CSN5 were coexpressed. This work shows that the intersect analysis of gene amplification and transcriptional expression on a genome-wide scale can uncover complex conditional interactions embedded in the systems map of transcriptional regulation.
