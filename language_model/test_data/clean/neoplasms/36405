Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is the most potent stimulator of hepatocyte growth and DNA synthesis identified; it is now known to be the same molecule as scatter factor, which increases the motility of a variety of cell types. HGF is becoming recognized as one of the most important factors in the regulation of liver regeneration after surgical resection or chemical damage. HGF is produced by several tissues, including neoplasms; it can therefore provide a stimulus for increased motility of malignant cells by both a paracrine and autocrine mechanism. The receptor for HGF has been identified as the product of the oncogene c-met, raising the possibility that this gene plays a key role in facilitating cellular invasion. HGF may therefore be important not only for liver cell growth but also in metastasis. This article summarizes the current position of research on HGF, and presents both clinical and scientific evidence that strongly implicates this factor in liver regeneration and cancer invasion and metastasis.
