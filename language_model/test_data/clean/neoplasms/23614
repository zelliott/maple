The major objective of this longitudinal, grounded theory study was to describe the family transition to living with childhood cancer, from the family's point of view, when a child is diagnosed with cancer with a favorable prognosis (long-term survival rate greater than 60%). A convenience sample consisting of 40 members of seven families with a child recently diagnosed with cancer was recruited for the study. Data collection consisted of three tape-recorded, semi-structured interviews with family members in the home. A model of the family transition in response to the diagnosis of childhood cancer was developed. This transition was characterized by a fracturing of reality at the realization of the malignant nature of the illness; a period of limbo, characterized by uncertainty after the diagnosis; utilization of strategies to reconstruct reality; and construction of a "new normal" for the family, during which the nature of uncertainty changed, but did persist.
