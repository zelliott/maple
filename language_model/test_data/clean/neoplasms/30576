This study was designed to determine the correlation between the rise of tumor temperature during hyperthermia treatment and the blood flow of the tumors measured by dynamic CT (DCT) and 15Ogas-positron emission tomography. In this report, we observed 20 patients with malignant tumors which underwent hyperthermia treatment. In each case, the temperature of the tumor was monitored with a photofiber sensor. DCT's and 15Ogas-positron emission tomographies were applied before the hyperthermia treatment. During the DCT, the tumor blood flow of each tumor was estimated by by analyzing the time-dependent activity curve after a bolus injection. During the 15Ogas-positron emission tomography, the tumor blood flow was estimated by the C15O2-steady-state method. The value of the tumor blood flow estimated by DCT were proportional to those calculated by the 15Ogas-positron emission tomography. These values were inversely proportional to the rise of the temperature of the tumors during hyperthermia treatment. Our results imply that DCT as well as the 15Ogas-positron emission tomography can be used for the prediction of the tumor temperature rise during the hyperthermia treatment.
