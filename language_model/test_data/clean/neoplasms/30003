Silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) obtained by mechanical grinding of porous silicon have been used for visualization of living cells in vitro. It was found that SiNPs could penetrate into the cells without any cytotoxic effect up to the concentration of 100 Î¼g/ml. The cell cytoplasm was observed to be filled by SiNPs, which exhibited bright photoluminescence at 1.6 eV. SiNPs could also act as photosensitizers of the singlet oxygen generation, which could be used in the photodynamic therapy of cancer. These properties of SiNPs are discussed in view of possible applications in theranostics (both in therapy and in diagnostics).
