The constantly growing list of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics requires a new survey of ophthalmic complications, which are often underestimated. Based on the review by Imperia et al (1989), an update on ophthalmic complications of currently used cytotoxic chemotherapeutics in oncology was written. Vision is a quality of life issue, which must be nurtured, especially if loss of vision can be prevented. The broad spectrum of ophthalmic complications induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy includes reversible and irreversible acute and chronic disorders. Mild to moderate ophthalmic complications are very common and reversible after cessation of anti-cancer therapy. Some major ocular toxicities may require a dose reduction or the discontinuation of cytotoxic chemotherapy in order to prevent visual loss. Ocular toxicities can be treated or even prevented, if detected early enough. That is why an ophthalmic baseline examination for patients receiving cytosine arabinoside, 5-fluorourocil, methotrexate, or docetaxel should be taken into consideration, and a consultation with an ophthalmologist has to be done as soon as symptoms are recognized. Oncologists and ophthalmologists must be aware of potential ophthalmic complications during cytotoxic chemotherapy, and should work together.
