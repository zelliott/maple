The protein encoded by the human gene HEC (highly expressed in cancer) contains 642 amino acids and a long series of leucine heptad repeats at its C-terminal region. HEC protein is expressed most abundantly in the S and M phases of rapidly dividing cells but not in terminal differentiated cells. It localizes to the nuclei of interphase cells, and a portion distributes to centromeres during M phase. Inactivation of HEC by microinjection of specific monoclonal antibodies into cells during interphase severely disturbs the subsequent mitoses. Disordered sister chromatid alignment and separation, as well as the formation of nonviable cells with multiple, fragmented micronuclei, are common features observed. These results suggest that the HEC protein may play an important role in chromosome segregation during M phase.
