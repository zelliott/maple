The objective of the present research was to study, in a multivariate design, the considerations that guide the physician when informing cancer patients about their diagnosis and prognosis. General surgeons (104) in Israel were presented with hypothetical case stories and other questionnaires. It was found that the main factor guiding the physician, when informing about the diagnosis, is the approach the physician holds towards information to cancer patients. When informing about the prognosis other factors were found relevant, the main one being the seriousness of the disease. Other considerations guiding for both diagnosis and prognosis were patient characteristics, such as questions asked and intelligence of patient as perceived by physician. Tenure of physician was important in that senior physicians tend to give a more optimistic prognosis than their junior colleagues, but not a more benign diagnosis. The findings were discussed in terms of the combination of variables encouraging openness or reticence from the physician.
