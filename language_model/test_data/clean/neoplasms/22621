Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), among others, play a major role in the pathophysiology of anemia in the cancer patient not only through complex mechanisms of the purely inflammatory situation but also through genetic regulatory aspects of erythropoiesis via GATA-1 and GATA-2, and other factors. In terms of therapy, iron is used more and more; the late side effects of transfusions are not really understood and the recent controversy regarding erythropoietin usage has resulted in regulatory authorities and scientific societies providing several recommendations and guidelines. These various aspects are addressed herein.
