It is widely accepted that clinical genetic services should provide culturally competent service to clients. However, systematic research is needed on the cultural meanings of heredity, family cancer, and family communication about inherited risk in order to move towards culturally competent cancer genetic services. Cultural differences in how families communicate about inherited risk is a particularly important, but neglected, research focus. The purpose of this paper is to: (1) review extant literature on cultural differences in family communication about inherited cancer risk; and (2) provide suggestions for cancer genetics research that will ultimately help furnish the evidence base for the training and provision of culturally competent cancer genetics services.
