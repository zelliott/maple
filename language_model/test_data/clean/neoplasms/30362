Poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) coupled with methoxy poly (ethylene glycol) (mPEG) or chlorin e6 (Ce6) was synthesized using the Steglich esterification method. PLGA-linked mPEG (PLGA-mPEG), PLGA-linked Ce6 (PLGA-Ce6), and Fe(3)O(4) were utilized to constitute multifunctional PLGA nanoparticles (∼160 nm) via the multi-emulsion W(1)/O/W(2) (water-in-oil-in-water) method. The photo-sensitizing properties of Ce6 molecules anchored to PLGA nanoparticles enabled in vivo luminescence imaging and photodynamic therapy for the tumor site. The encapsulation of Fe(3)O(4) allowed high contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the tumor in vivo. Overall, PLGA nanoparticles resulted in a significant tumor volume regression for the light-illuminated KB tumor in vivo and enhanced the contrast at the tumor region, compared to that of Feridex(®) (commercial contrast agent).
