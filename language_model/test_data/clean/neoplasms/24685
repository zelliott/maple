Nucleotide excision repair (NER) acts on a variety of DNA lesions, including damage induced by many chemotherapeutic drugs. Cancer therapy with such drugs might be improved by reducing the NER capacity of tumors. It is not known, however to what extent any individual NER protein is rate-limiting for any step of the repair reaction. We studied sensitivity to UV radiation and repair of DNA damage with regard to XPA, one of the core factors in the NER incision complex. About 150,000-200,000 molecules of XPA protein are present in NER proficient human cell lines, and no XPA protein in the XP-A cell line XP12RO. Transfected XP12RO cell lines expressing 50,000 or more XPA molecules/cell showed UV resistance similar to normal cells. Suppression of XPA protein to approximately 10,000 molecules/cell in a Tet-regulatable system modestly but significantly increased sensitivity to UV irradiation. No removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers was detected in the SV40 immortalized cell lines tested. Repair proficient WI38-VA fibroblasts and transfected XP-A cells expressing 150,000 molecules of XPA/cell removed (6-4) photoproducts from the genome with a half-life of 1h. Cells in which XPA protein was reduced to about 10,000 molecules/cell removed (6-4) photoproducts more slowly, with a half-life of 3h. A reduced rate of repair of (6-4) photoproducts thus results in increased cellular sensitivity towards UV irradiation. These data indicate that XPA levels must be reduced to &lt;10% of that present in a normal cell to render XPA a limiting factor for NER and consequent cellular sensitivity. To inhibit NER, it may be more effective to interfere with XPA protein function, rather than reducing XPA protein levels.
