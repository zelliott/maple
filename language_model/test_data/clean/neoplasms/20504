Fifty-seven patients with MAGE-3-positive measurable metastatic cancer, most of them with melanoma, were vaccinated with escalating doses of a recombinant MAGE-3 protein combined with a fixed dose of the immunological adjuvant SBAS-2, which contained MPL and QS21. The immunisation schedule included 4 intramuscular (i.m.) injections at 3-week intervals. Patients whose tumour stabilised or regressed after 4 vaccinations received 2 additional vaccinations at 6-week intervals. The vaccine was generally well tolerated. Among the 33 melanoma patients who were evaluable for tumour response, we observed 2 partial responses, 2 mixed responses and 1 stabilisation. Time to progression in these 5 patients varied from 4 to 29 months. In addition, a partial response lasting 10 months was observed in 1 of the 3 metastatic bladder cancer patients included. None of the tumour responses described above involved visceral metastases. Immunological responses to the vaccine will be reported separately.
