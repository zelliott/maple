This review paper is concerned with the topic of mortality differences by socio-economic group in Switzerland. After a short introduction to the topic and the pitfalls associated with it, the paper reviews work done in the course of a ten year programme investigating socio-economic mortality differentials in Switzerland. This programme was carried out by a working group at the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine of the University of Berne. The paper reviews methodological difficulties and pitfalls and relates the Swiss results to findings from other countries including England and Wales and Sweden. The disadvantages of socially isolated groups such as children of single women are shown. The relatively high mortality of groups under economic pressure, such as skilled manual workers in Switzerland, is demonstrated. The Swiss situation is interesting in that skilled manual workers have a higher mortality than the unskilled and semi-skilled groups. It is concluded that this is not an artifact but may be due to the fact that only Swiss workers were investigated and that Switzerland has a large proportion of foreign workers, especially in the less skilled groups. In addition, some results of an investigation of cancer mortality by occupation are reported too. Apart from some occupation-specific findings, there are some interesting cross-references to socio-economic differential mortality.

The socioeconomic aspects of differential mortality in Switzerland are described.  Factors considered include marital status, nationality, occupation, educational status, and age.  Data are from official sources.
