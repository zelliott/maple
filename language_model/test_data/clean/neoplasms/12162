To determine the maximum-tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and pharmacodynamics of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (formerly PS-341) in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

An intravenous bolus of bortezomib was administered twice weekly for 2 consecutive weeks at either 1.2 or 1.6 mg/m2/dose followed by a 1-week rest. The pharmacodynamics of bortezomib were evaluated by measurement of whole blood 20S proteasome activity.

Fifteen patients, 11 assessable, were enrolled between November 2001 and February 2003. Dose-limiting thrombocytopenia, which prevented administration of a complete course (four doses in 2 weeks) of therapy, occurred in two of five assessable children enrolled at the 1.6 mg/m2 dose level. There were no other DLTs. Inhibition of 20S proteasome activity seemed to be dose dependent. The average inhibition 1 hour after drug administration on day 1 was 67.2% +/- 7.6% at the 1.2 mg/m2/dose and 76.5% +/- 3.3% at the 1.6 mg/m2/dose. There were no objective antitumor responses.

Bortezomib is well tolerated in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. The recommended phase II dose of bortezomib for children with solid tumors is 1.2 mg/m2/dose, administered as an intravenous bolus twice weekly for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week break.
