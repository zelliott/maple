Strong epidemiological evidence implicates diet in a substantial proportion of cancer cases. Nutritionists largely agree on the attributes of a healthy diet for cancer prevention (and also for cardiovascular health). Researchers are now studying specific food components that can actively suppress the processes involved in carcinogenesis. The most potent of these could be used directly for chemoprevention in high-risk individuals and might even have potential in cancer therapy.
