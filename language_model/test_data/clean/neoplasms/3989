Despite the attraction of certain utopias and the convincing strength of some of the social and philosophical theories underlying attempts to change the social structure and to achieve a more egalitarian society, social inequalities have not disappeared and seem even to be increasing worldwide. Inequalities in health are part of the social inequalities present in our society and one of their most convincing indices. Sanitary conditions are worse, mortality higher, survival rates of cancer patients lower, and life expectancy shorter in developing countries than in industrialized countries. Similar if not identical differences can be seen within industrialized countries between socioeconomically less and more favoured population groups. In many areas of the industrialized countries social and environmental conditions comparable with those existing in the poorest countries last century have been recreated. Occupational risks are becoming a serious problem in developing countries, largely as a consequence of the transfer of hazardous industries from industrialized countries where certain industries are judged to be unacceptable. A similar double standard is applied to tobacco advertising and sales in the industrialized and developing countries. The projections of the total number of cancer cases in the next decades indicate a generalized increase, proportionally greater in developing than in industrialized countries.
