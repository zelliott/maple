Two new sesquiterpenes deltoiden A (1) and deltoiden B (2), and two new lignans deltoignan A (9) and deltoignan B (10), together with 14 known compounds, including six sesquiterpenes 3-8 and three lignans 11-13, were isolated from the whole plant of Saussurea deltoidea. Compounds 3-8 and 11-17 were isolated for the first time from this plant. Their structures were established by spectroscopic analysis, including 2D-NMR spectroscopic techniques. Cytotoxicities of compounds 1-13 were tested against three cancer cell lines A549, Hela and SMMC-7721. Results showed that 5, 6 and 7 exhibited cytotoxicity against SMMC-7721 with the IC(50) values of 6.49, 9.53, 1.23 μg/ml, 5 and 7 against A549 with the IC(50) values of 4.99 and 5.35 μg/ml, 5, 6, 7, 13 against Hela with the IC(50) values of 1.40, 4.75, 0.93 and 5.42 μg/ml, respectively. The structure-activity relationships of sesquiterpenes 1-8 were discussed on the base of cytotoxic results.
