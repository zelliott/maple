An important consideration in the development of T cell-based cancer immunotherapy is that effector T cells must efficiently traffic to the tumor microenvironment in order to control malignant progression. T cell trafficking to target tissues is orchestrated by dynamic interactions between circulating lymphocytes and endothelial cells lining blood vessels. It is informative, in this regard, to compare and contrast the molecular mechanisms governing lymphocyte extravasation at distinct vascular sites: (1) high endothelial venules (HEV) of secondary lymphoid organs, which are portals for efficient trafficking of naive and central memory T lymphocytes; (2) non-activated endothelium of normal tissues that mediate relatively low basal levels of trafficking but are rapidly transformed into HEV-like vessels in response to local inflammatory stimuli; and (3) vessels within the intratumoral region and the surrounding peritumoral areas. These vessels can be distinguished by differential expression of hallmark trafficking molecules that function as molecular beacons directing lymphocyte migration across vascular barriers. This article reviews evidence that recruitment of effector T cells to the intratumoral microenvironment is impeded by sub-threshold expression of trafficking molecules on tumor microvessels. Emerging data support the thesis that when considered from the perspective of extravasation, vessels embedded within the intratumoral microenvironment of established tumors do not exhibit stereotypical characteristics of a chronic inflammatory state. A major challenge will be to develop therapeutic approaches to improve trafficking of effector T lymphocytes to tumor sites without skewing the balance in favor of a chronic inflammatory milieu that facilitates tumor maintenance and progression.
