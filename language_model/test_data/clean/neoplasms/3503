Data from two large, community-based clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of epoetin alfa in anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed to determine if clinical outcomes were different depending on whether chemotherapy was platinum- or nonplatinum-based.

Patients received epoetin alfa 150-300 IU/kg (Glaspy: Study 1; n = 2,342) or 10,000-20,000 IU (Demetri: Study 2; n = 2,370) s.c. three times each week for 4 months. Efficacy end points were changes in transfusion requirements, hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and quality of life (QOL). A total of 4,298 out of 4,712 patients (platinum-based, n = 1,601; nonplatinum-based, n = 2,697), who both received chemotherapy and had available data, were eligible for this retrospective analysis.

Baseline characteristics across groups were comparable with few exceptions, which were anticipated in view of the characteristics of the two different chemotherapy types. Decreases in transfusion requirements after 2, 3, and 4 months were significant, regardless of chemotherapy type. Mean increases in Hb level from baseline to final evaluation ranged from 1.6 g/dl to 2.0 g/dl across study groups and were significant, regardless of chemotherapy type. QOL, as measured by the Linear Analog Scale Assessment (LASA), improved significantly by 20%-43%, regardless of chemotherapy type, and improvements were associated with increases in Hb. Epoetin alfa was well tolerated in both studies, regardless of chemotherapy type.

Treatment of anemic cancer patients with epoetin alfa results in significant reduction in transfusion requirements, increase in Hb levels, and improvements in QOL, regardless of whether the chemotherapy is platinum- or nonplatinum-based.
