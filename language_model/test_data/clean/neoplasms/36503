Although confusional states and depression are common accompaniments of advanced cancer, few objective data are available concerning the prevalence of these clinical states or what methods are most suitable for their accurate detection. We decided that a 10-question Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS) and a semistructured application of modified DSMIII-R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, third edition-revised) criteria for a major depressive illness were the most suitable screening tests for a terminally ill population. Thirty of 87 patients (34%) displayed significant cognitive impairment. The AMTS rating declined with approaching death and also correlated negatively with age. Of 81 patients, 21 (26%) were depressed when screened using DSMIII-R criteria for depression. One-third of patients with impaired AMTS scores also satisfied DSMIII-R criteria for depression. Of cognitively impaired patients, 90% had at least two possible causes for their confused state. We have found that both the AMTS and semistructured interview using DSMIII-R criteria for depression are useful routine screening tests in the terminally ill.
