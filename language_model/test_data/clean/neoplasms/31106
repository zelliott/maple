Twenty one cases of the association systemic scleroderma and cancer are reported. Neoplasic localisations were the following: pulmonary five cases; breast two cases; esophageal cancer one case; stomach one case; colon one case; uterus four cases; ovarian cancer one case; prostatic cancer one case; renal cancer one case; malignant hemopathies six cases. In the literature, more than three hundred cases of such an association have been reported since 1886, essentially lung cancers (more than 100). Recent epidemiological studies allow to conclude to a higher frequency of lung and breast cancers. We suggest that systemic scleroderma patients should be examined attentively and carefully for these risks.
