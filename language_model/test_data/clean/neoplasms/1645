Cancer affects approximately 1 in 3 individuals. An individual's susceptibility to cancer is partly determined by environmental exposures and by the combination of inherited cancer susceptibility and resistance genes. Initial mapping of these low penetrance cancer susceptibility genes has been done in the mouse because human low penetrance genes are extremely difficult to find using traditional methods due to heterogeneity and interacting factors. Also, the choice of candidate genes for human association studies can miss the unknown or unexpected. Mouse models also have limitations; it can be difficult to identify causal polymorphisms in the mouse because linkage disequilibrium often extends across several genes. To exploit the strengths of both systems, we outline a cross-species strategy to identify human variants associated with increased cancer risk. This approach uses linkage analysis and haplotyping, allelic imbalance in tumors, and gene expression studies in the mouse, combined with association studies and tumor imbalance studies in humans to identify causal cancer susceptibility variants. Allelic variants in both mouse and human can then be used to better understand the mechanisms behind cancer risk and as targets for intervention.
