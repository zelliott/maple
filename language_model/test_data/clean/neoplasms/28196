After major developments in the diagnosis and therapy of the primary cancer, at the turn of the century clinical oncology is still facing the major challenge: management of the disseminated disease. Cancer biology provided basic information on the genetic and biochemical background of the process, however, it turned out that the individual tumor types use a wide range of mechanisms for invasion and metastasis. Recent major discoveries concerning invasion are identification of the invasion organelle (invadopodia) and identification of certain molecular mechanisms leading to organ-selective metastatization. Prognostic pathology emerged as a new diagnostic field, specialized in predicting the metastatic behavior of the tumor based on the geno- and phenotype of the primary tumor. Ultimately, the first drugs which were designed on the principles of tumor progression entered clinical trials (angiogenesis- and MMP-inhibitors) indicating a slow but steady transfer of cancer biology knowledge to clinical oncology predicting a significant development in the management of disseminated cancer patients.
