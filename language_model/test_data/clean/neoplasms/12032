A total of 102 studies were conducted on 89 patients receiving cancer chemotherapy while on a protected environment-prophylactic antibiotic program. Major infections occurred during 22 studies. The majority of both minor and major infections originated during the first five weeks after the patients entered the protected environment units. The frequency of infectious complications was inversely related to the circulating neutrophil count. The majority of infections were cases of cellulitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia and septicemia. Most of the infections were caused by gram-negative bacilli. The majority of organisms causing infection had persisted in the patients after their entry into the protected environment units despite the use of prophylactic antibiotics.
