A poor doctor-patient-communication in cancer care has negative effects on psychological well being and causes high economic costs. This review analyses the current literature on the impact of communication on distress, satisfaction and utilization of psychosocial services among cancer patients with regard to patients' communication preferences. Crucial to a successful communication seems to be the match of patients' preferences and actual physician's behaviour. However, preferences depend on various factors and can change during the illness trajectory. As preferences often remain unconsidered in everyday practice, they should be assessed repeatedly. For the lack of theoretical foundation, future research should be designed according to theoretical assumptions. In this respect we developed and suggest a model on the impact of patients' preferences on physician-patient-communication, knowledge and use of psychosocial treatment offers that particularly considers psychosocial distress of cancer patients.
