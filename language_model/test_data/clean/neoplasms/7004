Centrosome amplification and telomere shortening, which are commonly detected in human cancers, have been implicated in the induction of chromosome instability in tumorigenesis. The functions of these two structures are closely related to DNA damage repair machinery, and some factors that operate in the maintenance of telomeres also take part in the regulation of centrosome status, suggesting they are functionally linked. We report that TEIF (telomerase transcriptional elements-interacting factor), a transactivator of the hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit) gene, is distributed in the centrosome throughout the cell cycle, but its transport into the centrosome is increased under some conditions, and its distribution is dependent on its C-terminal domain. Experimental modulation of TEIF expression through overexpression, polypeptide expression or depletion affected centrosome status and increased abnormalities of cell mitosis. Localization of TEIF to the centrosome was also stimulated by treatment with genotoxic agents and experimental telomere dysfunction, accompanying centrosome amplification. Moreover, we demonstrated that the expression level of TEIF is not only closely correlated with centrosome amplification in soft tissue sarcomas but it is also significantly related to tumor histologic grade. Our data confirmed TEIF functions as a centrosome regulator. Its participation in DNA damage response, including telomere dysfunction and tumorigenesis, indicates TEIF is likely to be a factor involved in linking centrosome amplification and telomere dysfunction in cancer development.
