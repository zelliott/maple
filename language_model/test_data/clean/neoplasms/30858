The diagnosis of malignancy in childhood is challenging. Signs and symptoms are generally nonspecific, and children with an underlying malignancy rarely are seriously ill at the time of initial presentation. A thorough history and physical examination are the most important components of the emergency physician's assessment of children in whom cancer is suspected. There are a number of risk factors, physical findings, and clinical syndromes that indicate the need for careful evaluation of which the emergency physician should be aware.
