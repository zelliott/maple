The benefits of utilizing computerized assessment in clinical settings have been reported in studies over the last three decades and more recently in the oncology settings. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using an electronic self report symptom assessment tool among Chinese oncology patients.

The tool, developed by The University of Washington, Distributed Health Assessment and Intervention Research (DHAIR) group was translated into Chinese. The adapted web-based survey platform, the Electronic Self Report Assessment - Cancer (ESRA-C), was tested in a local cancer resource center in Hong Kong. Participants' perceptions of the acceptability and feasibility of the symptom assessment process were assessed using the Acceptability E-scale as well as observation and qualitative interview data. Demographic data were also collected through the touch screen computer system. A convenience sample of 30 (11 male and 19 female) oncology patients was recruited to use the touch-screen computer to assess participants' symptoms using ESRA-C.

The acceptability scale indicated moderately high acceptability in each subscale (mean score of 3.32-4.71). On average, participants took 17.5 min (SD: 8.9) to complete the ESRA-C. The qualitative interview data revealed that the majority (25 participants) asserted that the ESRA-C was useful and effective in reporting personal health conditions.

The study suggested that electronic assessment can offer a feasible, attractive, and viable means of implementing regular and comprehensive symptom assessment, which can lead to better symptom management in cancer patients.
