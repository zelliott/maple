The formation of new vessels, (angiogenesis) characterizes body development and is pivotal in some diseases. In particular, angiogenesis is crucial for the growth of tumors and metastasis diffusion. The beginning of tumor angiogenesis is caused by the selection of a cancer cell clone which induces an unbalance between inducers and inhibitors of angiogenesis. The inhibition of this process by natural or chemical compounds increases apoptotic index in the tumors, does not causes drug resistance and has been demonstrated to induce cancer dormancy in many animal models.
