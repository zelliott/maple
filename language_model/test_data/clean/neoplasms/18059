Uncovered, rather than covered, metal stents are commonly used for palliation of malignant gastric outlet obstruction because of the low risk of stent migration, but tumor ingrowth risk is a major drawback. Few reports address malignant obstruction after gastric surgery.

Our purpose was to compare the technical feasibility and clinical outcome of using an endoscopic uncovered self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) and simultaneous use of uncovered and covered SEMS (double SEMS) in patients with recurrent malignant obstruction after gastric surgery.

Retrospective study.

Tertiary care, academic medical center, from August 2000 to June 2005.

Twenty patients were included in the study. All patients had symptomatic obstruction with nausea, vomiting, and decreased oral intake.

Ten patients received uncovered SEMS; the other 10 received double SEMS.

To compare tumor ingrowth and stent patency between the uncovered and the double-SEMS groups.

Technical and clinical successes were 10 of 10 and 8 of 10, respectively, in the uncovered SEMS group and 10 of 10 and 10 of 10, respectively, in the double SEMS group. Six of 10 patients (60%) with uncovered SEMS had tumor ingrowth compared with 1 of 10 patients with double SEMS, P = .057. Five of 10 patients (50%) with uncovered SEMS had very early restenosis, but no patients had early restenosis in the double SEMS group, P = .033. Stent patency was a median of 21.5 days (range, 7-217 days) in the uncovered SEMS group and 150 days (range 29-263 days) in the double SEMS group, P = .037. Survival duration was 109.5 days (range 29-280 days) and 150 days (range 29-263 days), respectively.

This was a small retrospective study.

Simultaneous double stent placement seems to be technically feasible and effective for palliative treatment of recurrent malignant obstruction after gastric surgery. Double stent placement is important in preventing tumor ingrowth, especially very early restenosis, and prolongs stent patency. We suggest that this procedure be considered rather than uncovered stent alone as the primary choice for palliation of obstruction in such patients.
