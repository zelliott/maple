In eukaryotic cells, relaxed interphase chromatin undergoes pronounced changes resulting in formation of highly condensed mitotic chromosomes. Moreover, chromatin condensation is particularly evident during mitosis and apoptotic cell death, whereas chromatin relaxation is necessary for replication, repair, recombination and transcription. The post-translational modifications of histone tails such as reversible acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation play a critical role in dynamic condensation/relaxation that occurs during the cell cycle. Histone phosphorylation is believed to play a direct role in mitosis, cell death, repair, replication and recombination. However, definitive roles for this modification in these processes have not yet been elucidated. In this review, we discuss recent progress in studies of histone phosphorylation.
