A review of the current knowledge on cell cycle control and the techniques used to assess proliferation of normal and neoplastic cells was the focus of a workshop in Regensburg, Germany, held under the joint auspices of the Graduiertenkolleg: Therapieforschung Onkologie and the Committee on AgNOR Quantification. An overview of the recently discovered group of cyclins and their specific kinases, and of other proliferation-associated antigens, such as Ki67, PCNA and topoiseromase II alpha, was given. The topics continued with a reappraisal of modern imaging and flow-cytometric techniques. An update of the relation of AgNORs to cellular proliferation and differentiation was the link to presentations on clinical data, problems and strategies for standardization, as well as guidelines to establish the prognostic value of marker molecules. These lectures were supported by posters. Bringing together researchers from life sciences, technically oriented workers, pathologists, and clinicians resulted in a lively and constructive discussion, which is briefly summarized in the Concluding remarks.
