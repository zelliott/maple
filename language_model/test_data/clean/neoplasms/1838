The care of patients with cancer and chronic pain, often complicated and demanding, strains the resources of a single physician. Continuity of care programs, such as that developed by the Pain Service of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York), with good communication and liaison work between hospital and community, add a much needed dimension to the pain management of these patients in the home. Although continuity of care programs resemble hospice programs in philosophy, there are major differences in admission criteria: the program is not restricted to dying individuals; patients may live alone; they may receive active therapy with a focus on cure or remission; and they continue to receive their care, including pain management, within a standard medical system under the supervision of their primary physician and nurse.
