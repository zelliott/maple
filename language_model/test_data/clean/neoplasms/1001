The aim of this study was to examine whether children experience less fear, distress and pain connected to a routine needle insertion in an intravenous port when subjected to an intervention: blowing soap bubbles or having a heated pillow vs. standard care. Twenty-eight children, 2-7 years, cared for at a paediatric oncology unit, undergoing a routine needle insertion in an intravenous port were included consecutively. All children were subjected to two needle insertions; at the first they received standard care, and at the second standard care + a randomized intervention. Parents and nurses assessed children's fear, distress and pain on 0-100 mm visual analogue scales. According to parents' report, children experienced less fear when subjected to intervention vs. standard care reported by parents (P &lt; 0.001). Children also experienced less fear (P &lt; 0.05) and distress (P &lt; 0.05) when subjected to standard care + blowing soap bubbles vs. standard care (n = 14), and less fear when subjected to standard care + heated pillow vs. standard care (P &lt; 0.05). Nurses' reports did not show any differences for standard care + intervention vs. standard care. Blowing soap bubbles or having a heated pillow is more effective than standard care in reducing children's fear and distress in needle procedures, according to parents' report.
