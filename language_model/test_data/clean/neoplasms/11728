Human behavior is constantly being modified, though not as rapidly or always in the direction that health professionals might wish. In cancer prevention and detection programs, human behavior is modified by several common interrelated methods: the mass media; face-to-face communications; risk-immunization measures; economic forces; and the enactment of laws and regulations. Information and education are the preferred methods and have over a period of time achieved encouraging results. Further emphasis should focus on improving communication skills of health professionals, especially physicians; the promotion of hospital health education programs; and the support of more effective school health education programs. They should keep the public informed about the latest scientific advances while guarding against oversimplifying scientific facts that can be misinterpreted. They must be aggressive in the battle against cancer quackery, and they must keep abreast of the self-care and self-help movements, supporting those that contribute to cancer prevention and detection.
