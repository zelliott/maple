Selection of CD34+ cells for autologous transplantation is increasingly being used to reduce potential tumor cell contamination of the autograft. Haematopoietic reconstitution in 40 patients after transplantation of CD34(+)-selected versus non-selected G-CSF-mobilized PBPC was compared and was almost identical in the two groups of patients. Delayed platelet engraftment was only observed in patients transplanted with a CD34+ cell dose of &lt; 2.5 x 10(6)/kg body weight. It has to be shown whether the positive selection of CD34+ cells will improve the disease free survival after autologous PBPC transplantation.
