The thioredoxin system-formed by thioredoxin reductase and its characteristic substrate thioredoxin-is an important constituent of the intracellular redox milieu. Interactions with many different metabolic pathways such as DNA-synthesis, selenium metabolism, and the antioxidative network as well as significant species differences render this system an attractive target for chemotherapeutic approaches in many fields of medicine-ranging from infectious diseases to cancer therapy. In this review we will present and evaluate the preclinical and clinical results available today. Current trends in drug development are emphasized.
