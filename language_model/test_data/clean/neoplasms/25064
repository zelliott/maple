Advances in our understanding of cancer biology and discoveries emerging from cancer genomics are being translated into real clinical benefits for patients with cancer. The 2011 Journal of Pathology Annual Review Issue provides a snapshot of recent rapid progress on multiple fronts in the war on cancer or, more precisely, the wars on cancers. Indeed, perhaps the most notable recent shift is reflected by the sharp increase in understanding the biology of multiple specific cancers and using these new insights to inform rationally targeted therapies, with often striking successes. These recent developments, as reviewed in this issue, show how the long-term investments in basic cancer research are finally beginning to bear fruit.
