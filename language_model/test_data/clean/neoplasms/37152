The present study tested the hypothesis that particular personality dispositions act as resistance resources in the encounter with stressful life events.

The sample consisted of 100 student nurses working in critical areas (oncology and AIDS). At the beginning of the 2nd year course subjects were administered the Kobasa Hardiness Scale and at the end of the year the Maslach Burnout Inventory.

Higher hardiness levels at the beginning of the course were associated with lower emotional exhaustion and higher personal achievement scores at the end. As predicted, findings show hardiness scores to be predictive of the risk of burnout.

A screening of personality traits could be useful in preventing the risk of burnout in nurses working in critical areas.
