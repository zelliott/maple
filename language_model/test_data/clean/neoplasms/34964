In a previous paper we reported an elevated incidence of systemic illnesses in a population of 846 cataract patients. The charts were reviewed to determine the prevalence of systemic illnesses and of drug allergy. Elevated rates of hypertension (46.0%), diabetes mellitus (15.8%), glaucoma (11.0%) and drug allergy (30.6%) were found. Recommendations are made for preoperative assessment of cataract patients.
