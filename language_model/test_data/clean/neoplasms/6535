The possible role of immunomodulators in the host-defense mechanism against neoplasm is discussed from the standpoint of the complement system. Serum complement is activated by the majority of immunomodulators in vitro via either the classical or the alternative pathway, and this activation is sometimes observed following systemic administration of immunomodulators. Besides activating the complement, systemic administration of immunomodulators elevates serum complement levels, and in some cases binds complements to tumor cells. Activated serum complement by an immunomodulator induced an accumulation of PMNs in ascites with tumor cell destruction when intraperitoneally injected, indicating that complement-derived chemotactic factors C3a and C5a generated by an immunomodulator had an antitumor effect. This evidence strongly supports the concept that complement system plays an important role in the host-defense mechanism against neoplasm.
