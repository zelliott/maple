Nodal, a member of the TGF-Î² superfamily, is an embryonic morphogen that is upregulated in different types of tumors. Nodal increases the tumorigenesis by inducing angiogenesis and promoting metastasis. Importantly, Nodal inhibition suppresses the growth and invasion of tumor. Since tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the major infiltrating leukocytes in most cancers, we investigated whether Nodal is involved in the differentiation of TAMs. Our results revealed that Nodal inhibition in tumor microenvironment upregulated the production of IL-12 in macrophages and reversed TAMs to classically activated macrophage phenotype. In contrast, treatment with recombinant Nodal (rNodal) decreased the expression of IL-12 in murine macrophages. Furthermore, rNodal promoted macrophage polarization to an alternatively activated macrophage-like/TAM phenotype and modulated its function. These results suggest that Nodal may play an important role in macrophage polarization and downregulation of IL-12. The rescued antitumor function of TAMs via the inhibition of Nodal expression could be a new therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.
