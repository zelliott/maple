In the process of RNA interference (RNAi), small RNAs pair with complementary messenger RNAs preventing their expression. The discovery of RNAi has revolutionized our understanding of gene regulation. Since cancer is a disease of altered genes, RNAi may have tremendous potential as a therapeutic strategy by downregulating altered genes. Just one decade after its discovery, this process is already being used in clinical trials and new technical achievements in delivering small RNAs to the cells are constantly improving the efficiency of this specific cancer treatment.
