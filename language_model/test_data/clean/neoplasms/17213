Two Mn(I) carbonyl complexes namely [MnBr(azpy)(CO)3] and [Mn(azpy)(CO)3(PPh3)](ClO4) (azpy = 2-phenylazopyridine) have been synthesized and characterized. Both complexes exhibit rapid CO release upon exposure to low power visible light. [MnBr(azpy)(CO)3] shows significant phototoxicity toward two malignant cell lines HeLa and MDA-MB-231.
