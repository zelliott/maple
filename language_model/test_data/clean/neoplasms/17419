Vindesine is a new vinca alkaloid antineoplastic agent derived from vinblastine. However, its antineoplastic spectrum more closely resembles that of vincristine. Clinical studies indicate activity against acute leukemia, lung cancer, carcinoma of the breast, squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and head and neck, Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that vindesine exhibits a triphasic elimination pattern with a terminal half-life of 24.2 hours. Elimination is primarily through hepatic metabolism. The major side effects associated with vindesine therapy are myelosuppression and neurotoxicity. Other side effects include alopecia, nausea and vomiting and local tissue irritation associated with extravasation. Vindesine will be a positive addition to the antineoplastic armamentarium. The full extent of its activity remains to be established.
