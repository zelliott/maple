Well-being falls within a broad category of quality of life indicators and encompasses both physical and emotional factors. Identification of the most important factors affecting overall well-being may allow health care practitioners to target these symptoms and improve patients' quality of life. The purpose of this study was to determine factors most predictive of well-being in advanced cancer patients.

Patients referred to the Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) at consultation. ESAS scores and demographics were analysed for their predictive ability for well-being via regression analysis of the raw and categorical scores.

In total, 1439 ESAS assessments were analysed; the median age was 69 years (range 21-95). The most common primary cancers were of the lung (36%), breast (21%) and prostate (18%). Greater distress in all ESAS items, lower Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and referral for bone metastases significantly predicted for worse well-being (all P &lt; 0.0001). However, referral for brain metastases predicted for better well-being. In multivariate analysis, the most predictive factors for worse well-being were lower KPS (P = 0.003) and greater distress in drowsiness (P = 0.01), pain (P &lt; 0.0001), fatigue (P &lt; 0.0001), depression (P &lt; 0.0001) and appetite loss (P &lt; 0.0001). Repeated analyses with categorical scores led to similar results.

Greater distress in physical and emotional symptoms assessed by ESAS contributes significantly to poorer well-being. Management for patients with advanced cancer should be directed towards these symptoms, as they form the basis for well-being. Although emotional symptoms may be scored lower than physical symptoms by patients, both significantly affect well-being.
