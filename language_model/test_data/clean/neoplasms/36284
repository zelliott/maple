Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) during metastasis is initially a two-step process beginning with delamination of cells from the solid tumor followed by acquisition of a migratory phenotype. Several reports indicate that plasma membrane blebbing, associated with cell division, coincides with cell delamination during developmental EMT. This raises a speculative question if blebbing drives EMT in cancer cells in a similar way. Here, we review available data on factors and processes that may support such a connection.
