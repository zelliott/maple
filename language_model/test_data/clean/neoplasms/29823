Cell spheroids are conglomerates of closely arranged cells with reciprocal effects among them. Spheroids are histologically similar to nodulary tumours. Cells constituting these spheroids are heterogenous in their sensitivity to X-rays and fast neutrons. Radiosensitivity of cells in a small spheroid is lower than that of similar cells grown in a monolayer.
