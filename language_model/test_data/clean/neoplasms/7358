We report our experience with epidural morphine analgesia. Morphine 2-3 mg in 10-15 ml 0.9% saline was given to patients after abdominal surgery, patients with terminal carcinoma and patients with multiple fractured ribs. Mean duration of analgesia was 14 hours and was not accompanied by severe complications.
