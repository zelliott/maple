The process of refolding or degrading misfolded proteins is the most important function of protein quality control (PQC) system. An imbalance between the capacity of PQC system and the quantity and severity of misfolded proteins may result in protein aggregate accumulation, which can ultimately contribute to a class of diseases referred to as conformational disorders. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that Ubiquilin 1 is an important component in PQC. Ubiquilin 1 has been indicated to be involved in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Here we review the evidence that Ubiquilin 1 is an important component of the PQC system and also review the role of Ubiquilin 1 in human diseases.
