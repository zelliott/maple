The objective of this phase I study was to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of weekly docetaxel and exisulind in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors were treated with intravenous weekly docetaxel with daily oral exisulind. The following dose levels (docetaxel/exisulind) were explored: 30-mg/m2/200 mg po bid, 35/200, 35/250 and 40/250. Docetaxel was administered weekly for 6 weeks followed by 2 weeks off, and exisulind was taken twice daily. Each cycle was 8 weeks.

Eighteen patients were enrolled in the study. All of them had received prior systemic therapy. Most patients had either melanoma or carcinomas of the upper gastrointestinal tract. A total of 31 cycles of therapy were administered. DLTs were grade 3 diarrhea, anorexia and fatigue and grade 3 cutaneous toxicity at dose level 4 (40/250). Myelosuppression was mild. Fatigue and gastrointestinal toxicity (anorexia, dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea) represented the most common toxicities. However, grade 3 and grade 4 toxicities were uncommon. There were no treatment related deaths. No objective responses were observed and five patients achieved stable disease.

The recommended dose for phase II studies is weekly docetaxel 35 mg/m2 for 6 weeks followed by 2 weeks off in combination with oral exisulind 250 mg po bid. This combination is feasible and well-tolerated at these doses.
