Paclitaxel (Taxol), is known to induce mitotic arrest and apoptosis by inhibiting the depolymerisation of microtubules. Tumour growth and metastasis are affected by the metabolic rate and angiogenesis. We investigated the effect of Paclitaxel on tumour metabolism and markers of angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Tissue samples of 39 patients diagnosed with invasive carcinoma were obtained. The solid tumours were cultured with Paclitaxel at a concentration of 4.27 ug/ml for 24 h. The metabolic rate of the samples was measured by ATP Bioluminescence assay and the levels of VEGF in culture medium were measured by ELISA.

The mean ATP concentration of control and test groups were 7.169 and 5.004 rlu/ml, respectively, suggesting that the metabolic rate was inhibited by Paclitaxel. The mean VEGF levels in the control and test groups were 5.335 and 4.567 pg/ml, respectively. All data analysed were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.005). The finding of the study showed that Paclitaxel could inhibit metabolic rate in solid tumour. It could also downregulate VEGF.

Our result suggested that Paclitaxel is an effective cytotoxic possibly with anti-angiogenic effects.
