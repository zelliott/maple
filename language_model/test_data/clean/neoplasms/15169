A comprehensive concept for cancer pain treatment is presented. The main idea of this concept is systematic analgesic pharmacotherapy. It is carried out in three steps, such as recommended by the WHO. This kind of therapy enables an individual adaptation or an increase of analgesic intensity when using non-narcotic analgetics, weak and strong opioids and adjuvant drugs. The principles of their application are discussed, detailed information about the dosage of certain drugs, their effects, side-effects and possible interactions is given, and examples of their clinical use are presented. The local peridural or intradural application of morphine enables a further increase in analgesic intensity. It is carried out by means of peridural and intradural catheters. Also for these cases dosages, side-effects and possible complications are described. The possibilities and advantages of prolonged analgesia with implantable systems (pain ports) and external portable or implantable pumps are discussed.
