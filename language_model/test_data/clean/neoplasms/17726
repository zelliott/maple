The trace element content of kidneys has been documented in very few international centres. Significant differences can be demonstrated between the cortical and medullary levels of calcium, zinc and cadmium. For the West of Scotland the values for the latter are similar to those found in Scandinavia. There are significantly higher cadmium contents in subjects who smoke and who have evidence of ischaemic heart disease.
