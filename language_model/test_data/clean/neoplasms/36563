Candidiasis remains the most frequently encountered fungal infection in patients with profound granulocytopenia and appears to be increasing in frequency. In addition, Candida infections are occurring earlier during remission induction chemotherapy and can be caused by a variety of species such as C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei. The most frequent source of disseminated infection is the gastrointestinal tract, as the integrity of the epithelium is disrupted by chemotherapeutic agents. The spectrum of disseminated candidiasis comprises both an acute and a chronic presentation (also known in the literature as hepatosplenic candidiasis). The management of disseminated infection consists of early empiric antifungal therapy with a standard agent, amphotericin B. Unfortunately, responses in the setting of profound granulocytopenia appear to be poor. Other agents that appear to be useful in the management of disseminated candidiasis include 5-flucytosine and fluconazole. Based on animal experimentation, it appears that the combination of these three classes of agents might produce superior results compared with amphotericin B alone. Removal of the central venous catheter does not appear warranted in the setting of profound granulocytopenia, and the role of colony stimulating factors needs to be defined. Given the severity and high mortality associated with disseminated candidiasis in patients with hematologic malignancies, antifungal prophylaxis appears warranted.
