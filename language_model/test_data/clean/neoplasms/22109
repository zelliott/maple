Leukocyte motility is known to be dependent on both beta2-integrins and matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2/-9 or gelatinases, which mediate leukocyte adhesion and the proteolysis needed for invasion, respectively. Gelatinases not only play an important role in cell migration, tissue remodeling, and angiogenesis during development, but are also involved in the progression and invasiveness of many cancers, including leukemias. The concept that MMPs associate with integrins, as well as their importance in some physiologic and pathologic conditions, has been advanced previously but has not been examined on leukocytes. This review will examine mainly the function of the MMP-integrin complexes in normal leukocyte migration and the effect of integrin and broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors in tumor progression.
