Ethylbenzene has been evaluated for carcinogenic activity in Fischer rats and B6C3F1 mice exposed by inhalation (Chan et al., 1998; Chan, 1999) and in Sprague-Dawley rats after oral exposure (Maltoni et al., 1985,1997). Bioassay findings are summarized below to expand on those not stated clearly or completely in Saghir et al. (2010). Overall in these three studies animals exposed to ethylbenzene had increased tumors in rats for kidneys, testes, head (including rare neuroesthesioepitheliomas), and total malignant tumors, whilst in mice tumor incidences were increased in the lung and liver (Huff, 2002). Thus ethylbenzene was carcinogenic by two exposure routes to both sexes of two species of rodents, two strains of rats, and one strain of mice, causing collectively tumors in five different target organs and a composite of "total malignant" tumors.
