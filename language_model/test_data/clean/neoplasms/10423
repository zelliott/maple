Storage of platelets &gt; 5 days provides improved availability, logistical management and decreased outdating. Promising results on in vitro parameters and on in vivo post-transfusion recovery and survival of autologous platelets in healthy volunteers have earlier been shown. To provide additional verification, randomized patient transfusion studies are needed.

Sixty allogeneic haematopoietic progenitor cell transplant recipients were randomized to receive buffy-coat (BC) platelets stored in platelet additive solution (PAS) for 1-5 days the first time a prophylactic transfusion was needed after transplantation, followed the second time by platelets stored for 6-7 days or vice versa. The corrected count increment (CCI) for 1 and 24 h were calculated.

CCI 1 h and CCI 24 h were higher for platelets stored 1-5 days as compared to 6-7 days, 10.4 +/- 5.1 vs. 7.4 +/- 3.8 (P &lt; 0.001) and 5.4 +/- 4.1 vs. 2.6 +/- 2.6 (P &lt; 0.001), respectively. Time to next platelet transfusion was significantly longer after a transfusion of platelets stored for 1-5 days as compared to platelets stored for 6-7 days: 2.2 +/- 1.1 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.8 days, respectively (P &lt; 0.005). No differences in bleeding events and no transfusion reaction were recorded.

The advantage of an extension of platelet storage time beyond day 5 should be balanced against the increased need for platelet transfusions that may occur and the conceivable risk of transfusion failure.
