Apoptosis is a mode of active cell death having distinct biochemical and morphological features including chromatin condensation, polynucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and disruption of cells into apoptotic bodies. The apoptotic process plays a major role both during development and in the functioning of the immune system. Apoptosis may in part be genetically regulated, and may also be linked to physiological and non physiological signals from the environment. Apoptosis may be a defense at the cellular level against cancer. Moreover, there is evidence that a number of pro-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are involved in regulating apoptosis. Further understanding of the molecular events underlying the apoptotic process should provide new insights into the mechanism of tumorigenesis and facilitate the development of new strategies for the treatment of cancer.
