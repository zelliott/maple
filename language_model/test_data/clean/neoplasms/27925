This article brings together the several current approaches to the use of short-term tests for identifying carcinogens and the several meanings of the term 'genotoxic'. Examples of genotoxic and nongenotoxic carcinogens and of genotoxic and nongenotoxic mechanisms of carcinogenesis are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the determination of genotoxicity as it affects evaluation of the mechanism of action of a new rodent carcinogen.
