The purpose of this investigation was to compare the risk factors, clinical features and outcomes in cancer patients with bacteraemia caused by vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. A retrospective, observational 7-year study was carried out in a 450-bed, acute-care university-affiliated hospital. We performed univariate comparisons between the two groups and then multivariate analysis to identify patient risk factors for E. faecium isolation. Seventy-three patients were included in the analysis: 54 (74.0%) with bacteraemia caused by E. faecalis and 19 (26.0%) by E. faecium. The Simplified Acute Physiological Score (SAPS) value was significantly greater in E. faecium isolates (40.7 vs. 35.2; p = 0.009). Diabetes mellitus was more frequently diagnosed in patients with E. faecium bacteraemia (52.6% vs. 24.1%; p = 0.021). Prior penicillin exposure was more frequent in patients with E. faecium bacteraemia (68.4% vs. 29.6%; p = 0.003). There was a trend toward higher mortality in E. faecium bacteraemia patients (47.4% vs. 25.9%; p = 0.084). Independent patient risk factors for E. faecium isolation were prior penicillin exposure (odds ratio [OR], 6.479; p = 0.003) and SAPS &gt; 34 (OR, 6.896; p = 0.009). When compared to E. faecalis bacteraemia, E. faecium bacteraemia in cancer patients is independently associated with more severe illness and prior use of penicillins; therefore, empiric treatment which would cover E. faecium should be considered in cancer patients suspected of having bacteraemia.
