KRN7000, an anticancer drug candidate developed by Kirin Brewery Co. in 1995, is an Î±-galactosyl ceramide. It is a ligand making a complex with CD1d protein, and it stimulates invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells, which are one of the lineages of immunocytes. NKT cells activated by recognition of the CD1d/KRN7000 complex with its invariant T-cell receptor (TCR) can induce both protective and regulatory immune responses. To determine the recognition and activation mechanisms of NKT cells and to develop drug candidates more effective than KRN7000, a large number of analogs of KRN7000 have been synthesized. Some of them show potent bioactivities and have the potential of being utilized as therapeutic agents. In this review, structure-activity relationship studies of novel glycolipids which stimulate NKT cells efficiently are summarized.
