Cancer deaths determined from national vital statistics in Canadian ('Chinese') immigrants who were born in mainland China, Hong Kong or Taiwan were compared with those in the Canadian-born population. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) based on 1981 census data and on 755 deaths among 81,740 Chinese males and 586 deaths among 83,965 females during 1980-1984, showed that the overall cancer mortality in Chinese males (SMR 141), and females (SMR 116), was significantly higher than in the Canadian-born. Moreover, SMR varied by cancer site and showed a pattern of risks similar to those reported for foreign-born Chinese in the USA: strikingly high SMR for nasopharynx and liver or gallbladder in males and females; high ratios for stomach, intestines or colon, rectum, and lung, but a low ratio for prostate in males; and high ratios for lung and cervix uteri but low ratios for breast and ovary in females. These findings indicate that useful studies on cancer mortality could be carried out in Canadian Chinese.
