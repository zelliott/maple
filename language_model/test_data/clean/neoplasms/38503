A survey of 24 pediatric oncologists from 21 institutions not performing bone marrow transplants found that 156 patients were referred for transplants in the years 1984/85; only 10 of these patients were not transplanted. No patient in good clinical condition whose disease was under control was denied transplantation after evaluation at a transplant center. The decision for transplantation was made by the families and the referring pediatric oncologists, almost always before the patient was seen at a transplant center. The fact that almost all patient and family evaluations at transplant centers take place after a family has decided to have a marrow transplant has obvious implications regarding informed consent. Referring pediatric oncologists must attempt to provide the best possible information to families when decisions regarding marrow transplantation are actually being made.
