The 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17beta-HSDs) are involved in the regulation of estrogens and androgens by catalyzing the reduction of 17-ketosteroids or the oxidation of 17beta hydroxysteroids. The enzyme activities associated with the different 17beta-HSD isoforms are widespread in human tissues, not only in classic steroidogenic tissues but also in a large series of peripheral intracrine tissues. Being involved at the end of steroidogenesis, the numerous members of 17beta-HSD family constitute interesting therapeutic targets for controlling the concentration of estrogens and androgens. Thus, inhibitors of reductive 17beta-HSD isoforms are attractive to block the formation of hydroxysteroids that stimulate estrogeno-sensitive pathologies (breast, ovarian, and endometrium cancers) and androgeno-sensitive pathologies (prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, acne, and hirsutism). The inhibitors could be used to block the degradation of estradiol, an attractive strategy for treating osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease. In addition to their classical use as anti-cancer agents and therapeutic agents, inhibitors of 17beta-HSDs are also useful tools to elucidate the role of these enzymes in particular biological systems. The present review article gives a description of novel inhibitors of 17beta-HSDs that were published in 2003-2006.
