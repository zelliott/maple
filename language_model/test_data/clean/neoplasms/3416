Myeloid growth factors are widely used in both pediatric and adult oncology. Although the literature supporting the use of growth factors in pediatric oncology is less extensive than the adult literature, some uses are clearly established. Both granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor shorten the duration of febrile neutropenia after myelosuppressive chemotherapy, effectively mobilize hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation, and enhance neutrophil engraftment after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although some open-label, uncontrolled trials and retrospective analyses support growth factor use to ameliorate the number of infections, duration of hospitalizations, and duration of intravenous antibiotic use after myelosuppressive chemotherapy or to enhance dose intensity, randomized controlled trials supporting these practices are lacking.
