Natural killer (NK) cells have important functions in the innate immunity to tumors. Recognition of tumor cells by NK cells is mediated by the interaction of activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors with ligands expressed on the tumor target. In addition, NK cell-target cell interactions require the engagement of adhesion molecules that stabilize the cell-cell conjugate. Recently, several novel NK cell receptors have been reported to regulate NK cell adhesion and activation through interaction with ligands of the nectin and nectin-like (Necl) family of adhesion molecules. We here review current knowledge on these receptors, CD226, CD96 and CRTAM, and their role in tumor immunosurveillance.
