Cancer cells arise from an increasing genetic disarray affecting control over proliferation, self-defence, and senescence. Multiple mechanisms with a multitude of players are invoked in the genetic distortion which leads to tumour progression in different tissues. Tumour pathology is in need of a clear, distinctive classification of tumour samples for assessment of risk and treatment. What for, and how should these two fields be combined? Markers which indicate the overall genetic disorder in cancer cells may be sufficient, in addition to a morphological description, to assess risk of cancer patients, in particular in cases with lymph node-negative disease. However, a refinement of risk is at hand when a better evaluation of genetic alterations is achieved. The status of genetic malfunctioning may also provide target(s) for therapy as well. In this editorial, the genetic alterations implicated in disturbed regulation of the G1 phase of the cell cycle by the Rb/cyclin D1/p16/cdk4 pathway are considered to provide relevant information to assess risk as well as to target therapy.
