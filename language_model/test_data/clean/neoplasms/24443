There are more than 100 distinct types of cancer, and subtypes can be found within specific organs. Cancer progression is a complex multi-step process. These steps reflect alterations that drive the progressive transformation of normal cells into highly malignant ones. One critical step in tumor growth and invasion is the proteolytic processing of the extracellular matrix environment. The degradation of the extracellular matrix not only enables cell migration, invasion, and metastasis formation, but also affects cell behavior in multiple ways; on one hand by cleaving extracellular matrix bound growth factors and on the other hand by inhibiting angiogenesis into the tumor by liberating cryptic endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis. Serine proteases and matrix metalloproteases are families of proteolytic enzymes involved in physiological and pathological extracellular matrix and basement membrane processing. In this review, we will focus on the role and activation of trypsinogens, a family of serine proteases, in cancer progression.
