An excessive number of studies on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has rendered results often contradictory and difficult to interpret. HRQOL evaluation in the aged is even more difficult, due to intrinsic conceptual and methodological problems. Since no structured instruments are available for use in geriatric surgery, it would be necessary either to work out a new specific instrument or to adapt/adopt an already existing method. Properties and methodological steps for development and validation are set forth. The Functional Assessment for Cancer Therapy (FACT) scale was developed for patients with cancer and has been recently validated also in the elderly. The Multidimensional Assessment for Cancer in the Elderly (MACE) was originally developed for elderly cancer patients. Since both methods are irrespective of subjects undergoing surgery, its use requires further validation. The MACE gives a broad information spectrum, but in geriatric surgery it seems too complex. The FACT-G is a simple core item questionnaire which can be integrated by disease-specific items and seems more compliant. A disease-specific and treatment-specific application of FACT questionnaires by multicenter studies might be useful in evaluating surgical procedures in patients in whom significant advantages in survival cannot be expected, but QOL can still significantly improve.
