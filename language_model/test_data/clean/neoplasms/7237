Unexpected findings in a mouse study in which the safety of FD&C No. 40 (Red 40) was examined led to additional experimentation and to new statistical analyses and models. The possibility of acceleration of tumors raised questions about an operational definition of acceleration and of appropriate statistical methods for assessing acceleration, especially in the face of data dredging. The evaluation of Red 40 was further complicated by cage and litter effects and the multigenerational design. In this report the investigations of these studies are reviewed and are used to illustrate how new scientific work can emerge through the regulatory process. A number of issues in animal experimentation that need to be examind are indicated.
