The introduction of local hyperthermia as a method of cancer therapy implies the necessity of quantitative measurements of the thermal dose. Our intention is to describe the nature of the problem, both physically and physiologically, with illustrations drawn from thermographic measurements in phantoms and in animals. The characteristics of a thermometry calibration facility are described. Some measurement problems associated with conventional thermometer probes are mentioned and several new thermometers which were developed for use in the electromagnetic fields are reviewed. We present some of the concepts that will guide the development of noninvasive thermometry. Systemic hyperthermia is not considered. We recommend that other reviews specifically directed toward localized hyperthermia be prepared on the methods of heating and on thermal physiological problems.
