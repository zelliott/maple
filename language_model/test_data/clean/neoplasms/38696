Expression of 3 cellular oncogenes among 7 ones under investigation is identified in the majority of 20 strains of human tumors, passaged in nude mice without significant specificity as far as the type of the tumor is concerned. The levels of the expression of these 3 oncogenes (c-myc, c-fos, c-ras) were higher than the ones in primary human tumors except for the human melanoma Mel-2 strain, where the expression of c-myb oncogene was identified. All the rest oncogenes (c-mos, B-lym, c-sis, c-myb) showed no expression in human tumors of the examined strains.
