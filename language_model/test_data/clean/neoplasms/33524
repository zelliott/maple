An in-gel renaturation method allows the visualization, quantitation, and initial characterization of reiterated DNA restriction fragments (RRFs) without prior possession of their probes. Using this method we analyzed EcoRI restricted DNAs from ten human tumors, paired normal tissues from these patients, ten unpaired tumors, and 26 noncancer patients. Frequent qualitative and quantitative differences in the relative radioactive intensities of all or specific RRFs in the DNA from different individuals have been observed. However, we also report frequent two- to ten-fold alterations in the relative radioactive intensities of several specific RRFs in tumor-control analyses of DNA from the same individual. A 0.65-kb alphoid-like DNA RRF was decreased in six tumors and increased in none. Moreover, a new 1.55-kb RRF was observed in two colon cancer DNAs. Several new RRFs, suggestive of gene amplification, were detected in a neuroblastoma, two of which were also seen in a glioma. These data support frequent qualitative and quantitative alterations of specific reiterated DNA sequences in human cancer when compared with paired controls. This approach will allow the future characterization of specific DNA sequences whose patterns of altered reiteration suggest a role in the emergence of specific malignancies.
