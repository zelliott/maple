A modified technique has been developed for the visualization of the chromosomes in human sperm. The cytogenetic analysis of 129 G-banded human sperm metaphases of 6 normal donors showed an incidence of structural and numerical chromosome abnormalities of 7.8%. Two out of 129 spermatozoa were aneuploid (1.6%). The frequency of sperms with chromatid-type aberrations was 2.3% (3/129). Chromosome-type aberrations were found in 5 out of 129 (3.9%) spermatozoa. X to Y ratio did not differ significantly from the expected one-to-one ratio. Twenty-six sperm complements from a patient 18-20 months after testes exposure to 30 Gy were examined. A significant increase of numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities was not observed. Chromatid-type aberrations were found in two sperm complements (7.7%) and chromosome-type aberrations in one sperm complement (3.9%). The cytogenetic analysis of 15 human sperms from a cancer patient 26 months after chemotherapy showed an increased frequency of aberrant sperm complements (33.4%). One chromatid-type (6.7%), three chromosome-type aberrations (20.0%) and one (6.7%) hyperploid sperm complement could be observed. The sample size is still too small to answer the question whether chemical mutagens may increase the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in human sperm.
