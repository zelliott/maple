We have previously described the generation of reconstituting retroviral (ReCon) vectors designed for cancer gene therapy using cytotoxic gene products. The unique vector structure with a promoter physically separated from the transgene allows generation of stable virus producer cells irrespective of the toxic gene. The mechanism of synthesis of DNA from retroviral RNA dictates that infection leads to the reconstitution of functional expression cassettes in the target cell.

To improve vector titres, a cytomegalovirus enhancer was inserted upstream of the 5'-long-terminal repeat (LTR); the Woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element and an elongated attachment site upstream of the 3'-LTR were included. In addition, a bacterial origin of replication was deleted and a functional internal polyadenylation signal mutated. Transcriptional targeting was attempted by introducing mammary tissue-specific promoters such as the U3 region of mouse mammary tumour virus or the promoter of the whey acidic protein encoding gene. All modifications were analysed in detail with respect to virus production and infectivity. Finally, the vector was armed with the lambda-holin encoding gene and transduced cells were analysed for cytotoxic effects.

Distinct modifications of the vector resulted in a titre improvement of more than 560-fold. Compatibility of the optimized vector with targeted cellular promoters was demonstrated. When equipped with the cytotoxic gene, stable producer cells could be successfully established and high titre virus infection resulted in rigorous target cell killing.

The ReCon vector in its optimized form is an attractive tool for cancer gene therapy approaches.
