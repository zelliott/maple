Data on the application of neurospecific proteins S-100, GFAP, D2 glycoprotein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in the differential tumor diagnosis are reviewed. S-100 protein and GFAP are found in well differentiated astroglial tumors. S-100 protein can be used as melanoma and Schwannoma specific marker. In malignant CNS tumors there is a decrease of S-100 protein content up to its complete disappearance, while the content of GFAP is variable. D2 glycoprotein is detected in gliomas and medulloblastomas, being absent in other brain tumors. NSE is invariably present in apudomas and was also found in the majority of investigated astrocytomas, ependymomas, glioblastomas and in some medulloblastomas.
