Soluble Fas (sFas) is produced as translation products of alternative mRNA splicing, and antagonizes the membranous Fas molecule in Fas/Fas ligand interactions. We investigated the serum sFas levels in 64 Japanese silicosis patients with no clinical symptoms of autoimmune diseases or malignant tumours, using ELISA for sFas. The serum sFas levels in the silicosis patients were significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers. Elevated serum sFas levels were also detected in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus but, unexpectedly, no difference was observed in sFas levels between progressive systemic sclerosis patients and healthy volunteers. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the expression of Fas on peripheral blood lymphocytes between the patients with silicosis and age-matched healthy volunteers. These observations provided the first evidence that serum sFas levels are elevated in silicosis patients without clinical symptoms of autoimmune diseases or malignant tumours. It remains to be clarified whether patients with elevated sFas levels have a tendency to develop autoimmune diseases later, or whether some other distinct factor(s) is necessary to initiate the progression of autoimmune diseases.
