Analysis of mortality among men who were employed by Reserve Mining Company from 1952 to 1976 has been carried out. Follow-up was conducted with standard methods, including searches by the Social Security Administration. Occupational exposures to dust were based on personal samples taken over the past five years by the industrial hygiene department of the company. Smoking habits were obtained by mailed questionnaires or telephone interviews. A modified life table method was used to compare death rates of the employees with those expected for white males in the state of Minnesota. Comparisons were also made with US rates for white males. The results showed that the death rates for all causes were significantly below expectation. Deaths from malignant diseases were marginally below those expected for the state. Exposures to total dust, to silica dust, or to fiber were low. There was no relationship between mortality and estimated lifetime dust exposures, nor was there any suggestion that deaths from malignant neoplasms were increased after 15 to 20 years latency. In contrast, there was a strong relationship between smoking habits and mortality from all causes, from cardiovascular diseases, and from cancer. This study does not suggest any increase in cancer mortality from taconite exposure.
