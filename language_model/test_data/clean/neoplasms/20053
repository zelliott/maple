A worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is in progress. This disease carries a heavy socioeconomic burden.

To compare the incidence rate of overall and site-specific cancers among Israeli Arabs with T2DM to that of Israeli Arabs without.

A retrospective cohort study of all adult Arab members of Clalit Health Care Services in northern Israel was conducted over a 10 year period (1999-2008).

During the study period 752 and 2045 incident cases of cancer were diagnosed among 13,450 adults with diabetes and 74,484 without, respectively. The follow-up time involved 817,506 person-years. Diabetes was associated with a standard incidence ratio (SIR) of 3.27 (95% CI 1.49-5.05) and 2.87 (95% CI 1.25-4.50) for pancreatic cancer in men and women, respectively. A significantly reduced SIR (0.67, 95% CI 0.36-0.99) was observed for esophageal, stomach and intestinal cancers in men.

Our findings support an association between T2DM and increased risk of cancer of the pancreas in Arab men and women. A significantly reduced risk of all other cancers was observed only in Arab men. Our findings underscore the need for effective diabetes and cancer prevention and intervention programs.
