I describe morphologic, histologic, immunohistochemical, and serologic changes in dogs with spontaneous breast adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, hemangiopericytoma, and fibrosarcoma after extracorporeal perfusion of plasma over heat-killed and formalin-stabilized Staphylococcus aureus Cowans I (SAC), which was embedded in a membrane filtration system. In 12 dogs with breast adenocarcinoma, tumor necrosis was observed within 12 hours after perfusion; 24 hours after perfusion, multiple visible lesions in 6 of 6 dogs exhibited necrosis, but there was no reaction in uninvolved normal mammary tissue. In 8 dogs, healing of large ulcerated areas of cutaneous tumor was observed within 8 to 18 days after perfusion. Similar tumoricidal responses were observed in dogs with other neoplasms after SAC perfusion. Tumor cell necrosis oserved within 4 hours after extracorporeal perfusion was associated with immunohistochemical deposits of IgG and C'3 and ultrastructural evidence of lytic lesions on tumor cell membranes. No tumoricidal effects were observed after perfusion over Staphylococcus aureus Woods (SAW) (non-protein A bearing) in 3 dogs that previously or subsequently responded to SAC perfusion. No tumoricidal reactions were noted after phlebotomy of up to 50% of plasma volume in 6 tumor-bearing dogs that subsequently responded to SAC perfusion. SAC but not SAW perfusion was followed by increases in circulating tumor associated antibodies (TAA) for up to 48 hours after perfusion. Immune complexes increased after perfusion and remained elevated fo 72 hours. Findings suggest that the acute tumoricial responses are not due to mere removal of circulating immune reactants and may be initiated by TAA that are rendered operational after extracorporeal perfusion over SAC. The rapidity, specificity, and magnitude of the observed tumoricidal effects in various canine neoplastic diseases suggests that this may have potentially broad-based therapeutic and biologic implications for canine neoplasia.
