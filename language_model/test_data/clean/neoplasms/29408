Leukotrienes are arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediators of inflammation. The initial catalytic step in the formation of leukotrienes is catalyzed by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in conjunction with its activating partner protein FLAP. The long-awaited crystal structure of 5-LOX--reported in a recent issue of Science--should lead to novel, purpose-designed inhibitors for the treatment of asthma and for probing leukotriene involvement in cardiovascular disease and cancer.
