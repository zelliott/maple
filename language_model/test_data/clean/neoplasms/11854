We have used two highly sensitive assays to quantitate p97, a protein associated with human melanoma, in cultured cells and normal adult, fetal, and neoplastic tissues. To measure p97 at the surface of intact cells, radiolabeled Fab fragments of a monoclonal antibody specific for p97 were used in a binding assay. To measure p97 in detergent-solubilized membrane preparations, we used a novel double-determinant immunoassay that uses two monoclonal antibodies to two distinct antigenic determinants of p97. These assays revealed that although p97 is present in small amounts in normal adult tissues, it is present in much larger amounts in most melanomas, in some other tumors (both benign and malignant), and in certain fetal tissues. We conclude that monoclonal antibodies to p97 may prove to be of value for the diagnosis and therapy of melanoma.
