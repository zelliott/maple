Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a novel anticancer and anti-angiogenic agent, which acts through copper chelation and NF-kappaB inhibition.

This review summarizes the scientific rationale for the use of TM as an anticancer agent in human studies.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted for the use of TM in cancer including preclinical, animal and human studies. The results of this search are summarized in this review.

Copper chelation using TM has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical and animal models as an alternative and novel anti-angiogenic agent. Phase I and II clinical trials conducted in solid tumors using TM have demonstrated efficacy with favorable toxicity profile. The use of copper lowering as an anti-angiogenic strategy in the cancer chemopreventative setting remains to be investigated.
