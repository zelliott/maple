To study the psychosocial factors and illness variables associated with children's and parents' perceptions of and ways of coping with cancer, in 38 childhood cancer patients aged 5-15 years, coping was studied in relation to sociodemographic variables and self-perception in terms of competence, behaviour and self-worth. Less optimal coping was found to be associated with poor family communications and lack of sharing/expression of emotions ( P=0.005), presence of behavioural and emotional problems in the child ( P=0.008) and parental lack of hope ( P=0.001). No association was found with gender, parental education or occupation, socioeconomic status, or child's self-perception including global estimation of self-worth. Furthermore, none of the illness variables was found to be associated with coping. Awareness about health-related issues was found to be strongly associated with parental education ( P=0.000). Our findings suggest that parental hope and both social and family communication are integral to helping patients and families cope with the illness experience.
