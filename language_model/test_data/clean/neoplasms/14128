1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3, [1,25(OH)2D3], the biologically most active metabolite of vitamin D3, is involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. Recently, receptors for 1,25(OH)2D3 have also been shown in cells and tissues not directly related to calcium homeostasis. Experimental data obtained with leukaemic and cancer cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo, showed the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on cell differentiation and proliferation. However, high doses of the sterol have to be used to observe these effects. Additional studies are needed to establish whether 1,25(OH)2D3 or suitable analogues have a therapeutic potential in malignant diseases without unacceptable toxicity like the development of hypercalcemia.
