The in vitro and in vivo binding of a monoclonal antibody (MAB) that recognizes a tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen was studied in dogs. Monoclonal antibody 155H.7 was raised in response to innoculation of mice with beta-galactose(1-3)beta N-acetylgalactosamine conjugated to human serum albumin. Avidin-biotin-complex immunohistochemical staining of cryostat sections of normal and neoplastic canine tissue specimens revealed heterogenous binding of MAB 155H.7 to the cells of many canine mammary and lung carcinomas and homogenous staining of many sarcomas, including osteogenic sarcoma. In addition, there was variable staining of a variety of normal tissues including some ductual epithelium, peripheral nerve fibers, and some endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Immunoscintigraphy with 131I-labeled MAB 155H.7 was used to study the in vivo distribution of the antibody. The 131I-labeled MAB 155H.7 was administered to 1 clinically normal dog, 7 dogs with osteogenic sarcoma, 1 dog with undifferentiated sarcoma, and 2 dogs with mammary tumor. Scintigraphy revealed concentration of radioactivity in 8 of 10 tumor sites within 24 hours after MAB administration. The ratio of 131I in tumor sites to 131I in the surrounding normal tissues, compared with the similar ratio of 99mTc-labeled erythrocytes ranged from 1.1 to 4.3, in tumor vs normal tissue with a mean value of 2, confirming tumor localization of the radiolabeled MAB in excess of that associated with enhanced tumor vascularization.
