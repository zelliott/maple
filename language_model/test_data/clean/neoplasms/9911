This longitudinal study examined the mortality and cancer experience of workers at the Gulf Oil refinery located in Port Arthur, Texas. The cohort was studied over a period of 41 years, from 1937 to 1978, and consisted of 16,880 employees, with an accumulation of 406,198 person-years; 4361 deaths were observed. Emphasis of this study was placed on the experience of the hourly and salaried male workers employed one day or more and those with a minimum of one year employment. The standardized mortality ratio analysis revealed generally favorable mortality experience of the refinery workers, including that of overall cancer. Statistically significant deficits in mortality were found for several cancer sites including bladder, liver, and esophageal cancer. Many of the increased cancer risks suggested in the literature were not confirmed in this study. Although bone cancer was found to be increased significantly, review of those death certificates raises questions as to the accuracy of the recording and coding of this cancer. Sample size of this study is capable of providing sufficient statistical power for the detection of a twofold increase in mortality risk for many cancers, if such risk exists.
