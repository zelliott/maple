We have reviewed our experience with the treatment of 250 patients with deep vein thrombosis diagnosed by contrast venography. The level of thrombosis was recorded according to the anatomic level to which it extended. A third of the patients had cancer, and the most common clinical findings were swelling and pain. The risk of the development of pulmonary embolism, based on the anatomic level of initial deep vein thrombosis, revealed the following: 12 of 115 patients (10 percent) with level I (calf) deep vein thrombosis developed pulmonary embolism, as did 2 of 27 patients (7 percent) with level II (popliteal) disease, 5 of 60 (8 percent) with level III (thigh) disease, 1 of 19 patients (5 percent) with level IV (groin) disease, and 2 of 26 patients (8 percent) with level V (iliac) disease. Based on our favorable experience with heparin we believe that heparin is the treatment of choice for deep vein thrombosis regardless of the anatomic level. The incidence of pulmonary embolism does not appear to be influenced significantly by the level of the deep vein thrombosis.
