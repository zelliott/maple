As the primary prevention of disease has been emphasized, there may be a growing need for well-conditioned development and spread of OTC test equipment, OTC test reagent and remote healthcare. Some typical examples of "simple and rapid examination items, which can be done at home by established technology" are explained in this paper and may be required in the near future by the whole Japanese population with a view to the current status of OTC test and the coming relaxation of governmental regulation. The reasons why these examination items should be commercialized as Switch OTC and the epidemiological background are further discussed. In relation to metabolic syndrome derived from super spreader-like visceral mature adipocyte: SSVMAC, visceral fat rate measurement by bioelectrical impedance technology, postprandial blood glucose determination/urinary glucose determination, and urinary microalbumin detection, are explained with an example, together with the importance of early morning blood pressure recording. In the field of cancer and infectious diseases, immunological fecal occult blood determination as a marker of distal colorectal cancer, in which both higher survival rate and recovery rate by early detection have been established, Helicobacter pylori IgG antibodies or antigen examination including an examination of gastroduodenal disorder, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and genital chlamydia are emphasized.
