Three dogs receiving cyclophosphamide IV as part of a combination chemotherapeutic regimen developed macrohematuria, stranguria, and pollakiuria within 24 hours of administration of the first dose of this drug. An 11-year-old spayed mixed-breed dog with an oral squamous cell carcinoma was administered 250 mg of cyclophosphamide/m2 of body surface, whereas a 4-year-old castrated male Gordon Setter was treated with 100 mg of cyclophosphamide/m2 and a 6-year-old male German Shepherd Dog with a cutaneous hemangiosarcoma was administered 140 mg of cyclophosphamide/m2. Aerobic bacterial culture, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and urinalysis were performed on urine obtained by cystocentesis from all 3 dogs after hematuria was observed. Sterile hemorrhagic cystitis was diagnosed on the basis of large numbers of RBC in the urine, lack of pathogens on bacterial culturing of urine, and clinical signs. Although cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in dogs has been reported in the literature numerous times, acute episodes developing within 24 hours of administration of the first dose have not been reported in this species with the use of therapeutic doses. Therefore, appropriate precautionary steps should be taken, even when the drug is being administered intermittently.
