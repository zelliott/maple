Study of the p53 tumor suppressor has blossomed into a field of its own. From analysis of its mutations in several different cancers to deciphering the function of the protein in human cells, publications describing research on p53 annually number in the thousands. In the interest of presenting the most up-to-date information on the progress of cancer research involving p53, the workshop "p53: Twenty Years On" was organized in Trieste, Italy over May 20-22, 1999. The meeting highlighted some of the most exciting basic and clinical scientific findings on p53 within the last year.
