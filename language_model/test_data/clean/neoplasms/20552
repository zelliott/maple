The adhesion of cells to their surrounding extracellular matrix has vital roles in embryonic development, inflammatory responses, wound healing and adult tissue homeostasis. Cells attach to extracellular matrix by specific cell-surface receptors, of which the integrins and transmembrane proteoglycans are major representatives. The engagement of adhesion receptors triggers assembly of functional matrix contacts, in which bound matrix components, adhesion receptors and associated intracellular cytoskeletal and signalling molecules form large, localised multiprotein complexes. This review discusses the functional categories of matrix contacts, examples of the biological roles of matrix contacts in normal physiology, and examples of the ways in which abnormalities of matrix contacts are associated with major human diseases.
