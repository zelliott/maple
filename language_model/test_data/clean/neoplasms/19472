The review deals with the discussion of different mechanisms of the antitumor action of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), including the induction of endogenous cell mediators, the development of inflammatory and immune response and systemic metabolic changes. The complex action of these factors on the levels of cells, tissues, organs and the whole body led, in some cases, to the suppression or hemorrhagic necrosis of the tumor. These cases were regarded as analogous to the development of the septic syndrome when a cascade of reactions leading to the resorption of tumors was initiated and to chronic inflammation resulting, on the contrary, in the formation of pretumor status. The data on the role of cytokines in carcinogenesis are presented and the possible causes of established contradictions are discussed. The prospects of using LPS in the therapy of oncological diseases are discussed.
