Measurable concentrations of waste anesthetic gases have been found in hospital dental operating rooms. A mail survey of 4,797 general dental practitioners and 2,642 oral surgeons indicated that 20.2% of the general practitioners and 74.8% of the oral surgeons had anesthetic exposures exceeding three hours per week. In the comparison of the health of individuals exposed or unexposed to inhalation anesthetics, there was a significant increase (78%) of spontaneous abortion in the spouses of exposed dentists and a significant increase (156%) in liver disease for exposed dentists. The implication of these findings and possible solutions are discussed.
