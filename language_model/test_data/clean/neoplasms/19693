Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and their receptors (PDGFRs) are frequently expressed in various tumors and their expression levels correlate with tumor growth, invasiveness, drug resistance, and poor clinical outcomes. Emerging experimental evidence demonstrates that PDGFs exhibit multiple functions in modulation of tumor growth, metastasis, and the tumor microenvironment by targeting malignant cells, vascular cells, and stromal cells. Understanding PDGF-PDGFR-mediated molecular signaling may provide new mechanistic rationales for optimizing current cancer therapies and the development of future novel therapeutic modalities.
