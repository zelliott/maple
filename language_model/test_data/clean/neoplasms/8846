Aptamers are single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) oligonucleotides, which are able to bind their target with high selectivity and affinity. Owing to their multiple talents, aptamers combined with nanoparticles are nanosystems well qualified for the development of new biomedical devices for analytical, imaging, drug delivery and many other medical applications. Because of their target affinity, aptamers can direct the transport of aptamer-nanoparticle conjugates. The binding of the aptamers to the target "anchors" the nanoparticle-aptamer conjugates at their site of action. In this way, nanoparticle-based bioimaging and smart drug delivery are enabled, especially by use of systematically developed aptamers for cancer-associated biomarkers. This review article gives a brief overview of recent relevant research into aptamers and trends in their use in cancer diagnostics and therapy. A concise description of aptamers, their development and functionalities relating to nanoparticle modification is given. The main part of the article is dedicated to current developments of aptamer-modified nanoparticles and their use in cancer diagnostics and treatment.
