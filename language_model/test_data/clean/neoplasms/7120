We present the results of cytogenetic monitoring of the districts in Kemerovo region, which differ in standardized indices of cancer incidence. It has been shown that residents of the districts with high incidence of malignancies had higher average frequency of metaphases with chromosomal aberrations than the control group (4.06 +/- 0.12% and 2.76 +/- 0.13%, respectively). This difference is caused primarily by single or paired fragments. The increase in the frequency of aberrant metaphase incidence in the districts with elevated cancer frequency was observed both in the male and female groups as well as both in adults and children.
