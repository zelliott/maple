Since 1977, 64 children were diagnosed with cancer in the Department of Pediatrics of the University of Granada. Incidence and mortality rates from specific tumor types are discussed. Most common malignant neoplasms of children are: 1. Leukemia (36.3%). 2. Tumors of central nervous system (10.7%). 3. Lymphoma, and tumors of sympathetic nervous system (19.9%). 4. Soft tissue (6.1%). 5. Kidney (7.6%). 6. Bone (4.6%). Most of the male excess (1.9:1, p less than 0.01) is accounted for by acute lymphocytic leukemia, and central nervous system tumors. It is evident that about one-half of all children diagnosed currently with a malignant disease will survive for a long period. Psychosocial aspects of cancer in the young are commented. This paper examines how patients, family members and medical staff feel and behave in response to occurrence of cancer in adolescent.
