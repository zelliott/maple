Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) is a diagnostic technique which has achieved widespread use and acceptance. Its clinical use has continued to widen with the availability of more sophisticated methods of imaging. Its minimal invasiveness, cheap cost and easy application make it a technique of choice in investigating swellings even in children.

To investigate the reliability, safety and diagnostic value of FNAB in superficial masses including lymph nodes in children.

Superficial masses and lymph nodes of twenty consecutive children aged 2-13years were subjected to FNAB. Open biopsies were also performed on them to validate the FNAB. All specimens were subjected to examination by a cytopathologist and a histopathologist.

Nine of the patients (45 %) had malignant diseases (lymphoma and osteosarcoma); seven had tuberculous lymphadenopathy while four had reactive lymphadenitis. Open biopsies corroborated these findings. There were no false-negative or false-positive cytology results from aspirates. There were no complications related to the procedures.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a reliable, safe, less invasive and relatively cheaper alternative method of establishing a pathologic diagnosis, compared to open biopsy, in children.
