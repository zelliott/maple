Sixty-four consecutive patients with advanced breast cancer were included in a study designed to determine the prevalence of asthenia and its association with other clinical features. The Asthenia Score (AS, the average of four tests designed by our group to assess asthenia) was 59 +/- 9 for patients versus 88 +/- 7 for a group of 68 normal controls (p less than 0.001). Twenty-six patients (41%) scored below the tenth percentile of normal controls and were considered asthenics. AS was correlated with depression and the general severity index of the SCL-90 R test. No association was found between AS and nutritional status, lean body mass, tumor mass, anemia, or type of treatment. We conclude that asthenia is a frequent symptom in patients with advanced breast cancer, which, in our series, showed independent correlations only with psychological distress.
