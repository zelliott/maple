Several opposite effects of serotonin (5HT) on tumour growth have been reported. On one hand, 5HT is known as a growth factor for several types of nontumoural cells, and it has been proposed to take part in the autocrine loops of growth factors contributing to cell proliferation in aggressive tumours such as small cell lung carcinoma. Depending on the tumour type either 5HT2 or 5HT1 receptor antagonist have been found to inhibit the 5HT-induced increase in tumour growth. In contrast, several authors have also reported that 5HT and 5HT2 agonist can inhibit tumour growth. Most often this effect has been considered to be related with the specific vasoconstrictive effect of 5HT or 5HT2 agonists on the vessels irrigating the tumour, which has been evidenced by intravital microscopy. Intravital microscopy studies have also shown that vessels perfusing the tumour exhibit a specific vasconstrictive response to 5HT1 agonists. In addition, 5HT has been shown to be involved in the effects of several anticancer treatments associated with the reduction of tumour flow. Finally, the specific vasoconstrictive effect of 5HT or 5HT receptor subtype agonists might also be useful in inducing hypoxia in tumours, which could be exploited in a strategy using hypoxia-selective cytotoxins or hypoxia-selective gene therapy.
