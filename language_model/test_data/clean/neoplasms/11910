A test dose of arsenic was given to four patients with arsenical carcinoma. Blood arsenic levels, urinary and faecal excretion were measured and compared with those of three normal control subjects. Blood levels and urinary excretion were lower in the carcinoma subjects, suggesting increased storage. Abnormally high retention of arsenic, either medicinal or environmental, may be an individual metabolic trait and may be an important factor in carcinogenesis.
