More than 27 items have been used as tumor markers in Japan. However, their usefulness is limited mostly for monitoring of cancer patients. The screening is achieved by several markers such as those secreted in urine, breast discharge and feces. Biological and oncodevelopmental characteristics are reflected on these markers and may provide the suitable treatments. Occult metastasis or recurrence can be detected by serial determinations of the serum markers.
