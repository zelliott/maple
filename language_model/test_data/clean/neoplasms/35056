Chromosome alterations, which are directly visible changes in the DNA, have close associations to cancer development, non-specific ageing, and heritable genetic status. Human lymphocyte cultures can be used for cytogenetic monitoring of genetic health because many cancers and genetic effects are caused by long-term unhealthy life-styles. We have investigated the sensitivities of lymphocytes from inherited-cancer-prone diseases to the induction of the chromosome alterations by mutagens and carcinogens, and the correlations between the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in peripheral lymphocytes and life-styles or daily ways of living. Lymphocytes from patients with Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia, xeroderma pigmentosum, ataxia telangiectasia, and Bloom syndromes showed altered (usually enhanced) susceptibilities to the induction of chromosome aberrations and SCEs by mutagens and carcinogens in our environments. Mean frequencies of baseline SCEs in lymphocytes from normal men with poor life-styles have also been shown to be significantly higher than those in cells from men having good life-styles. The former cells have further been shown to have hyper sensitivities to the induction of SCEs by mitomycin-C' treatment compared to latter cells. Unhealthy life-styles also make the lymphocytes to be more sensitive to ara-C's enhancement of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations.
