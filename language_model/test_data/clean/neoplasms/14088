Hyaluronic acid (HA), an unbranched high molecular weight polysaccharide can now be measured by several immunometric assays. The connective tissues are the main source of HA and it is destroyed mainly in the liver. Very high levels of HA occur in mesothelioma. Wilms' tumour and acute liver failure, and moderate increases in rheumatoid diseases, renal failure and cirrhosis. Local increased production of HA is a feature of several forms of lung disease. HA is an indicator of connective tissue turnover, of the function of the receptor mechanisms for its capture and destruction by the liver, and of the removal of low molecular weight fragments by the kidney.
