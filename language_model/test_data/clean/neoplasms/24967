Recently much attention has been given to the anti-cancer drug nutlin-3a, an antagonist of murine double minute 2 (MDM2) that actively inhibits p53-MDM2 interaction. Reactivating p53 function by nutlin-3a thus provides a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer. Although nutlin-3a seems a potential candidate in restoring p53 activity, it has many lacunae, toxicity, poor bioavailability, nonspecific delivery, and most importantly it is a substrate of multidrug resistance protein. The objective of the present study is to prepare and characterize nutlin-3a loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs), surface functionalized with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody, with an aim to deliver encapsulated drug in a targeted manner to its site of action and to enhance its therapeutic efficacy many times over. The enhanced cellular uptake of EpCAM antibody conjugated nutlin-3a loaded NPs (EpCAM-nutlin-3a-NPs) over native nulin-3a, nutlin-3a loaded NPs (nutlin-3a-NPs) in HCT116 and A549 cells substantiate the targeting potentiality of conjugated system. IC₅₀ values depicted superior antiproliferative activity of EpCAM-nutlin-3a-NPs over nutlin-3a-NPs and native nutlin-3a in the above studied cell lines. Cell cycle arrest, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis induced by above formulation were confirmed by flow cytometry. Expression of p53, p21, EpCAM, and C-myc proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis were investigated by western blotting. The above investigation indicates the enhanced therapeutic ability of EpCAM-nutlin-3a-NPs compared to nutlin-3a or nutlin-3a-NPs. Thus, our results suggest that EpCAM-nutlin-3a-NPs could be a potentially useful drug carrier system for targeted delivery of potent anti-cancer drug nutlin-3a for cancer therapy.
