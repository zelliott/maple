To describe neurologic and cognitive alterations underlying symptoms of depression and to explore cognitive-behavioral approaches to promoting recovery from cancer-related depression.

Published literature, unpublished raw data, and clinical observations.

Depression is a progressive condition that is most responsive to treatment in its earliest stages because of the progressive nature of alterations in neurologic circuits and neurotransmitters. Aggressive screening and management using cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques can promote recovery from cancer-related depression and improve patients' quality of life. Application of CBT techniques to patient environments also holds promise of relieving and preventing depression.

By placing more emphasis on screening for cancer-related depression among newly diagnosed and treated patients, oncology nurses can expedite treatment of cancer-related depression. Working within psychiatric liaison teams or guidelines for routine psychiatric care, oncology nurses can promote recovery and create therapeutic environments that are conducive to promoting patients' mental health along the cancer trajectory.
