Ninety-eight patients with 100 different tumors of the small bowel were studied. There were more malignant than benign tumors. Adenocarcinoma was the commonest lesion and the ileum the most frequent anatomical site of all tumors. Except for carcinoid tumors, the lesions were observed more often in male than in female patients. The average age of patients in this series was higher than that reported in most other series. Loss of weight, and abdominal pain were the most constant symptoms. Clinical syndromes of anemia and bleeding, small bowel obstruction, biliary obstruction, perforation with peritonitis, abdominal tumor, melanosis with small bowel polyposis, and cutaneous von Recklinghausen's disease with small bowel neurofibromatosis were encountered either alone or in combination. In the group operated upon, a resection of the involved segment with end-to-end anastomosis was done when feasible. None of the patients operated upon before 1946 lived as much as five years after operation. The most common causes of death were extension of the primary tumor and metastasis, peritonitis due to perforation, associated bronchopneumonia, and hemorrhage.
