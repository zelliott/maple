A high performance liquid chromatography has been adapted to the measurement of putrescine, spermidine and spermine in plasma and erythrocytes. Detection was by fluorimetry using o-phthalaldehyde which formed fluorophores with the polyamines. Sensitivity of the method was better than 10 pmol of each polyamine, and recovery averaged 93.9 percent. The precision of the analysis was two percent (R.S.D.). Good correlation was obtained with a reference chemical ionization gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric procedure. Reference intervals for polyamines in both plasma and erythrocytes were estimated on the basis of 25 normal volunteers.
