Indenoindoles and their isomers cyclopentacarbazoles represent a wide class of synthetic and natural compounds. The great interest of these structures in (bio)organic chemistry is due to the use of various building blocks to get the elemental four ring structure. Depending on the synthetic route chosen, the chemists can achieve a large number of regioisomers. Each regioisomer can be considered as a template for specific functionalizations. Therefore, this mini-review aims (i) to present an overview on how to access this large family of heterocyclic compounds and (ii) to discuss their various biological applications and drug development in oncology (e.g. kinases), in CNS disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's disease), in endocrinology (e.g. hormone replacement therapy) and oxidative stress (e.g. organ preservation). Past and present works will be presented through the systems 6-5-5-6 and 6-5-6-5 (combination of 6-membered and 5-membered rings).
