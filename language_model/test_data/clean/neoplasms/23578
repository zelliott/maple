The Twelfth International Conference on Endothelin (ET-12) was held at Clare College, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, from September 11-14, 2011, with researchers from basic and clinical science from nearly 20 countries attending. The conference featured a number of invited lectures, presentation of new research in several oral and poster sessions. It also featured newly introduced and well-received interactive panel discussion reviewing results and challenges of clinical trials using endothelin receptor antagonists conducted in the past 20 years. Evidence for new roles of endothelin in physiology and disease was presented, as well as new data from clinical trials in cancer and renal disease suggesting therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological modulation of the endothelin system.
