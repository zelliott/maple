The use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been rapidly growing in the United States. This technology is now being used in a multitude of academic and community centers throughout the country and is being incorporated into the treatment of cancers in almost every anatomical site, most commonly head and neck cancer, central nervous system tumors, and prostate cancer. In addition, current protocols are investigating the use of IMRT for the treatment of breast cancer, lung cancer, abdominal/retroperitoneal malignancies, and gynecological diseases. This article presents a brief technical review of IMRT and addresses specific clinical concerns and caveats that radiation oncologists should be aware of when utilizing this technology.
