Cancer is the most deadly disease in the United States. In developing countries such as China, cancer is increasingly prevalent as a cause of death. The "war against cancer" that was initially declared in the United States has become a global war that requires an alliance of world-wide cancer researchers. As part of such an effort, the Second Guangzhou International Symposium on Oncology was held on May 20-22, 2011, in Guangzhou, China. The symposium was jointly organized by the Guangdong Anti-Cancer Association, the US Chinese Anti-Cancer Association (USCACA), the Chinese Journal of Cancer, and the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. More than 1000 cancer researchers attended, including speakers from China, the USA, Finland, England, Japan, and Spain. The presentations covered most cancer types and both basic and clinical research. Recurring themes of the presentations were that cancer is "smart", cancer is complex, and cancer cells communicate actively. Outsmarting cancer is clearly a challenging task that needs multipronged attacks on multiple targets and on the communication systems among cancer cells. Presenters and attendees left the conference with a sense of urgency in the need for more communication among cancer researchers in fighting this disease. In this article, we summarize highlights from a number of presentations. Many of the presenters have published or will publish reviews and research articles in the Chinese Journal of Cancer, which has become an important international forum in disseminating exciting cancer research progress.
