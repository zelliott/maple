As part of an effort to address shortages in the cancer workforce, C-Change developed competency standards and logic model-driven implementation tools for strengthening the cancer knowledge and skills of non-oncology health professionals. These standards and tools were applied by four diverse grant programs to yield gains in the management of pain and palliative care, thereby improving the quality of care for individuals experiencing or recovering from cancer treatment. The results from the four grant sites and tools used to achieve them are described in this article.
