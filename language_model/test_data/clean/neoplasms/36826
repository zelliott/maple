Lesion detection and localization of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-18-FDG) Onco-PET-Investigations are usually performed on-line at the computer display. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a standardized film documentation as an alternative approach.

100 Onco-PET-investigations without attenuation correction were analyzed with regard to number and localization of lesions suspicious of malignancy. A standardized documentation on film was developed including 1. transversal slices of the brain, 2. coronal slices and maximum-intensity-projections (MIPs) of the head/neck region and 3. of the trunk and 4. MIPs of the legs. These transparencies were analyzed at the light box. An additional analysis on the computer display was performed slice by slice in coronal, transversal and sagittal directions for the whole body.

A total of 315 lesions were detected in 100 patients. In 96/100 patients the two modalities agreed both in number and localization of tumor-suspicious lesions. 7 lesions in the legs of 3 patients didn't show when interpreting the films (MIPs only). In 2/100 patients additional analysis on the computer display caused a change in the localization of 9/315 lesions. 8 of these were located in the legs. When adding coronal slices for the documentation of the lower extremities all the lesions were shown. Moreover, all lesions were localized correctly except one clinically non-relevant change of localization out of a total of 322 lesions.

The newly developed standardized documentation supports the concept of film reading and reporting of onco-PET investigations, restricting an additional on-line analysis to rare cases only. Furthermore, the intention of the "Arbeitsgemeinschaft Standardisierung" (work group standardisation) are met, i.e. to ease analysis of follow-up studies acquired at different places.
