Bleeding prophylaxis with cryopreserved autologous thrombocytes was evaluated in 43 patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation. Platelet transfusions were given prophylactically. Nineteen patients received only autologous, 10 only fresh allogeneic single-donor, and 14 both types of transfusions. The effects of 104 autologous versus 93 allogeneic thrombocyte transfusions were compared. The increment at 1 h was for allogeneic platelets twice that for autologous platelets (30.6 versus 15.2 x 10(9)/l), but the interval between transfusions in days (2.3) was the same. Twelve patients received alternating autologous platelet transfusion after washing out the cryoprotectant dimethyl sulfoxide (18 transfusions) and non-washed autologous platelets (24 transfusions). Platelet increments, corrected increments, and predicted recovery were not influenced by omitting the washing procedure, and no side effects of dimethyl sulfoxide occurred.
