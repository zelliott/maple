The objective of this study was to measure the serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) in cancer patients and compare with those of immune disease patients and healthy individuals for discriminatory analysis. For this purpose, automatic systems for special protein analysis (Type: Drcon Diognostica Tarbox) was used to measure serum CRP concentrations in 276 cancer patients (Group A), 110 immune disease patients (Group B), 161 phlogistic patients (Group C), and 125 age-matched healthy individuals (Group D). Our data show that serum CRP concentrations in Group A were significantly higher than those in Groups B and D, whereas CRP concentrations in Group B were higher than those in Group D. The differences of serum CRP concentrations between Groups A and B as well as between Groups B and D were significant (P &lt; 0.01). We, therefore, concluded that the measurement of serum CRP concentrations was a fast and accurate method to distinguish between cancer and immune disease patients.
