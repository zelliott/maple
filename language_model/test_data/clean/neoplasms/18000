Crying is a common but seldom studied phenomenon in palliative care. The aim of this study was to explore the significance of patients crying in a palliative care context.

Tape-recorded interviews with 14 cancer patients in palliative home care were carried out. To gain deeper understanding, a hermeneutic analysis and interpretation was used.

Crying was described in different dimensions: (1) intense and despondent crying as a way of ventilating urgent needs, (2) gentle, sorrowful crying as a conscious release of emotions, and (3) quiet, tearless crying as a protection strategy. Crying seems to be an expression for an inner emotional force, provoked by different factors, which cause changes in the present balance. To cry openly but also to cry on the inside meant being able to achieve or maintain balance. Crying may be something useful, which could create release and help reduce tension, but it may also have a negative impact as it consumes energy and creates feelings of shame.

Professionals need to understand the different levels of crying. In such situations sometimes comforting the patient may not be the best solution, as some may need privacy.
