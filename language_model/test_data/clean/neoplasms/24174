The analysis of the incidence of malignant neoplasms, recognised as occupational disease, in Poland during the years 1971-94 was based on occupational disease certificates sent obligatory to the Nofer institute of Occupational Medicine (LÃ³dz) by all sanitary and epidemiological stations under the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and the Polish State Railways. During the period study 1118 occupational neoplasms were diagnosed, including 1042 cases (93.2%) of neoplasms in males. Among males malignant Ineoplasms of lung (36.1%), larynx (25.5%), bladder (14.7), skin (6%), lymphatic and haematopoietic tissue (3.4%) and pleura (2.9%) were most common. The rate occupational neoplasms in the total number of neoplasms registered accounted for 0.11% in males and 0.01% in females. PAH (29.1%), asbestos dust (18.8%), ionizing radiation (13.8%), chromium and its compounds (13.5%) and benzidine (9.8%) belong to the most frequent causes of malignant neoplasms in males, and ionizing radiation (31.5%) and asbestos dust (30.3%) in females. The number of neoplasms recognised as occupational disease is very low. Underestimation of occupational neoplasms is very common throughout the world, but it is particularly high in Poland if we take the incidence of pleura mesothelioma as an example. This is mainly due to: (1) the lack of clinical and morphological specificity of occupationally induced neoplasms; (2) a long latency; (3) the influence of other factors confounding the effect of occupational exposure; (4) a relatively small number of occupational carcinogens identified thus far; (5) limited knowledge of occupational carcinogens and criteria for occupational disease certification, and unsatisfactory interviewing skills among doctors who diagnose cancer disease. The identification of a harmful factor and the size of exposure to it, belongs to the weakest point in certifying the occupational background of the disease. The essential conclusions presented stress the urgent need for establishing the system facilitating the diagnosis and certification of occupational neoplasms.
