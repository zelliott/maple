The increased incidence of oral candidiasis in patients with malignancies stems partly from the systemic disease itself and, partly from the therapeutic measures such as cytotoxic and other immunosuppressive drugs and radiotherapy they receive during management of such malignancies. In this review we discuss the clinical and laboratory findings on the relationship between cytotoxics, radiotherapy and oral candidiasis, possible mechanisms of pathogenicity following such therapy, as well as precautions that could be taken to minimize such recalcitrant yeast infections.
