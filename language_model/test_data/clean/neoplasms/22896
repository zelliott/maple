The clinical research in the oncological field makes it necessary to have in the shortest possible time information as to the statistical elements of the various neoplasias according to the adopted treatment schemes. In this report we are going to describe the realization of a computerized file with the patient's data of our radio-chemo-therapy department. From the clinical report of each patient, according to the physician's judgement, the more important medical and anagraphical data have been taken out to be then memorized in the computer. The analysis of the data introduced allows to obtain an inventory of patients in alphabetical order, according to the type of neoplasia and to the type of the treatment. The system is quite easy to be used and the interaction with the user is dialogue oriented. In this way both the inserting and the research stage of the filing data as well as the printing of the lists can be effected even by people not particularly trained in the computer use.
