Cancer mortality rates among black workers employed in several United States industries are higher than those of their white co-workers and of the national black population. As a result of discriminatory employment patterns, blacks are disproportionately employed in "high-hazard" jobs, where they are exposed to carcinogens and other disease-producing substances. The elevated cancer mortality rates in black workers in these industries are a direct consequence of discriminatory employment patterns. The implications of these findings for physician practice, research, and national regulatory policy are discussed.
