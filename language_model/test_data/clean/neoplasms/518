A skin test to DNCB, the reaction on spontaneous rosette formation, the lymphocyte blasttransformation reaction to PHA, and the leucocyte migration inhibition test were utilized in examining 501 human subjects (157--control group, 41--patients with benign tumors of the mammary gland and lung and 303--patients with cancer of the lung, breast, rectum and lymphogranulomatosis). The results obtained were processed after the V. S. Genes method. The examinations performed revealed no diagnostic value of the tests under study in patients with malignancies, benign tumors and lesions of a non-tumor origin.
