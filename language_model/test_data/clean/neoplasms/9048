Helicobacter pylori infection is a risk factor for gastric cancer. In addition, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. This study investigated the association of TLR4 polymorphisms with a risk of intestinal metaplasia (IM) and intraepithelial neoplasia (IN) in a Chinese Han population. This study analyzed TLR4 gene polymorphisms in 333 patients (IM, 193 cases; IN, 140 cases) and 312 atypia-free controls in a Chinese Han population using a Taqman allelic discrimination assay. The TLR4 single nucleotide polymorphisms +896A/G and +1196C/T were not associated with the risk of IM or IN. However, the single-locus analysis showed that the C allele of TLR4+2856T/C had significantly reduced risk of IM and IN [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.42; 95%CI=0.29-0.62 and OR=0.62; 95%CI=0.41-0.93, respectively] compared with the wild-type homozygote (TT). The frequencies of TLR4+2856T/C TC and T carrier were significantly lower in patients with Sydney's slight IM and low grade IN (P&lt;0.01 and P=0.01, respectively), while the TC genotype showed a lower risk of moderate IM compared to healthy controls (P=0.045). In addition, the data revealed that H. pylori infection, heavy alcohol consumption and high salt uptake were associated with a higher susceptibility for developing this neoplasm. TLR4 rs10759932 TC and C carriers were associated with a lower risk in developing precancerous lesions in the stomach in a Chinese Han population.
