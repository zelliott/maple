Endothelial cells play a key role in the development and function of blood and lymph vessels. Excessive proliferation and transformation of endothelial cells lead to pathological angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis or vascular malfunctions which are hallmarks of malignant disorders. There is emerging evidence that circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) also contribute significantly to these processes. Major progress has been achieved over the past few years in the identification of key molecules involved, and in targeting tumour angiogenesis for human therapy. Current research efforts are concentrated on deciphering the origin and functional properties of endothelium in various tumours, as well as endothelial neoplasms themselves. The aim of these studies is to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating mobilisation of EPCs from bone marrow, and their homing and differentiation into mature endothelium in situ at sites of neovascularisation, as well as the role of viral oncogenes in regulating the plasticity and extending the life span of endothelial cells. Integrated understanding of the mechanisms regulating the properties and function of endothelial cells during tumourigenesis is resulting in the development of a number of exciting and bold approaches for the treatment of cancer.
