Cell cycling and protein synthesis are both key physiological tasks for cancer cells. Here we present a model for how the elongation phase of protein synthesis, governed by elongation factor 2 and elongation factor 2 kinase, both modulates and responds to cell cycling. Within this framework we also discuss survivin, a protein with both pro-mitotic and anti-apoptotic roles whose persistence in the cell is tied to protein synthesis due to its short half-life. Finally, we provide a brief overview of efforts of cancer researchers to target EF2 and EF2 kinase.
