The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of cryopreserved and thawed peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) fractionated return infusions in children. 35 children patients with malignant tumors (13 acute leukaemias, 15 neuroblastomas and 7 malignant lymphomas) received fractionated return infusions of cryopreserved stem cells after undergoing high-dose chemotherapy without or with total body irradiation. The toxicities of 70 return infusions were evaluated. All patients were mobilized by chemotherapy plus recombination human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), and then PBSCs were collected by a separator CS-3000 plus or COBE spectra-4. The grafts were cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSD) and stored in liquid nitrogen. There were totally 70 PBSC transfusions. The total volume of PBSCs transfused: 190 - 420 ml (265 +/- 73 ml or 13.7 +/- 4.2 ml/kg) with a mean of (4.43 +/- 1.91) x 10(8)/kg of PBSCs, and 0.94 +/- 0.18 g/kg of DMSO. The single dose: 90 - 300 ml (132 +/- 37 ml or 6.6 +/- 5.2 ml/kg) with a mean of 0.68 +/- 0.12 g/kg of DMSO. Symptoms occurring during the infusions were recorded. All patients were monitored for 24 hours after infusion. Pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, and respiratory rate were recorded every 15 minutes. At four hours before and 8 hours after infusion, urinalysis was performed. Serum potassium, sodium, creatinine, total bilirubin, aspartate amino transferase (AST), and alanine amino transferase (ALT) levels were examined within 24 hours before and after the first infusion. The results showed that the toxicities observed included hemoglobinuria in 54 return infusions (77.1%), headache in 28 (40.0%), nausea in 24 (34.3%), vomiting in 17 (24.3%), and abdominal pain in 8 (11.4%). Patients who received a graft &gt; 200 ml tended to have a higher frequency of hemoglobinuria, headache, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (P&lt;0.01), and they disappeared quickly, too. Total bilirubin increased after the first return infusion (P&lt;0.01), and there was a significant correlation between the volume of infusion and the degree of total bilirubin increase (r=0.8977, P&lt;0.01). No renal failure or shock occurred. It is concluded that transient hemoglobinuria, headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are common toxicities associated with PBSC autograft, and these toxicities are related with a single volume of PBSCs transfused. Total bilirubin increase is correlated with the volume of infusion. In a word, the toxicity is less frequent and lower severe in children with fractionated infusions of cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cell.
