Between April 1981 and February 1983 55 patients with advanced tumours or recurrences in preirradiated fields with different localizations and histology underwent radiotherapy in a pilot I study with MTDQ, a radiosensitizer developed in Hungary, at the University Clinic for Radiotherapy and Radiobiology of Vienna. The prognostically unfavourable group with recurrences following complete irradiation of the target volume shows the same response rate and frequency of complete remissions as the prognostically favourable group without pretreatment (73% versus 61% and 27% versus 29%). The best results are noted in epithelial and mesenchymal tumours of head and neck and in gynaecological malignancies. Furthermore, the side-effects of the drug MTDQ, which are clinically acceptable, are comprehensively described and discussed. The authors have come to the conclusion that MTDQ accomplishes the clinical prerequisites of a radiosensitizer, and propose a prospective randomized study for head and neck tumours.
