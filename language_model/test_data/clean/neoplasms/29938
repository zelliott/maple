The study of the phenotype of tumours aims to elucidate cell surface alterations that could be used for diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic purposes. As tumours tend to escape the homeostatic growth control mechanisms of the host, it can be assumed that plasma membrane alterations are also responsible for the antisocial behaviour of tumour cells. Selected features of the transformed phenotype, of fetal or unknown origin, namely tumour-associated antigens, isozymes and growth factors, are discussed in relation to the altered growth pattern of the tumour cell. It is concluded that definitive structure-function relationships have not yet been established, but areas for future investigation are suggested.
