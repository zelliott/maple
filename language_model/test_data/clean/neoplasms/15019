Cancer is one of the major causes of death with functioning allograft among renal transplant patients. The increasing age of patients in the waiting list has derived in a higher risk of cancer in this population. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of cancer in the waiting list and kidney transplant patients.

Between November/1996 and November/2007 we assisted 825 patients in the outpatient renal transplant clinic, 467 were transplanted, 120 remained in the waiting list and 238 have been removed from the waiting list or died.

During this period, 97 malignancies were diagnosed, 33 of 32 kidney transplant candidates and 64 of 62 renal transplant patients. The comparative analysis between this two groups showed that candidates had higher frequency of solid organ tumours compared with a higher incidence of skin cancer in transplanted patients. Mean time between transplant and cancer diagnosis was 42.6 +/- 32.7 months, 48% of malignancies were diagnosed within the first three years postransplant. When comparing kidney transplant patients with and without cancer diagnosis, the formers were older and had worse patient survival at five years. Allograft survival was similar for both groups.

we want to emphasize the extreme importance of a detailed screening in the renal transplant candidates and transplanted patients due to a higher incidence of malignancies in this population.
