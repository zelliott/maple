We had previously shown that activated NKT cells licensed B cells to be immunogenic antigen-presenting cells and helped to elicit a wide spectrum of cancer targeted immune responses. In the current study, we sought to verify the safety of αGalCer-loaded, and adenovirus-transduced B cell-based vaccines, together with mechanism of action. Intravenously injected αGalCer-loaded, antigen-expressing B cells rapidly localized in the spleen and directly primed CD8(+) T cells in an antigen-specific manner. The transferred antigen was sustained for at least 30 days. While some injected B cells produced nonspecific IgG, the antigen-specific IgG response was completely dependent on endogenous B cells. The liver was one of the main tissues where injected B cells were retained; however, we could not find the signs of liver toxicity. Our results demonstrate that αGalCer-loaded, antigen-expressing B cells behave as "antigen-presenting" cells that stimulate endogenous antigen-specific T cells and B cells in vivo without significant toxicity.
