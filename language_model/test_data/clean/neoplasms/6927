Metastasis to distant organs is an ominous feature of most malignant tumours but the natural history of this process varies in different cancers. The cellular origin, intrinsic properties of the tumour, tissue affinities and circulation patterns determine not only the sites of tumour spread, but also the temporal course and severity of metastasis to vital organs. Striking disparities in the natural progression of different cancers raise important questions about the evolution of metastatic traits, the genetic determinants of these properties and the mechanisms that lead to the selection of metastatic cells.
