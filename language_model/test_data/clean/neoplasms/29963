Multicell spheroids are useful as in vitro models for certain nodular tumors. Spheroids may contain subpopulations of cells that are necrotic, hypoxic, and redistributed through the cell cycle, and the relative fractions of these subpopulations can change as the spheroids grow. As a result, spheroids of different sizes may respond differently to any given treatment. For experimental studies it is important to use populations of spheroids of homogeneous size. Here we report the design and use of a sedimentation column that uses precision woven screen to obtain homogeneously sized populations of multicell spheroids quickly, accurately, aseptically, and reproducibly. This device may be applied in other biological fields also where separation of cell aggregates of a specific size is required.
