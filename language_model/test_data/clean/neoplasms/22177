The 'magic bullet' concept of specifically targeting cancer cells at the same time as sparing normal tissues is now proven, as several monoclonal antibodies and targeted small-molecule compounds have been approved for cancer treatment. Both antibodies and small-molecule compounds are therefore promising tools for target-protein-based cancer therapy. We discuss and compare the distinctive properties of these two therapeutic strategies so as to provide a better view for the development of new drugs and the future direction of cancer therapy.
