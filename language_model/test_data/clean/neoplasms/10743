Progress through the cell mitotic cycle requires precise timing of the intrinsic molecular steps and tight coordination with the environmental signals that maintain a cell into the proper physiological context. Because of their great functional flexibility, ion channels coordinate the upstream and downstream signals that converge on the cell cycle machinery. Both voltage- and ligand-gated channels have been implicated in the control of different cell cycle checkpoints in normal as well as neoplastic cells. Ion channels mediate the calcium signals that punctuate the mitotic process, the cell volume oscillations typical of cycling cells, and the exocytosis of autocrine or angiogenetic factors. Other functions of ion channels in proliferation are still matter of debate. These may or may not depend on ion transport, as the channel proteins can form macromolecular complexes with growth factor and cell adhesion receptors. Direct conformational coupling with the cytoplasmic regulatory proteins is also possible. Derangement or relaxed control of the above processes can promote neoplasia. Specific types of ion channels have turned out to participate in the different stages of the tumor progression, in which cell heterogeneity is increased by the selection of malignant cell clones expressing the ion channel types that better support unrestrained growth. However, a comprehensive mechanistic picture of the functional relations between ion channels and cell proliferation is yet not available, partly because of the considerable experimental challenges offered by studying these processes in living mammalian cells. No doubt, such studies will constitute one of the most fruitful research fields for the next generation of cell physiologists.
