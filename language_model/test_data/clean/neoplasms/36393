Formation of new blood vessels is essential for several physiological and pathological events, e.g. embryogenesis, wound healing and tumor growth and metastasis. In order to increase the insight into the mechanisms of angiogenesis we have visualized the different components of the microvasculature in human wounds and tumors by immunohistochemistry on the light and electronmicroscopic level. For this purpose, antibodies recognizing distinct markers for human endothelial cells, pericytes and basal lamina were used on freshly frozen or paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue samples. In terms of efficacy, the PAL-E antigen is highly specific for blood vessel endothelium. Its sensitivity is less than other endothelial markers, such as von Willebrand factor and CD 31, as it is not expressed in arterioles. Within the context of the microvasculature alpha-smooth muscle actin and the HMW-MAA chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan are useful markers for pericytes. Type IV Collagen and Laminin can be visualized consistently in the microvascular basal lamina. During the formation of granulation tissue in wound healing a heterogeneity of the expression of endothelial and pericyte markers is found. In the least matured zone in granulation tissue of decubitus lesions and experimental skin wounds microvessels already contained both endothelial cells and pericytes, suggesting a role for both cell types in the early steps of angiogenesis. Regarding the tumor microvasculature, antibodies to von Willebrand factor often failed to stain capillaries, that did show expression of the other endothelial markers studied. Broad staining in pericytes was found for the HMW-MAA chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan. In contrast, these cells only locally expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin. Staining of the basal lamina components Type IV Collagen and Laminin within tumors was not restricted to the microvasculature. Therefore, antibodies recognizing endothelial markers, particularly PAL-E and BMA 120, are preferable as tools to visualize the tumor microvasculature. In accordance with the situation in granulation tissue of wound healing the broad presence of pericytes in the microvasculature of human tumor suggests an involvement of this cell type in tumor angiogenesis. Recent immunohistochemical studies on human tumor lesions indicated that a high number of microvessels adjacent to the tumor as a measure of tumor angiogenesis is an unfavorable prognostic factor in cutaneous melanoma, mammary carcinoma and non-small cell pulmonary carcinoma. This new application of immunohistochemistry represents a valuable, clinically relevant adjunct to the repertoire of the surgical pathologist.
