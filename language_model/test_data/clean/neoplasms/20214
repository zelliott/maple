Samples of sera from 1,508 consecutive patients, which were sent to the clinical laboratories of Chang Gung Medical College for creatine kinase (CK) isoenzyme determination, were examined for the simultaneous presence of various patterns of three or more usual or atypical isoenzymes. Of these samples, a total of 29 cases (1.9%) exhibited this abnormal isoenzyme condition. Nineteen (66%) of these 29 cases were patients with cancer of various types. Furthermore, five (26%) of these 19 cases had the same pattern of four isoenzymes, and 17 (89%) of these 19 cases showed the cathodic CK variant (macro CK type II). Eleven (58%) of these 19 cancerous cases also showed a CK-MB variant, evidently of nonmyocardial origin.
