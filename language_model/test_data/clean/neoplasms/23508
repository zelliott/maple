In the recent years, research in the field of anti-tumour therapeutic vaccines showed a rapid development. Many studies regarding different types of cancers are presently on going. In the trials various immunological approaches are applied and studied in combination with standard therapies. Results are controversial and anti-tumor vaccines are not licensed in the European Union and only one is commercialized in US. Before these vaccines can be considered a valid therapeutic alternative it is necessary that the characteristics of the candidate patients are clearly identified and that clinical efficacy, length of protection and safety are well documented. Moreover a correct evaluation of socio-economic and public health aspects should be available.
