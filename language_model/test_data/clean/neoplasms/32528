Because of the lack of power of case-control study designs to detect gene-environment interactions, flexible matching has recently been proposed as a method of improving efficiency. In this paper, the authors consider a large-sample approximation method that allows estimation of the most efficient matching strategy when genotype and exposure are either independent or associated. The authors provide tables of the sample sizes required to detect gene-environment interactions if this flexible matching strategy is followed, and they make brief comparisons with other study designs.
