External ultrasound hyperthermia is considered to be a very flexible modality for heating deep-seated tumors owing to its penetration and focusing ability. However, using this flexibility requires that many complicated, interacting decisions be made to obtain optimal treatment. This paper presents the feasibility of arranging multiple-focused ultrasound transducers to produce an appropriate heating pattern for a specific treatment, based on the optimal scan parameters obtained from an optimization algorithm. The variable scan parameters of the heating system optimized are the transducer tilt and rotation angles, focal depth, scan radius, and output acoustical power. After obtaining the optimal scan parameters, multiple transducers are systematically arranged according to these scan parameters. Three-dimensional ultrasound power deposition and temperature distribution for a specific treatment are calculated for this multiple ultrasound transducer system. A more uniform temperature distribution in the treatment region for a large, highly perfused tumor can be achieved by scanning the system with respect to the central scan axis and/or swinging the transducers inwards and outwards. The maximum heating depth of focused ultrasound transducers used in this heating system is also studied. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal arrangement of this multiple-focused ultrasound transducer system is highly promising for heating deep, large, and highly perfused tumors.
