Oncogenic upregulation of tissue factor (TF) and release of TF-containing microvesicles play an important role in cancer-related coagulopathy (Trousseau's syndrome), angiogenesis, and disease progression. In addition, certain types of host cells (stromal cells, inflammatory cells, activated endothelium) may also express TF. Although the relative contribution of host-related versus tumor-related TF to tumor progression is not known, our recent studies indicate that the role of both sources of TF in tumor formation is complex and context-dependent. Disruption of TF expression/activity in cancer cells leads to tumor growth inhibition in immunodeficient mice, even in cases where TF overexpression is driven by potent oncogenes ( K-RAS or EGFR). Interestingly, TF expression in vivo appears to be influenced by many factors, including the level of oncogenic transformation, tumor microenvironment, and differentiation from cancer stem-like cells. We postulate that activation of TF signaling and coagulation may deliver growth-promoting stimuli (e.g., fibrin, thrombin, platelets) to dormant cancer stem cells (CSCs). Functionally, these influences may be tantamount to formation of a provisional (TF-dependent) cancer stem cell niche. As such, these changes may contribute to the involvement of CSCs in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis.
