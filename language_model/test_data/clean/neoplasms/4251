Among the factors triggering programmed cell death (PCD) are a number of known carcinogens, and several consequences of DNA abnormalities characteristic of cancer have been shown capable of eliciting the PCD response. So although elimination of a potentially malignant cell is likely to be a rare consequence of PCD it could turn out to be important for cancer development. A brief survey is given of the most well-known triggering factors, the molecular mechanisms of the pathways involved and the emerging experimental and clinical data relating capacity of PCD to cancer initiation and progression. It is suggested that future cancer prevention will have to consider also those factors which may abrogate normal PCD.
