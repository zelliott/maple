Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to a variety of serious gastrointestinal infections. Among the most common or most severe are Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, herpes simplex, candidiasis, cryptosporidiosis, and Salmonellosis. Some of these infections are difficult or impossible to treat successfully. The correct diagnosis often can only be established if it is first suspected and the appropriate studies are performed.
