The expression of p53-target genes encoding the proapoptotic factor Noxa, but not PUMA, was not induced by p53 in HCT116 and SW480 cells, which show resistance to apoptosis in response to p53 overexpression. The lack of p53 inducibility of Noxa was restored by treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR). Furthermore, p53 induced apoptosis in HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with 5-aza-CdR. Moreover, the inhibition of Noxa expression by RNAi in 5-aza-CdR-treated HCT116 cells resulted in the partial inhibition of p53-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that epigenetic cancer therapy is possible for some cancers in combination with forced p53 activation.
