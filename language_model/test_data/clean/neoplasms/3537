The use of human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEpo) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in patients with anemia and cancer. Although good results have been obtained, it is too expensive to permit its use massively. For the purpose of evaluating the therapeutic effect of rHuEpo, including toxicity, predictive response variables and quality of life parameters, a prospective trial was carried out in patients with anemia and cancer. Hematimetric parameters, ferritin, Epo, cytokines, transfusions and quality of life were registered. A total of 36 patients were treated in the protocol (34 were evaluable): 16 men and 20 women, with a medium age 56.4 years; 27 patients were treated with chemotherapy (16 with cisplatinum); 15 patients presented medullar infiltration. In 73.5% patients an increase in the level of hemoglobin was registered, and in 64.7% its normalisation was attained. Transfusional requirements were reduced by 50%. The hemoglobin increase greater than 0.5 g/dl at the second week of treatment was the most significant variable of early response. Patients treated with cisplatinum, seric ferritin lower than 1,100 ng/dl and those without medullar tumoral infiltration responded best. Serum Epo, cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF) and reticulocyte count at the second week did not correlate with response. Quality of life parameters were better in patients with good response to rHuEpo. It can be concluded that good results in the treatment of patients with anemia and cancer are obtained with rHuEpo.
