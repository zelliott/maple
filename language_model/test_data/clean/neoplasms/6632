Neoplasms appear to be one of the most important causes of death, rather more in women in their prime than in men. Psychological factors constitute personality and the age that goes with it. Furthermore illness behaviour related to individual morbidity history and social context of the individual is of importance. These factors together determine the way of coping with a disease like cancer. The stages that can be distinguished in the disease process are dealt with and the characteristics typical to old age. Finally a plea is made for further research in this topic.
