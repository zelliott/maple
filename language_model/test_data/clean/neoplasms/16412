The ability of DNA vaccination to induce effective immune responses has been shown in a range of preclinical disease models. However, the potency of DNA vaccines must be further improved for their use in patients. DNA fusion vaccine strategies, whereby target antigens are genetically linked to immuno-enhancing molecules, are currently being explored. The ease of DNA manipulation has allowed incorporation of a wide variety of molecules able to promote antigen uptake, processing and presentation by professional antigen-presenting cells, to provide critical CD4 T-cell help and to activate more effective immune effector pathways. These strategies are particularly important for cancer vaccines to increase their immunogenicity and to overcome tolerance.
