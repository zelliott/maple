The antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were fed in the diet to male F344 rats in two chronic feeding studies. In one study, feeding BHT for 76 wk at concentrations ranging from 100 to 6000 ppm produced no increase in neoplasms at any site. In a second study, feeding 12,000 ppm BHT for 110 wk had no neoplastic effect at any site, whereas feeding BHA at 12,000 ppm resulted in a small increase in squamous cell papillomas of the non-glandular squamous portion of the stomach.
