Terminally ill cancer patients are considered at high risk for pressure ulcers because of their clinical condition. However, in Italy, data about pressure ulcers and their prevalence are insufficient. This paper reports a study on pressure ulcers incidence and prevalence in a population of oncology patients cared for in an Italian palliative care service. A retrospective analysis of 414 clinical records of patients admitted over 6 months showed a prevalence of pressure ulcers of 22.9% and an incidence of 6.7%. Karnofsky Performance Scale Index scores, age and length of the stay were significantly related to the pressure sore development. These results support the need to focus attention on pressure ulcers prevention and treatment in terminally ill cancer patients, and to further define specific guidelines aimed at warranting patients' comfort and quality of life.
