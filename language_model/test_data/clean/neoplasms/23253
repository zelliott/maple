Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) has been identiÔ¨Åed as a major             protein involved in aberrant cell proliferation, immortalization, metastasis and             stemness maintenance in a majority of tumors, yet it has little or no expression             in normal somatic cells. During the past few years, the development of hTERT-based             therapies such as immunotherapy, suicide gene therapy and small-molecule interfering             therapy have become critical and specific for eradicating all types of cancer.             Here, current knowledge regarding hTERT and its involvement in various cancers             and its role as a target of cancer therapies are reviewed. Additionally, hurdles             to new cancer therapy development and new therapeutic opportunities are described,             along with areas that require further investigation.
