The Notch signaling pathway plays a crucial role at different stages of cell development, such as proliferation, growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Recent studies demonstrate that depending on the expression level and cellular context, the Notch receptors play a role in apoptosis resistance in malignant cells. These findings suggest that Notch signaling components may be a potential target in the development of new cancer therapies. This review describes the function of the Notch pathway and new strategies in the modulation of its signal.
