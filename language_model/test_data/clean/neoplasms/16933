In hereditary cancers the responsible inherited cancer genes are defective (mutated) anti-oncogenes (tumour suppressor genes). This inherited mutation is present in all cells of the organism, and only leads to cancer if in a somatic cell a complete set of specific cancer mutations is accumulated. Since one defective anti-oncogene has been inherited, only three additional somatic cancer mutations are required, according to our previously published view (Anticancer Res 10:1990). The number of de novo arising tumour cells in such a person is thus multiplied by a factor equal to the reverse of the mutant frequency, that is about 10(4)-10(5). This can be observed e.g. in retinoblastoma. Mutations occur in proliferating cells only. Consequently cancer mutations also depend on cell proliferation. If an inherited cancer mutation predisposes to cancer formation in certain organs, then the cancer risk in these organs is enhanced by 10(4)-10(5) times. Tumours in these organs will appear simultaneously if the number of cells and the growth kinetics are similar. This is of course observed in paired organs, like the retina and the female breast. In cancer family syndromes different organs may be affected at the same time. Examples are type I and type II cancer family syndrome and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 2a, and 2b. The secondly diagnosed tumours are not caused by metastatic spread. Tumours in two organs will arise at difference times if the number of end cells per organ and the growth kinetics differ. In this case the second tumour is called a second primary malignancy and is not caused by metastatic spread. A good example are the second primary malignancies in hereditary retinoblastoma. The inherited defective anti-oncogene is a recessive gene. This defective inherited gene causes a 10(4)-10(5) fold increase of the normal tumour incidence. This means that nearly always one or more tumours will arise. Evidently, this pattern of inheritance has led to the erroneous conclusion that the genetic abnormality is dominant at the level of the chromosome. The 10(4)-10(5) times enhanced tumour incidence in hereditary cancer is helpful for the clinical recognition of hereditary cancer. That is, hereditary cancer can be recognized not only by family history, but also by early occurrence, the multifocal and bilateral localisation, its occurrence as cancer family syndrome or by second primary malignancies. It is thus recommended to screen patients and families with hereditary cancer for first and second primary tumours. Treatment of patients with hereditary tumours requires extra care to avoid additional cancer mutations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
