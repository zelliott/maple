A high-title (2000 UCD) adrenal cortex extract was used in the support management of 30 neoplastic patients. Evaluation was based on performance status (PS) according to Karnofsky and symptom incidence before and after the treatment. PS improved in 30%. There was a marked reduction in asthenia and anorexia, with significant changes in headache, nausea, and vomiting. Blood pressure, heart rate, and the blood chemistry picture were not altered.
