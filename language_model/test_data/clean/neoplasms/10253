CD40 is a TNF receptor family member that is widely recognized for its prominent role in immune regulation and homeostasis. Expression of CD40 is not restricted to normal lymphoid cells but is also evident in the majority of haemopoietic and epithelial malignancies where it has been implicated in oncogenic events. Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that the CD40 pathway can be exploited for cancer therapy by virtue of its ability to stimulate the host anti-tumor immune response, normalize the tumor microenvironment and directly suppress the growth of CD40-positive tumors. Here, we provide an overview of the multifaceted functions of the CD40 pathway in cancer and its emerging role in the treatment of malignancy.
