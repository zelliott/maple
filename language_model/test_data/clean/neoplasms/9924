Flow cytometry (FCM) permits high speed measurement of fluorescence from individual cells flowing in a liquid medium. Cells stained with fluorescent dyes that bind specifically and proportionally to desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) emit fluorescence that reflects their DNA content. Since neoplastic cells often contain abnormal amounts of DNA, FCM can be used as a rapid means to detect neoplasia. Flow cytometry can also provide cell kinetic information by quantitating cells in the various phases of the cell cycle. These capabilities make FCM a useful tool in the study of patients with neoplasia.
