A clinical trial is a research study conducted in humans and designed to answer specific questions using scientifically controlled methods. These trials require considerable effort to assure that the data obtained are reliable, reproducible, and readily available. Data managers play a key role in this research effort. A nurse with a clinical background, computer knowledge, and some experience in the research environment is well suited for the role of data manager. The data manager performs a variety of tasks in this position that will enhance the quality of the data gathered in a research study. These responsibilities include designing forms, monitoring protocol accrual, abstracting data, entering data onto protocol-specific forms and/or specifically designed computerized data-entry screens, assuring the quality and the integrity of the data, and providing investigators with interim and summary reports. In addition, the data manager can be responsible for the management of a computerized clinical data base system, including the training of users and the designing of basic reports for the investigators. A nurse, functioning as a data manager, who understands research methodology, is detail oriented, and is well organized, could be a valuable asset to the clinical trials team in the successful management of any clinical study.
