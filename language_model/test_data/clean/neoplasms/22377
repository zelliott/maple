A report is given on the first clinical experience made with the application of new amino acid compounds in the therapy of malignant tumors. The established good compatibility of the substances allows long-termed treatments with great variability of individual dosage. The regressions of tumors observed and the frequent improvement of the general status, even in advanced stages of tumors, should give rise to a broad investigation of the available tumor inhibitors.
