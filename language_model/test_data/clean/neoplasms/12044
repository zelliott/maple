It seems that macrophages, which are present in most tissues, are involved in many steps of the immune reaction. They are essential for initiating the response and they assist the lymphocytes in several ways. By themselves, they play an important role in the immune surveillance and in tumour immunology. The behaviour of macrophages is strongly influenced by lymphocytes. However macrophages are equipped with a special machinery, including an active membrane and a developed lysosomal system. A lot remains to be done on its functions and on the trigger mechanisms.
