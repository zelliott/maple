From a psychosocial point of view, the children of parents who suffer from cancer are regarded as not being sufficiently provided for, as well as being at greater risk for developing a psychiatric illness. Protective factors are marital satisfaction, open communication within the family and a good relationship with their parents. Results stemming from research on divorce have shown that sibling relationships may act as a protective factor against suffering a psychiatric illness after a stressful life event. The aim of this literature review is to examine the possible influence that a positive sibling relationship may have in coping with parental (oncological) illness/stressful life events. A review of the existing literature has revealed that little research has been conducted to this date addressing the question at hand. Altogether, the existence of a positive sibling relationship has shown to have a protective effect when having to deal with the burden of a stressful life event.
