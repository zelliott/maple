Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia, and is associated with increased risk of stroke and death. Most of present knowledge is derived from studies in patients with cardiac disease whilst limited information is available for patients with several chronic non-cardiac conditions like cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease. Although millions of patients are affected and are at risk of adverse prognosis due to co-existent atrial fibrillation, we are left with very limited guidance for management of atrial fibrillation itself and prevention of complications in those patients. In this paper, we review data on incidence, prognostic importance and treatment modalities of atrial fibrillation in patients with cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease.
