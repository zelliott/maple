Lipid peroxidation (LP) occurring in pediatric cancer patients receiving polychemotherapy has been investigated. Plasma level of malonic dialdehyde in children with retinoblastoma (Rtb) was found to drop while it remained unchanged in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The treatment caused different changes in the red cell catalase levels in said groups: the enzyme concentration increased in the Rtb patients in the course of therapy and decreased in the ALL group. A slight decline in alpha-tocopherol and retinol levels the Rtb group was matched by a relevant rise in blood-plasma in the ALL group. To adjust LP regulation and improve resistance, antioxidants should be given to pediatric cancer patients suffering peroxidation-related stress.
