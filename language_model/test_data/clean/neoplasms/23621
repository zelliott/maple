Advancements in surgical techniques, procurement, and immunosuppressant therapy have made organ transplantation a major treatment modality with increasing survival posttransplantation. However, this longevity has placed individuals with transplanted organs at an increased risk for developing cancer. This article examines the following pertinent issues. First, what is the prevalence of malignancies among transplant recipients? Second, are organ recipients told that they may be at risk for developing cancer? Third, is the medical community trading one lethal disease for another? And finally, are oncology nurses properly trained to handle the maintenance of a transplanted organ while caring for a person with cancer? This article looks at several ethical issues, including the ethical principle of autonomy, which examines the respect for a patient's right to choose or refuse treatment. Within this text, autonomy will be the basis for informed consent and the need for cancer risk disclosure. The ethical principle of beneficence is also examined, in regards to the health-care community trading one illness for another. The final ethical principle of nonmaleficence is considered and the need for future oncology nurses to examine their practice to determine if they are ready to care for these posttransplant cancer patients.
