When external beam radiation therapy is administered to the pelvis, normal tissues irradiated may include the colon, small intestine, urethra, bladder, bone, and spinal cord. The objectives of this retrospective study were to determine the incidence and severity of late radiation effects following pelvic irradiation in dogs and to identify factors that increase the risk of these effects. Medical records of all dogs treated with curative intent external beam radiation therapy to the pelvic region between 1993 and 1999 were reviewed. Patients with follow-up longer than 9 months or any patient that developed late complications earlier than 9 months were evaluated. Sixteen dogs met criteria for inclusion in this study. All dogs were treated with a 6-MV linear accelerator with bilaterally opposed beams. Diseases treated included transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, transitional cell carcinoma of the prostate, and anal sac apocrine gland adenocarcinoma. Four dose/fractionation schemes were used: 49.5 Gy in 3.3 Gy fractions, 54 Gy in 3.0 Gy fractions, 54 Gy in 2.7 Gy fractions, and 18 Gy intraoperative radiation therapy followed by 43 Gy external beam radiation therapy in 2.9 Gy fractions. Implantable chemotherapy in the form of an OPLA-Pt sponge was used in six dogs as a radiation potentiator. Colitis was the major late effect following pelvic irradiation, occurring in nine dogs (56%). Colitis was characterized as mild in three dogs, moderate in one dog, and severe in five dogs. Three of the dogs with severe effects suffered gastrointestinal perforation. All dogs with severe late effects received 3 or 3.3 Gy per fraction, and 80% received radiation potentiators. In the seven dogs that received 2.7 Gy or 2.9 Gy per fraction, late effects were classified as none (n = 5), mild colitis (n = 1), and moderate colitis (n = 1). Radiation therapy can be administered to the pelvic region with a minimal risk of late effects to the colon by giving smaller doses per fraction and avoiding systemic radiation potentiators.
