This phase I trial evaluated a high-dose, short-term infusion of zidovudine (AZT) following oral leucovorin (LV) and bolus 5-fluorouracil (FUra). Thirteen patients with metastatic cancer received 30 cycles of therapy. Plasma monitoring demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in peak plasma levels of AZT through the range of dose levels, from 104.3 +/- 8.7 microM at the 1.5 g/m2 dose of AZT to 1312.6 +/- 165.9 microM at the 11.0 g/m2 dose. While AZT did not potentiate the usual clinical toxicities of LV plus FUra, an unexpected finding of symptomatic hypotension during the AZT infusion was the dose-limiting toxicity in this trial. One partial response was observed in a previously untreated patient with metastatic colorectal cancer. The maximal tolerated dose of AZT, 7.0 g/m2 over 2 hr, is recommended for future phase II evaluation of this novel combination.
