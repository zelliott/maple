Physiologic deoxynucleotides are required for an error-proof DNA replication, repair and synthesis. Any inaccuracy in this process results in a block in DNA synthesis until the error is corrected. If the cell enzymes are unable to correct the error, a signal for apoptosis is generated. This mechanism is the main target for anticancer nucleoside analogs. They also interact with the metabolism of physiological nucleosides, and consequently, have a large number of intracellular targets to induce cytotoxicity. In addition, it is now reported that some analogs may interfere directly with RNA synthesis. A great deal of synthesized nucleoside analogs provide the opportunity to understand the structure-based differences in their metabolism and mechanisms of action as well as to identify the specific intracellular targets and diseases, in which each of these newer nucleoside analogs acts most efficiently. This paper summarizes developments in the area of new nucleoside analogs undergoing clinical evaluation for the treatment of solid tumors, namely tezacitabine, troxacitabine, DMDC, CNDAC, ECyD, clofarabine, and decitabine.
