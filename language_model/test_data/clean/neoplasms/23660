First described in 1975 by KÃ¶hler and Milstein, monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) result from the fusion of a B lymphocyte and a myeloma cell. Among the many uses of Mabs, oncology constitute a privileged, but difficult, field of investigation: the antigen heterogeneity and difficulty of access to tumors are major obstacles. In diagnosis, the Mabs allow the identification and the quantification of tumor specific or tumor-associated antigens: the assay of circulating tumor markers is one of the largest applications. In situ localization of tumors is also possible, using radiolabelled Mabs. In therapeutics, Mabs are used alone or linked to radionuclides, toxins, anticancer drugs or enzymes. Ex vivo treatment of bone marrow is used in autologous and allergenic grafts. The use of mono (Fab,Fv) or bivalents (F(ab)'2) antibody fragments, chimeric or human Mabs, cocktails of Mabs, intended to improve sensitivity and specificity of the tests, are the main prospects of this research area.
