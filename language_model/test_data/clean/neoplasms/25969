An organized and distinct curriculum in hospice and palliative care education is lacking in most United States medical school programs. Because of this knowledge deficit, physicians are often not able to meet the needs of their terminally ill patients and their families.

A five-day combined didactic and clinical rotation in hospice and palliative care for third-year medical students was developed and is presented. The program is run through a home-based hospice in conjunction with the state's medical school.

The pilot program has been well accepted by the participating students as a valuable learning experience. Although brief, it has also been successful in changing some of their attitudes about death and the care of the dying.

This one-week program is an effective means to provide an intense course in hospice education. It should be easily transportable to other health care curricula.
