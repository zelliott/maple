This study used both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to assess the pediatric health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in siblings (n = 77) of cancer patients attending summer camp. On quantitative measures (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) parent and child versions), siblings reported statistically significant improvements in HRQOL from pre-to post camp. The parent sample, as a whole, did not report a statistically significant improvement in the siblings' HRQOL; however, statistically significant improvements were found when the analysis controlled for the responses of bereaved parents. On the qualitative measures (Sibling Qualitative Interview and Camp Okizu Satisfaction Surveys), both children and parents described the positive impact of camp. Using grounded theory, we identified the major themes and found that the positive emotional and social experiences captured by the quotes were paralleled in the quantitative findings of improved HRQOL in psychosocial domains on the PedsQL. These findings suggest the beneficial effects of camp as a psychological intervention and illustrate the value of integrating quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches in research.
