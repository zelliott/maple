To evaluate the feasibility of risk stratification of children with cancer and febrile neutropenia using a simple set of criteria from data available to the clinician at the time of the patient's presentation.

This study is a retrospective cohort study of all children with cancer admitted to a single institution with fever and neutropenia (defined as an absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500 cells/mm3) in a 1-year period. Patients were defined a priori as low risk if they were outpatients at the time of presentation with febrile neutropenia, had an anticipated duration of neutropenia less than 7 days, and had no significant comorbidity. All others were considered high risk. Data was analyzed by first admission for each patient and secondarily for all admissions for febrile neutropenia.

There were 188 admissions in 104 patients for febrile neutropenia during the study period. Of these 47% were high risk and 53% were low risk. The duration of fever was not significantly different in the two groups. However, the duration of neutropenia and the length of hospital stay were significantly longer in the high-risk group. The frequency of bacteremia, other documented infection, and serious medical complications was significantly different in the two groups. Overall, the rate of any adverse event was 4% in the low-risk group versus 41% in the high-risk group.

Simple criteria available to the clinician at the time of evaluation of the child with cancer who has fever and neutropenia allow the selection of a population at low risk for bacteremia or serious medical complication. A prospective study is planned using these risk criteria, evaluating outpatient oral antibiotic therapy in low-risk children with cancer.
