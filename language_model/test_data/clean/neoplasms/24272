The aim of this study is to sum up the development of European Community legislation concerning occupational carcinogens. In terms of prevention, 4 periods were studied. From 1951 to 1972, only a few texts of law were promulgated. From 1972 to 1984, after the ratification of the convention 139 of the International Labour Office, more texts were promulgated. Then, from 1985 to 1992, the protection against occupational carcinogens increased for workers, especially after the specific european directive edicted in 1990. Since 1992, most of the countries in the European Union have included this directive in their legislation. In terms of compensation for occupational cancer, a recommendation of the European Commission stated in 1962 had already proposed a list of compensable diseases. Because of the diversity of compensation means, it is difficult for the European Community to impose a common status.
