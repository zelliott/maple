During reconstructive surgery of lacrimal ducts, performed in 526 cases, in 48 of them tumors of lacrimal sac were found. The author maintains that chronic inflammation and unnecessary probing of the lacrimal ducts could cause injuries of the mucosa and development of benign tumor, mostly granuloma. In 20% of the pathological findings in the lacrimal sac there were calcified, amorphous, stone consistency concrements, with mycelium. A case of giant stone of lacrimal sac is presented.
