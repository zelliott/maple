Cutaneous manifestations in disseminated strongyloidiasis are infrequent but should raise the suspicion for its diagnosis. We retrospectively evaluated the charts of six patients with cancer and a proven diagnosis of disseminated strongyloidiasis. All patients had received prophylaxis with albendazole before starting antineoplastic therapy, which included high-dose steroids. They presented with septic shock, acute respiratory failure and characteristic purpuric periumbilical skin lesions. Strongyloides larvae were identified in tracheal aspirates (n=5), gastric aspirates (n=4), lung (n=2) and skin biopsies (n=2). All patients died despite antihelminthic therapy and intensive care support.
