A survey by a liaison health visitor of outpatients attending an oncology department has identified and enumerated the principal problems with which she is confronted, and defined her role. The main medical symptoms of concern to the patient at home and needing attention by the liaison health visitor were anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and constipation: inadequate pain control due to poor drug compliance was also common. Other functions of the liaison health visitor include providing nursing aids and prostheses, support for bereaved relatives, and liaison with the community health care team.
