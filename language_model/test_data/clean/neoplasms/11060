The past few years have provided substantial evidence for the vital role of the local tumor microenvironment for various aspects of tumor progression. With obesity and its pathophysiological sequelae still on the rise, the adipocyte is increasingly moving center stage in the context of tumor stroma-related studies. To date, we have limited insight into how the systemic metabolic changes associated with obesity and the concomitant modification of the paracrine and endocrine panel of stromal adipocyte-derived secretory products ("adipokines") influence the incidence and progression of obesity-related cancers. Here, we discuss the role of adipocyte dysfunction associated with obesity and its potential impact on cancer biology.
