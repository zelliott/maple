Adolescent care of the adult with cancer led the authors to choose three qualitative methods to describe this unexplored phenomenon. In this study, phenomenology, ethnography and unstructured survey were combined to provide a more complete picture of the phenomenon. Data from interviews with 11 youngsters within seven family units, observations, and unstructured questionnaire, demographic data from and field notes were analysed and combined. The processes used in designing and conducting the study and analysing the data, rather than the findings, are emphasized. The data obtained by using these three methods have laid the foundation for further nursing research on caregiving by youngsters and raise questions about combining analyses of three qualitative data sets.
