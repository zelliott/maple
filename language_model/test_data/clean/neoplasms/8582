Extensive biochemical studies have shown that mucin tumor antigens have a range of molecular sizes from 200 to greater than 1000 kDa. The molecular size of mucin antigens can be dramatically affected by the source and method of purification. Mucin antigens vary from 24 to 80% in carbohydrate content and their density is usually greater than 1.40 g/ml. Galactose and N-acetyl glucosamine are the predominant sugar residues in many mucins, whereas mannose is usually present in low levels or absent. The amino acids serine, threonine, alanine, glycine, and proline are abundant in mucins. An O-glycosidic linkage between the carbohydrate and protein of mucins is the most common linkage encountered. The gene encoding the core peptide for at least one mucin tumor marker, HMFG, has been identified, sequenced, and expressed. These findings may lead to a better understanding of the multiepitope nature of mucin tumor markers. The advent of hybridoma technology has yielded several monoclonal antibodies that have been used to identify the presence of tumor-associated mucins in the sera of cancer patients. Elevated levels of mucin antigens have been found in the serum of most patients with advanced adenocarcinomas. Many studies have shown that tumor-associated markers are useful in monitoring patients following cancer treatment. Clinically useful immunoassays have been developed for monitoring patients with ovarian, breast, and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Although individual mucin tumor markers show limited utility in detecting early adenocarcinoma, recent studies using multiple mucin markers have suggested that early detection, at sensitivities greater than 50%, can be achieved.
