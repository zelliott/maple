A hepatotoxicity can be observed at the use of different groups of antitumoral drugs. Cytotoxicity drugs have a leading place in relation to incidence and severity of liver damage. During chemotherapy the development of hepatotoxicity is caused by thedamage of the liver parenchymal cells with fatty degeneration, necrosis of the liver tissue, and cholestasis. The study of the mechanisms of development, clinical course and laboratory manifestations of hepatotoxicity of chemotherapy will lead to its prevention or reduction, which will improve the immediate and long-term results of treatment of patients with cancer.
