The dual or biphasic responses of cancer to nitric oxide (NO) arise from its concentration dependent ability to regulate tumor growth, migration, invasion, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The outcome of these various NO-dependent processes is dictated by several factors including NO flux, the chemical redox environment, and the duration of NO exposure. Further, it was recently discovered that an NO-induced redox flux in vascular endothelial cells hypersensitizes these cells to the antiangiogenic effects of thrombospondin-1. This suggests a novel treatment paradigm for targeting tumor-driven angiogenesis that combines redox modulation with mimetic derivatives of thrombospondin-1. This article discusses the biphasic nature of NO in cancer biology and the implications of NO-driven redox flux for modulation of tumor-stimulated angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis.
