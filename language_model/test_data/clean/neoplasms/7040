Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation is a key posttranslational regulatory modification of proteins in all eukaryotic cells in normal and pathological processes. Recently a pivotal janus-faced biological role of the low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMWPTP) has become clear. On the one hand this enzyme is important in facilitating appropriate immune responses towards infectious agents, on the other hand it mediates exaggerated inflammatory responses toward innocuous stimuli. The evidence that LMWPTP plays a role in oncological processes has added a promising novel angle. In this review we shall focus on the regulation of LMWPTP enzymatic activity of signaling pathways of different immunological cells, the relation between genetic polymorphism of LMWPTP and predisposition to some type of inflammatory disorders and the contribution of this enzyme to cancer cell onset, growth and migration. Therefore, the LMWPTP is an interesting target for pharmacological intervention, thus modifying both inappropriate cellular immune responses and cancer cell aggressiveness.
