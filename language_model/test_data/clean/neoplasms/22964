Different and effective modalities are available for various cancers. However, early consideration is necessary to allow optimal integration. Failure to do this may compromise the cure potential for some tumours. The differing biology of tumours and the efficacy of various modalities dictates specific approaches for each. The principles of multimodality therapy can be considered together with the biological factors affecting the success and failure of each therapy tupe and this allows a multimodality approach to be based on careful planning. For many tumours, where effective systemic therapy exists, there are good reasons for commencing with a multimodality approach at the onset with adjuvant chemotherapy. Practical considerations dictate that surgeons must play a key role in the care of cancer patients. This in turn requires that they maintain a sound knowledge of multimodality therapy for the cancers that they treat.
