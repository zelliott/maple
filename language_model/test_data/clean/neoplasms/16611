The study assessed the sensitivity of a blood culture drawn from only one lumen of a multilumen, long-term, indwelling, central venous catheter in pediatric oncology patients.

Episodes of positive blood cultures were included if cultures were sent simultaneously from multiple lumens of a long-term, indwelling, central line and if the culture was thought to represent a true bacteremia.

Discordant results from cultures drawn simultaneously from different lumens occurred in 13 (32%) of 41 episodes. The estimated sensitivity of a culture drawn from a single lumen was 84%.

Drawing blood cultures from all lumens of these lines should be considered in this patient population.
