Recent research has established the important beneficial relationship between exercise and cancer rehabilitation and survivorship. However, the complexities of this interrelationship are as yet underexplored. This article presents the findings of a recent qualitative research study that examined the psychosocial benefits associated with involvement in an exercise club (the Chemo Club) specifically designed for cancer patients during or postchemotherapy from the perspectives of the patients. The findings validate the important benefits involvement in the Chemo Club provides its members and highlight the need for further initiates, hospital based and external, to establish such services for cancer patients.
