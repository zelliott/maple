A series of 39 dogs bearing spontaneous mammary carcinomas or melanomas were tested for tumor-directed immune response against allogeneic Formalin-treated tumor cells. The immune response was assessed by the direct leukocyte migration inhibition technique. Comparison of leukocytes from tumor bearers and healthy donors by chi-square analysis showed no statistical difference between the groups. The findings did not provide evidence for the existence of specific tumor antigens in the dog.
