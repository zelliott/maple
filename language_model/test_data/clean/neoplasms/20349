Genetic alterations such as translocations, deletions or point mutations often result in a loss of function. Such alterations may contribute to oncogenesis by interference with mechanisms restraining cellular growth. However, mutations of protooncogenes can also result in abnormal positive signals for cell proliferation. Some concepts resulting from genetic approaches to identify the genes that may be involved in the regulation of cell multiplications are discussed.
