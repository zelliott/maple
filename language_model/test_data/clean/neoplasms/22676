Vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors, including Flt-1 and Flk-1, are involved in angiogenesis under physiologic and pathologic conditions. Recently, Flt-1-expressing cells were reported to contribute to the intracranial growth of glioma cells. However, the role of Flt-1 signaling in solid tumor growth in s.c. tissue has not been elucidated. To investigate how Flt-1 signaling is involved in the proliferation of solid tumors, we implanted tumor cells into wild-type (Wt) and Flt-1 tyrosine kinase (TK)-deficient (Flt-1 TK(-/-)) mice. Growth of HSML and B16 but not Lewis lung carcinoma cell in s.c. tissue was significantly decreased in Flt-1 TK(-/-) mice. Angiogenesis in HSML and B16 tumors was remarkably reduced in Flt-1 TK(-/-) mice. Moreover, the infiltration of macrophage lineage cells into HSML and B16 tumors was clearly suppressed in Flt-1 TK(-/-) mice. Pericyte marker(+) cells were also reduced in Flt-1 TK(-/-) mice. However, in the border area of tumor, angiogenesis and the infiltration of macrophage lineage cell were basically similar between Wt and Flt-1 TK(-/-) mice. In bone marrow (BM) transplantation experiments, tumor angiogenesis, infiltration of macrophage lineage cells, and tumor growth were significantly suppressed in Wt/Flt-1 TK(-/-) mice implanted with Flt-1 TK(-/-) BM cells compared with those implanted with Wt BM cells. We conclude that Flt-1 signaling is involved in the function of BM-derived cell, such as the migration of macrophages into cancerous tissues, and significantly contributes to angiogenesis and tumor progression.
