A series of experiments is described in which: (i) mast cells were found to accumulate at a tumour site before the ingrowth of new capillaries; (ii) heparin released by mast cells increased the migration of capillary endothelial cells in vitro; and (iii) heparin enhanced tumour angiogenesis in vivo. These experiments led to the discovery that protamine and platelet factor 4 are angiogenesis inhibitors. This finding suggests a central role for heparin or related glycosaminoglycans in the growth regulation of capillary blood vessels.
