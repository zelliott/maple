To assess the knowledge and attitudes that patients seen at a health centre had of cancer risk factors and their prevention.

A descriptive crossover study. Non-probabilistic sampling by quota. Survey with questionnaire.

Rekaldeberri Health Centre (Bilbao).

400 people aged between 14 and 74 who attended the Centre for any reason during June and July 1995.

276 patients (69%) thought that cancer was preventable. The cancers most often cited as preventable were lung in men and breast in women. 371 (93%) related cancer to tobacco; 372 (93.1%) to sun-bathing without protection; 267 (66.8%) to excess of alcohol. 192 (48%) thought that diet could play a protective role. 339 (84%) thought that early diagnosis was possible: of these, 60.5% cited breast cancer. 222 women (96.7%) knew about mammography; and 166 (79.4%), cytology. In age groups for whom these techniques are appropriate, 32 women (56.1%) had had the first, and 136 (76%) the second. 258 (64.5%) did not smoke; 230 (57.5%) did not drink; 156 (39%) always used protective cream; and 328 (82%) ate fruit and/or vegetables daily or almost daily.

The population group studied had a good understanding of cancer risk factors and prevention.
