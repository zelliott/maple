To describe the impact of genetics and genomics on the biology of cancer and the implications for patient care.

Pubmed; CINAHL.

Cancer research in genetics/genomics has identified new mechanisms influencing personalized risk assessment/management, early detection, cancer treatment, and long-term screening/surveillance.

Understanding the basics of genetics/genomics on the biology of cancer will facilitate patient education and care delivery, including the administration and monitoring of genetically targeted therapies whose toxicities may in part be mediated by the molecular pathways targeted by the specific agent.
