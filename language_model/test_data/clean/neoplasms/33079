We evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of Huber Plus through three outpatients treated with central venous (CV) port chemotherapy (FOLFOX). One of the three outpatients first received chemotherapy with safety huber (Huber Plus) in this study, and the huber needle was changed from non-safety to a safety huber (Huber Plus) in two of the three outpatients. All three outpatients were taught about needle removal methods and port care. In patients? education, 1) we used a skin model and training CV port, and 2) dressing materials were used as film dressing plus three-point fixation by Fixomull stretch. As a result, the safety system assured zero incidents. Moreover, the evaluation revealed that operability and pain of Huber Plus were not clinical problems. We suggest that Huber Plus is applicable in outpatient chemotherapy and that our care plan with patients? education might become a standard treatment.
