An emblematic measure of the first Cancer Plan (2003-2007), the diagnosis announcement procedure is used in health care institutes. The nurse support which it involves favours the emergence of new skills. At Saint-Louis hospital in Paris, patients were questioned about its impact, the way it complements their treatment pathway and its capacity to provide pertinent answers to their questions. The results are highly encouraging.
