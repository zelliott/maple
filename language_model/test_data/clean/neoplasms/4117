Low scores on satisfaction measures may be anticipated when patients' expectations of the doctor are unmet during the cancer consultation. We correlated discrepancies between patient expectations of their ideal doctor and their perceptions of their actual doctor with scores on a validated satisfaction scale to determine whether patients whose expectations were unmet were less satisfied.

The expectations questionnaire used a forced choice method designed to elicit patient preferences for either emotional or informational support from the physician. One hundred and five new patients with heterogeneous cancers, of five medical oncologists at a major teaching hospital were sampled. The patients were mostly female (55%) middle aged (mean age 54.3) and newly diagnosed with cancer (56% within two months prior to consultation).

Patients did not demonstrate a clear preference for an emotionally or informationally supportive approach. Seventy percent of patients did not want emotionally negative physicians but most (88.4%) would tolerate negative information. The mean number of exact matches between patients expectations of the ideal and their perceptions of their actual doctor was 3.7 (from a total of six). 5.9% of patients received exactly the doctor they wanted. No significant differences in satisfaction were found between patients whose expectations were met and those whose expectations were not met.

Patient satisfaction with the consultation was independent of patient expectation for informational or emotional support.
