Anorexia is a common symptom in cancer and is usually assessed by multiple questions and multidimensional questionnaires. A simplified questionnaire would be less burdensome to patients and abbreviate the process.

We compared the reliability at one point in time, sensitivity to change over time, and prognostic accuracy of a two-item questionnaire with the Functional Assessment of Anorexia and Cachexia Therapy shortened 12-question version (A/CS-12).

Individuals with cancer, who were cognitively intact and verbally agreed to participate, completed a two-item questionnaire and A/CS-12 in random order and again seven days later. We compared the direction of response to the summated two-item questionnaire to the validated A/CS-12 score at a single point in time, then intra-patient changes over a seven-day period of time. Scores of both questionnaires were divided into poor, moderate and good appetite and compared to survival using Kaplan-Meyer curves. Bootstrapping was used to construct confidence intervals for estimated probability agreement. Survival analysis also used hazard ratios from a Cox Proportional Hazards model.

One hundred seventeen individuals from a single institution participated, who were either admitted to an inpatient palliative unit or seen in an outpatient/palliative medicine unit. Median age was 58.8 (range 10.7-87.1 years). Agreement at one point in time was 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63 - 0.66). Agreement over time was 0.53 (CI 0.41 - 0.64). The A/CS-12 predicted survival based on scores on Days 1 and 7 (P&lt;0.001), (P=0.003) (HR 0.97 day 1, HR 0.95 day 7), whereas the simplified questionnaire failed to predict survival.

A simplified questionnaire has moderate correlation with the A/CS-12 at one point in time but loses sensitivity over time, and lacks the ability to predict survival. A change in the questionnaire may improve reliability. Changing question 2 of the simplified questionnaire to a neutral form (better, same or worse appetite) may improve sensitivity and prognostic capability.
