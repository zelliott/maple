Thrombotic episodes represent the second cause of mortality in cancer patients. These complications are more frequent with some adenocarcinomas and hematologic malignancies. The mechanisms of pathogenesis are complex inducing an unbalanced function of the antithrombotic system. According to the type of tumor and the underlying mechanism, clinical manifestations are generally severe. The diagnosis of these thromboses are essentially clinical or radiological. The treatment is based on heparinotherapy, thrombolytic agents or eventually on surgery, which is not discussed here.
