To chronicle the development of radioactive sources for permanent implantation.

Review of contemporary literature.

The value of ionizing radiation in the treatment of malignancy was appreciated soon after Roentgen's and Becquerel's discoveries. Brachytherapy was developed to treat tumors that were poorly controlled by early X-ray equipment. Sources and techniques for permanent implantation were devised in the first quarter of the 20th century.

Long before the creation of artificial isotopes, pioneering physicists and clinicians fashioned seeds from naturally occurring radionuclides and ingenuity.
