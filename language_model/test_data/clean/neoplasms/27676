Safety and health matters should be an integral part of the decision making of management. Cancer prevention at the workplace requires cooperation between management, occupational health personnel, and workers. At the planning stage of a new production facility the safety and health personnel should actively participate and bring their experience and special knowledge to the planning process. The basis for cancer prevention is exact information about exposure and real risk levels. Modern technology can essentially minimize both exposure and health hazards.
