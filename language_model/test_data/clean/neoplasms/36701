The clinical application of hyperthermia in the treatment of oncological patients is based on a strong biological rationale: hyperthermia is an effective cell-killing agent, the effects of which can be induced selectively in tumour tissue. The mechanism of action of hyperthermia is complementary to that of radiotherapy (and chemotherapy). Furthermore, hyperthermia enhances the effects of radiotherapy (and of chemotherapy). In the approximately 20 years that hyperthermia was clinically investigated, much progress was made in the techniques of application. The clinical results achieved so far show that the therapeutic gain by adding hyperthermia can indeed be substantial.
