Grapes produce large amounts of polyphenols. Many of them accumulate in the skin, pulp, and seeds and are consequently found in wine. The health benefits of a moderate consumption of wine have been attributed at least in part to grape's polyphenols. Among them, resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a phytoalexin that stimulates plant cell defenses against infections and also plays protective roles in humans, where it delays cardiovascular alterations and exerts anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects. Despite numerous studies, the molecular mechanisms of resveratrol action are only partially understood. Given its pleiotropic effects, it was previously suggested that resveratrol protective properties may arise from its modulation of the expression of microRNAs. Therefore, this review will focus on the effects of resveratrol on microRNA populations in humans and human cell lines, especially emphasizing the microRNAs that have been implicated in resveratrol effects on inflammation, cancer, metabolism, and muscle differentiation.
