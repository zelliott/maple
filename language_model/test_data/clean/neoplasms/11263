An outline is presented of an electronically accessible database that compares the locations of mouse genes involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, cell cycle and signal transduction with those of known cancer risk modifier genes. The database has a primary but not exclusive focus on modifiers of ionizing radiation (IR) cancer risk and genes involved in IR-induced DNA damage responses. The database () provides a useful tool for assessing the role of DNA damage response genes in cancer predisposition.
