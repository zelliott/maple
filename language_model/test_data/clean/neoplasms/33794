A model incorporating recent information regarding the specificity of a high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for "active" platinum in plasma ultrafiltrate, and the concept of mobile and fixed metabolites, was developed for cancer patients treated with cisplatin. Model parameters were determined using plasma and urinary platinum data obtained in 20 patients. It was assumed in the model that parent drug accounted for essentially all the platinum measured in plasma ultrafiltrate in the 2 h period immediately post infusion. At times greater than 4 h post infusion, platinum concentrations in plasma ultrafiltrate were assumed to be due entirely to reactive, mobile metabolites with possible cytotoxicity. The model accurately simulated platinum concentrations in plasma ultrafiltrate over a 24-h period following a 2-h infusion of 80 mg/m2 of cisplatin to seven patients, 100 mg/m2 to ten patients and 120 mg/m2 to three patients.
