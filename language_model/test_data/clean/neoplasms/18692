As a member of the HSP90 family, heat shock protein (HSP) Gp96 is one of the most abundant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which displayed important molecular chaperones function in cells. Gp96 can stimulate the production of cytokines by activating the antigen presentation cells (such as dendritic cell, et al) in innate immunity. It is capable of eliciting an antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immune response to eliminate pathogens and tumors by facilitating antigen cross-presentation in adaptive immunity. Gp96 is also an ideal adjuvant in many recent researches. Here, we review the progress that addresses the role of biological characteristics, immunogenic mechanism that may be involved in the induction of anti-infection immune response and antitumor immunity, which may guide the new vaccine strategies with the knowledge of Gp96-antigen complexes.
