The purpose of this article is to describe the imaging biomarkers of treatment response and provide an overview of anatomic imaging biomarkers.

Imaging biomarkers of treatment response have evolved into the primary endpoint of response in most phase 2 studies. Anatomic imaging biomarkers are applied to depict change in tumor size in response to treatment and are currently the most commonly applied method of treatment response evaluation.
