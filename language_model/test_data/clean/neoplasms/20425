The polymorphism at codon 72 of the TP53 gene has been extensively studied for its involvement in cancerogenesis and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) detection. Usually, the exon 4 of the TP53 gene is amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA extracted from blood and tumor tissues, then digested by AccII. In the case of heterozygosity, the comparison of AccII profile from blood and tumor DNA PCR products allowed the identification of a potential LOH in the TP53 locus. This method can be hindered by a partial AccII digestion and/or DNA contamination of non-tumor cells. To circumvent these problems, we have developed a new approach by using the AccII restriction site between exon 4 and exon 6. The PCR amplification of exon 4-6, followed by AccII digestion allowed us to detect without ambiguity any LOH case.
