International literature regarding the situation of partners of cancer patients and the results of empirical studies are critically reviewed. The front of this background is the retrospective study, and the results, of interviews with 30 partners of long-term surviving cancer patients. Qualified by half-structured interview and various questionnaires regarding the situation during and after the illness. This substudy is part of an overall study of the posttraumatic syndrome of long-term surviving cancer patients and their next of kin. To evaluate the hypotheses two groups were created, good and bad copers. On the basis of interviewer rating good and bad coping was operationalized. Results showed significant better coping skills in partners with sufficient social support, with no illness of their own and with more flexible defense mechanisms. The majority of the partners preferred to be better informed and more involved by the physician.
