Prevention is seen as a major concept of medical literature even distorted by two prisms: search through key-words and an unique referring: The Medline data bank. This topic is as important as "cancer": found in more than 8% of all the articles of this data base. Nine years have been studied (1985-1993) and the mean rise for the appearance of the word "prevention" is +25% a year. The topic "chemoprevention" is quantitatively unimportant: in 1993 0.07% of the whole corpus mentioned it, and as few as 0.8% of the prevention-related articles, however this topic has demonstrated a dramatic rise: a mean of +150% a year through the nine years studied (and +250% between 1992 and 1993). This topic of "chemoprevention" appears specially in connection with cancerology which seems to be a preferential field for this approach: more than 80% of the articles selected by "chemoprevention" refers also to "cancer". Finally, in the restrictive frame of "the upstream treatment", search on "hope" topic evokes a shift from early diagnosis to prevention.
