In a prospective study, the occurrence of malignancies in children referred to genetic counseling for congenital malformations, in their sibs, parents and grandparents was registered in 120 families by means of personal interviews. One hundred-and-twenty age matched subjects, admitted for acute respiratory infections or trauma, served as controls. No difference in the occurrence of tumors or leukemias between the two groups was found when the values of patients, sibs, and parents were compared. At the same time, the grandparents of probands with malformations had had significantly more malignancies than the grandparents of the controls. This may be explained by the fact that grandparents lived beyond the age of the usual onset of common cancers and leukemias.
