Some 3-acetyl-2-substituted phenyl-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives were synthesized by cyclization reaction of N'-substituted benzylidene-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzohydrazide in acetic anhydride. Their structures were verified by elemental analysis, IR, (1)H NMR, and (13)C NMR. Compound 3i was provided with X-ray crystallographic data. The compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative activities against some cancer cells in vitro by MTT method. Among them, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2f, 3l, and 3m were highly effective against PC3 cells and 2a, 2c, and 2f showed moderate activities against Bcap37 and BGC823 cells. The IC(50) values of high active compounds 2a, 2b, 2c, 2f, 3l, and 3m against PC3 cells were 0.2, 1.8, 0.2, 1.2, 1.7, and 0.3muM, respectively.
