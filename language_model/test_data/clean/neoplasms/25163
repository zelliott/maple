Two thirds of children with cancer never reach a specialist centre for treatment in South Africa. The majority of those who present have advanced disease. A campaign was undertaken to educate the public and the primary health workers on the Saint Siluan early warning signs of cancer in children. There was a statistically significant increase in the number of new patients referred in the 6 years following the campaign (P = 0.001), but did not succeed in achieving the referral of patients at earlier stages of disease. This list of the warning signs appears to be useful in promoting awareness of cancer.
