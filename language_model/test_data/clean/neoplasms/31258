A new type of cancer vaccine for therapeutic application in cancer patients is described. It consists of three components. (1) autologous tumor cells, (2) Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), to be used for infection and (3) bispecific antibodies (bsAb) which attach to the viral hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) molecule on the infected tumor cells. A standardized procedure has been developed for generating virus infected human autologous tumor cell vaccines (ATV-NDV) which includes cell dissociation, removal of leukocytes and cell debris, gamma-irradiation and cryopreservation. Infection with the non-virulent strain NDV Ulster is performed within 30 min of co-incubation. While virus infection already increased immunogenicity of the tumor vaccine, further augmentation of T cell stimulatory capacity is achieved by attachment of specially designed bi-specific antibodies (bs HN x CD28 or bs HN x CD3).
