As first line chemotherapy Bevacizumab, associated with a platinum based regime, improves survival in patients with metastatic, non small cell, non epidermoid bronchial carcinoma. Marketing authorization for this indication was obtained in 2007. This treatment produces specific secondary effects related to its anti-angiogenic action. Physiologically, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important in the process of scar formation. Bevacizumab inhibits scar formation and may encourage bleeding. The aim of this article is to analyse the specific risks associated with invasive procedures and to produce practical recommendations. Unfortunately there are few data in the literature. We depend, therefore, principally on studies of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in metastatic colo-rectal cancer prior to excision of hepatic metastases and on our own experience of excision of pulmonary metastases from solid tumours treated with bevacizumab. We recommend a delay of 2 days between implantation of an intravenous device and the initiation of bevacizumab, a delay of at least 5 weeks between the last injection of bevacizumab and invasive surgery and a delay of 4 weeks between surgery and the initiation of bevacizumab treatment. Obviously, referral to a medico-surgical team experienced in the management of these patients is strongly recommended.
