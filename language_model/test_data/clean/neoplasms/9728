The sperm production of 14 cancer patients who received doxorubicin was examined after cessation of therapy. Doxorubicin was used in several multiple-drug protocols for the treatment of various malignancies. Seven patients also received radiotherapy to different sites. Total cumulative doses of doxorubicin ranged from 145 to 625 mg./m.2. Sperm concentration, motility, morphology and the frequency of quinacrine-stained sperm with 2 fluorescent bodies (2F sperm) were measured 7 to 79 months after discontinuation of doxorubicin. Of the patients 6 remained azoospermic, 3 were oligospermic and 5 were normospermic. Sperm motility among the 8 patients with sperm ranged from 20 to 80 per cent. Morphology and 2F sperm distributions were not significantly different from controls. We conclude that, in contrast with the mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone protocol, active sperm production within relatively short recovery times is possible after treatment with protocols that include doxorubicin.
