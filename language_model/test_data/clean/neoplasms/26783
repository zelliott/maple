This article reviews the functional, molecular, and disease-specific imaging biomarkers of treatment response.

Substantial progress has been made in the evolution of drugs directed at specific targets of the tumor lifecycle. These novel agents are predominantly cytostatic, and their efficacy may be optimally evaluated by functional, molecular, and disease-specific imaging biomarkers.
