This paper presents a review of the ways in which optimal control theory interacts with cancer chemotherapy. There are three broad areas of investigation. One involves miscellaneous growth kinetic models, the second involves cell cycle models, and the third is a classification of "other models." Both normal and tumor cell populations are included in a number of the models. The concepts of deterministic optimal control theory are applied to each model in such a way as to present a cohesive picture. There are applications to both experimental and clinical tumors. Suggestions for designing better chemotherapy strategies are presented.
