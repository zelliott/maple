This article presents the gatekeeping funnel as a model of the process that a public service announcement (PSA) goes through from distribution until it reaches its target audience. Process measures such as bounceback postcards, the Broadcast Advertisers Report (BAR), and analysis of audience response are suggested as ways of monitoring this funneling process. The model is then applied to the National Cancer Institute's PSA campaign designed to promote cancer prevention awareness. Three waves of PSAs were distributed between March 1984 and May 1985. Two of these waves of PSAs were targeted to the general public and the third wave was targeted to black audiences. Bounceback postcards, BAR data, and the Cancer Information Service (CIS) call data exemplify the gatekeeping funnel model described in the article. When the messages were distributed, they had the potential of reaching 170 million adults with televisions. BAR data show that the gatekeeping function narrowed the number of people potentially exposed to the messages to 24 million, or 14% of the total. Yet only 144,000 people, or less than one-tenth of 1% responded to the messages by calling the CIS number and asking about cancer prevention. This analysis may help PSA campaign planners to develop more realistic expectations for message effects.
