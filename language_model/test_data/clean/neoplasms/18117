This article reviews the principles of systemic cancer treatment in older individuals. These include: assessment of physiologic age with a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), adjustment of chemotherapy doses to the patient's renal function, and prevention of myelotoxicity with hemopoietic growth factors. Other complications that become more common with age include mucositis, peripheral neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Two chronic complications of chemotherapy become more common with age, including myelodysplasia and chronic cardiomyopathy. The goal of systemic cancer treatment in the older person should include prolongation of active life-expectancy and compression of morbidity in addition to prolongation of survival and symptom management.
