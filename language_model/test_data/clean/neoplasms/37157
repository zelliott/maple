This is the fourth official document of the SIOP Working Committee on psychosocial issues in pediatric oncology constituted in 1991. This document develops another topic discussed and approved by the SIOP Committee: "communication of the diagnosis" is addressed to the pediatric oncology community as guidelines that could be followed. The highly stressful nature of the diagnostic period must be acknowledged, and communication involving the staff and all family members should cover both medical and psychosocial issues. A well-planned and extensive initial session should be followed by continuing discussions. The goal is a knowledgeable family that can talk openly with its members and with the staff.
