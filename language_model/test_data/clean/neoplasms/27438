To investigate CYP3A activity in cancer and noncancer Asian patients using midazolam and to reveal possible alternative traits for phenotyping CYP3A.

Intravenous midazolam 2.5 mg or 2.5-8 mg was administered to 27 cancer and 24 noncancer patients, respectively. Plasma was sampled at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3.5 and 5 h after intravenous ultrashort, 30 s infusion. Plasma midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam concentrations were determined using GCMS. The disposition of midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam in these patients was compared. Midazolam clearance was correlated with dose-normalized plasma midazolam concentrations (concentration/per dose).

Clearance (CL) and steady state volume of distribution (Vss) of midazolam (mean +/- SD, 95% confidence level) in cancer (424 +/- 155, 61.3 ml min(-1); 1.21 +/- 0.46, 0.18 l kg(-1)) and noncancer (407 +/- 135, 57.1 ml min(-1); 1.15 +/- 0.33, 0.155 l kg(-1)) patients, respectively, were not different and comparable with published data. Clearance variability was 4-5 fold in both groups. Midazolam clearance correlated significantly with all plasma concentration/per dose at and after the 1-h time point, with a minimum correlation coefficient of r = 0.752, P &lt; 0.001.

CYP3A activities determined with different doses of midazolam in cancer and noncancer Asian patients showed variability of 4-5-fold and were not different between groups. One to two-fold plasma midazolam concentrations per dose may be feasible as a simple alternative phenotypic trait for hepatic CYP3A activity determination.
