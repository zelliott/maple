Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) are phase II detoxification enzymes that are involved in the biotransformation of a wide variety of structurally diverse endo- and xenobiotics. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SULTs can alter the phenotype of the translated proteins. SNPs in some SULTs are fairly uncommon in the population, but some, most notably for SULT isoform 1A1, are commonly found and have been associated with cancer risk for a variety of tumor sites and also with response to therapeutic agents. SNPs in many SULTs vary by ethnicity, another factor that could influence SULT-associated disease risk and pharmacogenetics. This review surveys the current knowledge of SULT genetic variability in relation to cancer risk and response to therapy, focusing primarily on SULT1A1.
