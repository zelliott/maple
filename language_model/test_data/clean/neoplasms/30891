In Brazil, 226 children with cancer presenting 299 episodes of fever and neutropenia (&lt; or = 500/mm3) were treated with two consecutive empirical regimens. Regimen I-Cefoxitin Amikacin-Carbenicillin; and Regimen II Ceftriaxone-Amikacin. 67.0% of the patients had leukemias or lymphomas, documented infections occurred in 47.2%, superinfections occurred in 18.7% (Reg. I) and 17.8% (Reg. II) of the episodes. The most common agents identified in Reg. I and Reg. II were, respectively, Gram negative rods (55.0%) and Gram positive cocci (52.6%). The overall rate of success with modifications (Amphotericin B, Vancomycin, Clindamycin, Metronidazole) was higher in Reg. II (93.0%) than in Reg. I (84.0%). This study shows that the appropriate formula to maximize the successful treatment of children with cancer, fever and neutropenia in developing nations includes adherence to established principles of supportive care, utilizing the optimal antibiotic agents available in the country. It is important to promote the necessary modifications along the treatment having in mind the high index of resistant agents.
