Our understanding of the mechanism of carcinogenesis is developing rapidly, owing to the discovery of genes and gene products involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation and the identification of genetic events implicated in tumour formation. Our current concept is that cancer is basically the result of accumulating genetic damage. This damage may range from single base-pair substitutions to gross chromosomal changes, leading to distortion of either the expression or the biochemical function of genes, particularly those involved in proliferation and differentiation (PDR genes). These PDR genes and gene products can now be envisioned as critical targets for interaction with carcinogens. This paper discusses only the evidence that PDR genes are critical targets for carcinogenic agents.
