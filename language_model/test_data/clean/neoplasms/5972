A summary of recommendations from a breakout session of a Workshop on Hereditary Breast, Ovarian and Colon Cancer held in Washington, DC, in April 1994 is presented here. The focus of the session was the provision of testing and counseling services for adults at increased risk for developing cancer. Elements of service provision involving three time-points for counseling (pretest education, risk notification, and follow-up) and suggested areas of research are outlined for discussion.
