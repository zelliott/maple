Neutron dosimetry intercomparison visits have been made by physicists from the M. D. Anderson Hospital-Texas A&M University Project to the Naval Research Laboratory, the University of Washington, and the MRC Cyclotron at Hammersmith Hospital. The Naval Research Laboratory and University of Washington physicists have made dosimetry intercomparisons at the Texas A&M Variable-Energy Cyclotron (TAMVEC). The parameters that are usually measured during these visits are tissue kerma in air, tissue dose at depth of dose maximum, relative central-axis depth dose, neutron/gamma ratios in air and in phantom, and photon calibrations of ionization chambers. In addition, beam profiles and dose buildup curves are sometimes measured. Other parameters that are compared are values of W, stopping power ratios, kerma corrections, and calculations that lead to the statement of tumor doses for patients. This paper presents some of the results of the intercomparisons and discusses the implications of the findings.
