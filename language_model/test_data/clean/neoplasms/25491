Evidence of early loss of immunological competence in cases of neoplasms occurring in juveniles was found in an analysis of OSCC data (Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancers). The effects observed included heightened sensitivity to infection from birth onwards for all types of childhood cancer, higher levels of sensitivity for leukaemia than for lymphomas, and higher levels for lymphomas than for other solid tumours. The findings as a whole are consistent with in utero loss of immunological competence, which is an essential promoter of cancers of foetal origin and thus allows the outcome of an in utero cancer induction to be influenced both by maternal levels of immunological competence and postnatal infection.
