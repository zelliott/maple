The use of low power ultrasound in therapeutic medicine is a developing field and this review will concentrate on the applications of this technology in cancer therapy. The effects of low power ultrasound have been evaluated in terms of the biological changes induced in the structure and function of tissue. The main fields of study have been in sonodynamic therapy, improving chemotherapy, gene therapy and apoptosis therapy. The range of ultrasonic power levels that can be effectively employed in therapy appears to be narrow and this may have hindered past research in the applications in cancer treatment.
