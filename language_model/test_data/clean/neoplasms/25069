Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have been used for years in Taiwan, but their broad usage has been restricted by their short durability and complications.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the most important factors causing failure of PICCs by comparing 2 periods of retrospectively studied cases before and after we implemented nursing care improvements.

We analyzed possible factors affecting the length of the insertion period, according to the reasons for catheter withdrawal after insertion, self-care ability, coagulation status, and other factors. We reviewed 2 different periods of PICC insertions at our hospital (133 and 143 cases, respectively) before and after an announcement of nursing educational comprehensive guidelines for post-PICC care.

In the first period, the most common complication due to PICC placement was wound oozing (24.7%), followed by infection/phlebitis (9.7%), occlusion (6.7%), and leaking (3.8%). In the second period, comprehensive educational guidelines for post-PICC manipulation were provided. The outcomes of PICC insertions significantly improved from 33.8% in the first period to 64.3% in the second period (odds ratio, 3.53), and the complication rates of persistent oozing (7%), infection (4.2%), and occlusion (2.8%) significantly decreased.

Changes in nursing care provided in the period 2 contributed to improvements in the success rate of PICC.

This is the first study suggesting that cancer nursing practice for PICC could benefit from professional guidelines that reinforce in-service education, strict control of PICC candidates without risk of coagulopathies, and a special nursing care system for patients with poor self-care ability.
