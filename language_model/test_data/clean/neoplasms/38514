Children and parents who attend pediatric oncology clinics often develop close relationships with other patients and may question clinic staff about another child's disease, therapy, or status. To assess parental attitudes concerning the dissemination of information by the clinic staff, questionnaires were mailed to the parents of all 154 patients who have attended pediatric oncology clinic since 1972. There were 100 (65%) responses including 77 from 99 living (78%) and 23 from 55 deceased patients (42%). Parents were asked whether clinic staff should respond completely to questions from other clinic parents regarding six aspects of their child's cancer. Percentages of parents who favored complete information sharing without their explicit consent about each of the aspects were as follows: diagnosis, 83%; medication/side effects, 85%; laboratory results, 66%; general status, 87%; occurrence of relapse, 77%; development of terminal phase, 67%. Neither the survival status (living v deceased) nor whether the patient was receiving therapy or not affected responses significantly. Benefit from receiving information about other children from clinic staff was reported by 82% of parents.
