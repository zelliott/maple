ENDS (external nasal dilator strips) are adhesive bands containing a central elastic strip providing a spring action. The possibility of reducing the cumulated effort of continuous breathing or decreasing the perception of exertion would be of major benefit to oncological dyspneic patients, namely in presence of a cachexia-asthenia complex.

Nine patients complaining of dyspnea were included in this pilot study. The ENDS were applied at 0800 and at 1600. Perception of dyspnea and tolerability was assessed 12 h after the first application of the ENDS. No other treatment changes were performed during the evaluation time.

As a result of the application of ENDS, one patient perceived a good improvement of dyspnea, three moderate, two little, and three none. Tolerability was good for four patients and moderate for another four. Seven out of nine patients decided to carry on with the application of ENDS afterwards.

The application of ENDS may be useful in cancer patients with dyspnea. It could be particularly helpful to patients suffering from cachexia and profound fatigue. However, further research is needed to affirm that ENDS might have an important place in relieving dyspnea.
