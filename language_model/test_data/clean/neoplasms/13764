National French investigation of the using of conformal radiotherapy in routine work, has been made in 2001, in 180 radiotherapeutic centers. Eighty responses have been obtained and analyzed. Conformal radiotherapy is used in 88% and virtual simulation in 60% of these centers. There is a heterogeneity in the equipment of these institutions, most of them have one or two machines. The accelerator equipment differs, and the disponibility of multileaf collimators and electronic portal imaging is limited. Actually only eleven centers have IMRT, eight have projects to install. Only six centers have CT-scans, used mainly for simulation. In 75% of centers, conformal radiotherapy have been used in the treatment of CNS-tumors, head and neck cancers, prostate, and non-small cell lung carcinoma. If there are more equipment and human facilities to use conformal radiotherapy, this treatment can be proposed to patients with breast cancer, rectal and gynecological tumors. According 90% of responses, all prostatic cancers need conformal radiotherapy. The analysis of routine use of conformal radiotherapy in France shows an important heterogeneity but it seems that there is an agreement with objectives of this treatment.
