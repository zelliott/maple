In the period from 1996 to 2007 operations were fulfilled in 120 patients with isolated pulmonary metastases of solid tumors (68 men and 52 women aged from 22 through 77 years): 46 patients with metastases of colorectal cancer, 28 - with cancer of the kidney, 23 - with non-small cell carcinoma of lung, 7 - with breast cancer, 9 - with endometrium cancer, 7 - with melanoma. Altogether there were 128 operations. The operations have revealed lesion of intrathoracic lymph nodes in 29 patients (24%). In most cases (21 patients) they were lesions of lymph nodes of the lung root and intrapulmonary lymph nodes. In 93% of cases (27 patients) localization of the lesion coincided with anatomical pathways of lymph outflow from the affected part of the lung. The survival rate median of the operated patients who had alterations in the lymph nodes was 21 months, in cases with intact lymphatic system it was 37 months. A conclusion is made of possible secondary lymphatic cancer spread from intrapulmonary metastases of solid tumors and its negative influence on results of treatment that allows recommendation of revision of the lymphatic system of the lungs and mediastinum in all cases of surgical treatment of intrapulmonary metastases, and in a number of cases recommendation of anatomical resections of the lung tissue as operation of choice.
