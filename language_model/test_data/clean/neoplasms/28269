New efforts in cancer therapy are being focused at various levels of signaling pathways. With phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) potentially being necessary for a range of cancer-related functions, we have investigated the influence of selected inositol tris- to hexakisphosphates on cell growth and tumorigenicity. We show that micromolar concentrations of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate and inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5,6)P(4)] inhibit IGF-1-induced [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation in human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells and the ability to grow in liquid medium and form colonies in agarose semisolid medium by small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells, a human cancer cell line containing a constitutively active PI3-K. In an ovarian cancer cell line that also contains a constitutively active PI3-K (SKOV-3 cells), Ins(1,4,5,6)P(4) again inhibited liquid medium growth. Furthermore, when applied extracellularly, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate was shown indeed to enter SCLC cells. These effects appeared specifically related to PH domains known to bind to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4)P(2)] and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)], indicating involvement of the PI3-K downstream target protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). This was further supported by inhibition of PKB/Akt PH domain membrane targeting in COS-7 cells by Ins(1,4,5,6)P(4). Thus, we propose that specific inositol polyphosphates inhibit PI3-K by competing with PtdIns(3,4, 5)P(3)-binding PH domains and that this occurs mainly at the level of the downstream PI3-K target, PKB/Akt.
