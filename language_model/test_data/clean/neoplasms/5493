To analyze the descriptive epidemiology of cancer at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología of Mexico, and describe the characteristics of the growing demand for medical care.

A review of the 10 year experience of the Hospital Cancer Registry from 1985 to 1994 was done.

During the study period a total of 28591 patients was registered with the histological confirmation of cancer. There were 8984 (31.4%) men, being the testicle (8.3%), the lung (7.4%), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (7.1%) and the prostate (5.5%) the more frequent malignancies. In women a total of 19597 (68.6%) cases were seen; together, invasive cervical cancer (30.6%) and breast cancers (20.6%) represent more than 50% of all patients. In 1996, 108876 outpatient services were given, 6492 hospitalizations, 36388 sessions of radiotherapy and 9116 of chemotherapy. Only 30% of this population comes from Mexico City, the remaining lives in the 31 different states of Mexico.

Supporting the development of the Centros Estatales de Cancerología for the referral of patients is necessary, this will avoid the rapid saturation of medical care at the institute. Also, stimulate the development of hospital registries and collaborate with the Ministry of Health to improve the early cancer detection programmes in Mexico.
