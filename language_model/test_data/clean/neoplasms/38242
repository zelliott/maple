The diagnosis of terminal cancer begins one of the most complex and challenging individual experiences of human life that requires multiple coping responses, one of those being hope. There are few studies that provide descriptions of hope over time for adults, ages 20-59, with advanced stage cancer. The purpose of this study was to describe hope as defined and experienced by young and middle age adults with advanced stage cancer.

This descriptive, longitudinal qualitative research study interviewed 12 hopeful adults with advanced stage cancer once a month for 3 months.

By definition, this population exhibited high levels of hope at study entry. Hope scores did not change overtime. Four qualities associated with high levels of hope included: reliance on strong spiritual beliefs, maintenance of positive attitudes, accommodation of cancer symptoms, and the presence of supportive resource people. The emphasis or importance of each quality and specific hope related goals were determined and defined individually. Hope goals varied in degree of expectancy and concreteness and require reassessment as conditions change. SIGNIFICANCES OF RESULTS: By identifying an individual's hope goals, palliative care clinicians can then plan and implement interventions to move toward that hope goal.
