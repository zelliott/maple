This article focuses on two questions regarding cancer mortality in the Federal Republic of Germany:  whether the risk of cancer mortality has increased in recent decades and whether the risk increases monotonically with age, even for the highest age groups.  It is noted that factors such as changes in age structure, diagnostic errors, and declines in the incidence of other causes of death create problems in interpreting cancer mortality data.  When these factors are controlled, it is found that the risk of cancer mortality has increased in recent years and that it does increase with age.
