Culturing of embryonic and adult stem cells (SC) is characterized. Animal experiments on models of human pathology (diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial unfarction, cerebral stroke, Parkinson's disease, etc.) have shown that use of SC is associated with good effects on the diseases. Pilot results of SC treatment of acute myocardial infarction, parkinsonism, hemoblastoses, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and others are reviewed.
