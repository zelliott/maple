In an investigation by the Swedish Cancer Society, the present status, critical issues and future aspects and prospects were described by an expert group for each of nine major areas of radiation research. A summary of the investigation is presented in this report. A more extensive summary (in Swedish) can be found at www.Cancerfonden.se. It is concluded that radiation therapy plays an increasingly important role in curative and palliative tumour treatment and presents a considerable challenge to research. Several suggestions are made that could improve the possibilities for high-quality radiation therapy research in Sweden.
