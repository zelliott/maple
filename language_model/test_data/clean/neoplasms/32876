The human tolerance to multiple dosages of misonidazole (Ro-07-0582) was studied in 28 patients with different types of malignant neoplasias. The mean total dose for this group of patients was 16.2 g. The main toxicity was peripheral neuropathy with an overall incidence of 35%. This neuropathy occurred more frequently and with greater severity when the drug was administered 3 times a week and when patients received total doses of over 18 g. The best tolerated schedule appears to be once or twice a week up to total dosages of 18 g or less (approximately 11 g/m2). Electron microscopy of a sural nerve biopsy from an affected patient revealed residual of previous distal axonal degeneration, with some segmental demyelination and remyelination, which affected both large and small myelinated nerve fibres.
