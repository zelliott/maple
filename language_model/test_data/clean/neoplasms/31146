We have provided care at home for 29 patients who were terminally ill, and from the fact that 3 of them needed excretion care, we learned something important for successful nursing care. The first necessity is the technical skill and knowledge of nursing care for the terminal cancer patients. We need to be able to provide guidance for the patient or family. The second is prompt consultation anytime when the patient or family needs it. The key to success is to create a medical network system for terminal cancer patients. The third is to provide support for the patient and family so that they pass the time without pain and meaningfully.
