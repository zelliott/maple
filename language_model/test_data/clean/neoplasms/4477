The National Cancer Institute's computerized information systems have been designed to help physicians cope with the information explosion by translating the medical literature into usable forms. Systems developed by the NCI's International Cancer Information Center provide access to a comprehensive source of bibliographic citations on cancer research (the CANCERLIT database) and to current, peer-reviewed syntheses of state-of-the-art clinical information on cancer (the PDQ database). This article describes how the PDQ databases were developed and are kept up-to-date, and how physicians and other health professionals can access PDQ and other NCI information by computer and fax.
