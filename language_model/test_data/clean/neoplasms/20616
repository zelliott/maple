In the medical community, little is known regarding bone marrow necrosis (BMN) as a clinicopathologic entity, although to the authors' knowledge it was described for the first time more than 50 years ago. To identify the rate of prevalence, the symptoms and signs, the underlying disease associations, and the usefulness of diagnostic procedures, an extensive literature search was made.

Only cases identified as extensive necrosis and diagnosed during life were selected. Two hundred forty cases met these criteria.

Bone pain (75%) and fever (68.5%) were the most important symptoms, whereas anemia (91%) and thrombocytopenia (78%), associated with a leukoerythroblastic picture (51%), were the most frequent hematologic abnormalities. Nearly 50% of patients showed elevated lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase levels. In 90% of the patients an underlying malignancy was identified.

Bone marrow necrosis is caused by hypoxemia after failure of the microcirculation. Given the high rate of malignancy as an underlying disease association, an extensive search for neoplastic disease is justified whenever BMN is diagnosed. Pancytopenia and embolic processes are major complications that should be managed with supportive measures until effective treatment of the underlying disease has been administered. When necrosis resolves, repopulation of the bone marrow cavity with normal hematopoiesis is observed.
