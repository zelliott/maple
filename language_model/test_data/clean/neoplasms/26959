Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a potent estrogen mimic that was predominantly used from the 1940s to the 1970s by pregnant women in hopes of preventing miscarriage. Decades later, DES is known to enhance breast cancer risk in exposed women and cause a variety of birth-related adverse outcomes in their daughters such as spontaneous abortion, second trimester pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Additionally, children exposed to DES in utero suffer from sub/infertility and cancer of reproductive tissues. DES is a pinnacle compound that demonstrates the fetal basis of adult disease. The mechanisms of cancer and endocrine disruption induced by DES are not fully understood. Future studies should focus on common target tissue pathways affected and the health of the DES grandchildren.
