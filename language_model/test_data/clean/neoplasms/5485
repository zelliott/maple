The author proposes that the formation of immunosuppressive hybridomas resultant from fusion of transformed tumor cells and immune reaction suppressor cells precedes the development of malignant tumors and cancer in man and animals. Physical and chemical carcinogens and oncogenic and nononcogenic viruses act not only as transforming agents in this process, but directly induce these cells' fusion to form immunosuppressive hybridomas. The resultant hybridomas retain the tumor cell capacity to unlimited division and growth and suppressor cell capacity to overcome the immune barrier, and thus form the base for malignant tumors and their capacity to metastasizing.
