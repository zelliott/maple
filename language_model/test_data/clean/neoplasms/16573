Five to ten percent of oncological diseases exhibit monogenic mode of inheritance. They occur as a consequence of the germline mutations of tumor suppressor genes and of the genes engaged in reparative processes. Most common monogenically determined oncological diseases are: AD form of breast and ovarian cancer, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, Lynch sy.) and familiar adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The aim of the genetic investigation is to evaluate whether the index family deals with the hereditary form of tumor predisposition, than, if possible, to perform DNA analysis in the family and to propose preventive screening program (methods) for the probands in risk.
