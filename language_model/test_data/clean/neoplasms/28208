The aim of this study was to clarify patients', physicians', and nurses' perceptions with regard to the communication of diagnosis to cancer patients in Japan. Sixty-three cancer patients, 35 physicians and 21 nurses were enrolled for this study: 54 of the patients wished to be informed of the diagnosis, of whom 34 had actually been told that they had cancer. Physicians did not tell the truth to the remaining 20 patients, of whom seven were not told the diagnosis because family members objected. Twenty-one of the 35 physicians thought that telling the true diagnosis had a positive effect and 27 thought that disclosure of the diagnosis to cancer patients should be promoted. Sixteen of the 21 nurses did not experience any difficulties with patient care after the diagnosis was disclosed. The present study suggests that medical staff and family members should respect the patient's standpoint because patients have the right to know about their own condition. Physicians should first provide the details of the disease to their patients. Thereafter, family members should be informed, but only with the patient's consent.
