A novel member of mitochondrial carrier superfamily has been identified from human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and designated as human BMSC-derived mitochondrial carrier protein (HuBMSC-MCP). It encodes a 321 amino-acid protein with three tandem related domains of about 100 amino acids. Each domain contains two hydrophobic stretches, which are thought to span the membrane as alpha-helices. Distant relationship analysis indicates that the protein is highly conserved between species from Caenorhabditis elegans to human. HuBMSC-MCP gene is mapped to chromosome 11p11. HuBMSC-MCP mRNA expression is detectable in various human tissues and cell lines. By confocal imaging, HuBMSC-MCP is localized to mitochondria and also detected in the pseudopodial protrusion of human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells. When transfected into dendritic cells (DC), HuBMSC-MCP could enhance DCs endocytotic capacity. Thus, HuBMSC-MCP is a phylogenetically conserved and widely expressed mitochondrial carrier protein which perhaps associates with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
