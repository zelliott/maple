We have actively carried out cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART) for refractory ascites. However, with conventional CART, the membrane becomes clogged after processing about 2 L of cancerous ascites fluid due to the fact that it is rich in cellular and mucous components; it is therefore difficult to process the entire volume of collected ascites.

We developed KM-CART which includes a membrane cleaning function, and applied it in 73 cases of cancerous ascites, after its basic functions had been evaluated in 11 cases of refractory cancerous ascites.

On average, using KM-CART, 6.4 L (range 1.7-14.9 L) of ascites were filtrated and concentrated to 0.8 L (0.2-2.0 L) in 57 min (5-129 min); the membrane was cleaned an average of three times (range 0-10 times) and this enabled the processing of more ascites in a shorter period. In addition, the circuit and the handling were both markedly simple, and fever, which has been the most notable adverse effect with the conventional system, was not an issue.

Since KM-CART was safe and is expected to improve the subjective symptoms and general condition of the patient, it is proposed that this novel system should actively be used not only for palliation but also as supplementary treatment for cancerous peritonitis.
