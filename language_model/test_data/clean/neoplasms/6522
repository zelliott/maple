Out of 810 patients autopsied at our institute between 1972 and 1985, tuberculosis was demonstrated in 12 (1.5%), all between 40 and 80 years of age, regardless of cancer type. Of 4,272 patients who underwent surgery for malignant neoplasms, 481 were examined for M. tuberculosis by culture in different specimens. All of eight positive cases were with sputum or bronchial mucus specimens, regardless of the site of primary cancer. Tuberculosis complicating malignant thymoma or Hodgkin's disease was found to be generalized and severe. Remarkable growth of elongated bacteria was observed in host macrophages in these immunodeficient patients, suggesting their altered intracellular environment. These findings warrant special attention to tuberculosis in hospital care of cancer patients, who are often immunodeficient.
