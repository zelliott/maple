The clinical development of interleukin 12 (IL-12) as a single agent for systemic cancer therapy has been hindered by its significant toxicity and disappointing anti-tumor effects. The lack of efficacy was accompanied by, and probably related to, the declining biological effects of IL-12 in the course of repeated administrations at doses approaching the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Nevertheless, IL-12 remains a very promising immunotherapeutic agent because recent cancer vaccination studies in animal models and humans have demonstrated its powerful adjuvant properties. Therefore, IL-12 may re-enter the arena of cancer therapy. Here, we review the immune modulating characteristics of IL-12 considered responsible for the adjuvant effects, as well as the results of animal and human cancer vaccination studies with IL-12 applied as an adjuvant. In addition, we discuss how studies with systemic IL-12 in cancer patients, and several other lines of evidence, indicate that IL-12 may exert optimal adjuvant effects only at low dose levels. Therefore, the MTD may not constitute the maximum effective dose of IL-12 for adjuvant application.
