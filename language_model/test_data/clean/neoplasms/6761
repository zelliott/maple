Despite increasingly sophisticated techniques, improvements in the correlation between laboratory findings and tumor response to endocrine therapy have not been obtained by hormone receptor studies. A possible explanation is that present knowledge of the mechanisms of the endocrine stimulus is incomplete. Some aspects of the present model, (elevated conjugated steroid levels, multiplicity of the plasma proteins capable of binding hormones, pulsatility of the plasma protein bond and of the receptor system for steroids), are still unclear and thus are not used in diagnosis. By evaluating these factors it will probably be possible to correlate better laboratory data with clinical findings.
