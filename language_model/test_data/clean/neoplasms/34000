Hematopoetic stem cell transplants (HSCT) are discussed as treatment options for patients with solid tumors. Transplant numbers have changed substantially over the last decade, few controlled studies are available and different opinions prevail. Objective information on current practice is needed.

Data from 27 902 HSCT for solid tumors (2% allogeneic, 98% autologous), collected by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) activity survey from 1991 to 2002 were used to assess trends, transplant rates and coefficient of variation of transplant rates in Europe.

Transplant numbers increased from 536 in 1991 to 4154 in 1997 and decreased to 1913 in 2002. Indications were neuroblastoma (2504 HSCT; 9%), glioma (662 HSCT; 2%), soft tissue sarcoma (1253 HSCT; 4%), germ cell cancer (3291 HSCT; 12%), breast cancer (13 524 HSCT; 48%), Ewing's sarcoma (1896 HSCT; 7%), lung cancer (387 HSCT; 1%), ovarian cancer (845 HSCT; 3%) and other solid tumors (3540 HSCT; 14%). Allogeneic cells were used in &lt;20 cases up to 1997; since then allogeneic HSCT increased to 159 in 2002, mainly for renal cell carcinoma. Low coefficients of variation in transplant rates (&lt;60%) are observed for Ewing's sarcoma (&lt;56.5%), suggesting consensus for this indication.

These data give an overview on current practice of HSCT for solid tumors in Europe. They provide objective information for health-care providers and patient counselling.
