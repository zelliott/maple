Between 1979 and 1986, 100 patients underwent parenteral nutrition at home on account of malnutrition consecutive to digestive insufficiency or heavy anti-cancer chemotherapy. Parenteral feeding was performed through a buried catheter for a mean period of 74 days (range 30 to 430 days). The patients' nutritional status was improved, with a significant increase in weight, total plasma proteins and serum albumin (P less than 0.001). The principal complication observed was infection, and few patients (10.61%) were rehospitalized. Home parenteral nutrition may be regarded as "the artificial bowel" for chronic malnutrition patients. It increases the duration and quality of life without prolonging the time spent in hospital, and it reduces health expenses by 50 to 70%.
