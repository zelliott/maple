More than five million Americans with a history of cancer are alive today, creating a large population with specific healthcare needs. The nurse's role in cancer prevention and education should be extended to meet the needs of cancer survivors. The care and rehabilitation of patients with cancer should include strategies to promote new behaviors for enhancing the early detection of recurrent disease and reducing risk factors for second malignancies, as well as for other preventable diseases related to diet, exercise, and smoking. As cancer survivors incorporate new health-oriented behaviors into their lives, they may achieve a better sense of control over their health.
