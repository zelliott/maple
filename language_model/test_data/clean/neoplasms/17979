Quantum dots (QDs) are fluorescent nanocrystals that are emerging as fine alternatives to the conventional organic dyes. They have several advantages including greater photostability and a wider range of excitation-emission wavelengths. By using mortalin staining as a model, we initially demonstrated that the QDs are more stable and provide better resolution in protein imaging in fixed cells. With the help of an internalizing antibody, we generated internalizing QD (i-QD) and demonstrated its inertness to cell replication, structure, and viability. Based on the superior resolution, stability and inertness, we propose the use of QD staining of mortalin as a cell-based visual assay to screen for senescence-inducing drugs, proteins, and siRNAs.
