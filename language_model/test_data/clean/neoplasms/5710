A survey of investigations performed over the last decade concerning analytical, clinical and pharmacological data on cancer chemotherapy with Pt-based drugs is reported. From this standpoint discussion focuses on clinical studies aimed at evaluating therapeutic response and toxicity during regional and systemic treatment of cisplatin against solid tumors in adults as well as in children. Concurrent treatments with locoregional hyperthermia in the case of limb tumors or with radiotherapy in the case of lung carcinoma are also dealt with.
