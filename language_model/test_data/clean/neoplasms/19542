Neopterin is a low-molecular mass substance synthesized from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in monocytes/macrophages due to IFNgamma stimulation. The cellular immune system is involved in or affected by the disease process in various conditions such as viral infections (AIDS), autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, Crohn's disease), malignancy and monitoring after solid organ transplants. Similar to procalcitonin, neopterin determination can assist in the differential diagnosis between viral and bacterial infection and as an indicator for impending septic complications (MODS vs. sepsis). Because of fact that reduced glamerular filtration rate neopterin accumulates in the blood, neopterin determination in multiorgan failure or sepsis patients are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of neopterin in clinical diagnostics.
