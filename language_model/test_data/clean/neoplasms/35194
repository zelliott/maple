Monocytes lysing a variety of tumor cells were isolated by adhesion to autologous serum-coated plastic surfaces. When the blood monocytes were co-cultured with K562 cells for 3-24 h, the supernatants contained soluble factors, termed monocyte cytotoxic factors (MCF), capable of lysing K562 and other tumor cells in a 48-h microcytotoxicity assay. The production of MCF was mediated by typical monocytes expressing a surface phenotype of CD11 (+), CD16 (-), LeuM1 (+). When target cells were pretreated with actinomycin D, they showed an increase in their susceptibility to lysis by MCF. Addition of the drug to MCF assays also resulted in an enhancement of MCF-mediated lysis. Thus, the lytic activity of MCF was detectable in an 18-h assay. The presence of interferon (IFN)-alpha or -gamma augmented the biological activity of MCF, while pretreatment of target cells with IFN did not enhance MCF activity. The absorption of MCF activity was not elevated by actinomycin D or IFN. MCF lysed target cells that were resistant to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). One result of importance is that MCF lysed autologous and allogeneic freshly isolated human tumor cells. The lysis of fresh human tumor cells by MCF was not inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against TNF, lymphotoxin (LT), IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, or interleukin 1 (IL-1). Furthermore, TNF, LT, IFNs, and IL-1 did not kill fresh human tumor cells. MCF activity was stable at low temperatures but was destroyed by heating. The biological activity of MCF was reduced or abolished by serum, trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K, indicating the proteinaceous nature of MCF. The lytic activity was resistant to protease inhibitors. These data indicate that MCF is a noble cytokine that acts on human fresh tumor cells.
