Human vascular endocan is a proteoglycan exhibiting tumorigenic activity through both its glycan and protein cores. Endocan mRNA is identified as being one of the most significant molecular signatures defining a poor prognosis in lung, breast, kidney, prostate, and thyroid malignancies. The survival inversely correlates with endocan expression in tumor tissue from hepatocarcinoma, and in serum from lung cancer. In mouse, endocan mRNA is also increased in tumor vessels. However, mouse endocan has not yet been fully characterized. Here, we produced a panel of rat monoclonal antibodies directed against mouse endocan, leading to the development of a specific mouse/rat endocan ELISA. Mouse endocan serum level was measured at a median of 0.96 ng/mL and 1.08 ng/mL in 129Sv mice and C57bl6, respectively. These results also provide new tools to characterize and explore the role of endocan in mouse and rat models of human diseases. These results present mouse vascular endocan as a circulating molecule similar to human endocan.
