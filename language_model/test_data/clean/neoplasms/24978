Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are a very interesting class of molecules to be introduced in gene and siRNA vectors. They can be used to overcome one of the biggest hurdles in gene and siRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo, the transfer across cell membranes. This chapter describes protocols for the synthesis and biological evaluation of a polylysine-based polymer. In this carrier system, melittin is used as CPP with a high activity to disrupt membranes. pH-Labile masking is applied to render the lytic activity specific for intracellular acidic endolysosomal organelles.
