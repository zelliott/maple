Acute renal tubular necrosis occurred in this 19-year-old white female after severe hypotension developed as the result of massive pulmonary emboli and failure of the right side of the heart.  This previously healthy young girl was 19 days into her first cycle of an oral estrogen-progestogen agent.  Upon admission to the hospital she was in critical condition, and 4 hours after admission cardiopulmonary resuscitation was necessary.  34 days after admission she developed ventricular tachycardia during a cardiac catheterization.  Hemodialyses were instituted twice, with ventricular fibrillation occurring during the first procedure, which required cardiac defibrillation.  Hemiparesis of the left side developed after this episode.  She was discharged after 58 days with some left-sided weakness.  After 9 months the pulmonary lesions had cleared and her electrocardiogram was normal.
