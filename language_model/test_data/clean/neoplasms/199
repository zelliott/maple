This paper is concerned with discussing various methodological components of cancer epidemiology. Developments in measuring disease frequency are acknowledged as well as the high level of sophistication of statistical methodology. Several examples are given to illustrate that methods for measuring exposure to factors which cause or protect against cancer have developed considerably over the last few years and allow new approaches in cancer epidemiology. The potential links with clinical research are highlighted.
