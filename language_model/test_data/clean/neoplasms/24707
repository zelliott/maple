Some laboratories have reported HTLV-I genome integration in cancer patients diagnosed with neoplasms of cervix and uterus. Usually, cancer patients undergo radiotherapy besides chemotherapy and surgery. It is hypothesized that radiation exposure would induce HTLV-I genome generation/activation, nevertheless there is not any report on experimental procedures trying to demonstrate HTLV-I gene expression in cells exposed to ionizing radiation. Anyway, earlier experimental works by Lieberman and Kaplan in 1959 succeeded to isolate retroviral particles, the radiation leukemia virus (RadLV), from thymic lymphomas of X-ray-irradiated C57BL/Ka mice, assuming that RadLV activated in the host by ionizing radiation, is released and transported to the thymus, where lymphoblasts, generated during the postradiation recovery phase, constitute an optimal target cell population for both replication of and eventual transformation by virus. Recent studies claim that besides RadLV, another retrovirus (RadLV-0) also induced by ionizing radiation is expressed and would be responsible for transformed cells of bone marrow origin. Epidemiological studies coincidentally point out to high incidence of HTLV-I infection in geographic areas displaying significant levels of radioactivity contamination as in Central Africa, Japan Islands and Mururoa Atoll. In our research work, we detected HTLV-I antibodies and viral genome integration in cancer patients of cervix and uterus and health care workers, whose had been exposed to ionizing radiation during radiotherapeutic procedures. Recombinational events among endogenous retrovirus and other retrogenic elements in the host cell genome under the bombardment of ionizing radiation from different sources could have optimized the phenomena occurrence or even ignited them to happen, generating HTLV-I genome, related viral peptides and virions. Therefore, it is feasible that exposure to ionizing radiation during therapeutic procedures could generate HTLV-I genome or induce the virus to be expressed in cells of cancer patients submitted to radiotherapy as also in healthy subjects under the same conditions, in artificial or natural radiation environment.
