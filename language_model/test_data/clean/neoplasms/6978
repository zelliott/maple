The primary objective of this study is to describe cancer mortality rates and trends among Japanese adolescents and young adults aged 15-29 years for the period 1970-2006.

Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated by the direct method using age-specific mortality rates at 5-year age intervals and weights based on the age distribution of the standard world population. The joinpoint regression model was used to describe changes in trends.

For all cancers combined, the mortality rate at age 15-29 years during 2000-2006 was 4.41 (per 100,000 population) for males and 3.81 (per 100,000) for females. Trends of mortality from cancer in Japan were similar to that in other developed countries. A notable exception was cervical cancer, for which Japanese young women showed a significant increase, on average 4.0% per year throughout the period.

This report presents updated figures and trends in cancer mortality among adolescents and young adults aged 15-29 years in Japan and other developed countries. We hope this study will raise public awareness on cancer in this age group and provide the impetus for further research to improve the survival and quality of life of the young people in Japan.
