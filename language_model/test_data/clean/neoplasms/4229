To overcome the need for multiple leukaphereses to collect enough PBPC for autologous transplantation, large-volume leukaphereses (LVL) are used to process multiple blood volumes per session. We compared the efficiency of CD34+ cell collection by LVL (n = 63; median blood volumes processed 11.1) with that of standard-volume leukaphereses (SVL) (n = 38; median blood volumes processed 1.9). To achieve this in patients with different peripheral blood concentrations of CD34+ cells, we analyzed the ratio of CD34+ cells collected per unit of blood volume processed, divided by the number of CD34+ cells in total blood volume at the beginning of apheresis. For LVL, 30% (9%-323%) of circulating CD34+ cells were collected per blood volume compared with 42% (7%-144%) for SVL (p = 0.02). However, in LVL patients, peripheral blood CD34+ cells/L decreased a median of 54% during LVL (similar data for SVL not available). The number of CD34+ cells collected per blood volume processed after 4 and 8 blood volumes and at the end of LVL were 0.32 (0.01-2.05), 0.24 (0.01-1.68), and 0.22 (0.01-2.40) x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg, respectively (p = 0.0007), despite the 54% decrease in peripheral blood CD34+ cells/L throughout LVL. A median 66% decrease in the platelet count was also observed during LVL. Thus, LVL may be more efficient than SVL for PBPC collection, allowing, in most patients, the collection in one LVL of sufficient PBPC to support autologous transplantation.
