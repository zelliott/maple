Mucositis can be the major dose-limiting toxicity during the adminstration of certain types of chemotherapy, especially 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate and doxorubicin. Infection probably plays a role after initial inflammatory changes occurs in the mucous membranes of the mouth after chemotherapy, especially if the patient becomes neutropenic. The issues addressed in this paper following a review of the literature are whether surveillance cultures can be helpful to avoid mucositis or at least predict who will be at risk for its development and whether this will be a help in decisions on the antimicrobial treatment that should be given if mucositis develops. Bacterial, fungal and viral causes of mucositis have been identified. The simplest to deal with is viral, since if herpes simplex is identified it should be treated with acyclovir; in the case of allogeneic bone marrow transplants acyclovir is usually given prophylactically. Fungal organisms almost certainly play a part; especially if a Candida species, particularly Candida tropicalis, is identified in surveillance cultures, it is probably important. The significance of bacterial pathogens in surveillance cultures is more difficult to sort out except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which almost always predicts for eventual systemic infection, especially bacteraemia. The poor overall predictive value (both positive and negative) for surveillance cultures and their significant expense do not support their routine use in 1997.
