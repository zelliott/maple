This small study was carried out to assess the effectiveness of lactulose syrup (Duphalac) in the management of constipation in forty-six patients with terminal illnesses. The daily dose of lactulose was titrated to meet the individual patients requirements and was found to be in the region of 20 to 30 mls twice daily, despite the almost universal administration of opiates as analgesics. The study lasted 21 days in each patient capable of completing the assessment. Constipation was relieved within a an average of 3 to 4 days, and of the 512 days observed, there were 203 days in which a bowel movement occurred. Of these motions 71% were recorded as easy to move, rather than hard (21%)  of loose (8%). Faecal incontinence and nausea attributable to lactulose treatment were extremely rare. Therefore, lactulose appeared to be a useful treatment for constipation in the terminally ill patient.
