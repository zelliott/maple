To describe (1) anticipated health-related quality of life during different strategies for febrile neutropaenia (FN) management and (2) attributes of those preferring inpatient management.

Respondents were parents of children 0-18 years and children 12-18 years receiving cancer treatment. Anticipated health-related quality of life was elicited for four different FN management strategies: entire inpatient, early discharge, outpatient oral and outpatient intravenous (i.v.) therapy. Tools used to measure health-related quality of life were visual analogue scale (VAS), willingness to pay and time trade off.

A total of 155 parents and 43 children participated. For parents, median VAS scores were highest for early discharge (5.9, interquartile range 4.4-7.2) and outpatient i.v. (5.9, interquartile range 4.4-7.3). For children, median scores were highest for early discharge (6.1, interquartile range 4.6-7.2). In contrast, the most commonly preferred strategy for parents and children was inpatient in 55.0% and 37.2%, respectively. Higher current child health-related quality of life was associated with a stronger preference for outpatient management.

Early discharge and outpatient i.v. management are associated with higher anticipated health-related quality of life, although the most commonly preferred strategy was inpatient care. This data may help with determining more cost-effective strategies for paediatric FN.
