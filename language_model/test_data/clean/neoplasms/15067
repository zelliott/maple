The present review updates treatment of neutropenia from articles published from January 2008 through April 2009.

Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia occurs most commonly in the first cycle of treatment. Older patients, patients with multiple comorbidities, and those receiving more myelotoxic drugs are prone to develop neutropenia and its complications. Current guidelines recommend the prophylactic use of the myeloid growth factors for the first cycle of chemotherapy for patients with more than a 20% risk of febrile neutropenia. Meta analysis from randomized trials shows that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis is associated with patients receiving more intensive chemotherapy, having better survival, but also having a higher risk of secondary acute myeloid leukemia. Antibiotics are standard treatment of febrile neutropenia and are increasingly used for prophylaxis in 'low-risk' patients.

The myeloid growth factor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has radically changed our approach to the prevention of febrile neutropenia. Antibiotics remain the mainstay of treatment of febrile neutropenia.
