Advances in the treatment of cancer have resulted in the long survival of patients afflicted with various types of cancers. Many patients, however, still suffer post-treatment sequelae which frequently prevent patients from returning to a normal life style.

The modern techniques of plastic surgery and advance such as musculocutaneous flaps and microsurgical free tissue transfers are introduced.
