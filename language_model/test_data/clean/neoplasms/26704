Ultrasound imaging has evolved as a very useful tool in medical science. However, the technique of ultrasound-guided bone marrow trephine biopsy (BMTB) has not been routinely used by haematologists and oncologists to help locate the posterior iliac crest during the BMTB procedure. We have used the technique of ultrasound-guided BMTB in 20 patients diagnosed with various haematological and non-haematological malignant conditions. We found the technique simple and useful in precisely locating the posterior iliac crest. As a result, it facilitates the extraction of a satisfactory core sample or aspiration biopsy and is more surgically precise than when access to the target bone is based only on external landmarks and blind biopsy.
