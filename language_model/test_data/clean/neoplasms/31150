We experienced fifty cases of HPN (home parenteral nutrition) from January 1987 to May 1994. Using effectively these important data, we attempted to make a database for these fifty cases of HPN. We constructed a database based on Windows 3.1-J and Access 2.0-J produced by Microsoft company. At this time, we introduce a part of the database, which must be completed in terms of input items and simplicity.
