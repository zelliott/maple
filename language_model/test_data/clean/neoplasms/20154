A synthetic opiate agonist-antagonist norphin (buprenorphin) has been studied in 297 cancer patients as an analgetic component of general anesthesia, in postoperative analgesia and in the treatment of chronic pain syndrome. In modified neuroleptanalgesia based on norphin, diazepam, droperidol and N2O the patient is more adequately prevented from surgical trauma than in conventional neuroleptanalgesia based on fentanyl. This is confirmed by greater stability in circulation, metabolism and stress hormone parameters, however this anesthesia technique is less manageable and may be accompanied by prolonged postanesthesia depression of the central nervous system. Good results have been obtained when norphin pills were used sublingually for the treatment of long-lasting intensive chronic pain syndrome in incurable cancer patients. Norphin is no less effective than morphin, however, unlike morphin, it causes no severe adverse reactions.
