Apoptosis, known as programmed cell death, is a conserved, gene-directed mechanism for the elimination of unnecessary or unwanted cells from an organism. A retrospective look at the basis of human disease pathogenesis almost always reveals an apoptotic component that either contributes to disease progression or accounts for it. Modulating the expression of key molecular components of the cell death machinery is an attractive and obvious strategy for apoptosis-based therapeutics. Apoptosis is an important component of most developmental abnormalities and human diseases and in many cases the underlying cause of the resulting pathology. It has also become clear that many, if not all, viruses possess mechanisms to forestall apoptosis and provide a living host to enhance virus propagation. Diseases like AIDS involve excessive apoptosis, and suppression of apoptosis may restore functionality to the infected tissues. Although these are still early days, it is difficult not to get excited about the significant advances that have already been made. The true therapeutic benefits of apoptosis modulation for the treatment of many devastating human diseases remain to be discovered.
