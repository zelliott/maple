Two HLA-A2 restricted epitopes have recently been identified from the broadly expressed tumor antigen survivin, and several vaccination trials in cancer patients based on these survivin-derived peptides have been initiated. Consequently, there is a crucial need for the identification of survivin epitopes restricted to other HLA-molecules in order to extend the proportion of patients that can enter these ongoing clinical trials. In the present study, we characterized 2 survivin-derived epitopes, which are restricted to HLA-B35. Specific T-cell reactivity against these survivin-derived epitopes was found in the peripheral blood from patients with different B-cell malignancies and melanoma. Substitution of the C-terminal anchor residue of the survivin-derived peptides improved the recognition by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from melanoma patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated spontaneous cytotoxic T-cell responses to survivin in a primary melanoma lesion. The characterization of these epitopes allows more patients can be included in the ongoing peptide-based survivin vaccination trials against cancer.
