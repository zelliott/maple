Cancer continues to be a major health problem despite advances in medical technology for its diagnosis and treatment. Hence prevention strategies are needed to decrease the burden of the disease. Of all the environmental factors, dietary components appear to play an important role in the initiation/progression of the disease. Nutrients and non-nutrients in the diet can influence the carcinogenic process at various stages, from initiation to overt manifestation. The National Institute of Nutrition has conducted studies on several aspects of diet-cancer inter-relationships. These include studies on metabolic susceptibility, case-control approach to determine the risk factors and intervention studies to determine the role of nutrients and non-nutrient components on preneoplastic events. Extensive work has been carried out demonstrating the antimutagenic/anticarcinogenic potential of some commonly consumed spices and vegetables such as turmeric, mustard, green leafy and allium species of vegetables. Dietary intervention for cancer prevention is needed to control the disease besides avoiding risk factors such as smoking and alcoholism and exposure to genotoxicants. Public education and awareness about the beneficial effects of consuming a healthy diet including plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits with spices such as turmeric in adequate amounts to prevent cancer are required.
