NKT cells are key players in the regulation of antitumor immunity, particularly in experimental models of tumor immunotherapy, such as IL-12 or alpha-galactosylceramide administration. They may also operate in natural antitumor immunity. NKT cells are best known for their immunosuppressive functions; however, NKT cells interact with a range of other cell types (particularly dendritic cells and NK cells) and the outcome of NKT-cell stimulation depends on these and on the cytokine/co-stimulatory milieu.
