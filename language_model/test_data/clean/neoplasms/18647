The ability of hematopoietic progenitor cells-apheresis (HPC-A) that have been stored for many years after cryopreservation to reconstitute hematopoiesis following high-dose chemo/radiotherapy has not been well-documented.

In this retrospective study, eight Canadian centers contributed data from 53 autologous stem cell transplants (ASCT) performed using HPC-A that had undergone long-term storage (&gt;2 years, range 2-7 years) and 120 ASCT using HPC-A stored for &lt;6 months (short-term storage).

The doses of nucleated and CD34(+) cells per kilogram recipient weight were similar between the short- (mean ± SD, 4.7 ± 4.9 × 10(8) and 6.8 ± 4.3 × 10(6), respectively) and long- (4.0 ± 4.9 × 10(8) and 6.1 ± 3.4 × 10(6), respectively) term storage groups. The median days to neutrophils (absolute neutrophil count; ANC) &gt;0.5 × 10(9)/L (median 11 days for both short- and long-term storage) and platelets &gt;20 × 10(9)/L (median 12 and 11 for short- and long-term storage, respectively) post-ASCT were not significantly different between the two groups. When ASCT performed with &lt;5 × 10(6)/kg CD34(+) cells was compared there was also no difference in ANC or platelet recovery (median 12 days for both after short-term storage, and 12 and 11 days, respectively, after long-term storage). Fourteen HPC-A products stored for &gt;5 years also showed similar count recoveries as the entire long-term storage group (median 11 days for both ANC and platelets).

Cryopreserved HPC-A can be stored for at least 5 years with no apparent loss in their ability to support hematopoietic reconstitution after high-dose chemotherapy.
