Tin oxide nanosheets were crystallized on transparent conductive oxide substrates of fluorine-doped tin oxide in aqueous solutions. The nanosheets had chemical ratio of Sn:O:F = 1:1.85:0.076, suggesting fluorine doping into SnO(2). They were hydrophobic surfaces with contact angle of 140°. They were converted to hydrophilic surfaces with contact angle of below 1° by light irradiation. The simple water process will be applied to surface coating of polymers, metals, biomaterials, papers, etc. Furthermore, the tin oxide nanosheets were modified with dye-labeled monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibody reacts with human alpha-fetoprotein in blood serum of hepatocellular cancer patient. Photoluminescence and photocurrent were obtained from the nanosheets under excitation light. Photoelectric conversion was an essence in the sensing system. The tin oxide nanosheets with dye-labeled prostate specific antigen will be used for electrodes of prostate cancer sensors.
