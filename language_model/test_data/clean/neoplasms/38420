The therapeutic benefits of several existing ultrasound-based therapies such as facilitated drug delivery, tumor ablation and thrombolysis derive largely from physical or mechanical effects. In contrast, ultrasound can also trigger various time-dependent biochemical responses in the exposed biological milieu. Several biological responses to ultrasound exposure have been previously described in the literature but only a handful of these provide therapeutic opportunities. These include the use of ultrasound for healing of soft tissues and bones, the use of ultrasound for inducing non-necrotic tumor atrophy as well as for potentiation of chemotherapeutic drugs, activation of the immune system, angiogenesis and suppression of phagocytosis. A review of these therapeutic opportunities is presented with particular emphasis on their mechanisms. Overall, this review presents the increasing importance of ultrasound's role as a biological sensitizer enabling novel therapeutic strategies.
