Various types of art therapy increasingly gain importance in psycho-oncology. The aim of this article is to determine whether art therapy may help decrease psychological distress and increase coping skills in cancer patients.

An art therapy course for use in psycho-oncological care for outpatients was developed and implemented in a prospective observation study of the Department of Social Medicine,Leipzig University. Participants' levels of psychological distress (HADS) as well as their coping skills (TSK) were quantitatively evaluated before (t1) and after (t2) the intervention.

After completion of the course mean anxiety of the participants(n = 18) had significantly decreased from 11.06 to 9.33 (p &lt; 0.04). On average, however, participants reported more anxiety both before and after the intervention than a representative comparison group of n = 48 cancer patients (anxiety: mean= 5.51). Regarding depression no significant change could be observed after completion of the intervention (t1 = 6.94, t2 =6.22; p &lt; 0.32). Also in relation to the comparison group (mean= 5.24) no significant difference in depression could be detected (t1: p &lt; 0.066, t2: p &lt; 0.519). No significant change in participants' coping skills could be observed.

The level of psychological distress among cancer patients in outpatient care is above average. This underlines the need for psycho-oncological aftercare services. Art therapy interventions can make an important contribution to the psychological well-being of cancer patients.
