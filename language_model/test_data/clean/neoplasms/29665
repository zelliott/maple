PMNs upon stimulation by a chemoattractant adhere to a substratum and then in amoeboid fashion migrate toward the source of the attractant. We have studied molecular events in both adherence and migration and have arrived at the following conclusions: 1) PMNs, like other motile cells such as highly metastatic tumor cells, can use laminin to attach to Type IV basement membrane collagen. PMNs may use this anchoring mechanism in their emigration from the vasculature. 2) Attached cells may be stimulated to migrate as a result of the chemo-attractant-induced inactivation of lipomodulin, a natural inhibitor of phospholipase A2, an enzyme that may be essential for chemotaxis. 3) The substrate for this enzyme is generated by both the CDP-choline and transmethylation pathways. These pathways may be regulated by another enzyme, transglutaminase (TGase). 4) Natural substrates of TGase, such as uteroglobin, inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis, again suggesting a regulatory role for TGase in chemotaxis. 5) Tumor cells also produce inhibitors of chemotaxis. In addition to protecting the tumor from the host's phagocytes, these inhibitors may be related to normal modulators of cell motility. Therefore, determination of their mode of action could increase our understanding of this type of cell behavior.
