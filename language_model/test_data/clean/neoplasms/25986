Anemia is a common complication of myelosuppressive chemotherapy that results in a decreased functional capacity and quality of life (QOL) for cancer patients. Severe anemia is treated with red blood cell transfusions, but mild-to-moderate anemia in patients receiving chemotherapy has traditionally been managed conservatively on the basis of the perception that it was clinically unimportant. This practice has been reflected in the relative inattention to standardized and complete reporting of all degrees of chemotherapy-induced anemia. We undertook a comprehensive review of published chemotherapy trials of the most common single agents and combination chemotherapy regimens, including the new generation of chemotherapeutic agents, used in the treatment of the major nonmyeloid malignancies in adults to characterize and to document the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced anemia. Despite identified limitations in the grading and reporting of treatment-related anemia, the results confirm a relatively high incidence of mild-to-moderate anemia. Recent advances in assessing the relationships of anemia, fatigue, and QOL in cancer patients are providing new insights into these closely related factors. Clinical data are emerging that suggest that mild-to-moderate chemotherapy-induced anemia results in a perceptible reduction in a patient's energy level and QOL. Future research may lead to new classifications of chemotherapy-induced anemia that can guide therapeutic interventions on the basis of outcomes and hemoglobin levels. Perceptions by oncologists and patients that lesser degrees of anemia must be endured without treatment may be overcome as greater emphasis is placed on the QOL of the oncology patient and as research provides further insights into the relationships between hemoglobin levels, patient well-being, and symptoms.
