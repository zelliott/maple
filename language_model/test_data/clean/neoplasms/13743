About five years ago, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) initiated a new program, IARC Handbooks of Cancer Prevention, aimed at evaluating the evidence base for the cancer-preventive activity of various agents and strategies. To date (2001) 5 volumes have been published--1. Non-steroidalAnti-inflammatory Drugs, 2. Carotenoids, 3. Vitamin A, 4. Retinoids, and 5. Sunscreens--and volume 6 (Weight Control and Physical Activity) is in press. Future volumes will include evaluations of breast cancer screening (vol. 7) and fruits and vegetables (vol. 8).
