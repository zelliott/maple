Cysteine cathepsins have been known for a long time to play an important role in cancer progression and metastasis. Several studies have proposed the concept of anti-cathepsin therapy in cancer treatment. On the other hand, cysteine cathepsins have been recently found to play a role in tumour cell death through mediation of apoptosis. The purpose of this mini-review is therefore to provide an insight into the mechanisms by which cysteine cathepsins modulate apoptosis and/or participate in tumour invasion, and to evaluate the impact of these enzymes on both tumour progression and development of potential strategies for cancer treatment.
