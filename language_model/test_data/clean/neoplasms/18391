In vivo luminescent imaging technology was introduced in experimental life science research several years ago and has rapidly gained wide acceptance. By making use of this technology substantially more information can be gained from animal experiments than was previously possible. The concept of the 3Rs describes the aim to Refine, Reduce and Replace animal models in research. The goal of the present paper is to systematically investigate the impact of luminescent imaging on the 3Rs. In particular, three examples of applications are explained in detail so as to be accessible to the reader unfamiliar with the procedure. The examples are subsequently analysed for and categorised according to their concrete effect on animal welfare as defined by the 3Rs.
