The pharmacological treatment of chronic pains induced by an excess of nociception is mainly based on analgesics which are classified according to their pharmacological nature (not opioid/opioid) and to their power according to the three World Health Organization steps. Their use is founded on a strategy which differs from the nature of pain (cancer pain vs no cancer pain), in particular with regard to the use of the strong opioids.
