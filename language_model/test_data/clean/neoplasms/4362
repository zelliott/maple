The data presented from the population-based cancer registry in Harare, Zimbabwe, represent the first information on the incidence of cancer in a population of European origin living in Southern Africa for over 30 years. Their cancer pattern is more or less typical of white populations of high socio-economic status living in Europe or North America, with elevated incidence rates of breast cancer, large-bowel cancer and, in women, lung cancer. However, there are also several unusual features, with extremely high incidence rates of skin cancers, including melanomas, and higher rates of liver and bladder cancer than normally seen in white populations.
