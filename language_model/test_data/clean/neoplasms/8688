The mechanisms associated with the immunoregulation of tumour growth are reviewed. In addition to cytotoxic reactions, the division and differentiation of tumour cells is probably also under the control of antibodies and lymphocytes specific for receptors of humoral growth factors and proliferation inhibitors, for intercellular contact molecules, and also for matrix adhesion receptors.
