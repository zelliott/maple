A method for radio-nuclide labelling of histo-acryl/lipiodol with 133Xe gas is described. The method consists of dissolving the gas in lipiodol under sterile conditions. After embolization and angiography, the localisation of the embolizing material can be determined by means of a scintillation camera. The labelling method was used in 15 patients. In all patients the position of the embolizing material, as demonstrated by scintigraphy, corresponded with the radiological findings. It was not possible to demonstrate escape of the material by scintigraphy.
