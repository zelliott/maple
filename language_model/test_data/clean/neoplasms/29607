To find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of OSI-461 in combination with mitoxantrone in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This was a Phase I study using cohort dose escalation of OSI-461 dosed orally twice daily in combination with mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) given on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.

OSI-461 dose was escalated to 1,000 mg po bid. One patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Three patients discontinued the study due to adverse events (AE). Two patients (10%) had a partial response, and ten patients (50%) had stable disease as best response.

The combination of OSI-461 and mitoxantrone was well tolerated. Dose escalation was stopped because of toxicities in a concurrent Phase I trial. The response rate seen in patients with prostate cancer was comparable to response rates seen in trials of mitoxantrone and prednisone alone, and further studies of the combination of OSI-461 and mitoxantrone were not pursued.
