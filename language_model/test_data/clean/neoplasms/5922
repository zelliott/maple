In order to analyze the economics of home care, we calculated the revenue and expenditures of both hospitalization and home care in a private hospital. The home care expenses were about 44.7% of the institutional care expenses. It became clear that home care saved medical expenses. The expenses of patients were about 33.7% less with home care. In conclusion, home care may be favorable medical care if some problems are solved. The home care expenses of a cancer patient on the institutional side were about 3.4 times more that those of a patient with other diseases. If we support home care of cancer patients alone, it would be an excessive burden on them, because patients are too few at present to organize and keep a team. As a private hospital, we support home care regardless of disease. However, medical economic expenses as a total turned out to be about 17% short of the necessary expenses.
