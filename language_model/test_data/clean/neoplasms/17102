Genomic abnormalities may accumulate in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) during in vitro maintenance. Characterization of the mechanisms enabling survival and expansion of abnormal hESCs is important due to consequences of genetic changes for the therapeutic utilization of stem cells. Furthermore, these cells provide an excellent model to study transformation in vitro. We report here that the histone deacetylase proteins, HDAC1 and HDAC2, are increased in karyotypically abnormal hESCs when compared to their normal counterparts. Importantly, similar to many cancer cell lines, we found that HDAC inhibitors repress proliferation of the karyotypically abnormal hESCs, whereas normal cells are more resistant to the treatment. The decreased proliferation correlates with downregulation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 proteins, induction of the proliferation inhibitor, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), and altered regulation of tumor suppressor protein Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Through genome-wide transcriptome analysis we have identified genes with altered expression and responsiveness to HDAC inhibition in abnormal cells. Most of these genes are linked to severe developmental and neurological diseases and cancers. Our results highlight the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of genomic stability of hESCs, and provide valuable candidates for targeted and selective growth inhibition of karyotypically abnormal cells.
