Faced with scientific progress, social security must be concerned by ethics, especially by protection of personal integrity. Financial necessities lead to take into account the efficiency of public health interventions. But in front of potentially toxic drug, are we allowed to compare possible advantages with potentially serious risks for healthy women? For these reasons, social security takes a stand in favour of carefully controlled trials, focused on restricted target populations which are estimated at high risk of cancer. Research of side effects should be included in the follow of the patients and special caution should be taken to avoid premature spreading of this behaviour. About a financial contribution of social security, the National fund for health prevention, education and information (FNPEIS) could perhaps not support such a project, regarding to his experimental nature. CNAMTS-INSERM research contracts could be an alternative.
