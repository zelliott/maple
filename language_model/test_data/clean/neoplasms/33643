The incidence of malignant neoplasma was determined in patients with multiple sclerosis in epidemiological studies in 717 patients. No significant difference was found from the general population aged over 15 years. This seems to suggest that immunosuppression resulting from corticotherapy has no effect increasing the risk of malignant neoplasm development in multiple sclerosis.
