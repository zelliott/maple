Lymphophagocytosis by nonlymphoreticular neoplasms has been observed. Twenty cancer patients having either adenocarcinoma or epidermoid carcinoma were the subjects of our study. Malignant cells were found to phagocytize autologous lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and red blood cells (RBCs). Papanicolaou smears from cancer patients revealed that 30% (6/20) of the patients had phagocytic malignant cells in situ, the mean phagocytosis for this group was 3.7%. Different cellular elements showed differences in their susceptibility towards phagocytic activity of tumor cells: 2.6% for lymphocytes, 0.7% for PMNs and 0.4% for RBCs. The patients having phagocytic malignant cells showed complete absence of monocytes in their peripheral blood. In contrast, other patients had peripheral blood monocyte percentages within the limits of control values (7.2). However, there was no correlation between development of phagocytic activity of malignant cells and age and sex of patients or type of tumor. This study further confirms that phagocytic activity of nonlymphoreticular neoplasms is a general phenomenon which can be directed against erythroid elements. In addition, we have demonstrated that these tumor cells also phagocytize autologous leukocytes.
