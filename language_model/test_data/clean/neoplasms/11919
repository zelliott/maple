Actual HL-A typing has been performed on 115 members of cancer family N, a large kindred (over 1000 members ascertained) showing the findings consistent with the cancer family syndrome. In the cancer-prone line (branches C and D) of the family, 20 of 21 members with cancer had one HL-A haplotype, HL-A2-HL-A12 (relative odds = 6.30), including some decreased family members who had haplotypes assigned. Eleven of 12 family members with cancer in branches C and D, actually typed, had HL-A2-HL-A12 (relative odds = 6.06). The single exception showing cancer and another haplotype in branch D is a child of a family member with haplotype HL-A2-HL-A12.
