Deaths prior to or shortly after the diagnosis of childhood cancer may reflect inadequacies in detection and appropriate referral for care. This study was performed to determine the extent of and factors associated with early death in childhood cancer.

Patients with of primary cancer, aged &lt;20 years at diagnosis, were identified from the SEER data (n = 23,470) from 1973 to 1995. Early deaths were defined as cases identified by 1) death certificate, 2) autopsy report, or 3) death within 1 month of initial diagnoses (n = 481). Cause of death was determined by ICD-8 and -9 codes. Age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, morphology, site of disease, race, and gender were evaluated for association with early death.

Age &lt;1 year at diagnosis (6.2% early deaths), being diagnosed earlier in the observation period, and a diagnosis of a brain tumor, neuroblastoma, leukemia, or liver tumor were associated with increased early death. Gender and race were not associated with early death. Among the cases for whom the malignant diagnosis was made at the time of death (n = 119), the cause of death was nonmalignant for 36. For 22 of these cases the malignancy was an incidental finding and appeared not to contribute directly to the cause of death. Among these patients, 11 had neuroblastoma, 9 being &lt;1 year of age.

A decrease in the proportion of early deaths associated with childhood cancer has occurred during the past 2 decades. This decrease may reflect earlier diagnosis or improved imaging capabilities, surgical techniques, medical therapy, and supportive care. Awareness among pediatricians, general practitioners, and emergency physicians is warranted, with a focus on high-risk groups for early detection among childhood cancer patients.
