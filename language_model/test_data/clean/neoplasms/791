Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) exhibit a unique phenomenon, known as surface plasmon resonance, which is responsible for their large absorption and scattering cross-sections, which are four to five orders of magnitude larger than those of conventional dyes. In addition, their optical properties can be controlled by varying their sizes, shapes and compositions. AuNPs can be easily synthesized and functionalized with different biomolecules including oligonucleotides. Numerous methods have been utilized for detecting AuNPs such as colorimetric, scanometric, fluorescence, surface-enhanced Raman scattering and electrochemical techniques. These unique aspects have permitted the development of novel AuNP-based assays for molecular diagnostics which promise increased sensitivity and specificity, multiplexing capability, and short turnaround times. AuNP-based colorimetric assays in particular show great potential in point-of-care testing assays. This review discusses properties of AuNPs and their utilization for the development of novel molecular assays.
