Most children with cancer are immunocompromised during therapy and for a variable period after completion of therapy. They are at an increased risk of infections, including vaccine-preventable infections. There is a reduction in immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases after completion of standard-dose chemotherapy and after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. It is important to protect these children against vaccine-preventable diseases by reimmunization.
