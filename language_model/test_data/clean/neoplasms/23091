Nine patients suffered from intractable pain that was not relieved by analgesic medication. All had cancer of the stomach or pancreas. The coeliac plexus was approached from the back, two long Teflon catheters being directed onto the appropriate ganglia under x-ray control. When the catheters were correctly positioned, under continuous aspiration we administered via each catheter 25 ml of Xylocaine 0.5-0.8%. The successful and uneventful trial was followed with injection of an equal volume of 25 ml 50% alcohol through each catheter on the next day. In eight patients pain ceased completely while the ninth presented a 50% improvement. In the last five patients alcohol was injected 2 to 3 hours after the injection of the local anesthetic. We had a postspinal headache from accidental puncture of the dura mater, and a mild toxic reaction to Xylocaine. Also three patients presented hypotension after the Xylocaine was administered.
