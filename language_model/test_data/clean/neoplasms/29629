A wide variety of imaging approaches have been developed in the past few decades for monitoring tumor oxygenation and hypoxia in vivo. In particular, nuclear medicine has seen the development of several radiolabeled hypoxia markers and is the preferred method for imaging of tumor hypoxia. Hypoxia imaging is increasingly being used in the clinical setting and is progressing from a mere detection method to application in individualization of chemoradiotherapy.
