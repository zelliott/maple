One hundred sixty Mongolian gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus, were examined for the presence of naturally occurring lesions. The first recognized cases of cecal adenocarcinoma, testicular teratoma, and sebaceous gland pad carcinoma were found. Neoplasms previously reported from the gerbil and also seen in the present study included ovarian theca lutein and granulosa lutein cell tumors, sebaceous gland pad adenoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and renal and splenic hemangiomas. Calcinosis cutis was also observed in two male gerbils.
