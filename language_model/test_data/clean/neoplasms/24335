Several targeted agents are now available for clinical use. Their mechanisms of action are more specific against tumor cells than traditional cytotoxics. Monotherapy regimens based on targeted agents tend to be better tolerated than chemotherapy, and most combination regimens with targeted agents have proven feasible. Their availability has greatly expanded cancer treatment options, especially for chemorefractory patients.

Nurses involved in the care of patients with cancer can benefit from an increased understanding of targeted therapies, including their mechanisms of action, their efficacy profile, as well as prophylaxis and management of adverse events and administration procedures.
