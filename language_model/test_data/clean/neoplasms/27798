The AACE Cancer Education Survey-II offers an unusual opportunity based on data from 125 medical schools and 1,035 experienced cancer educators to effect constructive change with regard to cancer education. The changes suggested include more coordination; integration; and a shift of emphasis to include more on topics of prevention, early diagnosis, tumor biology, rehabilitation, palliative care, and psychosocial issues. Ample opportunities, especially in the ambulatory care arena, exist at most medical schools, and there is a great deal of interest in improving the situation. This article reviews the factors contributing to resistance to change, the data on adult learning, and the major movements and dilemmas facing medical education today. It also discusses some of the external forces like the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) and foundation support, which are being harnessed to effect change. Given these barriers, forces, and opportunities, the article ends with a possible action plan for an individual, an institution, and national bodies interested in cancer education. The knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes must be defined, taught effectively, and evaluated. It is an opportune time, armed with this useful data, to bring about change in how cancer subjects are taught. The ultimate goal is more knowledgeable and effective practitioners and scientists who can decrease the morbidity and mortality from cancer.
