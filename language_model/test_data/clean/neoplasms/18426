Cell fusion plays an essential role in fertilization, formation of placenta, bone and muscle tissues, immune response, tissue repair, and regeneration. Increasing recognition of cell fusion in somatic cell dynamics has revitalized the century-old hypothesis that cell fusion may contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. In this review, we discuss findings from experimental and clinical studies that suggest a potentially multifaceted involvement of cell fusion in different stages of tumor progression, including aneuploidy and tumor initiation, origin of cancer stem cells, multidrug resistance, and the acquisition and diversification of metastatic abilities.
