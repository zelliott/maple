A method of enhancing contrast in fluorescence imaging has been devised, based on real-time digital subtraction of a background video image from a signal-plus-background video image. Color filters are used to differentiate signal from background. The technique has been applied to detection of small tumors labeled with the tumor specific fluorescent drug hematoporphyrin derivative.
