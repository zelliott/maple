The multistage model is tested on several human and animal data sets. It fits in some cases but not in others. With human lung cancer data, there is a drop in risk for ex-smokers quite different from the predictions of the model. The results are not conclusive but are compatible with the view that the multistage model provides a family of curves that often fit cancer incidence data, but may not capture the underlying biological reality.
