An elective cancer education course at a public university attracted twice as many women as men. Course information was disseminated to an average of eight people by each student. The course seemed reasonably effective in stimulating positive behavioral changes. According to self-report, dietary fat was reduced by 47 per cent of women and 49 per cent of men. Fiber intake was increased by 48 per cent of women and 36 per cent of men. Breast self-examination was initiated by 36 per cent of previous nonperformers: and testicular self-examination, by 23 per cent.
