The relationship of potentially lethal damage repair (PLDR) to clinical radiotherapy has not been studied in great detail. We have therefore examined the cellular and molecular basis of PLDR in bacterial, animal and human tumor systems and attempted to relate laboratory data to clinical fractionation schemes. We also have examined how the repair of potentially lethal damage may alter the therapeutic ratio by altering tumor radiocurability and normal tissue tolerance.
