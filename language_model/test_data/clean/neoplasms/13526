Peritoneovenous shunt placement has been reported as a treatment of refractory ascites by general surgeons, but without a clearly established role. The authors successfully inserted shunts under ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic guidance in 12 patients who had symptomatic refractory ascites (nine men, three women; mean maintenance duration, 88.5 d). Nine patients had advanced liver cirrhosis (five with superimposed hepatoma). Other patients had stomach cancer, colon cancer, and complicated polycystic kidney disease. The mortality rate was 83%. Causes of death included bleeding from preexisting varices, sepsis, hepatic failure, rupture of hepatoma, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The authors describe the feasibility, technical details, and short-term results of percutaneous peritoneovenous shunt placement.
