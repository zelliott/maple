Photodynamic therapy (PDT) provides an effective option for treatment of tumors and other diseases in superficial tissues and attracts attention for in vitro study with cells. In this study, we present a significantly improved model of in vitro cell killing through Type-II PDT for simulation of the molecular interactions and cell killing in time domain in the presence of oxygen transport within a spherical cell. The self-consistency of the approach is examined by determination of conditions for obtaining positive definitive solutions of molecular concentrations. Decay constants of photosensitizers and unoxidized receptors are extracted as the key indices of molecular kinetics with different oxygen diffusion constants and permeability at the cell membrane. By coupling the molecular kinetics to cell killing, we develop a modeling method of PDT cytotoxicity caused by singlet oxygen and obtain the cell survival ratio as a function of light fluence or initial photosensitizer concentration with different photon density or irradiance of incident light and other parameters of oxygen transport. The results show that the present model of Type-II PDT yields a powerful tool to quantitate various events underlying PDT at the molecular and cellular levels and to interpret experimental results of in vitro cell studies.
