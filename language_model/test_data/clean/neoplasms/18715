The authors present an analysis of specific features of transfusions of erythrocyte containing media in oncological patients. Special attention was given to necessary selection of donor erythrocytes in performing operations with massive intraoperative blood loss. It considerably contributes to a decreased number of posttransfusional reactions and complications. For the recent five years transfusions of erythrocyte containing media to more than 15 thousand patients with surgical treatment were analyzed. Among them the individual selection of donor blood was fulfilled in 2047 cases. Compatible erythrocytes could not be selected in five cases only. In these patients infusions of Perftoran were used as an oxygen carrier both during operation and at the postoperative period.
