Direct injection of naked plasmid DNA either intramuscularly or intradermally induces strong, long-lived cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to the antigen encoded by the gene vaccine. In the present study, we used gene vaccination with naked plasmid DNA to induce prophylactic immune responses to tumor associated antigens. MAGE-1 (melanoma antigen 1) is an ideal candidate for cancer vaccines because it belongs to a family of genes that are expressed in a number of human tumors of various histological types but not in normal adult tissues except for the testis, and because both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against MAGE-1 antigen were detected in tumor patients. Intradermal administration of plasmid DNA encoding MAGE-1 (pcMAGE1) induced anti-MAGE-1-specific antibody in BALB/c mice. In contrast, no detectable level of anti-MAGE-1 antibody was induced by intramuscular injection of pcMAGE1. Also, intradermal injection of pcMAGE1 was capable of generating CTLs reactive with MAGE-1-transfected murine tumor cells, M-MSV-MAGE1. Most of the mice (8 out of 10) immunized with pcMAGE1 rejected the challenge of M-MSV-MAGE1 tumor cells, compared with control animals most of which developed tumors. This suggests that intradermal DNA vaccination could provide a novel immunotherapy of cancer.
