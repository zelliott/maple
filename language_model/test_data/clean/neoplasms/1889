Immunohistochemical technique is now successfully applied to the cytologic materials. This review article describes details of staining procedures for immunocytochemistry at both light and electron microscopic levels. The clinical application of the technique includes aspiration biopsy cytology for breast lesions, thyroid lesions, lymph nodes, the nervous system, and others. The establishment of carcinoma cells in the body fluid by the demonstration of carcinoembyronic antigen (CEA) and the establishment of specific diagnoses in small-cell or large-cell anaplastic tumors by immunocytochemistry warrants special emphasis.
