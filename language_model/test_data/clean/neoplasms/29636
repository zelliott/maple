We established our bio-repository in October 2002. One of the unique aspects of our bio-repository is that it is based on post-clinical test samples. Although the post-clinical test sample-based storage is beneficial because ample clinical information is available for each sample and samples are to be refreshed regularly, many bio-bankers are hesitant to store them because of the possible problems of de-identification procedures and sample quality. Currently, we have two different types of sample, not de-identified status and de-identified status. Most of the samples for storage are not de-identified status. A portion of the samples are transferred to new tubes before and after being frozen, without clinical patient identifications and the status is de-identified. This tube transfer is the only de-identification procedure in our bio-repository so far. After a procedure of de-identification, these samples are stored. The de-identified samples are collected under various project-based schemes. The quality standards of our samples are established by two factors: pre-analytical quality control efforts, and record keeping of sample history by sample tracking system. All the samples have been phlebotomized under strict control of pre-analytical requirements. By record keeping of sample history with the sample tracking system, we can tell the exact temperature and elapsed time in various situations since the phlebotomy procedure or on arrival at the clinical laboratory. In this article, we will disclose how we have dealt with the de-identification procedure and sample quality.
