In the last fifteen years the role of cytokines in the modulation of anti-tumor responses has been extensively studied at the Institute of Microbiology of the University of Turin. In retrospect many observations appear to have been quite innovative and original. Altogether they form the steps of a consequential intellectual endeavour leading progressively towards a precise definition of the role of the lymphokines in modulating the immune response to neoplasia. Starting from the characterization of the tumor signals required for lymphokine induction, this research progressed towards the definition of the cellular, molecular and genetic mechanisms involved, and provisionally ends with the direct manipulation of lymphokine genes transfected to tumor cells.
