A phase I study of carboplatin (CBDCA) was performed in 40 children with advanced cancer. A single course of CBDCA consisted of 4 weekly 1-hour infusions followed by a 2-week rest. The starting dose of 100 mg/m2/week was 66% of the maximum tolerated dose in adults. Escalated dose levels given were: 125, 150, 175, and 210 mg/m2. Myelosuppression was dose limiting, with thrombocytopenia more pronounced than leukopenia. There was no evidence of cumulative toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose for children with solid tumors was 210 mg/m2/week X 4. Other side effects included transient nausea and vomiting at the higher dose levels and non-dose-related, reversible changes in creatinine clearance. One patient developed hives. No hepatic toxicity was seen. Among the 28 evaluable patients with solid tumors, one of ten with osteogenic sarcoma had complete disappearance of a lung nodule for 15+ months. Two of four patients with medulloblastoma had partial responses by clinical and computerized tomographic scan for 4 and 10 months. All three responders had received prior cisplatin therapy. CBDCA has major advantages over cisplatin in terms of reduced toxicity. Responses observed in patients previously treated with cisplatin are encouraging. The recommended phase II dose for children with solid tumors is 175 mg/m2/week X 4 with a 2-week rest.
