This paper systematically reviews the published economic research upon cancer genetics services for families at risk of having familial breast, ovarian or colorectal cancer. A structured search was made of 15 electronic databases. The search identified 1030 papers, of which 31 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, two were cost-benefit studies, five were cost consequences, four were cost-effectiveness studies, one was a cost analysis, two were cost-minimisation studies, one was a cost-utility study, 10 modelled life years and six were reviews. Modelling studies indicate that surveillance, prophylactic and chemoprevention techniques extend survival for carriers of identified mutations. Genetic testing has been estimated to cost 70-2400 USD [48-1591 UK pounds] and genetic counselling 129-800 USD [89-551 UK pounds]. The technology of genetic testing has been found to be cost effective. Cost effectiveness was particularly influenced by targeting genetic services for patients with a strong family history of cancer rather than screening the entire population. Future economic evaluation must go beyond merely assessing health outcomes and mutation identification, and account for the impact of genetic services upon the individual, the family and society, establish the value of services to these groups and determine the most effective ways of delivering genetic services.
