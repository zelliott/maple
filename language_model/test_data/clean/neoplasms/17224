Major progress has been made in recent years in the development of Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitors for the treatment of patients with cancer. Promising clinical trial results have been obtained in cancers that harbor activating mutations of the Hh pathway, such as basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. However, for many cancers, in which Hh ligand overexpression is thought to drive tumor growth, results have been disappointing. Here we review the preclinical data that continue to shape our understanding of the Hh pathway in tumorigenesis and the emerging clinical experience with smoothened inhibitors.
