Cancer in the family may affect the psycho-social adjustment of the children involved. Children who have survived childhood cancer or with a parent or sibling with cancer, may find protection from the risk of emotional and behavioural difficulties from effective external support systems. A training course was developed by the Cancer Research Campaign to help professionals who make up potential external support systems, cope with children experiencing cancer-related life crises. The course was offered to, and evaluated with, practising teachers, student teachers and Cancer Aid and Listening Line workers. Results from interviews and pre and post course questionnaires indicated that after the course all three groups felt more confident in dealing with children under stress. Participants felt that specific skills such as 'attentive listening' had increased as a result of the course. Of the three groups the practising teachers have found the course the most useful in their work and have been able to disseminate their newly acquired skills throughout their schools. Teachers are expected to cope with students' various life crises as they arise in schools. Basic counselling skills training for teachers could help them cope with these in a more confident manner, thereby reducing the risk of emotional and behavioural difficulties and contributing towards a Health Promoting School ethos.
