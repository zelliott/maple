Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may be performed with many different treatment delivery techniques. This article summarizes the clinical use and optimization of multisegment IMRT plans that have been used to treat more than 350 patients with IMRT over the last 4.5 years. More than 475 separate clinical IMRT plans are reviewed, including treatments of brain, head and neck, thorax, breast and chest wall, abdomen, pelvis, prostate, and other sites. Clinical planning, plan optimization, and treatment delivery are summarized, including efforts to minimize the number of additional intensity-modulated segments needed for particular planning protocols. Interactive and automated optimization of segmental and full IMRT approaches are illustrated, and automation of the segmental IMRT planning process is discussed.
