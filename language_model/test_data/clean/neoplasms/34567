In this paper we summarized the current knowledge about the new mechanism of immunosuppression in cancer i.e. the lately discovered myeloid-derived suppresor cells (MDSC). MDSC are produced in bone marrow under the influence of tumor cell derived substances. MDSC show negative effect on T lymphocytes function through arginine depletion and nitric oxide production. In mice MDSC are characterized by Gr-1 and CD11b expression, however in human there are no definitive markers of this subpopulation. Some laboratory experiments in turning back the negative influence of MDSC on immunological system are provided, mainly through the administration of monoclonal antibodies against MDSC or drugs which block their function. The elucidation of MDSC characteristics can allow us to build new immunotherapeutic protocols in the future.
