Multidrug resistance describes a complex phenotype whose predominant feature is resistance to a wide range of structurally unrelated cytotoxic compounds, many of which are anticancer agents. This phenotype occurs frequently in mammalian cell lines and transplantable tumours selected for resistance to a single drug. Reduced cellular accumulation of the drugs involved appears to account for the resistance. This may be a consequence of reduced drug influx, increased drug efflux, or both. A wide variety of biochemical changes have been identified in multidrug resistant cell lines, the most consistent of which is the increased expression of P-glycoprotein, a conserved, high molecular weight, plasma membrane glycoprotein. The level of P-glycoprotein expression correlates with the degree of drug resistance in a variety of different cell types. In a number of multidrug resistant cell lines, overexpression of P-glycoprotein results from gene amplification. While the function of P-glycoprotein is unknown, independent lines of evidence support the notion that P-glycoprotein is the causative molecule mediating the multidrug resistance phenotype. Significant levels of P-glycoprotein expression have been detected in some biopsy specimens from patients with ovarian and sarcoma tumours. These findings suggest that multidrug resistant tumour cells can occur in human malignancies. The presence of such cells may affect the outcome of chemotherapy.
