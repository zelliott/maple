In this report, we describe a fast and accurate capillary electrophoresis, PCR-based method for detecting loss of allelic heterozygosity in solid tumor samples. This automated method requires small sample sizes, and data can be obtained in less than 15 min. The method is particularly powerful for uncovering deletions in tumor sample preparations containing significant normal tissue contamination.
