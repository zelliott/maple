A predisposition to developing immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has not been reported in survivors of childhood cancer. We report a case series of childhood cancer survivors who developed an isolated thrombocytopenia in the presence of a normocellular bone marrow. Five children, two with endodermal sinus tumors and three with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, developed ITP at a median of 4 years (range: 0.2-8 years) after completion of therapy. We suggest the association of ITP in survivors of childhood malignancy may not be co-incidental as chemotherapy may cause persistent immune dysfunction.
