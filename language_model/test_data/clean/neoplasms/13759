Structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations have been considered important biological end points in genotoxic studies. Conventional solid staining (such as Giemsa) has been employed to evaluate the frequencies ofinduced chromosomal aberrations following exposure to chemical or physical agents. Recently, molecular cytogenetic techniques that have become available, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using chromosome-specific or chromosomal regions-specific DNA libraries, have increased the resolution of detection of aberrations. The present paper reviews briefly the results obtained from basic and applied studies using the FISH technique.
