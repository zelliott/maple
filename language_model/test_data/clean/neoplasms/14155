Plants produce a remarkable amount of low molecular mass natural products endowed with a large array of pivotal biological activities. Among these molecules, resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) has been identified as an important modulator of cell phenotype with a complex and pleiotropic mode of action. Extensive literature regarding its activity, mainly employing cellular models, suggests that this polyphenol controls cell proliferation, induces differentiation, and activates apoptosis and autophagy. The compound also modulates angiogenesis and inflammation. Similarly, studies on implanted cancers and chemical-induced tumors confirm the potential chemotherapeutical interest of the compound. Likewise, several reports clearly demonstrated, in animal models, that the compound might positively affect the development and evolution of chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes, obesity, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and neurogenerative pathologies. Finally, a number of investigations stated that the toxicity of the molecule is scarce. Despite these promising observations, few clinical trials have yet been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the molecule both in prevention and treatment of human chronic disease. Preliminary findings therefore suggest the need for more extensive clinical investigations.
