This correlational and descriptive research examined the Quality of the Dying Process (QDP) in cancer patients. Data were collected from one significant person for each of the 78 patients who had died, using QDP and communication quality questionnaires. The highest QDP scores were found for social experiences related to: the moment of death, family company and their concern with the person. The lowest score was for symptoms. A statistically significant association (p&lt;0.001) was found between a better QDP and: preparation for death, spending time with the family, concern and care for the patient, communication quality.

patient care needs to be focused on the aspects fostering closeness and dialogue with the patient's close relatives, promoting communication in order to detect and handle the real problems, along with efficient pain management, in which humanized care is essential.
