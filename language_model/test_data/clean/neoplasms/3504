Since the biology, pharmacology and toxicology of pediatric cancer is so different from cancer in adults, it is impossible to extrapolate from adult cancer experience; however, conducting studies in children with cancer is ethically and clinically very complex. This is especially so in phase 1 trials, aimed at dose finding for new modalities, where the chances to cure the child who failed standard therapy are marginal to non-existent. Hence, the child may be exposed to risks and discomfort which may be unbalanced by potential benefits. This situation, which is difficult for consenting adults, is much more complex when a parent gives proxy consent. This review addresses the ethical and clinical framework of such studies in the most vulnerable of children.
