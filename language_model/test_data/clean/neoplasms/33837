The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of dexamethasone (DEX) pretreatment on antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics of the cancer chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin and gemcitabine.

Antitumor activities of carboplatin and gemcitabine with or without DEX pretreatment were determined in six murine-human cancer xenograft models, including cancers of colon (LS174T), lung (A549 and H1299), and breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468) and glioma (U87-MG). Effects of DEX on plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics of carboplatin and gemcitabine were also determined by using the LS174T, A549, and H1299 models.

Although DEX alone showed minimal antitumor activity, DEX pretreatment significantly increased the efficacy of carboplatin, gemcitabine, or a combination of both drugs by 2-4-fold in all xenograft models tested. Without DEX treatment, the tumor exposure to carboplatin, measured by the area under the curve, was markedly lower than normal tissues. However, DEX pretreatment significantly increased tumor carboplatin levels, including 200% increase in area under the curve, 100% increase in maximum concentration, and 160% decrease in clearance. DEX pretreatment similarly increased gemcitabine uptake in tumors.

To our knowledge, this is the first report that DEX significantly enhances the antitumor activity of carboplatin and gemcitabine and increases their accumulation in tumors. These results provide a basis for further evaluation of DEX as a chemosensitizer in patients.
