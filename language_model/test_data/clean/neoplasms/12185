Resistance to, the hydrophilic drug ara-C, might be meditated by decreased membrane transport. Lipophilic prodrugs were synthesized to facilitate uptake. These compounds were equally active as ara-C, while the compounds with the shortest fatty-acid group and highest number of double bonds were the more active. These compounds also show a better retention profile, their effect is retained longer than for ara-C.
