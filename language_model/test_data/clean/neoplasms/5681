The colony formation in agar of human tumour xenografts was used as a test system to study the cytostatic activity of ethyldeshydroxy-sparsomycin (EdSm) at the cellular level. EdSm was additionally studied in vivo in human tumour xenografts and murine tumour models. EdSm showed a clear dose-response effect in vitro. At continuous exposure with 0.01 micrograms/ml, 2 out of 11 of the tumours responded (a gastric and a small cell lung carcinoma). At 0.1 mu/ml EdSm, the tumour response was 5/11 tumours and at 1 microgram/ml the compound was active in all tumours. The maximal tolerable doses of EdSm in vivo have been determined in non-tumour bearing CDF1 mice. In the intraperitoneally (i.p.) given multiple dose schedules the respective LD10 doses indicated that the tolerable cumulative dose increases when lower doses are given more frequently. This also enhances the antitumour activity in L1210 leukaemia to 172% T/C. On the other hand, continuous infusion strongly diminished the tolerable dose as well as the antitumour activity. EdSm was also active against i.p. inoculated P388 leukaemia (150% T/C), B16 melanoma (156% T/C), and RC carcinoma (197% T/C), and the subcutaneously (s.c.) inoculated L1210 (139% T/C) and RC (138% T/C). Absence of tumour responses was found in the following s.c. implanted murine tumours: M5076 sarcoma, osteosarcomas C22LR and CP369, and the LL carcinoma, as well as in the human tumour xenografts: LXFG 529, a non-small cell lung carcinoma; GXF 251, a gastric carcinoma; and FMa, an ovary carcinoma. Possible long-range retinotoxic effects of EdSm were investigated in tumour-bearing mice, cured after surviving treatment with LD50 doses of EdSm, by assaying the protein biosynthetic capacity of the retinal by assaying the ocular rhodopsin and opsin levels as parameters. In none of these cases could a significant reduction in either opsin or rhodopsin levels be measured and no changes were seen histologically.
