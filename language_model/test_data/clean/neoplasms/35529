Saponins are well recognised as potent immune stimulators, but their applicability as vaccine adjuvants have been limited due to associated toxicity. Formulation of saponin adjuvant with cholesterol and phospholipid produces the particulate ISCOMATRIX adjuvant, and when antigen is also contained within the particle, an ISCOM vaccine is produced. These particulate vaccines retain the adjuvant activity of the saponin component but without toxicity. Saponin-adjuvanted particulate vaccines have significant potential as a novel strategy in vaccine development. This review discusses (i) recent methodologies which have attempted to increase the flexibility and applicability of this technology by modifying either the vaccine composition or the mode of formulation; (ii) recent evaluations of these technologies for inducing protection against infectious diseases and as cancer immunotherapeutics.
