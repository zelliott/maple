A computerized 24-h diet recall interview program (EPIC-SOFT) was developed for use in a large European multi-center study, namely the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). This program, which was adapted for each participating country and translated into nine languages, was developed to standardize interviews between the 22 EPIC centers. Common rules were pre-entered into the system to describe, quantify and probe approximately 1500-2200 foods and 150-350 recipes. Common methods used to classify and export the EPIC-SOFT dietary data facilitate their exchange, comparison and analysis. So far, EPIC-SOFT is the only available computerized 24-h diet recall system developed to provide comparable food consumption data between several European countries.
