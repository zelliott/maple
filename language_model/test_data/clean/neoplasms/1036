Positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) is emerging as a valuable tool for assessing a wide variety of pediatric malignancies, including lymphomas, soft-tissue tumors, and bone sarcomas. PET-CT may provide information that is not apparent on conventional imaging performed to stage these diseases and monitor their response to treatment. The use of PET-CT in children requires an awareness of the technical and logistical issues unique to this patient population. In addition, interpretation of pediatric PET-CT imaging requires familiarity with aspects of pediatric anatomy and physiology that differ from those of adults. In this article, the technical considerations in performing pediatric PET-CT, pitfalls in the diagnostic use of PET-CT in children, and current and emerging applications of PET-CT in pediatric oncology are reviewed.
