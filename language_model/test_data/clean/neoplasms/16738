The incidence and mortality rates of all cancers in Louisiana are among the highest in the nation. Cancer control measures must be instituted in order to have an impact on the reduction in cancer deaths which amounted to 8,120 in 1987. Cancer prevention and early detection by means of changes in lifestyles are among the highest priorities of the Louisiana Cancer Consortium. The Consortium is a nonprofit corporation, established by the LSU Medical Centers in New Orleans and Shreveport, Tulane Medical Center and School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Ochsner Medical Foundation, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. The goal of the Consortium is to plan, develop, and implement cancer control programs focusing on tobacco education, health promotion at the worksite, cancer education, early detection, and reduction of exposure to carcinogenic substances.
