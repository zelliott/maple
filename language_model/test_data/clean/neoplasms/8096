Telomeres play a vital role in protecting the ends of chromosomes and preventing chromosome fusion. The failure of cancer cells to properly maintain telomeres can be an important source of the chromosome instability involved in cancer cell progression. Telomere loss results in sister chromatid fusion and prolonged breakage/fusion/bridge (B/F/B) cycles, leading to extensive DNA amplification and large deletions. These B/F/B cycles end primarily when the unstable chromosome acquires a new telomere by translocation of the ends of other chromosomes. Many of these translocations are nonreciprocal, resulting in the loss of the telomere from the donor chromosome, providing a mechanism for transfer of instability from one chromosome to another until a chromosome acquires a telomere by a mechanism other than nonreciprocal translocation. B/F/B cycles can also result in other forms of chromosome rearrangements, including double-minute chromosomes and large duplications. Thus, the loss of a single telomere can result in instability in multiple chromosomes, and generate many of the types of rearrangements commonly associated with human cancer.
