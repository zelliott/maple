A recent successful development is found in a series of innovative, new statistical methods for smoothing data that are based on the empirical Bayes method. This paper emphasizes their practical usefulness in medical sciences and their theoretically close relationship with the problem of simultaneous estimation of parameters, depending on strata. The paper also presents two examples of analyzing epidemiological data obtained in Japan using the smoothing methods to illustrate their favorable performance.
