Karminomycin effect on the activity of some serum enzymes, such as hexokinase (HK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDG), its isoenzymes and glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-P-ase) was studied. Biochemical assays were applied to 52 patients with neglected malignant tumors. The course dose of the drug was on the average 72mg. The objective antitumor effect was registered in 15 patients. A reliable increase in the values of LDG-5 and G-6-P-ase was observed after the treatment course in the combined group consisting of all the patients subjected to the biochemical assay. Normalization of the serum enzyme spectrum was observed in 15 patients effectively treated with karminomycin: activity of HK and the cathode fractions of LDG decreased. When treatment with karminomycin was ineffective (37 cases), the changes in the enzymatic activity recorded before the treatment further aggraviated. It was found that the level of G-6-P-ase in the patients' treated with karminomycin increased independent of the treatment effect which was probably associated with its toxic effect on the liver. The increase was reversible.
