The frequency and causes of ovarian failure among 182 long-term survivors of childhood cancer were examined. Twenty-two patients (12%) had ovarian failure. Ovarian failure was found in 17 of 25 patients (68%) who had both ovaries within abdominal radiotherapy fields, in five of 35 patients (14%) whose ovaries were at the edge of the treatment field, and in none of 122 patients with one or both ovaries outside of an abdominal treatment field (p &lt; 10(-4)). The odds for ovarian failure in patients with both ovaries in the field are 19.7 higher than those for other irradiated patients (95% confidence interval, 5.3 to 72.8). Covariate and multivariate analyses of tumor type, age at diagnosis, duration of follow-up, abdominal tumor surgery, abdominal radiotherapy, number of chemotherapeutic agents administered, and cumulative doses of several drugs revealed that the location of the ovaries relative to radiation treatment fields was the only risk factor for subsequent ovarian failure.
