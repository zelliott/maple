Cancer among children is a substantial public concern. The epidemiology of childhood cancer is not fully understood. The descriptive epidemiology for cancer incidence has been a subject of considerable debate in order to identify and clarify the role of etiological factors and environmental exposure in cancer. An up-to-date perspective systematically collected data on the incidence of childhood cancer in Alexandria was used. Statistical analysis revealed that the over all cancer incidence rate increased from 1972 to 2001. The incidence of lymphatic and haemopoietic cancers increased dramatically over the specified period. The lymphatic and haemopoietic ancer incidence in 2001 have increased approximately 11 times cancer incidence in 1972. The incidence of leukemia among infant less than 5 years increased exponentially with a higher incidence among boys. Little increase was observed in the cancers of oral cavity, digestive organs and respiratory system over the specified period. Incidence of genito-urinary cancers have increased 3.7 times cancer incidence in 1973. Brain and central nervous system cancers showed an increase of 4.5 fold during the 30 years studied period. The trends in some cancer types suggest the need of a closer examination of the underlying factors and environmental contaminants leading to the disease in children.
