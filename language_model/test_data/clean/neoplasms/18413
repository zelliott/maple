ERK5 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 5), also termed BMK1 [big MAPK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 1)], is the most recently discovered member of the MAPK family. It is expressed in a variety of tissues and is activated by a range of growth factors, cytokines and cellular stresses. Targeted deletion of Erk5 in mice has revealed that the ERK5 signalling cascade is critical for normal cardiovascular development and vascular integrity. In vitro studies have revealed that in endothelial cells, ERK5 is required for preventing apoptosis, mediating shear-stress signalling, regulating hypoxia, tumour angiogenesis and cell migration. This review focuses on our current understanding of the role of ERK5 in regulating endothelial cell function.
