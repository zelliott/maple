Approximately half of all patients who receive anticancer chemotherapy are treated with a platinum drug. Despite the widespread use of these drugs, the only cure that can be claimed is that of testicular cancer following cisplatin treatment. This article reviews some of our recent work on phenanthriplatin, a cisplatin derivative in which a chloride ion is replaced by phenanthridine, and on one of its analogues, the previously reported pyriplatin. These cationic complexes form monofunctional adducts on DNA that do not significantly distort the duplex, yet efficiently block transcription. Cell-based assays reveal altered cellular uptake properties and a cancer cell-killing profile different from those of established platinum drugs. Mechanistic work, including a crystal structure analysis of platinum-modified DNA in the active site of RNA polymerase II, is discussed herein.
