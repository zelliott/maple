The purpose of this retrospective cohort study is to update mortality experience at refinery/petrochemical plant facilities in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Baytown, Texas.

Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for 1970-1997 based on death rates in the respective states.

SMRs are near or below unity for most causes of death. Among elevations, Baton Rouge has an SMR of 2.42 (95% CI = 1.16-4.45) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 1.58 (95% CI = 1.17-2.08) for hypertension with heart disease, and 1.47 (95% CI = 0.98-2.11) for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Baytown has an SMR of 2.13 (95% CI = 1.10-3.73) for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and 3.11 (95% CI = 1.01-7.26) for unspecified brain/spinal cord neoplasms. The above findings pertain to pre-1950 hires and exhibit no apparent job-related patterns. Both cohorts have approximately twofold increases in mesothelioma deaths, similar to the last update, with most decedents having held maintenance jobs.

Periodic examination of mortality patterns has an important role in assessing overall employee health status and identifying potential areas of increased risk. Mortality surveillance will continue to monitor these outcomes among more recent workers.
