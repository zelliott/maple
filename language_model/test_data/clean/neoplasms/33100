A novel anticancer vaccine candidate built on a nonpeptidic scaffold has been synthesized. Four S-Tn tumor-associated glycomimetic antigens have been clustered onto a calix[4]arene scaffold bearing an immunoadjuvant moiety (P3CS). The immunogenicity of the synthetic construct has been investigated by immunization of mice in vivo. ELISA assay has evidenced that the tetravalent construct stimulates a higher production of anti-Tn antigen IgG antibodies when compared to an analogous monovalent compound. This result is ascribable to an antigen cluster effect and makes the reported vaccine candidate a good mimic of the natural motifs present on the mucine surface.
