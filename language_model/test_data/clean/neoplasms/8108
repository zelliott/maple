It is now common knowledge that for a solid tumour to become life-threatening clinically, an adequate blood supply to the neoplasm has to be established. Although neovascularisation via angiogenesis leads to a subsequent rapid growth of the tumour mass, it provides the most reliable route by which neoplastic cells may be reached by cytotoxics. In addition, for a majority of tumours, the lesion's vasculature is more permeable and tortuous than that of the surrounding healthy host tissue. Such deviation potentiates selective delivery of drugs to be achieved. This review examines, from various viewpoints, the area of tumour angiogenesis and vascularisation, currently one of the most fertile and active fields of cancer research.
