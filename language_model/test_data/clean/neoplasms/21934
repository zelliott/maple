The occurrence of tumors, their influence upon the organism of Phoxinus phoxinus (L.), its parasite fauna, and parasite component community were investigated in the upstream of the Pechora River. According to the data obtained, tumors could occur in the fishes of every age group, but one-year (0+) or two-year (1+) old minnow is affected by tumors more frequently. The tumors lesion extensiveness ranges from 0.02 to 3 %. From 1 to 3 tumors were recorded on one fish specimen. The investigated tumors were in progressive stage (Georgiev, 2000), since the vascular ingrowth and dissemination (in few cases) of the tumors were observed. Tumors are colored in intensive-black and taupe. The taupe tumors usually have a compact capsule at its peripheries, which isolates affected tissue from muscle fibers. In the intensive-black tumors the invasion of tumor cells to the adjacent transversal striated musculature is observed. Distinct symptoms of necrosis are revealed in all slides of the new growths. Blood vessels are formed in most tumors, and the blood flow is recorded before the completion of the vessels forming, that apparently supplies the tumors feeding. Metastases in different organs revealed in several minnow specimens. Tumor affected individuals of the minnow has parasite species complex practically identical (by species list and quantity) with the same of the even-aged unaffected fishes. However, the parasite component communities of the affected individuals are characterized by 4 groups of species, while the parasite component communities of the intact individuals--by 3 groups. The parasite communities of affected and unaffected one-year fishes are similar by the number of the groups of species, but differ in the number of species.
