Tubulo-squamous polyp is an infrequent, apparently benign lesion which has recently been described in the vagina. Histologically, it is characterized by an epithelial component, consisting of squamous nests and tubules, embedded in a hypocellular fibrous stroma. Here, we report an unusual histological variant showing a cellular stroma, as an additional histologic feature, which could lead to confusion with other site-specific lesions of the vagina. A brief review of the literature on this entity is also provided.
