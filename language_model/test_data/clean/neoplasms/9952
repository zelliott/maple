Before administration of intensive cytotoxic therapy, 90 central venous catheters were inserted into 80 patients with malignancies. Twenty-seven episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred during 96 treatment courses. The majority of these infections were due to gram-positive bacteria (45%) or fungi (22%), although gram-negative organisms accounted for 33%. Catheter occlusion occurred in patients receiving intravenous phenytoin, but blood products could be infused without difficulty. An increase in gram-positive bacteremias in patients with these catheters and drug-induced catheter occlusion must now be appreciated.
