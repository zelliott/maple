In the following reports two main problems are questioned by the Authors. To start with, a sharp distinction is made between the so-called "theoretical physiology" and the "actual" use of the physiological functions adopted by the single man and woman. The second question is concerned with the biological consistency of the different surgical approaches. In the neoplastic treatments, surgeon can draw a conclusion that goes behind the single therapeutic event casting over other different areas of the surgery itself. To answer this second question by no means represents the solution of the aimed goal, on the contrary it is the starting-line towards a surgery, which, having left behind his old, obsolete, but pompous garments, does wear those, which, apparently shabby, are, on the other hand, enriched of many lapels, such as those naturally offered by the self-healing behaviour.
