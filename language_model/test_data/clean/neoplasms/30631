The Epstein-Barr virus, a human B lymphotropic herpes virus, is strongly associated with undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which is endemic in Southern China and North Africa. More recently, an association of the virus with certain other epithelial malignancies has been described, some of which are more common in Western countries. Also, the observation that oral hairy leukoplakia, an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related lesion of the tongue, supports Epstein-Barr virus replication in the epithelial cell compartment has further strengthened the notion that Epstein-Barr virus infection of epithelial cells may be an important phenomenon in vivo. The purpose of this article is to review the association of Epstein-Barr virus with nasopharyngeal carcinomas, to examine the evidence suggesting an association of the virus with other epithelial neoplasias and to discuss Epstein-Barr virus infection of non-neoplastic epithelial cells.
