The authors have studied the different situations that prompt a request for genetic counseling if different members of the same family suffer from cancer. Six possibilities are considered: the cancer concerned is a genetic disease per se (e.g. retinoblastoma, thyroid cancer with amyloid stroma); the genetic disease is often complicated with cancer (e.g. intestinal polyposis); the genetic disease is occasionally complicated with cancer (e.g. neurofibromatosis); cancer is part and parcel of the genetic disease (e.g. chromosomal abnormalities); in addition, there are two special situations: "cancer-prone families" and families who request genetic counseling after one single case (e.g. cancer of leukaemia in a child).
