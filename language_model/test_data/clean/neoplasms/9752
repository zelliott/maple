Palmar keratosis is studied in patients with visceral cancer. It is related to sex and localization. Its higher frequency can be observed in these patients than in controls. Their incidence is larger in the male and in patients with cancer localized in oesophagus, lungs and prostate. In woman the incidence is less than in male and in cancers localized anywhere but breast and uterus. This cutaneous lesion is a very important phenotypical sign in oncology and can be considered as paraneoplasic cutaneous marker.
