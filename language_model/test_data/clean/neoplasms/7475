The contributions of radiation therapy to the management of the patient with cancer are constantly changing, both because of improving use of ionizing radiations and development of other effective treatments. Therefore, if radiation therapy is to be used to each patient's advantage, well-trained radiation oncologists must be involved in the initial and all subsequent management decisions. Such essential activity requires the immediate availability of trained physicians, who have access to adequate facilities in order to provide the best known treatment methods. This availability in turn depends on physician recruitment and training, well-considered development and maintenance of facilities and research programs which are well correlated with clinical activity.
