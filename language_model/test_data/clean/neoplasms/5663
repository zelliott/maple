Fusarium infection is increasingly reported in immunocompromised patients. The role of central venous catheters as potential portals of entry for Fusarium is possibly underestimated. Four cases of catheter-related fusarial infection in children with acute leukemia or a solid tumor are described. These patients had an excellent response to removal of the central venous catheter and treatment with amphotericin B.
