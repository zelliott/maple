Many anticancer therapies induce oral mucositis, diminishing the patient's quality of life. Especially in neutropenic patients, it can lead to life-threatening systemic infection. Moreover, it can become a limiting factor in intensive treatment schedules. Many interventions are aimed at reducing trauma and the risk of secondary infection. The institution of good oral hygiene seems to play a crucial part and can be achieved manually or by means of antiseptic agents. More specific antimicrobial therapy may be indicated. In addition, local and/or systemic pain control may be required. The administration of hematological growth factors, cryoprotectants and other agents or measures that may be of help in the management of mucositis are discussed.
