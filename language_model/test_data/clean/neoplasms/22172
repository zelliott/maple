The transfer of polymer-protein conjugates into routine clinical use, and the clinical development of polymer-anticancer-drug conjugates, both as single agents and as components of combination therapy, is establishing polymer therapeutics as one of the first classes of anticancer nanomedicines. There is growing optimism that ever more sophisticated polymer-based vectors will be a significant addition to the armoury currently used for cancer therapy.
