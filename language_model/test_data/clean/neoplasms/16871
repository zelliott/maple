A number of chemically diverse substances is associated with the malignant transformation of cells. Though none of these can be said to be wholly specific they are operationally useful and this paper is a selective review of some of them. They arise from exposure of previously cryptic epitopes in membranes and secreted molecules and the amplification of normally small quantities of cellular components, such as oncogenes in chromosomes. Antibodies directed to these tumour markers are opening up new avenues of research, diagnosis and therapy of cancer patients. The use of radioisotope labelled antibodies has become sufficiently sensitive and specific to be useful for decision-making in their clinical management.
