Retinoids, physiological regulators of cell growth and differentiation, are used in the treatment or chemoprevention of several malignant diseases. This class of compounds can induce growth arrest or apoptosis in tumor cells. Permanent growth arrest of retinoid-treated cells is often assumed to result from retinoid-induced differentiation. Recent studies in breast carcinoma and neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that retinoids can stop tumor cell growth through the program of senescence rather than differentiation. Retinoid-induced tumor suppression is associated with the induction of multiple intracellular and secreted growth-inhibitory proteins. Most of these proteins were also found to be upregulated in senescent cells. The induction of senescence-associated growth inhibitors appears to be an indirect effect of retinoids. Elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for the induction of growth-inhibitory genes in retinoid-treated cells should help in developing agents that would mimic the antiproliferative effect of retinoids in retinoid-insensitive cancers.
