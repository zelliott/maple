Five (1-5) ent-kaurane diterpenoids and 17 other known ones, were isolated from the leaves and stems of Isodon sinuolata. Their structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic methods including 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis. All compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against a small panel of cell lines. Some compounds exhibited significant cytotoxicity.
