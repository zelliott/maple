Liposomes which offer the advantage of the enhanced drug accumulation at tumor sites are currently applied extensively in the clinical treatment of tumor. However, accumulation of the liposomes in the tumor area cannot guarantee the drug bioavailability. To resolve the question, thermosensitive targeting liposomes (TTL) have been the hotspot of current studies. TTL can enhance drug accumulation at tumor sites and be triggered to release their contents upon hyperthermia. By applying these two strategies, antitumor efficacy of encapsulated drug can be significantly improved. The present paper reviews the development of TTL in recent years.
