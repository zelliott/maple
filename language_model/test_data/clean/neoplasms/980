Analogues of parthenin were synthesized by substitutions at different reaction centres to establish a structure-activity relationship (SAR). Some of the molecules have displayed significant cytotoxicity in human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) and human myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells. A few of the compounds also induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells measured in terms of sub-Go/G1 DNA fraction. Also one of the lead molecules has been shown to be the inhibitor of both telomerase and topoisomerase-II.
