Recent advances in genomic and proteomic technologies have begun to address the challenge of assigning molecular and cellular functions to the numerous protein products encoded by prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. In particular, chemical strategies for proteome analysis have emerged that enable profiling of protein activity on a global scale. Herein, we highlight these chemical proteomic methods and their application to the discovery and characterization of disease-related enzyme activities.
