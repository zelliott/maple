Spatial accuracy in extracranial radiosurgery is affected by organ motion. Motion tracking systems may be able to avoid PTV enlargement while preserving treatment times, however special attention is needed when fiducial markers are used to identify the target can move with respect to organs at risk (OARs). Ten patients treated by means of the Synchrony system were taken into account. Sparing of irradiated volume and of complication probability were estimated by calculating treatment plans with a motion tracking system (Cyberknife Synchrony, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and a PTV-enlargement strategy for ten patients. Six patients were also evaluated for possible inaccuracy of estimation of dose to OARs due to relative movement between PTV and OAR during respiration. Dose volume histograms (DVH) and Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD) were calculated for the organs at risk. In the cases for which the target moved closer to the OAR (three cases of six), a small but significant increase was detected in the DVH and EUD of the OAR. In three other cases no significant variation was detected. Mean reduction in PTV volume was 38% for liver cases, 44% for lung cases and 8.5% for pancreas cases. NTCP for liver reduced from 23.1 to 14.5% on average, for lung it reduced from 2.5 to 0.1% on average. Significant uncertainty may arise from the use of a motion-tracking device in determination of dose to organs at risk due to the relative motion between PTV and OAR. However, it is possible to limit this uncertainty. The breathing phase in which the OAR is closer to the PTV should be selected for planning. A full understanding of the dose distribution would only be possible by means of a complete 4D-CT representation.
