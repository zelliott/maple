Twenty patients with end-stage heart failure and preexisting malignancies underwent heart transplantation at a single center, with a neoplasm-free interval before the procedure of 0 to 240 months. Twelve patients were long-term survivors (2 to 72 months); there were 2 early and 6 late deaths, thus justifying heart transplantation in patients with preexisting malignancies in individual cases.
