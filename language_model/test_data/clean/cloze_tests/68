Cardiac differentiation involves a cascade of coordinated gene expression that regulates cell proliferation and matrix protein formation in a defined temporo-spatial manner. The zinc-finger-containing transcription factor has been implicated as a critical regulator of multiple cardiac-expressed genes as well as a regulator of inducible gene expression in response to hypertrophic stimulation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways are among the most widespread mechanisms of eukaryotic cell regulation. The MAPKs function inside the nucleus and target transcription factors that are prebound to DNA. Many transcription factors are probably important MAPK targets. Here, we have cloned a new zinc-finger gene named ZNF411 using degenerate primers from an early embryo heart cDNA library, which mapped to 19p13.11. The ZNF411 gene consists of 2360 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 499 amino acids with an amino-terminal KRAB domain and eleven carboxy-terminal C2H2 zinc-finger units. Northern blot analysis indicates that a 2.4 kb transcript specific for ZNF411 is expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and placenta at adult stage and is expressed in most of the examined embryonic tissues, especially at a higher level in skeletal muscle, heart, and pancreas. ZNF411 protein distributes evenly in nuclei when overexpressed in the cells. Reporter gene assays show that ZNF411 is a transcriptional repressor and overexpression of ZNF411 in the COS-7 cells inhibits the transcriptional activities of AP-1 and SRE. These results indicate that ZNF411 is a member of the zinc-finger transcription factor family and may be involved in the heart development, and it probably works as a negative regulator in MAPK signaling pathway.
