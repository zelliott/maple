The comparative characterization of a series of 4-acyl-1,6-dialkylpiperazin-2-ones as potent cell entry inhibitors of the hemorrhagic fever arenavirus Lassa (LASV) is disclosed. The resolution and examination of the individual enantiomers of the prototypical LASV cell entry inhibitor 3 (16G8) is reported and the more potent (-)-enantiomer was found to be 15-fold more active than the corresponding (+)-enantiomer. The absolute configuration of (-)-3 was established by asymmetric synthesis of the active inhibitor (-)-(S)-3 (lassamycin-1). A limited deletion scan of lassamycin-1 defined key structural features required of the prototypical inhibitors.
