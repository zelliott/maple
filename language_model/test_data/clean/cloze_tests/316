Exogenous obesity increases morbidity and mortality risk and has been associated with nutritional habits, which in turn can be affected by health education. Health education aims to promote patient participation in achieving behavior change and healthy lifestyles. The objective of this study is to show the advantages of participatory education in the modification of body mass index (BMI) in obese type-2 diabetics. A quasi-experimental study was performed with random allocation of two patient groups. The educational intervention was organized through a reflection-action process. BMI was measured at baseline and then monthly for 9 months during the intervention. The groups were analyzed by age and sex. Statistical analysis used the Student t test, with the mean difference for related groups. The control group showed a mean BMI of 33.89 + 1.96 and a final BMI of 33.2 +/- 2.15 (t:22.4; p:0.16). The experimental group had an initial value of 33.63 +/- 2.12 and a final BMI of 31.54 +/- 1.71; statistical difference: (t:11.55; p:0.003). The participatory educational intervention thus helped improve the BMI in obese type-2 diabetics.
