The purpose of this study was to examine the level of some conventional coronary heart disease risk factors in blue-collar women and evaluate the link between the spreading of this risk factors and the level of physical work. The active smoking, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, overweight and obesity, abnormal lipid levels and leisure-time physical activity were analyzed. 120 women of hard physical work and 57 women of light physical work in the age of 25 +/- 45 y. were examined. The questionnaire and full physical examination were performed. In the group of hard physical work the prevalence of active smoking, environmental tobacco smoke exposure and mixed hyperlipidemia. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and obesity were observed in the group of light physical work. The high level of coronary artery disease risk-factors were found out in groups of blue-collar women with high and low level of occupational physical activity. It seems that lifestyle and diet plays an important role in spreading of the risk factors of CAD in blue-collar women.
