Environmental exposure to inhaled mineral dusts is associated with a variety of inflammatory, fibrotic and carcinogenic pulmonary diseases, generally characterized by the infiltration into the lung of phagocytic cells, namely macrophages and polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN). The ability of pathogenic mineral, fibrous and metalliferous dusts to stimulate PMN to produce potentially injurious free radical oxidants, has been studied using an in vitro chemiluminescent technique. The cellular mechanisms and nutritional agents involved in providing the pulmonary antioxidant biochemical defence systems are reviewed, and the prospects of dietary modification of environmentally induced lung cancers and related pneumoconiotic diseases discussed.
