Glycosylated BSA was prepared via Maillard reaction and central composite design (CCD) technique was applied to study the effects of reaction time, temperature, the pH value of the buffer solution on the degree of graft (DG), content of the melanoid (A420) and emulsifying stability (ES) of the resultant product. Fluorescence spectra as well as several other techniques including sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), infrared spectrum (IR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were employed to study the possible differences between the glycosylated BSA and BSA. Glycosylated albumin possessed distinct properties from BSA and had the great potential to be used as the drug carrier for nanoparticles.
