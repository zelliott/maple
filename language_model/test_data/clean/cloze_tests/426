A simple technique is described that facilitates a proper procedure of venous end-to-end anastomosis during neurosurgical procedures. This technique, which consists of insertion of a Venflon tube in the vein during anastomosis, results in easier handling and proper apposition of the vein, resulting in an improved quality of the anastomosis. The technique was successfully applied in a patient after parasagittal meningioma resection, and the patency of the cortical vein was confirmed postoperatively on magnetic resonance venography.
