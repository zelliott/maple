To evaluate the hospital multistay rate to determine if it has the attributes necessary for a performance indicator that can be applied to administrative databases.

The fiscal year 1994 Veterans Affairs Patient Treatment File (PTF), which contains discharge data on all VA inpatients.

Using a retrospective study design, we assessed cross-hospital variation in (a) the multistay rate and (b) the standardized multistay ratio. A hospital's multistay rate is the observed average number of hospitalizations for patients with one or more hospital stays. A hospital's standardized multistay ratio is the ratio of the geometric mean of the observed number of hospitalizations per patient to the geometric mean of the expected number of hospitalizations per patient, conditional on the types of patients admitted to that hospital.

Discharge data were extracted for the 135,434 VA patients who had one or more admissions in one of seven disease groups.

We found that 17.3 percent (28,300) of the admissions in the seven disease categories were readmissions. The average number of stays per person (multistay rate) for an average of seven months of follow-up ranged from 1.15 to 1.45 across the disease categories. The maximum standardized multistay ratio ranged from 1.12 to 1.39.

This study has shown that the hospital multistay rate offers sufficient ease of measurement, frequency, and variation to potentially serve as a performance indicator.
