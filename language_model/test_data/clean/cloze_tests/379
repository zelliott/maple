Admission, and non-admission, in intensive care units (ICU) for oncologic patients are discussed in this review. Medical, ethical and economical concerns have to be considered. We are in favor of a flexible attitude, aimed at avoiding two pitfalls: first, not to allow to a patient to benefit of intensive treatment when available and useful, and, second, to impose to a patient difficult and painful therapy if the survival chance is minimal. The patient must be a partner for the decision to admit him or her in the ICU. In addition, it is important to be aware that, during the last few years, the prognosis of the oncologic patients treated in the ICU is continuously improving. Therefore, the admission of such patients must be systematically discussed with both the oncologist and the critical care physician.
