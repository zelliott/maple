Synovial tissue is rarely available from patients with early synovitis, with the exception of synovial biopsies. However, T cell populations early in the development of synovitis may be enriched in antigen-specific cells and critical to disease pathogenesis. To investigate the T cell repertoire in early synovitis, we utilized a PCR protocol for detection of T cell receptor (TCR) transcripts present in small amounts of synovial tissue. To expand the substrate for PCR, preamplification of cDNA was performed with a 3' constant region primer plus either a mixture of variable region primers or random hexanucleotides. Utilizing this method improved the sensitivity of detection. This technique is applied here to the analysis of TCR transcripts in synovial biopsies from individuals with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and non-RA synovitis. TCR alpha-chain transcripts were detectable in 5/5 RA and 4/4 non-RA specimens evaluated, with beta-chain transcripts detected in 4/5 early RA and 4/4 non-RA specimens evaluated. Confirmation of transcripts by sequencing of cloned PCR products verified the specificity of amplification. The most frequently expressed TCR V region families in early RA synovitis were V alpha 11, V alpha 14, V alpha 28, V beta 7, V beta 9 and V beta 17. Several of these V regions have previously been implicated in studies of chronic RA synovitis. J alpha and J beta region usage was similar to that seen in chronic RA, and conserved N region motifs were apparent. We conclude that it is possible to detect TCR transcripts in small synovial biopsies from individuals with early arthritis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
