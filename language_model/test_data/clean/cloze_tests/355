NF-kappaB is a master transcription factor in the immune system. It regulates various aspects of immune cell development, homeostasis, survival and function. It is in these contexts that the signaling pathways leading to NF-kappaB activation are best understood. This review addresses the cell signaling from antigen receptors as well as Toll-like receptors to NF-kappaB in both innate and adaptive immunity as revealed by the analysis of mice lacking specific signaling intermediates.
