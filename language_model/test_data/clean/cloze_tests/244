In 300 postmenopausal adipose and complaint-free patients but with one risk factor for the development of endometrial carcinoma one prospective study transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonographic examinations by 3.75-MHZ abdominal and 5-MHZ vaginal sound was carried out. In all cases with endometrial thickness of 10 mm and also with endometrial thickness of 5-10 mm and irregular endometrial boundary fractional curettage was done. The rate of abnormal findings was 8% of which in 18 patients the findings were histologically confirmed (3 endometrial cancer, 5 hyperplasia, 8 polyp and 2 submucosal myomas). The sensitivity of ultrasonography was found to be 75%. Patients with normal findings were controlled in 6 months, none of these patients showed pathological symptoms.
