Two cases of epidural abscess as a complication of frontal sinusitis are presented. The diagnoses were suspected on the basis of history and were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Both patients were treated successfully by means of surgery and intravenous antibiotics. One patient developed meningitis in the postoperative course and was treated by changing the antibiotic regimen. However, further follow-up in the outpatient clinic by physical examinations and brain computed tomography scans showed no longterm neurologic complications in either case. Intracranial suppuration, including epidural abscesses, can complicate acute and chronic frontal sinusitis. These complications are diagnosed by maintaining a high index of suspicion and using the appropriate neuroimaging studies without delay.
