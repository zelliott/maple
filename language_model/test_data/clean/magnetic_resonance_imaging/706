This article reviews common cardiovascular pathologies that can be noted first on plain film when previously unsuspected, and then illustrates how cross-sectional imaging can provide the follow-up information needed to make a diagnosis. First reviewed are the normal cardiac structures and contours as seen on the plain film of the chest, followed by specific types of pathologies as seen in older adults; patients with lung cancer invading the heart, pericardium, or large vessels; and postsurgical and posttraumatic findings. Also provided is a review of non-cardiac-related areas of plain film and cross-sectional imaging correlation. It is hoped that the reader gains a better understanding and appreciation for the great value of cross-sectional imaging, and the power of the plain film in helping detect and recognize thoracic pathology.
