Dialysis patients are less active and have reduced functional capacity compared to individuals with normal renal function. Muscle atrophy and weakness may contribute to these problems. This investigation was undertaken to quantify the extent of atrophy in the lower extremity muscles, to determine whether defects in muscle specific strength (force per unit mass) or central nervous system (CNS) activation are present, and to assess the relationship between muscle size and physical performance in a group of patients on hemodialysis.

Thirty-eight dialysis subjects (aged 55 +/- 15 years) and nineteen healthy sedentary controls (aged 55 +/- 13 years) were enrolled. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lower leg was used to determine the total cross-sectional area (CSA) and the area of contractile and non-contractile tissue of the ankle dorsiflexor muscles. Isometric dorsiflexor strength was measured during a maximal voluntary contraction with and without superimposed tetanic stimulation (N = 22 for dialysis subjects, N = 12 for controls). Physical activity was measured by accelerometry, and gait speed was recorded as a measure of physical performance.

Dialysis subjects were weaker, less active, and walked more slowly than controls. Total muscle compartment CSA was not significantly different between dialysis subjects and controls, but the contractile CSA was smaller in the dialysis patients even after adjustment for age, gender, and physical activity. Central activation and specific strength were normal. Gait speed was correlated with contractile CSA.

Significant atrophy and increased non-contractile tissue are present in the muscle of patients on hemodialysis. The relationship between contractile area and strength is intact in this population. Muscle atrophy is associated with poor physical performance. Thus, interventions to increase physical activity or otherwise address atrophy may improve performance and quality of life.
