Magnetic resonance imaging is an extremely sensitive technique for evaluation of bone marrow changes at an early stage of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip. We therefore examined 11 painful hips whose clinical symptoms led us to suspect idiopathic AVN. The radiographs of all of these either were normal or demonstrated a minimal decrease in radiodensity. Magnetic resonance demonstrated diffuse signal loss of the bone marrow at short TR/TE images of the femoral head in all hips, with various extensions in the head, neck, and intertrochanteric area. These regions turned iso- to hyperintense on long TR/TE images compatible with bone marrow edema (BME). Focal abnormalities characteristic for AVN were not seen in any of the cases. Radionuclide studies performed in six cases were positive. All patients underwent core decompression treatment. Hydrostatic bone marrow pressure measurement and intraosseous venography were positive in five cases when measured. Histology available in eight cases confirmed the presence of BME. Furthermore, the bone changes corresponded to those of early AVN. Follow-up examinations after core decompression with MR showed normal signal intensity in all cases. Magnetic resonance represents a viable diagnostic tool for BME and can monitor the therapeutic success of core decompression. Whether BME of the femoral head constitutes a distinct transient syndrome or represents an early form of AVN is controversial at present. Our findings support those who believe that BME may represent an initial stage of idiopathic AVN.
