Experimental brain tumours were produced in adult cats by stereotactic xenotransplantation of the rat glioma clone F98. Regional ATP, glucose and lactate were measured after 2-4 weeks on coronal cryostat sections by substrate-induced bioluminescence, potassium content was imaged by the histochemical sodium cobaltinitrite method, and regional pH by incubating cryostat sections with the fluorescent pH-indicator umbelliferone. The regional biochemical alterations were correlated with magnetic resonance imaging and tissue water content. Biochemical changes were heterogeneous in tumours but exhibited a rather uniform pattern in peritumoural oedema. ATP was consistently reduced, glucose and lactate were increased and pH was more alkaline than in normal white matter. The decrease of ATP matched the increase of water, indicating that ATP decline represents fractional dilution in the oedematous tissue rather than break-down of energy metabolism. The increased lactate levels, therefore, may originate from the tumour and not from a metabolic disturbance in the peritumoural oedematous tissue. The implications of this interpretation for the pathogenesis of peritumoural oedema are discussed.
