A new automatic model-based segmentation scheme that combines level set shape modeling and active appearance modeling (AAM) is presented. Since different MR image contrasts can yield complementary information, multi-contrast images can be incorporated into the active appearance modeling to improve segmentation performance. During active appearance modeling, the weighting of each contrast is optimized to account for the potentially varying contribution of each image while optimizing the model parameters that correspond to the shape and appearance eigen-images in order to minimize the difference between the multi-contrast test images and the ones synthesized from the shape and appearance modeling. As appearance-based modeling techniques are dependent on the initial alignment of training data, we compare (i) linear alignment of whole brain, (ii) linear alignment of a local volume of interest and (iii) non-linear alignment of a local volume of interest. The proposed segmentation scheme can be used to segment human hippocampi (HC) and amygdalae (AG), which have weak intensity contrast with their background in MRI. The experiments demonstrate that non-linear alignment of training data yields the best results and that multimodal segmentation using T1-weighted, T2-weighted and proton density-weighted images yields better segmentation results than any single contrast. In a four-fold cross validation with eighty young normal subjects, the method yields a mean Dice ะบ of 0.87 with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.946 for HC and a mean Dice ะบ of 0.81 with ICC of 0.924 for AG between manual and automatic labels.
