A 15-year-old male with unresolved hip pain after minor trauma is presented. The diagnosis of an acetabular labral tear was made using correlative scintigraphic and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, obviating the more invasive investigations of arthrography or arthroscopy of the hip. The clinical and radiological features of this lesion are reviewed. Undiagnosed, acetabular labral tears may result in considerable morbidity. Appropriate operative or conservative management of the condition usually provides symptomatic relief.
