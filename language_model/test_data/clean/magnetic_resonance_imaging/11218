In patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction, normal coronary arteries in the first coronary angiography lead to diagnostic uncertainty. We report the case of a 41-year-old woman with an acute anterior infarction and a severe spasm of the left coronary artery, which was treated with intracoronary nitroglycerine and verapamil. The new technique of contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was used to confirm the diagnosis.
