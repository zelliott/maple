PADUA score is a standardized anatomical classification of renal tumors proposed with the aim to objectivize the decision-making process of any urologist evaluating kidney tumors potentially suitable for nephron-sparing surgery. The system was proposed in a series of patients treated with open partial nephrectomy (PN) and was recently validated in a series of patients treated with either open or laparoscopic PN. The purpose of the present study was to validate the PADUA score in a series of consecutive patients who underwent robot-assisted PN (RPN).

We evaluated retrospectively all the MRI or CT images of 62 consecutive patients who underwent RPN for renal tumors at a nonacademic teaching institution by a single surgeon between September 2006 and November 2009.

PADUA score (6-7 vs. 8-11) was correlated with warm ischemia time (WIT) (P = 0.002), console time (P = 0.001), blood loss (P = 0.009), percentage of pelvicaliceal repair (P = 0.002), and overall complications (P = 0.02). PADUA score was the only variable able to predict the risk of the overall complications (P = 0.02). PADUA score turned out to be an independent predictor of WIT >20 min in multivariable analysis (OR 5.4; P = 0.002), once adjusted for surgeon's experience Finally, PADUA score was the only independent predictor of the need for pelvicaliceal repair (OR 3.7; P = 0.006).

PADUA classification was an effective tool to predict WIT and risk of perioperative complications also in patients who underwent RPN. This classification must be considered useful to improve patients counseling and selection for RPN.
