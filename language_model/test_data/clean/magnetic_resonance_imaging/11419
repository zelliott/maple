Twenty nine non-traumatic appalic syndrome (AS) cases of various etiology were observed in children aged from 3 to 14 years. The clinical picture study was carried out, along with brain structure visualization in vivo (CT and MRT), EEG and cerebral blood flow detection with transcranial ultrasonic dopplerography. All the cases were studied in dynamics in relation to influence of complex course therapy developed by the authors, including vasoactive drugs, nootropics, craniopuncture, acupuncture and electrostimulation of craniopuncture zones. Five patients (17.2%) had a distinct positive dynamics with complete consciousness rehabilitation on the background of moderate neurological deficit regress. In general, CT-data and changes of EEG and cerebral blood flow in AS were not found to have any prognostic value and to be etiologically specific. But changes of EEG and cerebral blood flow in response to the treatment appear to be positive prognostic sign. The prognosis for AS due to meningoencephalitis is worse than one for AS due to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The non-traumatic AS duration for more than 2 months corresponds to unfavorable outcome.
