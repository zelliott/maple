Arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) and true aneurysms are uncommon arterial vascular disorders of the breast. The etiology can be either acquired or congenital. Coexistence of a congenital AVF and true aneurysm of internal mammary artery (IMA) branches is a very rare condition. We present a case of congenital AVF and true aneurysm of the IMA in a woman, age 56 years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published case of the coexistence of a congenital AVF with a true aneurysm of the breast. The radiologic findings of these rare entities have been reviewed according to the literature.
