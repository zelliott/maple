A 43-year-old woman with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and pelvic pain of several years' duration had a uterus enlarged by myomas to the size of a 16-week pregnancy. Her uterine arteries were noninvasively transvaginally identified and occluded for 6 hours with a clamp that was guided by audible Doppler ultrasound. Following removal of the clamp, blood flow in the uterine arteries returned immediately. Menorrhagia symptoms diminished. Three months following treatment, uterine volume decreased by 48.9%, and dominant myoma volume decreased by 77.2%.
