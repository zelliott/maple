The paper provides the results of magnetic resonance tomographic examination of patients with acoustic neurinoma, and shows that the method can be used in the defining the site of a focus, its size, and relations of the tumor with adjacent tissues. The paper also outlines the image structure of the tumor in relation to scanning techniques and gives magnetic resonance criteria for differential diagnosis of tumor processes in the region of the cerebellopontine angle. It is concluded that magnetic resonance tomography is of high informative value in the diagnosis of extra-axial tumors of the posterior cranial fossa.
