Primary tumors of the osseous spine are rare. This article illustrates some aspects of imaging of tumoral pathology of the osseous spine. Plain film and CT scan still remain the initial imaging modalities in the work-up of tumoral pathology of the osseous spine. MR imaging however has proven its potentials in the detection of lesions in areas with superimposing structures which hamper reliable reading of the plain films or in areas with a complex bony anatomy such as the sacrum. MR imaging is exquisite in determining the local extent of tumoral lesions and in defining the relationship to adjacent central nervous system structures. In some tumors or tumor-like lesions, MR imaging allows to make a correct tissue-related diagnosis or to strengthen the diagnosis made on plain film/CT observations. In other case MR imaging only has a role in staging or may have definitely no role at all.
