Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia is a multisystem disorder consisting of spondylo-epiphysial dysplasia, progressive renal insufficiency due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and immunodeficiency. Cerebrovascular complications have only been described in five patients. Here we report a patient with prominent neurological symptoms most likely caused by transient ischaemic attacks.

Neurological symptoms consisted of repeated brief spells of hemiparaesthesia, motoric aphasia and diplopia. MRI studies of the CNS revealed progressive white matter lesions. Morphological changes as well as neurological deficits are compatible with cerebral ischaemia.
