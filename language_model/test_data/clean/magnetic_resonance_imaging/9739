Cardiac impairment by an intrathoracic stomach is an accepted indication for surgical repair. However, the assessment of the hemodynamic impact often remains a challenge. The present article reports on two subjects with intrathoracic stomach and chest discomfort, who underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) before and after food intake. CMR enabled the accurate assessment of cardiac compression in dependency from the gastric filling state, and demonstrated an association between food intake, decrease in left ventricular stroke volume and the occurrence of symptoms. Thus, CMR may become a valuable tool for clinical decision-making in patients with intrathoracic stomach.
