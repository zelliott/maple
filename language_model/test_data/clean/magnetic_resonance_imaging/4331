The aim of our study was to investigate the central nervous system (CNS) morphology and myelination with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in congenital hypothyroid (CH) infants detected by neonatal screening before replacement therapy. We studied 11 CH infants, 9 girls and 2 boys, mean age 22 days, 3 with aplasia, 5 with ectopia, 2 with hypoplasia of the thyroid gland, 1 with unknown diagnosis. As normal controls 22 term newborns (38 to 41 weeks of gestational age) were studied. MRI studies were performed with a 1.5-T magnet, extremity coil, T1-weighted and heavily T2-sequences axial sections were obtained. No sedation was needed for the MRI studies. MRI brain examination was normal in all patients compared with controls. In particular, no differences in the myelination patterns of the brain were observed between normal subjects and patients with hypothyroidism. Our study shows no morphological brain abnormalities in CH infants detected by neonatal screening before replacement therapy. Perinatal hypothyroidism seems to have no effect on CNS structures.
