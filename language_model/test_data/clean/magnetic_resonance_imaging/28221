This is a case history of a 38-year-old woman with a dumbbell-shaped C2 neurofibroma associated with right-sided classic migraine headaches (migraine with aura) and cervical trigeminal signs on the affected side. Surgical removal of the tumor was followed by resolution of the migraine headaches and persistence of the signs of cervico-trigeminal involvement.
