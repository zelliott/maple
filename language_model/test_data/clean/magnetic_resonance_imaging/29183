To evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting primary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and regional metastasis to the lymph nodes, and to correlate magnetic resonance signal intensity to pathologic changes.

Magnetic resonance images in 14 patients with MTC (9 with primary disease, 5 with recurrent disease) were reviewed for signal intensities, tumor morphologic characteristics, and tumor invasion with spin-echo T1-weighted images (T1WIs), T2-weighted images (T2WIs), and gadolinium-enhanced T1WIs. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the correlation between T2-weighted signal intensity and pathologic findings. Lymph nodes were evaluated based on signal and morphologic characteristics.

Magnetic resonance imaging detected tumors in 9 (90%) of the 10 patients who had MTC in the thyroid gland. Extrathyroidal spread of the tumors was correctly predicted using this procedure. Most tumors were hyperintense or markedly hyperintense on T2WI. T2-weighted signal intensity of the tumor was associated with increased amyloid deposition and high tumor cellularity and low level of fibrosis (r = 0.91, P = .01). Lymph node metastasis was present in 38 (23%) of 168 surgically dissected nodes. The combined use of 4 criteria (nodule size, a minimum-maximum diameter ratio of 0.80 or greater, marked hyperintensity on T2WI, and necrosis in the node) yielded a high detection accuracy (93%) for nodal metastasis, with 74% sensitivity and 98% specificity.

Magnetic resonance imaging is useful for detecting primary and recurrent MTC, and its signal intensity reflects the underlying pathologic changes.
