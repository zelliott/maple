To detect structural adaptations of collagen fiber matrix in compressed articular cartilage in individual sub-tissue zones by microscopic magnetic resonance imaging (microMRI) at 23 microm in-depth resolution.

Each of the six beagle humeral cartilage specimens was placed in a specially built nonmetallic compression device inside an in-situ rotation device, and was imaged four times at 7T: without and during static compression, and at two orientations: 0 degrees and 55 degrees . Proton intensity images and quantitative T(2) maps were constructed and analyzed.

Upon compression at 55 degrees (the magic angle), rather than appearing homogenous, T(2)-weighted intensity images of cartilage showed a distinct laminar appearance and the T(2) profiles exhibited two distinctive peaks. At both 0 degrees and 55 degrees orientations, lower values of T(2) were observed in compressed tissue. A significant correlation was established between changes in tissue T(2) at 55 degrees and a thickness reduction due to compression. At a mean of 20% strain value, modifications in cartilage structure were studied at each histological zone. We found that the percentage of superficial zone was significantly doubled, the percentage of radial zone was significantly decreased by 10%, and no significant change in the transitional zone.

External loading can induce a new kind of laminar appearance at the magic angle. microMRI T(2) anisotropy can be used to analyze the zone-specific alterations in collagen fibril organization in articular cartilage in response to mechanical compression.
