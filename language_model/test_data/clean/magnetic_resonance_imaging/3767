The chin fat pad is poorly described in anatomic publications. To improve its knowledge, we performed 10 dissections, we studied 10 CT Scanners and ten RMN from patients without mental scar, and we performed a CT scanner of this area in a man at rest and during the lips protraction. A histological study has been performed comparing the chin fat pad with the subcutaneous fat and the buccal fat pad. The chin fat pad was cylindric, measuring 20 mm long, 7,5 mm wide and 4 mm high. It became thinner during the lips protraction. The histological study revealed a lot of fibrous septa. It was more similar to the subcutaneous fat than to the buccal fat pad.
