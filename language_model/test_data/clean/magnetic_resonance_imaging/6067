We hypothesize that the bone marrow edema seen in MRI images of osteoarthritic joints are a result of microfractures. These microfractures caused intermittent pain of the osteoarthritis knees. Varus malalignment of the knee with osteoporosis leads loading on the medial compartment, and high pressure on the lateral compartment for valgus malalignment.
