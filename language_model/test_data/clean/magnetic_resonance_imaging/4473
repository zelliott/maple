Serial images of the swallowing motions of 10 healthy volunteers were taken using the Turbo-fast low angle shot (FLASH) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence, while the subject swallowed an oral contrast agent containing ferric ammonium citrate. In all cases, the flow of the contrast agent and the motion of the organs in the oral cavity and the pharynx during swallowing could be observed. High-speed MR imaging combined with an oral positive contrast agent has the potential to evaluate accurately swallowing motion.
