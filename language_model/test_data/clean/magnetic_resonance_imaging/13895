Interhemispheric and gender differences of the central sulcus were examined via a parametric ribbon approach. The central sulcus was found to be deeper and larger in the right nondominant hemisphere than in the left dominant hemisphere, both in males and in females. Based on its pattern, that asymmetry could be attributed to increased connectivity between motor and somatosensory cortex, facilitating fine movement, which could constrain the in-depth growth of the central sulcus. Position asymmetries were also found, which might be explained by a relative larger parietal association cortex in men but not in women.
