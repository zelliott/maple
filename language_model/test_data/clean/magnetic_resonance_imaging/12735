This paper describes the case of a 56-year-old man with a history of small cell lung cancer under chemotherapy, who presented with left-sided peripheral facial palsy and progressive bilateral sensorineural deafness due to leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the petrosal bones and posterior cranial fossa revealed 2 solid lesions in the internal acoustic meatuses bilaterally and LMC of the skull base. Whole brain radiation therapy and methotrexate intrathecally were applied to the patient.
