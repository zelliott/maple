To report a group of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and orbital plexiform neurofibroma who developed axial myopia in the associated eye.

The clinical records and imaging of 3 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and orbital plexiform neurofibromas were reviewed.

Three patients were identified who were diagnosed with orbital plexiform neurofibromas at the ages of 10 months, 9 months, and 16 years old. In all cases the axial length of the eye associated with the neurofibroma increased with length compared with the unaffected eye over time. Accordingly, the affected eye became increasing myopic with age, while the unaffected eye remained emmetropic.

Eyes affected with orbital plexiform neurofibroma, a hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 1, appear to be associated with increased axial length and myopia. This is of particular importance in children, to diagnose and treat unilateral high myopia early and prevent anisometropic amblyopia.
