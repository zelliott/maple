Case series.

Two pediatric patients with paraplegia due to acute transverse myelitis and one pediatric patient with paraplegia due to traumatic myelopathy were included in this case series. Their initial MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) findings were spinal cord swelling and high signal intensity in T2-weighted image. After several months, they had no motor recovery and showed no change of neurological level, though they underwent steroid and physical therapy. A follow-up MRI revealed spinal cord atrophy.

If a pediatric patient with traumatic or inflammatory spinal cord injury does not show motor recovery after several months, spinal cord atrophy must be considered.
