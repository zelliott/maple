Before the advent of MR imaging, intraventricular cysts were difficult to diagnose noninvasively. Among the invasive procedures used were contrast ventriculography and CT ventriculography. MR imaging, with its multiplanar imaging capabilities, excellent depiction of tissue contrast, and versatile parameters, is an important tool in the assessment of intraventricular cystic lesions. We investigated the role of three-dimensional constructive interference in steady state (3D-CISS) MR sequences in the evaluation of intraventricular cysticercal cysts.

The study group comprised 11 patients with intraventricular cysticercal cysts. MR studies included spin-echo (SE) T1-weighted, turbo-SE T2-weighted, and 3D-CISS sequences. All images were obtained on a superconducting 1.5-T MR unit. The routine and 3D-CISS sequences were reviewed and interpreted separately by two neuroradiologists.

All patients underwent surgery for excision of intraventricular cysticercal cysts. Eight patients had cysts in the fourth ventricle, two in the lateral ventricle, and one in the third ventricle. SE T1-weighted images showed the cystic wall in nine cases, the scolex in four, and the cystic fluid in two. Turbo-SE T2-weighted images showed the cystic wall and scolex in three and four cases, respectively. The routine sequences did not show the scolex, cystic wall, or cystic fluid together in any of the 11 patients. 3D-CISS images showed the scolex in all 11 patients and the cystic wall and cystic fluid in eight patients each. In seven of the 11 patients, 3D-CISS images showed the scolex, cystic wall, and fluid together.

The 3D-CISS sequence is more sensitive and specific than routine SE sequences in the diagnosis of intraventricular cysticercal cysts.
