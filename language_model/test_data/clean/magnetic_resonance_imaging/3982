Reduction of image-to-image signal fluctuations and imaging artifacts is important for fMRI studies. The imaging artifacts caused by respiration, cardiac pulsation, and gross head motion and the suppression of these artifacts have been studied for many years. However, the artifacts caused by eye movement and their effects on fMRI mapping are not well known. It is demonstrated in this report that involuntary eye movements during resting conditions can cause substantial signal fluctuations in the phase-encoding direction even for a fast echo-planar imaging sequence. An oblique slab presaturation technique is proposed for saturating the magnetization of eyes and suppressing the artifacts from eye movements with minimal signal loss of other brain tissues. The results show that the technique significantly reduces signal fluctuations and improves fMRI reliability for mapping functional activation in the human brain.
