A case of right renal agenesis in a beagle, of interest because of the age of the dog at the time of diagnosis, is described. Physical, haematological, biochemical and urinary examinations, including measurement of endogenous creatinine clearance, were performed to assess renal function. Survey radiography, excretory urography, ultrasonography, computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance examinations were also used to confirm the absence of a kidney. The effect of kidney agenesis on renal function, evaluated on the basis of endogenous creatinine clearance, is discussed together with the benefits of the various imaging techniques to enable in vivo detection of renal abnormalities.
