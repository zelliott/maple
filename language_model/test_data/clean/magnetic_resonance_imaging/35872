Traumatic and degenerative changes in the meniscus can be demonstrated well by MRT, but the small size and complex anatomical structure of the menisci present practical problems. A correct understanding is only possible by images in several planes and good resolution, making the examination a lengthy procedure. A technique is therefore described using 3-D images and reconstruction of high-resolution films, which allows rapid examination of the menisci in optimal planes.
