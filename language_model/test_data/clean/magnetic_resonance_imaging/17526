The purpose of this report is to describe successful surgical treatment of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) in two patients presenting with depressed skull fractures over the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). The first case involved a 22-year-old patient who presented with depressed skull fracture overlying the posterior third of the SSS. Symptoms of BIH developed within 48 h. The second case involved a 33-year-old patient who presented with depressed skull fracture overlying the junction between the middle and posterior thirds of the SSS. Symptoms of BIH developed 1 month after. Although this patient presented with bilateral papilloedema, the less straightforward nature of his BIH symptoms prompted us to undertake further neuroradiological assessment by angiography with retrograde venous catheterization. A high-pressure gradient was found between venous flow upstream and downstream from the compressed zone. Both patients underwent surgical decompression in the lateral decubital position. Continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure was begun upon induction of general anaesthesia. High preoperative pressure declined immediately after elevation of the depressed zone. Bleeding was not a problem at any time during the procedure. Follow-up MRI and angio-MRI demonstrated total restoration of SSS patency. Benign intracranial hypertension is an uncommon complication of depressed skull fracture. Retrograde venous catheterization with pressure measurement can be a useful diagnostic adjunct. Surgical treatment is indicated in symptomatic patients. Based on the two cases reported, we now propose MRI venography in all patients presenting with symptoms of BIH and arteriography with retrograde venous catheterization when venous sinus stenosis exists.
