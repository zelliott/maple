We describe a 60-year-old man with a history of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome associated with intermittent painful ophthalmoplegia and a visual disturbance on the left side, who presented with signs and symptoms of severe hypoadrenalism and diabetes insipidus. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated enlargement of the hypophysis and infundibulum and left cavernous sinus. An endocrinologic study revealed anterior pituitary dysfunction and diabetes insipidus. The patient underwent a transsphenoidal biopsy which revealed chronic inflammation in the hypophysis, mucosa of the sphenoid sinus, and dura mater. The patient was treated with steroids that decreased the size of the hypophysis and infundibulum, but the symptoms of anterior pituitary insufficiency and diabetes insipidus have persisted. The chronic inflammation of the hypophysis and infundibulum is thought to have spread from the cavernous sinus.
