Aim of this research is the evaluation of an oncotropic drug in diagnostics of substernal goiter.

The radiodrug has noticed profit in the differential from neoplastic and colloidal tissue, even if in a few cases it has also demostrated affinity for the benign adenomas. When the fine aspirated needle biopsy has turned out inadwisable or not setting, the MIBI methodical has been of special help. The extent of the use of this radiodrug also to parathyroid and cardiac pathology has made the economical costs cheaper and promoted the routine use of the methodology.
