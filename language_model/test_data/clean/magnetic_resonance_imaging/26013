The association of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR2 allele with brain MRI signal abnormalities and with the development of MS was assessed in 178 patients enrolled in the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial. HLA haplotype DR2 was present in 85 (48%) of the 178 patients. Its presence was associated with increased odds of probable or definite MS at 5 years (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 3.67; p = 0.04). The association was most apparent among patients with signal abnormalities on baseline brain MRI.
