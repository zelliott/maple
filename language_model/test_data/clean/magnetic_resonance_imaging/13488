Magnetic resonance imaging of 30 normal volonteers' posterior fossae was performed on a CGR Magniscan machine with a magnetic field strength of 0.5 Tesla. We chose the inversion recovery signal with a Tr of 2,000 ms, a TE of 21 ms and an inverse time of 500 ms. This sequence gives a better definition of the grey matter, the white matter and the CSF. To study the brain stem we suggest 8 horizontal and 3 sagittal sections.
