Sublingual salivary gland neoplasms are extremely rare, accounting for only 0.3-1% of all epithelial salivary gland tumors. Most of the sublingual tumors are malignant, adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) being the most common histological types. The coexistence of two salivary gland tumors located in different major salivary glands is uncommon.

A rare case of two simultaneous tumors of the major salivary glands, one in the sublingual and the other in the contralateral parotid gland in a female patient is reported.

The diagnostic procedure followed, and the management of the patient, is outlined in the paper.
