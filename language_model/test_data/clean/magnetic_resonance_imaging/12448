Paraffinomas (also known as 'sclerosing lipogranulomas' or 'myospherulosis') are a widely acknowledged complication of cosmetic paraffin injections but they are rare following functional endoscopic sinus surgery.

Our first case features a 45-year-old woman presenting with a peri-ocular swelling two weeks after functional endoscopic sinus surgery. The procedure was complicated by a fractured lamina papyracea. A nasal packing with antibiotic ointment was left in situ. Initially, the inflammation was controlled successfully with corticosteroids but the swelling persists to this day. Our second case is a 45-year-old man who suffered from a recurrent swelling of the right eyelid after endoscopic sinus surgery. Multiple treatments with oral antibiotics and corticosteroids brought about no improvement. Debulking surgery was performed and a PDS film was placed between the peri-orbita and the bony orbital floor but the swelling recurred. The patient finally consulted a plastic surgeon as a last resort, but the reconstructive procedure only exacerbated the clinical picture. In both cases a biopsy was performed which established the foreign body reaction typical of a paraffinoma. At present, both patients still suffer from this condition.

The complete resection of a paraffinoma is seldom possible because of diffuse infiltration and recurrence is very likely. We therefore conclude that paraffin-based ointments should not be used with nasal packing after sinus surgery, especially when there has been a lesion involving the orbital wall.
