We ask the question whether the coding of categorical versus coordinate spatial relations depends on different neural networks showing hemispheric specialization or whether there is continuity between these two coding types. The 'continuous spatial coding' hypothesis would mean that the two coding types rely essentially on the same neural network consisting of more general-purpose processes, such as visuo-spatial attention, but with a different weighting of these general processes depending on exact task requirements. With event-related fMRI, we have studied right-handed male subjects performing a grid/no-grid visuo-spatial working memory task inducing categorical and coordinate spatial relations coding. Our data support the 'continuous spatial coding' hypothesis, indicating that, while based on the same fronto-parieto-occipital neural network than categorical spatial relations coding, the coding of coordinate spatial relations relies more heavily on attentional and executive processes, which could induce hemispheric differences similar to those described in the literature. The results also show that visuo-spatial working memory consists of a short-term posterior store with a capacity of up to three elements in the parietal and extrastriate cortices. This store depends on the presence of a visible space categorization and thus can be used for the coding of categorical spatial relations. When no visible space categorization is given or when more than three elements have to be coded, additional attentional and executive processes are recruited, mainly located in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex.
