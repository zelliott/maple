This case illustrates an unusual complication of neuroendoscopic third ventriculostomy.

A 30-year-old man with established hydrocephalus was treated with neuroendoscopic third ventriculostomy during which bleeding occurred from a vessel deep in the floor of the third ventricle. He subsequently had a third nerve palsy and developed frontal lobe infarction.

The complication was treated conservatively. The patient subsequently required shunting.

The cause of the infarction is discussed. The general issue of complications of this procedure is explored with a call for more open reporting of such occurrences.
