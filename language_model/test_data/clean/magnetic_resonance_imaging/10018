The authors used voxel-based morphometry to compare the patterns of brain atrophy in two variants of pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD): FTLD with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND) and FTLD with ubiquitin-only-immunoreactive neuronal changes (FTLD-U). Patterns of atrophy were distinct and different from each other. A localized pattern of frontal lobe atrophy was found in FTLD-MND with a more widespread pattern of atrophy affecting the frontal and temporal lobes in FTLD-U.
