The cranio-mandibular syndrome (CMS) is often secondary to an cranio-facial asymmetry (CFA); it associate a painful masticatory dysfunction syndrome with functional and aching clinical signs in relation with a functional torticollis required for oculo-labyrinthal equilibration maintenance. Our anatomical and functional MRI protocol uses tridimensional study of semi-circular canals (SCC) up relation to the medial cerebral axis (MCA), and permit to measure precisely these CFA and propose, with a multispecialist approach, an adapted treatment of the SCM. Application of MRI to SCC asymmetry looks to its future use for spatial intracranial referencial of cerebral structures.
