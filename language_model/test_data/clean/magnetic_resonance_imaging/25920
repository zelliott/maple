The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential utility of a nutritional support formula to serve as a practical means of enhancing the gastrointestinal tract on abdominal MR images. Nutritional support formula (Ensure Plus) was administered to 29 patients prior to abdominal MRI. Standard T1-weighted and T2-weighted pulse sequences were performed, in addition to fat suppression and inversion recovery sequences in selected patients. Images in these patients were evaluated for degree and uniformity of gastrointestinal tract enhancement and delineation of the bowel wall and pancreas. Results were compared with those obtained in 10 control patients. Marked enhancement of gastric contents was present in nearly all patients who received nutritional support formula on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences, with mild to moderate enhancement of small bowel and colon in most patients. Although gastrointestinal and respiratory motion artifacts often limited bowel wall delineation, excellent delineation of the gastric wall and pancreas was provided. Phantom experiments demonstrated that gastrointestinal tract enhancement with nutritional support formula is due to the paramagnetic trace elements, corn syrup, and lipid material it contains. Such a formula requires no preparation, is safe, inexpensive, palatable, readily available, and represents a practical means of enhancing the gastrointestinal tract on MRI.
