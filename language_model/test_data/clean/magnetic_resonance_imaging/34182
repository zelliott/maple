The role of hyperbaric oxygenation in the treatment of radiation-induced sequelae and chronic ulcer is well established. On the contrary, a possible cancer-causing or growth-enhancing effect by hyperbaric oxygenation was highly controversial. Herein, we present a 55-year-old Chinese woman with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix on her left inguinal area. She received concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by radical inguinal lymphadenectomy due to persistent tumor mass. The patient was complicated with severe radiation fibrosis and unhealed wounds, so she was treated with hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO). However, the patient died of complications of the disease after completing HBO therapy I month later and autopsy of the patient showed carcinomatosis of the abdominal cavity and lower abdominal wall. Because previous studies have been inconclusive regarding the effect of HBO on tumor cells, we reviewed the possible relation between the HBO and tumor cells.
