Peripheral nervous system (PNS) imaging is usually carried out by ultrasound and MRI. Thanks to its wide availability and excellent spatial resolution, ultrasound is a mature investigation with clearly established indications, particularly in entrapment syndromes and tumors. MRI is generally a second-line examination, which provides decisive additional information thanks to its excellent contrast resolution and its multiplanar abilities. This review describes the current methods for imaging the PNS, concentrating on acquisition techniques, normal results and basic pathological semiology. Ongoing and future developments are described in order to underline the forthcoming changes in this very dynamic field of musculoskeletal radiology.
