Osteocartilaginous exostoses are benign bone tumors frequently found in the metaphysis of long bones but rarely in the spine. Four patients with acute spinal cord decompensation due to vertebral exostoses spinal cord compression have been previously described in the literature. We report an additional case of rapidly evolving spinal cord compression due to a cervical osteochondroma in a patient with hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), also known as Bessel Hagen disease. Careful analysis of the 5 cases suggested to us that patients with HME should have a systematic spinal imaging screening, in order to prevent rapid neurological decompensation. A minimal risk surgical procedure can be performed at a time of election.
