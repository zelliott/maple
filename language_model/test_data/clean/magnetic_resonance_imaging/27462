To report a case of posterior microphthalmos caused by novel compound heterozygous mutations in the membrane-type frizzled-related protein (MFRP) gene.

A 9-year-old girl with posterior microphthalmos underwent a standard ophthalmological examination and genetic screening by direct sequencing.

The patient had a short axial length, high hyperopia, crowded optic discs, and dilation and tortuosity of the retinal vessels. No signs of retinitis pigmentosa were present. A diagnosis of posterior microphthalmos rather than nanophthalmos was made because the corneal diameter and anterior chamber depth were normal. Genetic analysis revealed two novel nonsense mutations in the MFRP gene, Q123X and W443X. Her parents were heterozygous carriers of one of the mutations.

Posterior microphthalmos can be caused by nonsense compound heterozygous mutations in the MFRP gene.
