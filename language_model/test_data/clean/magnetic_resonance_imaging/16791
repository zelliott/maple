Gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) is a relatively new hepatobiliary MRI contrast agent. It is increasingly used in adults to characterize hepatic masses, but there is little published describing its use in children. The purpose of this paper is to describe our pediatric MRI protocol as well as the imaging appearance of pediatric liver lesions using gadoxetate disodium. As a hepatocyte-specific MRI contrast agent, Gd-EOB-DTPA has the potential to improve characterization and provide a more specific diagnosis of pediatric liver masses.
