The number of newborn infants with congenital heart disease is relatively stable.However, because of marked advances in correction and palliation of these conditions,the great majority will survive into adult life, significantly increasing the number of such patients in our population. Most patients with congenital heart disease, treated or not,will require routine, continued medical observation and, therefore, many radiologists will become involved in their care. Not uncommonly, pertinent clinical information is not provided to the radiologist, particularly when the patient presents to an Emergency Room because of intercurrent disease. In order to interpret the chest film or CT examination and provide a pertinent report, the radiologist must be conversant with the patterns of the more common congenital cardiac anomalies as well as their post-operative appearances and potential complications.
