The purpose of our study was to retrospectively investigate the MRI findings (diameter, location, contour and margin, signal intensity characteristics, and enhancement patterns) in a series of eight patients with pathologically proven colloid carcinoma of the pancreas.

Colloid carcinomas of the pancreas appear as masses with lobulating contours, indiscrete margins, and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (n = 8). In addition, all patients who underwent dynamic studies (n = 4) showed peripheral and internal sponge-like or mesh-like progressive delayed contrast enhancement.
