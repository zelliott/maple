The choice of a surgical approach for multi-level cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is still a controversial issue. While most of the surgeons are still performing decompression by laminectomy, some are doing multi-level anterior decompression. Few neurosurgeons are performing decompression by corpectomy. We have treated 26 patients by median cervical corpectomy during the last 4 years. These patients were followed up for a mean period of 25 months. Twenty one (80%) patients had a good outcome, 2 patients remained unchanged and 3 expired. Review of the literature and our experience indicates that patients with CSM and OPLL should be operated by median cervical corpectomy (anterior approach).
