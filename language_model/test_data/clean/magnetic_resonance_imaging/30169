Structural and functional neuroimaging continues to play an increasing role in the presurgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy. In addition to its value in localizing the epileptogenic zone and eloquent cortex, neuroimaging is contributing to our understanding of mood comorbidity in epilepsy. Although the vast majority of research has focused on patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), neuroimaging studies of patients with extratemporal epilepsy and primary generalized epilepsy are increasing in number. In this review, structural and functional imaging modalities that have received considerable research attention in recent years are reviewed, and their strengths and limitations for understanding behavior in epilepsy are assessed. In addition, advances in multimodal imaging are discussed along with their potential application to the presurgical evaluation of patients with seizure disorders.
