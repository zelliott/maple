Four patients with findings compatible with the VATER association having a malformation of the central nervous system requiring neurosurgical intervention are reviewed. Each patient has a different neurosurgical lesion, one of which has not been hitherto described as occurring with the other anomalies of the association. We suggest that all patients with the VATER association be evaluated carefully for malformations having neurosurgical implications.
