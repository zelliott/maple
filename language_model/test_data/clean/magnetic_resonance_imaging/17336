The syndrome of iris coloboma, ptosis, hypertelorism, and mental retardation (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man -- OMIM # 243310), also known as the Baraitser-Winter syndrome, originally was described in a brother and sister and in an unrelated girl in 1988. Six additional individuals with a similar phenotype have been reported in the world literature. Microphthalmos, microcornea, and brain malformations were added to the phenotypic spectrum of this syndrome in 1995. We report a child who presented with the aforementioned findings. Eye examination revealed bilateral microphthalmos and typical iris, optic nerve, and choroidal colobomas. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated pachygyria and cortical atrophy.
