Myelofibrosis (MF) is a chronic disorder characterized by bone marrow evidence of myeloid metaplasia associated with reactive fibrosis, angiogenesis, and osteosclerosis. We report serum biochemistry, noninvasive markers of bone turnover, tetracycline-labeled bone histomorphometry, and bone densitometry (DXA) data of four men presenting with newly diagnosed biopsy-proven MF and osteosclerosis. The mechanisms and putative growth factors responsible for this syndrome are examined.
