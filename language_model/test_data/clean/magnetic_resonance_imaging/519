Venous varix of the volar digit (VVVD) is a rare condition that is usually described as a firm, blue, and painful mass. However, the clinical features of VVVD are still unclear. We treated a patient who had a firm, normal-skin-colored, and painless mass on the volar aspect of a digit. The mass was removed and was diagnosed as VVVD by histological examination. Magnetic resonance imaging was useful for assisting with the pre-operative diagnosis. We also review 11 previously reported cases.
