Fischer developed a scoring system in 1999 that made identifying malignnant lesions much easier for inexperienced radiologists. Our study was performed to assess whether this scoring system would help beginners to accurately diagnose breast lesions on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to assess the correlation between the magnetic resonance mammography Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (MRM BI-RADS) grade and the final diagnosis.

The lesion morphology and contrast kinetics of 63 masses in 41 patients were evaluated on MRI and accorded a MRM BI-RADS final assessment category using the Fischer scoring system. The accuracy was evaluated after the final diagnosis was obtained by tissue sampling and follow-up imaging.

There were 25 malignant and 30 benign lesions. Eight lesions were seen by MRI only and we could not verify their pathology since we did not have MR-guided biopsy facilities at the time of the study. On MR mammography, the proven carcinomatous lesions were characterized as BI-RADS category V in 16 (64%), category IV in 7 (28%), and category III in 2 (8%) lesions. Benign lesions were graded as category V in 3 (10%), category IV in 6 (20%), and category III in 3 (10%), category II in 10 (33%) and category I in 8 (27%) lesions. The MRM BI-RADS category accurately predicted malignancy in 92% and a benign pathology in 70% of the lesions. The overlap between the MRM features of chronic inflammatory lesions and carcinomas resulted in a lower accuracy in diagnosing benign as compared to malignant lesions.

The MRM BI-RADS lexicon using the Fischer scoring system is useful and has a high predictive value, especially for malignant breast lesions, and is easy to apply. Overlapping features between benign inflammatory and malignant lesions might yield a reduced accuracy in inflammatory pathologies.
