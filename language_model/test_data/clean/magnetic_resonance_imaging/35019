The objective of this article is to provide a practical review of the incremental benefit of MRI in the assessment of adnexal masses in pregnancy.

MRI can assist sonographic assessment of adnexal masses in pregnancy by depicting the characteristic findings of exophytic leiomyoma, red degeneration of leiomyoma, endometrioma, decidualized endometrioma, and massive ovarian edema. Accordingly, MRI should be considered as a useful adjunct when sonography is inconclusive or insufficient to guide management of adnexal masses discovered in pregnancy.
