A 35-year-old man experienced severe sensory loss, pseudoathetosis, and areflexia during recovery from a severe viral illness. Sensory nerve action potentials were absent, motor conduction velocities were mildly slowed, and blink reflexes were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormal signal within the central and dorsal aspects of the thoracic cord. Acute and convalescent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) titers suggested EBV as the etiology. Subacute sensory neuropathy, with peripheral and central nervous system involvement, is a rare complication of EBV infection.
