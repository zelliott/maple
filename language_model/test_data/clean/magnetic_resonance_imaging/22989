This article describes the relevant surgical detail and MR imaging appearance of common operations performed in the foot and ankle. To evaluate postsurgical patients critically, it is important to understand the primary clinical diagnosis, surgical treatment undergone, the interval since surgery, and patients' current clinical symptoms. Radiography is the most common imaging modality for evaluation of the postoperative ankle and foot. MR imaging may be useful for evaluating the soft tissues and osseous structures in the postsurgical foot and ankle.
