A 60-year-old male presented with bilateral papilledema. Neuroimaging showed a densely enhanced flat tumor within the interhemispheric region in the frontal and parietal lobes with sulcal obliteration and enhancement. There was no history of tuberculous infection. Histological examination of the excised tissue from the flat tumor within the interhemispheric region was consistent with tuberculoma. Multiple antituberculous agent therapy resolved the papilledema and reduced the tumor.
