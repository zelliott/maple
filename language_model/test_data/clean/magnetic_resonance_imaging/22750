A 30-year-old man presented with a supratentorial malignant glioma manifesting as isolated progressive left oculomotor nerve paresis. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed an intra-axial tumor in the left temporal lobe, extending to the basal and prepontine cisterns, and compressing the brainstem. The tumor was removed subtotally. The histological diagnosis was anaplastic astrocytoma. Malignant glioma with exophytic growth in the temporal lobe should be considered in the differential diagnosis of isolated oculomotor nerve paresis.
