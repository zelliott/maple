Stable and cytocompatible hybrid PEGylated micelles with multimodal imaging capabilities are described. The F3O4-encapsulated polymeric micelles composed of cores containing magnetic nanoparticles and polyethylene glycol (PEG) shells are synthesized by self-assembly of amphiphilic poly(HFMA-co-VBK)-g-PEG copolymers and oleic acid stabilized Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles in the core produce T2-weighted MR imaging functionalities, whereas the small fluorescent monomer carbazole in the polymer shell introduces good fluorescent properties. The multifunctional micelles exhibit excellent paramagnetic properties with the maximum saturation magnetization of 9.61 emu/g and transverse relaxivity rate of 157.44 mM(-1) S(-1). In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies reveal enhanced contrast between the liver and spleen. Fluorescence spectra show characteristic emission peaks from carbazole at 350 nm and 365 nm and vivid blue fluorescence can be observed by 2-photon confocal scanning laser microscopy (CLSM). In vivo optical imaging demonstrates the unique fluorescent characteristics of the Fe3O4-encapsulated polymeric micelles in the liver and spleen and the excellent multifunctional properties suggest potential clinical use as nanocarriers in magnetic resonance imaging and optical imaging.
