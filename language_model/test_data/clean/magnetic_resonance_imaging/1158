To assess the possibility of differentiating between completely hyalinized leiomyomas and ordinary leiomyomas by using diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (DWI) employing very small b-factors (b = 1.51 and 55.3 seconds/mm(2)) in comparison with three-phase dynamic MRI.

The subjects were 25 patients with 52 histopathologically confirmed uterine leiomyomas. All leiomyomas were divided into two histopathologic subtypes (5 completely hyalinized leiomyomas and 47 ordinary leiomyomas). For each leiomyoma, the enhancement index (EI) at three-phase dynamic MRI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were obtained and then compared.

The EIs at second and third dynamic phases clearly differentiated the two types of leiomyomas without overlap of values. ADCs also clearly differentiated the two types of leiomyomas without overlap of values. Moreover, there were significant positive correlations between ADCs and EIs at all dynamic phases (r = 0.41-0.50, P < 0.01).

Not only three-phase dynamic MRI but also DWI with very small b-factors could be useful for differentiating completely hyalinized leiomyomas from ordinary leiomyomas.
