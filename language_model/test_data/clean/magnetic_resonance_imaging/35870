21 patients with suspected, or known, abnormalities of the feet or ankles were examined by magnetic resonance tomography. The indications were: osteochondritis dissecans of the talus (three cases), osteomyelitis (three cases), suspected tumour recurrence (three cases), undiagnosed pain (six cases) and a further miscellaneous six cases. Although most of these problems could have been solved with other imaging methods, magnetic resonance tomography did add some valuable diagnostic information. Because of its ability to demonstrate bones, synovia, tendons, vessels and subcutaneous fascia in a multi-directional manner, it is superior to all other imaging methods. It saves time by making it unnecessary to use a variety of diagnostic procedures.
