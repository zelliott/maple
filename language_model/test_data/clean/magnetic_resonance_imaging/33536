Hepatic hydatic cysts are a very common finding in the endemic areas like Australia, the Middle East, New Zealand, South Africa and in some countries bordering the Mediterranean. Immigration has increased the finding of this pathology in some European and North American areas. Our purpose is to show possibilities and limits using US, TC and RM to demonstrate the presence of parasitic hepatic localizations and their evolution after therapy.
