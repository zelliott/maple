Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the perceptual, motor, and cognitive capacities in humans is of increasing importance for basic and clinical neurosciences. The explanatory power of current fMRI techniques could be greatly expanded, however, if the pattern of the neuronal connections between the active cortical areas could likewise be visualized. In this study, we acquired blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals during the stimulation of subjects with a set of localizer stimuli for cortical visual areas. Subsequently, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from the same subjects were obtained, and the activation areas identified through fMRI were utilized as seeding points for 3D DTI fiber reconstruction algorithms. The methods developed in this study have the potential to lay a foundation for in vivo neuroanatomy and the ability for noninvasive longitudinal studies of brain development.
