Primary mucinous carcinoma of the skin is a slow-growing tumor with a high recurrence rate. To improve the recognition of the clinical entity, two cases of this tumor were reported and were investigated histopathologically and histochemically. Both patients showed no evidence of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma int he breast or gastrointestinal tract. This tumor should be resected with wide margins. MRI is very helpful to plan the surgical margin.
