Although Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome is a rare condition with a reported incidence of 1/4500 female live births, it represents the second most common cause of primary amenorrhea and has psychologically devastating consequences. The radiologist plays a pivotal role in both making the accurate initial diagnosis of this condition and assessing findings that may contribute to treatment planning. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the capabilities of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis and management of this syndrome with emphasis on the relevant clinical and surgical findings and to describe potential associated abnormalities and differential diagnosis.
