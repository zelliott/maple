In evaluating the success of deep brain stimulation (DBS), the benefit for the patient is the most important criteria. Nevertheless, correct placement of electrodes should also be determined in terms of their anatomic position. Therefore, we propose a suite of different imaging modalities and further processing, which leads to an exact anatomic and statistically comparable documentation of electrode localization. Forty-three consecutive patients with a total of 85 implanted DBS electrodes were evaluated with respect to postoperative imaging. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T1-MRI) was performed in all patients, 34 patients received T2-MRI, in 18 patients stereotactic X-ray of the scull was performed in anteroposterior and lateral projections, whereas 6 patients were additionally evaluated by pre- and postoperative MR-image fusion between T1-data sets and calculation of coordinates for electrode contacts. In T1-MRI, the artefacts of each electrode contact could be delineated in relation to anatomic reference structures, whereas T2-MRI allowed reproducibly for delineation of electrode artefacts within subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus pars interna. By MR-image fusion it could be shown that the difference between planned target coordinates and coordinates of the active electrode contact ranged below 1 mm except for the z axis. The comparison with values obtained from stereotactic X-ray confirmed these results. The sequential and complementary use of the described imaging modalities and further image processing provide clinically reliable and statistically comparable results to prove the exact anatomic electrode positioning in DBS in addition to the objective and subjective improvements of the patients' symptoms.
