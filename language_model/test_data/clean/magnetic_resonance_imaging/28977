We studied the effect of the cortical projection from the basal forebrain on the cerebral cortical metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) with [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose. Unilateral damage of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) did not cause a permanent reduction of cortical metabolism: recovery was observed 4 weeks after the operation. Destruction of the contralateral side after recovery from unilateral damage produced persistent bilateral suppression of glucose metabolism, with partial recovery. We speculate that recovery from the unilateral NBM lesions is partly ascribable to the cholinergic projection from the contralateral NBM, and partly due to non-cholinergic systems, and conclude that bilateral damage might be responsible for persistent cortical glucose metabolism suppression.
