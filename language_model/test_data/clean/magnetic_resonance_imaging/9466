This article provides an overview of imaging modalities that aid in diagnosing, staging, and assessing therapeutic response in prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in American men and the second leading cause of cancer death among men. Prostate cancer is difficult to diagnose in early stages, and advanced disease often recurs after treatment. To localize sites of recurrence many imaging modalities have been used with varying success. This article presents case studies of PET scanning using carbon 11 acetate and discusses intravenously infused ascorbate, a complementary and alternative medicine therapy for prostate cancer.
