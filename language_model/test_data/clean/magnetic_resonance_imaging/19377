In 95% of right handed individuals the left hemisphere is dominant for speech and language function. The evidence for this is accumulated primarily from clinical populations. We investigated cortical topography of language function and lateralization in a sample of the right handed population using functional magnetic resonance imaging and two lexical-semantic paradigms. Activated cortical language networks were assessed topographically and quantitatively by using a lateralization index. As a group, we observed left hemispheric language dominance. Individually, the lateralization index varied continuously from left hemisphere dominant to bilateral representation. In males, language primarily lateralized to left, and in females, approximately half had left lateralization and the other half had bilateral representation. Our data indicate that a previous view of female bilateral hemispheric dominance for language (McGlone, 1980. Sex differences in human brain asymmetry: a critical survey. Behav Brain Sci 3:215-263; Shaywitz et al., 1995. Sex differences in the functional organization of the brain for language. Nature 373:607-609) simplifies the complexity of cortical language distribution in this population. Analysis of the distribution of the lateralization index in our study allowed us to make this difference in females apparent.
