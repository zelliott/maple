A 37- year old male with a long history of a left orbital venous/lympathic malformation presented with ocular injection, increased proptosis and reduced left vision. Angiography demonstrated a carotid cavernous dural AV fistula combined with a concomitant venous/lymphatic malformation. After attempts at transvenous embolization, a direct uncomplicated transorbital puncture of the cavernous sinus via a lateral orbitotomy was performed with complete resolution of ocular symptoms.
