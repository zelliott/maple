A group of 69 patients aged 60-80 years with brain tumours were analysed, estimating the surgical risk at the time of qualification for operations. Surgical treatment was given to 36 patients limiting it to lobectomy of the part of the brain containing the greater part of the tumour. The peri-operational mortality was 8.3%. The decision on surgical treatment of old age patients with brain tumours depends on many factors, both medical and sociopsychological.
