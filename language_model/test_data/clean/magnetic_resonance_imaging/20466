A 5-year-old previously healthy boy presented with typical findings of Guillain-Barré syndrome and unilateral tonic pupil. He was placed on mechanical ventilation for 35 days for respiratory failure. Plasmapheresis and two courses of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy were given to the patient, and he experienced stepwise recovery from his illness. This case of acute motor axonal neuropathy type Guillain-Barré syndrome is novel in that the cause was established as ingestion of a toxic solanaceous plant, angel's trumpet (Brugmansia suaveolens; syn. Datura suaveolens). Understanding the signs and symptoms of angel's trumpet toxicity can allow for early diagnosis and proper case management.
