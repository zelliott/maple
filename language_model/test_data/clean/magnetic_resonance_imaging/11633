Only seven cases of a sphenoid mucocele occurring after transsphenoidal hypophysectomy have been previously reported in the world literature. In this article, we report a new case, which occurred in a 67-year-old man. The sphenoid sinus mucocele developed 12 years following transsphenoidal hypophysectomy and adjunctive radiotherapy. The patient was successfully managed with incision and drainage. Although transsphenoidal hypophysectomy is a common operation, this particular complication appears to be rare or at least under-reported. Sphenoid sinus mucocele deserves consideration in the differential diagnosis of a sphenoidal parasellar mass in a patient who has undergone an earlier transsphenoidal hypophysectomy.
