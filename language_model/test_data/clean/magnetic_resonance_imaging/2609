Chester-Erdheim disease is a rare form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis consisting of disseminated xanthogranulomatous infiltration and fibrosis that primarily involves the bones, visceral organs and systemic fatty spaces. Involvement of the central nervous system is variable, and neuropathological features have seldom been documented. We report the neuropathological findings in 3 autopsy cases. One patient had radiological and pathological bone changes characteristic of Chester-Erdheim disease. Neuropathology revealed multiple characteristic xanthogranulomas disseminated in the cerebral hemispheres, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and brainstem. The second patient presented first with cutaneous lesions characteristic of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. She subsequently developed bone abnormalities suggestive of Chester-Erdheim disease, which was confirmed by autopsy, raising the possibility of a common spectrum of histiocytosis including both diseases. Gross examination of the brain was normal, however, microscopy showed infiltration of the brain by characteristic non-Langerhans cell xanthogranulomas. The third patient presented with systemic features characteristic of Chester-Erdheim disease. Neurological signs included gait disturbance, seizures and confusion. Examination of the brain did not show any histiocytic infiltration, but did show changes suggestive of Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome. Association of Chester-Erdheim disease and Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome has not been previously reported. The relationship between both conditions is unclear.
