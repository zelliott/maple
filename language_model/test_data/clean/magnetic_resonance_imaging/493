Fibroadenomas are hyperplasia arising from the terminal ductulo-lobular unit and adjacent tissue of the breast. As single fibroadenoma, even giant ones are easily manageable, however multiple fibroadenomas pose a particular challenge.

In 1971, Liacyr Ribeiro described his new technique for reduction mammaplasty. Four years later, the first 20 cases were published. This technique was introduced by Rezai in oncoplastic surgery. With free hand design, preoperative marking is performed- and the inferior pedicle modulated.

Selective resection of more than seventy fibroadenomas was performed on two patients. The technique allowed a modelling of the breast like a mastopexy through the inferior pedicle.

Multiple fibroadenomas of the breast are safely removable with the Ribeiro technique modified by Rezai.
