Reptimed is a novel, species-conserved, bone marrow-derived molecule which possesses anti-neoplastic activity. Previously, we established an orthotopic murine bladder tumor (MBT-2) model and reported accurate documentation of the presence and the extent of intravesical involvement of bladder tumor implants using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (1). Herein, we investigated the activity of exogenously administered Reptimed in the MBT-2 model.

Intravesicular and intraperitoneal administration of Reptimed concurrently with and following transurethral tumor cell implantation was performed and MBT-2 tumor response was assessed at several time points post tumor implant.

Serial MRI scans of Reptimed-treated mice at days 14 to 33 post tumor transplant revealed significant inhibition of bladder tumor growth with no significant tumor growth observed by MRI on day 33 post-implant. The corresponding histological examination of the whole mount bladder sections revealed similar inhibitory effects of Reptimed with respect to the topography and depth of intravesical tumor involvement. In contrast, control, untreated bladders revealed extensive exophytic tumors with deeply invasive transitional cell carcinoma.

These studies demonstrate the anti-tumor effect of Reptimed and highlight its importance as a potential therapy for cancer.
