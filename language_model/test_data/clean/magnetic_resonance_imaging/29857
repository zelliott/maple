Presently article carried out an up-to-date revision of the literature on the diagnosis of the Parkinson's disease, considering the clinical aspects, those of neuroradiology and the genetic diagnosis.

The Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and despite of the important development that has taken place in the last years as much in molecular genetics and neuroradiology, the diagnosis of this disease continuous being eminently clinical, the appropriate knowledge of the calls 'cardinal signs' and its application in the diagnosis increases the possibility that this it is guessed right, regrettably the definitive approach is only obtained in the autopsy. The genetic studies and of neuroradiology mainly are presented as tools for a more reliable differential diagnosis with other parkinsonism forms and the knowledge of these techniques can be useful in the taking of therapeutic decisions or of the affected patient's integral treatment. They have also been different monogenic forms in origin to the sporadic form of the illness.

The knowledge and search of the preponderant clinical signs increases the capacity of diagnostic of the illness, in the same way the appropriate use of additional methods of investigation, mainly in the differential diagnosis.
