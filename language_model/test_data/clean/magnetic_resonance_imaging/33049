To report the detection of secondary neurotransmitter abnormalities in a group of SPG11 patients and describe treatment with l-dopa/carbidopa and sapropterin.

Case reports.

National Institutes of Health in the Undiagnosed Disease Program; Children's National Medical Center in the Myelin Disorders Bioregistry Program.

Four SPG11 patients with a clinical picture of progressive spastic paraparesis complicated by extrapyramidal symptoms and maculopathy.

L-Dopa/carbidopa and sapropterin.

3/4 patients presented secondary neurotransmitter abnormalities; 4/4 partially responded to L-dopa as well as sapropterin.

In the SPG11 patient with extrapyramidal symptoms, a trial of L-dopa/carbidopa and sapropterin and/or evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid neurotransmitters should be considered.
