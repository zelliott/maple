Sporadic cases have been reported of ectopic thymic tissue formed along the path of embryologic descent from the mandibular region to the mediastinum, usually manifesting as an asymptomatic mass. Here is reported the case of an 8-month-old boy with a tender palpable mass in the right upper lateral neck. Preoperative posteroanterior chest radiograph revealed normal structures in the mediastinum superior including the thymus. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 4-cm x 4-cm soft-tissue mass in the left submandibular region. Surgical resection was performed and histopathologic examination showed that the mass was composed of thymic lymphoid tissue and epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical features included positive expression of LCA, CKpan, EMA, CD20 and CD43 antibodies. The clinical 14-month follow up was negative and the child was growing normally after operation. Ectopic thymus in the submandibular region is uncommon; surgical treatment is the definitive means of pathological diagnosis. Prior to surgery, the presence of a mediastinal thymus should be confirmed to prevent the risk of a total thymectomy.
