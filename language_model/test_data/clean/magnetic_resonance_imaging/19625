The authors report an unusual manifestation of extracranial vertebral artery dissection (VAD), presenting with a predominantly motor radicular manifestation. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the intramural hematoma in the dissected vessel wall, compressing mainly the segmental motor root and, to a lesser degree, the sensory ganglion. In the digital subtraction angiography (DSA), a circumscribed narrowing of the incriminated vessel was demonstrated. Color-coded Duplex imaging (CDDI) revealed complete recanalization after a few days of anticoagulation treatment. Complete neurologic recovery was seen after 3 months. Considering the MRI data, the likely pathogenetic mechanism was compression of the nerve root by the intramural hematoma. The synopsis with similar cases in the literature points to the characteristic features, i.e., the association of neck pain with radicular motor deficit and the absence of degenerative disk disease. The respective syndrome should raise the suspicion of vertebral artery dissection, especially in young individuals.
