Clinical myocardial involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus is rare. Lupus myocarditis is usually not detected until significant decrease in myocardial function becomes clinically evident. This case report describes MR imaging of lupus myocarditis that was used for diagnosis and follow up in a patient who declined cardiac biopsy. We also review the literature related to myocardial imaging by MRI.
