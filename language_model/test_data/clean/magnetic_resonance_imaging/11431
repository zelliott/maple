Voluntary palatal tremor in a patient with essential palatal tremor induced activation predominantly within regions corresponding to the inferior olive, adjacent brainstem, and dentate nuclei. Finger movements elicited only ipsilateral lobular cerebellar activation, suggesting a dysfunctional nuclear activation by palatal tremor.
