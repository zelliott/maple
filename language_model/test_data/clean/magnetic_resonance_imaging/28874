In lateral ankle ligament tears, the anterior talofibular ligament ruptures most commonly, often in conjunction with the calcaneofibular ligament. The posterior talofibular ligament is rarely affected. Associated injuries at the adjacent ligamentous structures or at the articular cartilage of the ankle commonly occur. The diagnosis is established clinically with the anterolateral drawer sign and an increased lateral talar tilt. Stress radiographs in two planes demonstrate talar tilt and anterior displacement of the talus, in comparison to the unaffected side. Magnetic resonance imaging provides an early diagnosis of concomitant injuries. Simple, acute lateral ankle ligament tears are treated non-operatively. Surgery is indicated in dislocated bone avulsions and in chondral or osteochondral fractures. A recurrent tear in an athletic patient should also be treated operatively. Athletic endeavours, the number of torn ligaments and patient age are no useful indicators for surgical treatment. Conservative treatment consist of oedema therapy, immobilization of the fibular ligaments with as little compromise of ankle joint function as possible, and rehabilitation with muscle strengthening and proprioception training. During surgery, the ligament stumps are reapproximated in anatomic position, reinforced with local tissue if necessary, and the articular surface is examined for concomitant injuries.
