A unilateral adrenal tumour was incidentally detected in a 39-year-old woman with no characteristic features of Cushing's syndrome. Basal levels of glucocorticoids were within normal limits. However, abnormal pattern of plasma cortisol and ACTH was observed. The dexamethasone suppression test and the metyrapone test showed also abnormal response. Adrenocortical scintigram demonstrated high accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical in the tumour region alone. Final diagnosis was "pre-Cushing's syndrome" and a solitary adenoma was removed from the left adrenal gland.
