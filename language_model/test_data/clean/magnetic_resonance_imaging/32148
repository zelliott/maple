Tourette syndrome is a common neurologic disorder with close ties to obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The majority of patients improve spontaneously as they near adulthood. Most others are effectively treated with pharmacologic agents, although these therapies fail for an unfortunate few. For patients debilitated by the disease despite medical therapy, surgery can become an important option.
