Leydig tumour is rare and there are only three cases with metastatic disease reported.

A 52 year-old Caucasian male was admitted, on emergency basis to the Orthopaedic Department with six weeks history of increasing midthoracic back pain, change in gait, poor balance, subjective weakness and numbness of the lower trunk and legs. MRI scan showed change in the signal intensity of T4 and T5 vertebral body but their height were maintained. Urgent T4 and T5 corpectomies, decompression of the spinal cord and reconstruction of the vertebral bodies were performed followed by radiotherapy. Neurological status significantly improved with a mild residual numbness over the dorsum of the right foot. The histology of the excised tumour was identical to the primary. At 2 years follow-up visit the patient is neurologically stable and disease free without other organs metastases.

This is the first case in English literature, which shows that spinal metastases could occur even in the early stage of Leydig cell tumour, without other organs involvement. Aggressive surgical management of spinal metastases combined with post operative radiotherapy can give a better chance for long survivorship.
