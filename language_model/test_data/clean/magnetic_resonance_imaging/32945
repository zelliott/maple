Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), also named sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a rare, idiopathic, and benign disorder that classically presents as a painless massive bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. In cases of extranodal presentations, such as cutaneous RDD, it may not involve the classic manifestation. The diagnosis is usually made by histopathologic analysis. Surgery is suggested in the cases of significant cosmetic deformity or when there is fatal or functional obstruction. We reported a case of extranodal RDD that recurred in the infraorbital region postoperatively.
