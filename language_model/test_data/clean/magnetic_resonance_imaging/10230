A 38-year-old woman presented with blurred vision and "jumping" of the right eye for 7 months. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head was normal. Intermittent intorsion of the right eye was noted on examination, consistent with superior oblique myokymia. She was initially treated with carbamazepine but stopped after becoming light-headed. The diagnosis and treatment of superior oblique myokymia are discussed.
