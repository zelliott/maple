The aim was to evaluate how often MRI can detect the meniscofemoral ligament and if there is any relationship with the presence of lateral meniscal tears. Sagittal and coronal MR images of 138 patients with arthroscopically proven meniscal tears were included in this study. MR images were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of a meniscofemoral ligament and a lateral meniscal tear. The chi 2 test was used for statistical analysis. Either one or both meniscofemoral ligaments were shown in 114 (83%) of 138 patients on MR images. In 61 cases with a lateral meniscal tear, the meniscofemoral ligament was present in 82% (50/61) and absent in 18% (11/61). In 77 cases without lateral meniscal tear, the meniscofemoral ligament was present in 83% (64/77) and absent in 17% (13/77). A significant correlation was not established between the meniscofemoral ligament and lateral meniscal tear (p = 0.85).
