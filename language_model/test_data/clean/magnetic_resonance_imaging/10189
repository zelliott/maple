Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method was developed to investigate the pattern and temporal relationship in neuronal pathways of brain and spinal cord. Signal intensity changes correlating with stimulation patterns were observed simultaneously in the rat spinal cord and brain using fMRI at 9.4 T. Electrical stimulation of the forepaw was used to elicit activity. A quadrature volume RF coil covering both brain and the cervical spinal cord was used. Sets of fast spin echo (FSE) images were acquire simultaneously for both brain and spinal cord fMRI. Experiments were repeated in single animal and across animals. Activities within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and within the somatosensory cortex were observed consistently within each animal as well as across animals.
