Nasal fractures are a common complaint familiar to all otolaryngologists. Sinonasal primary Ewing's sarcomas are extremely rare. The case of a 9-year-old boy is presented whose nasal fracture and subsequent lateral nasal wall hematoma revealed an underlying Ewing's sarcoma. There are several unusual features in the history and clinical course of this patient. Following biopsies, immunohistochemistry proved essential in distinguishing a Ewing's sarcoma from other small cell tumours. It is important that a seemingly common condition can be the first presentation of a less common, more sinister pathology.
