A congenital fistula of the left circumflex coronary artery with large aneurysmal sacculations and drainage into the vena cava superior is reported in an asymptomatic black adult female. An indicator dilution curve excluded a significant left-to-right shunt. In addition, the patient had a large fusiform aneurysm of the superior vena cava with maximal extension in the anterior upper mediastinum. Transesophageal Doppler echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging were complementary diagnostic tools, the first for clearly visualizing coronary anatomy and shunt, the second for accurate imaging of the aneurysmal vena cava superior in the upper mediastinum.
