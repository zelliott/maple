Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, idiopathic, necrotizing, and non-infectious ulcerating skin disease included among the neutrophilic dermatoses. It rarely affects the eye, orbit, and/or ocular adnexa. We describe one case of PG affecting both orbits and the lacrimal sac in a patient with Crohn's disease.
