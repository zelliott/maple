MRI has assumed a major role in investigating disorders of the knee, especially internal derangement. We correlated the MRI report and arthroscopic findings of 18 patients with suspected meniscal or ligament injury. The results are presented and compared with other series. A particularly important asset of MRI is its very high negative predictive value.
