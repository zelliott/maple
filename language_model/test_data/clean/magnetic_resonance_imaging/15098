The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of the phagocytic activity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neutrophils that are mannan coated with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (M-SPION).

Human neutrophils were divided into control and LPS groups. The neutrophils were labeled with M-SPION and dextran-coated SPION. After labeling of M-SPION, the mean signal intensity (SI) of the LPS group was significantly lower than that of the control group.

The labeling of both control and LPS groups with M-SPION showed significantly lower SI than those labeled with D-SPION. After labeling with M-SPION, the intracellular iron uptake of neutrophil in Prussian blue staining was markedly demonstrated in the LPS group, but not in the control group. M-SPION was more effective than D-SPION in the labeling of neutrophils in vitro.

The in vitro labeling technique of LPS neutrophil with M-SPION on MR imaging could be developed into a diagnostic method of LPS-induced neutrophils.
