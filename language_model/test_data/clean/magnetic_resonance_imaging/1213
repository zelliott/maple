A two-dimensional rapid extended coverage (REX) rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) pulse sequence for simultaneous multisection double inversion-recovery (DIR) black-blood vessel wall magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was developed. Aortic vessel wall MR imaging was performed in five healthy subjects (mean age, 33 years +/- 4 [SD]) and five patients with atherosclerotic disease (mean age, 67 years +/- 11.7). Shortening of blood inversion time and imaging of multiple sections after single DIR block resulted in simultaneous acquisition of up to 20 aortic wall sections in less than 1 minute (spatial resolution, 0.97 x 0.97 x 3 mm(3)). Higher signal-to-noise ratios per unit time per section (16.0 +/- 2.45 vs 7.5 +/- 1.10, P <.05), no significant changes in contrast-to-noise ratios (15.0 +/- 5.3 vs 20.1 +/- 3.9, P >.05), and 17-fold improvement in acquisition time compared with those at conventional single-section DIR RARE imaging was achieved. Use of the REX method significantly shortened aortic imaging acquisition times without degrading image quality.
