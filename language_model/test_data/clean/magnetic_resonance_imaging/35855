Segmental intensity differences (SIDs) in hepatic parenchyma free of tumor were noted in six patients with hepatic masses (hepatocellular carcinoma in five and metastatic liver cancer in one). Areas of SID were homogeneous in intensity. The intensity of the affected region was high in all six patients on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and low in two on T1-weighted images. Three of five patients examined with plain computed tomography (CT) had corresponding segmental areas of low attenuation. Angiograms obtained in five patients showed occlusion of the intrahepatic portal vein, segmental staining corresponding to the region of the SID, or both. Twelve of 82 patients examined with MR imaging and angiography had similar findings on angiograms, and ten of them had abnormal intensity of anatomic distribution around or beside the liver tumors on MR images. MR imaging may be more sensitive than plain CT in the detection of secondary changes caused by intrahepatic portal flow stoppage.
