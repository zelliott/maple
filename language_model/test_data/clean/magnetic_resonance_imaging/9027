We report the case of a 55-year-old woman with thymoma diagnosed after finding of extra limbic encephalitis. She presented neurologic symptoms as seizure and aphasia; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed multiple lesions located in insular, parietal and temporal lobes (in cortical and sub-cortical area). Brain biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of encephalitis and CT-scan of the thorax showed an anterior mediastinal mass suspected for thymoma. The patient was submitted to thymectomy through a median sternotomy and we assisted to secondary reduction of cerebral lesions and total remission of symptoms.
