To retrospectively determine the safety of cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed early (<14 days) after coronary stent implantation in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

This HIPPA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board; the informed consent requirement was waived. Consecutive patients with AMI who underwent cardiac MR imaging (study group) shortly after stent implantation (median, 3 days) were compared with control subjects who did not undergo MR imaging and were matched for clinical factors and angiographic extent of coronary disease. A 1.5-T MR imager was used to evaluate cine function, perfusion, and viability. Rates of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization 30 days and 6 months after stent implantation were compared with chi(2) analysis.

The study group consisted of 66 patients (median age, 56 years; 17 women) with 97 stents, 38 (39%) of which were drug eluting. The control group included 124 patients (median age, 58 years; 23% women) with 197 stents, 21 (10.7%) of which were drug eluting. There was no significant (P = .13) difference in the combined end point of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization between the study (2.0% [95% confidence interval: 0.0%, 4.5%]) and control (6.5% [95% confidence interval: 1.6%, 11.3%]) groups at 30-day follow-up. The event-free survival rate at 6-month follow-up was 91% in the study group and 83.7% in the control group (P = .18). Considering the end points separately, there was no difference in the event rate at 30-day or 6-month follow-up between groups. No adverse cardiovascular events occurred in patients with drug-eluting stents who underwent MR imaging.

Cardiac MR imaging performed shortly after AMI and percutaneous revascularization with bare metal or drug-eluting stents appears safe. The risk of adverse cardiovascular events is low and similar to that in patients who do not undergo MR imaging.
