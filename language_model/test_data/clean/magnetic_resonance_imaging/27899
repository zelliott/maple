The authors report a rare case of cervical spinal neurinoma in a patient who presented with symptoms originating from hydrocephalus. Her symptoms improved after a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted, although progressive quadraparesis appeared when she began to walk. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cervical tumor. When it was removed, the patient's quadraparesis improved. Associated spinal tumors should be considered in the treatment of hydrocephalus of unknown origin.
