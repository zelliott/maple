Unilateral dilatation of the lateral ventricle is a rare condition. The most common causes are tumors of the lateral ventricles or in the area of the third ventricle, acute or chronic inflammatory gliosis, cysticercosis or congenital atresia of the foramen of Monro. We report a case of asymmetrical dilatation of the lateral ventricle in an adult patient presenting with a raised intracranial pressure syndrome caused by narrowing of the foramen of Monro which was occluded by a thin membrane. The patient underwent successful endoscopic fenestration of the Foramen of Monro.
