To evaluate the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with clinical suspicion of scaphoid fractures and normal initial plain radiographs.

MR imaging was performed within 7 days after trauma in 42 patients with clinical suspicion of scaphoid fractures and normal plain radiographs. T1-weighted spin-echo, T2*-weighted gradient-echo, and short inversion time inversion-recovery (STIR) sequences were performed. MR images were evaluated independently by two radiologists. Six-week follow-up radiographs were used as a standard to diagnose fractures.

MR imaging depicted occult fractures of the scaphoid bone in 14 patients (33%), the capitate bone in four (10%), the trapezium in one (2%), and the distal radius in two (5%). All wrist fractures were detected with a combination of STIR and T1-weighted spin-echo sequences. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of radiographically occult fractures of the wrist were 100% each for the first and 95% and 100%, respectively, for the second radiologist with an almost perfect interobserver agreement (K = 0.953).

MR imaging has a high sensitivity for detection of fractures of the scaphoid bone and wrist not evident on plain radiographs and may enable early diagnosis and treatment.
