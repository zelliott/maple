To show the characteristic findings of testicular ultrasound and MR imaging in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and testicular adrenal remnants.

Male patient with congenital adrenal hyperplasia presenting with azoospermia. Testicular ultrasound showed heteroecogenic nodular lesions in both testicles. In view of the past medical history of the patient suspect of adrenal tissue remnants was raised. Testicular MRI findings supported the diagnosis. Regression of the intratesticular masses after glucocorticosteroid treatment confirmed the disease.

The presence of a testicular mass in a patient with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may pose a diagnostic dilemma in relation to perform or not testicular biopsy or orchIectomy to identify it. The combination of imaging diagnostic tests such as testicular ultrasound and MRI, the medical history of congenital adrenal hyperplasia and the regression of the lesions after administration of glucocorticosteroids allow to identify this pathologic entity without performance of other invasive procedures.
