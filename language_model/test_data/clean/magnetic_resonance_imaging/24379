Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by the development of multiple peripheral nerve sheath tumors, the majority of which are benign neurofibromas. However, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) occur with a 10Â % lifetime risk in patients with NF1, often developing within a neurofibroma. When clinical suspicion for an MPNST arises, imaging with FDG PET and MRI is performed to characterize a peripheral tumor for potential malignancy. In this report, we describe a patient with NF-1 who had two peripheral tumors with similar features by PET, both suspicious for MPNST, but differing features by MRI, one of which was subsequently determined to be an MPNST and the second to be a schwannoma.
