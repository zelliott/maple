With the routine use of computed tomographic imaging, intrinsic involvement of the genitourinary tract in newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is seen in as many as 10 percent of patients. Incidental discovery of an extranodal, extra-lymphatic lesion in the genitourinary tract without clinical or radiographic evidence of disease elsewhere, however, is an uncommon occurrence. The clinical presentation and imaging findings in 4 patients with initial manifestation of lymphoma isolated to the kidney, ureter, bladder, and adrenals, respectively, are presented. These patients had no evidence of lymphoma elsewhere, and imaging studies mimicked the more common neoplasms affecting these organs.
