The purpose of our study was to determine the changes in the size of the edema observed on MRI scans and its relation to the activity pain of the patient and the rest pain in bone marrow edema (BME). A total of 51 patients were followed up at 3-month intervals for a period of 1 year. During the follow-ups, MRI scans of the patients' knees were obtained; the scores obtained on the Stanmore functional rating scale and visual analog scale were determined. The changes in these parameters and the correlation between them were examined. The following are the observations recorded during the bone marrow edema follow-ups: the size of the edema as observed on MRI scans decreased, and the activity pain and the rest pain decreased. While there is a correlation between the decrease in the edema size observed on MRI scans and decrease in the activity pain, there is no correlation between the decrease in the edema size observed on MRI scans and the decrease in rest pain. No changes were observed after a particular period of time with regard to decrease in the edema size observed on MRI scans, decrease in activity pain, and decrease in rest pain in follow-ups of BME patients.
