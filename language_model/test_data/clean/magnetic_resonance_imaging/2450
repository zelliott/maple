A case of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma and its appearance on MRI is presented. The tumor showed a zonal architecture on MRI with a large central core of very low signal intensity and a peripheral rim of intermediate to high signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted spin echo pulse sequences. The core showed decreased cellularity with dense collagen deposition on histologic examination, and the peripheral zone increased cellularity with increased nuclear atypia. The presence of a prominent region of very low signal intensity on T1- and T2- weighted images can be seen with neural tumors, giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath, aggressive fibromatosis, and, in rare instances, with soft tissue sarcomas rich in collagen.
