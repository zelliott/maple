Hepatic microcirculation is a main determinant of reperfusion injury and graft quality in liver transplantation. One of the important diagnostic procedures to recognize reperfusion failure is contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.

To examine the additional effect of contrast media (iomeprol and gadopentetate dimeglumine) on hepatic microcirculation and hepatic cellular damage in the phase of early ischemia/reperfusion injury of the rat liver.

The partial warm ischemia-reperfusion injury model of rat liver was used. Microcirculation and leukocyte-endothelium interaction were measured by intravital microscopy. Hepatic cellular damage was indicated by liver enzyme activity in the sera. The evaluation parameters were measured at baseline and at 30, 60, and 90 min after reperfusion. The contrast media (iomeprol group, n = 6; gadopentetate dimeglumine group, n = 6) or Ringer's solution (control group, n = 8) were applied after 30 min of reperfusion.

No additional injury to the ischemia/reperfusion injury of the liver after intravenous application of radiographic contrast media was found. Some protective effect was even recorded after application of iodinated contrast media.

The use of contrast media during diagnostic procedure of the liver seems to be relatively safe, even in the stage of early reperfusion after liver transplantation.
