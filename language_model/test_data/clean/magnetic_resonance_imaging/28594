Intercranial epidermoid tumours are benign lesions of congenital origin that are potentially curable. Although computerized axial tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are usually diagnostic, a few atypical features sometimes make pre-operative diagnosis difficult. Two cases of cystic epidermoids with peripheral ring enhancement are reported. Relevant literature has been reviewed.
