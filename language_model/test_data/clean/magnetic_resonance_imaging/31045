A 12-year-old boy was admitted with electrical burn and loss of consciousness. On physical examination his general condition was poor. Extensive burn areas, second and third degree, were present on his face, scalp, bilateral auricles, right cervical region, shoulders, right axilla, upper region of the thorax, and proximal region of the upper extremities. The total burned surface area was about 25%. Pupils were isocoric, but response to light was bilateral poor. He was stuporous and responsive only to pain. Deep tendon reflexes were exaggerated and plantar responses were bilateral extensor. Bilateral decorticate rigidity was noted. Computerized tomography of brain revealed brain edema and right thalamic hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain, examined 25 days after admission, revealed right thalamic hemorrhage and mild right subdural effusion. He was discharged form hospital 40 days after admission. However, spastic quadriplegia and severe mental retardation remained as sequela. On the 4th month of follow-up, no improvement was noted in his neurological examination. On the 9th month of follow-up, his clinical condition was better, but bilateral electric cataract was diagnosed. Both eyes were operated on and intraocular lenses were implanted with good results. Now he is 16th month of follow-up: neurological examination revealed only mild hemiparesis on the left side and mild articulation disorder. His school performance was moderate and intelligence quotient was 71. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain showed markedly improvement of the hemorrhage. To our best knowledge thalamic hemorrhage resulting from high-voltage electrical injury has not previously been reported in the literature.
