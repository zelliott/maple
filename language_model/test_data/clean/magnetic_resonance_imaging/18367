The authors report their analysis of the literature on the evaluation of intrathoracic extension of non-small-cell bronchial cancers to lymph nodes, using tomography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The criteria used to assess the metastatic character of a lymph node, the characteristics of the populations studied and the methods of comparison with the clinicopathological "truth" account for the variations of the results published. Tomographs are useless today. The performances of CT and MRI are equivalent, and it is not necessary to associate both techniques. Although its performances are mediocre, CT allows mapping the mediastinal lymph nodes, which is useful to continue the assessment of extension and to make decisions.
