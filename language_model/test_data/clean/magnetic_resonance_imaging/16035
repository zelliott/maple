The primary stabilizers of the knee can be functionally compartmentalized into the cruciate ligaments, the medial and posteromedial stabilizers, and the lateral and posterolateral stabilizers. This complex anatomy provides global knee stability. This article familiarizes the reader with the normal MR imaging appearance of these structures, and the changes following injury. The posteromedial and posterolateral corners are emphasized because recent research has improved the understanding of their importance, and their repair and reconstruction are becoming more common. Accurate identification of injury is important to ensuring optimal patient outcome.
