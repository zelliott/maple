An ischaemic stroke related to neurocysticercosis observed in the Paris neighbourhood is reported. A 32-year-old man originating from Cape Verde presented a left lacunar stroke. CT scan showed multiple areas of calcifications and a left capsulostriatal lucency. Gadolinium enhanced MRI disclosed significant abnormalities surrounding the left middle cerebral artery in the sylvian fissure. The titers of anticysticercian antibodies were highly positive in the serum and the CSF. The investigations in search of another cause of the stroke were negative. The outcome was good after a treatment associating albendazole and methylprednisolone. The increasingly recognized links between neurocysticercosis and stroke, especially in endemic areas are reviewed. Neurocysticercosis is an exceptional cause of ischaemic stroke in non endemic areas. In non-endemic areas, this cause of stroke has to be systematically suspected in patients coming from endemic areas. The diagnosis is based upon MRI, CT scanner and serologic tests. Treatment requires anti-parasitic drugs. The role of the corticosteroids is discussed.
