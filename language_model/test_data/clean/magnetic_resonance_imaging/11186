We present the case of a patient initially diagnosed with Retrobulbar Optic Neuritis and Multiple Sclerosis. The unusual evolution enforced the repetition of the magnetic resonance imaging exam. Consequently the new exam signals the presence of a pituitary tumor with suprasellar extention. The patient was operated on Neurosurgery Department, where they detected the presence of a suprasellar tumor which appertains to the left optic nerve. The histopathologic examination underlines fibrilar astrocytoma type II.
