Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries were suspected clinically in 22 wrists of 21 patients, but arthrography and MRI assessments of this structure were normal. As conservative therapy for 2 months did not improve their symptoms, wrist arthroscopy was then performed. Although no abnormalities of the TFCC and ligaments were observed, meniscus homologue-like tissue which arose from TFCC was riding on the articular surface of the triquetrum. After resection of this soft tissue with a shaver and a punch, the symptoms disappeared in all cases. The arthroscopic findings suggested that a portion of TFCC that was originally attached to the ulnar side of the triquetrum had become detached.
