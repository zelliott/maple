The present detailed radiological study investigated the relationship between petroclival meningiomas and petrosal veins with contrast-enhanced (CE) principles of echo-shifting with a train of observations (PRESTO) imaging to assess the potential contribution of the findings to the surgical strategy. Fourteen patients (13 women and 1 man) with unilateral petroclival meningiomas underwent microsurgical resection at Osaka City University Hospital between April 2009 and February 2011. Preoperatively, patients were examined using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including CE PRESTO imaging, focusing on the relationship between the tumor and the petrosal vein, and compared to the sensitivity of three-dimensional CT (3D-CT) venography or conventional MR imaging, including CE MR venography and constructive interference in steady-state (CISS) MR imaging. In 11 of 14 cases, we could identify the petrosal veins with intraoperative findings. In 10 of these 14 cases, the anatomical relationship between the tumor and the petrosal vein was detected preoperatively with CE PRESTO imaging, compared to 5 of 14 cases with 3D-CT venography, 5 of 14 cases with CE MR venography, and only 4 of 14 cases using CISS MR imaging. CE PRESTO imaging compares favorably to other approaches. There was no venous complication related to the surgery in any of the cases. CE PRESTO imaging is a non-invasive and useful method to assess the status of the petrosal vein in patients with petroclival meningiomas.
