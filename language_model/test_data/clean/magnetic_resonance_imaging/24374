Schmieder and colleagues introduced a new molecular magnetic resonance (MR) probe with a promising lipophilic gadolinium chelate complex that provides high relaxivity. Results of in vivo experiments clearly demonstrate the excellence of the probe for longitudinally monitoring α(v)β(3) integrin expression in tumors. In addition, the authors have developed a robust nonrelaxometric analysis method with which to quantify the spatial distribution of molecular MR probes. In combination with a molecular probe targeting angiogenesis, this approach may be superior to functional vascular assessments. It has the potential to enable better detection of angiogenic regions in heterogeneous tumors and to improve the monitoring and individualization of antiangiogenic treatments.
