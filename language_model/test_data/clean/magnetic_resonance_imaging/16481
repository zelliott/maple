The most common vascular tumors of infancy are hemangiomas. These are further classified as infantile or congenital. Infantile hemangiomas are not present at birth, go on to proliferate and then involute, whereas congenital hemangiomas are mature at birth. Congenital hemangiomas are further characterized as rapidly involuting (RICH) or noninvoluting (NICH). Rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas (RICH) are more common with the majority involuting completely by 12 months of age. Noninvoluting congenital hemangiomas (NICH) never involute, demonstrate proportional growth and require eventual excision. We report a unique case of an intracranial rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma. Pre- and postnatal imaging, as well as clinical follow-up, demonstrate the rapid regression of both the intracranial and cutaneous portions of this lesion during the first year of life.
