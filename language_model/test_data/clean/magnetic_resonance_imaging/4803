Hypothermically preserved rat livers were studied with proton magnetic resonance imaging (1H-MRI) under proton density-, spin-lattice relaxation time-, spin-spin relaxation time- and diffusion-weighted (P-W, T1-W, T2-W and D-W) conditions. Relative signal intensities (RSI) of the liver to distilled water in terms of P-W, T1-W, T2-W and D-W increased time-dependently during 12 h hypothermic (4 degrees C) preservation with saline, while these parameters did not increase during preservation with University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. One-hour Wiggers' hypotensive treatment before the harvesting increased the RSIs of P-W, T2-W and D-W, and the subsequent 12-hour preservation with UW solution did not improve the increased RSIs. These results suggest that 1H-MRI has potential application in evaluating the biophysical changes of water molecules in the liver graft, which were measured by placing the harvested liver in a plastic bag under a magnetic field at a low temperature.
