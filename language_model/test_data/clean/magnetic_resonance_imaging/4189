A method to measure arbitrary k-space trajectories was developed to compensate for nonideal gradient performance during rapid magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with actively or nonactively shielded gradients at a magnetic field strength of 4.1 T. Accurate MR image reconstruction requires knowledge of the k-trajectory produced by the gradient waveforms during k-space sampling. Even with shielded gradients, residual eddy currents and imperfections in gradient amplifier performance can cause the true k-space trajectory to deviate from the ideal trajectory. The k-space determination was used for spiral gradient-echo imaging fo the human brain. While individual calibrations are needed for new pulse sequences, the method of k-space determination can be used for any sequence of preparation pulses and readout gradient waveforms and should prove useful for other trajectories, including the rastered lines of echo-planar imaging.
