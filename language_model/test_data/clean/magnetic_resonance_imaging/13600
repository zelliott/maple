To evaluate the anatomy and function of the levator ani in normal women by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging.

Twelve asymptomatic, nulliparous, premenopausal women with no previous pelvic surgery underwent a dynamic magnetic resonance imaging scan of their pelvis. The origin, orientation, thickness, and function of the two components of the levator ani were studied.

The ileococcygeus is a thin muscle with an upward convexity. It slopes forward and medially. It is of variable thickness (mean thickness 2.9 mm, standard deviation 0.8 mm). There are apparent gaps in the muscle diaphragm and at its site of origin from the obturator fascia. The puborectalis is a thicker muscle. It is shaped like a belt encasing the pelvic organs. It is taller posteriorly than anteriorly. It is not attached to the bladder neck, but the midurethra and lower urethra lie in close proximity to it. The puborectalis moves dorsoventrally, whereas the ileococcygeus moves craniocaudally.

The levator ani is not a single muscle but has two functional components that vary in thickness, origin, and function. The ileococcygeus has a mainly supportive function, whereas the puborectalis has a sphincteric function. Gaps in the diaphragmatic portion of the ileococcygeus are a normal finding. Individual components of the levator ani may be prone to different types of childbirth trauma and should therefore be assessed separately when planning rehabilitation.
