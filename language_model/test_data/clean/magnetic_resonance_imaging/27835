Oropharyngeal teratomas are extremely rare congenital tumours, and because of their location in the upper airway they represent one of the most unusual causes of airway obstruction during the neonatal period. We report a 2-month-old girl who presented with repeated vomiting, failure to thrive and recurrent bouts of stridor and cyanosis since birth. On examination there was a mass originating from the oropharynx. The mass was excised under general anaesthesia by CO(2) laser. Histopathological examination revealed a teratoma of the oropharynx. We discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of this case as well as a review of the literature.
