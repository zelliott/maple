Fat necrosis of the breast is a benign inflammatory process that may be mistaken for cancer in clinical examination or imaging studies. Although its mammographic manifestations are well known, data from other imaging modes, particularly sonography and magnetic resonance imaging, are limited. With the growing number of breast surgeries performed today (eg, breast-conserving, autologous tissue reconstruction, mammoplasty), fat necrosis is seen more often in daily practice. Knowledge of its imaging features could improve clinical management, including the avoidance of unnecessary biopsy procedures. The main objectives of this article are to review the literature and to relate the manifestations of fat necrosis on mammography, sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography to their associated histopathologic events.
