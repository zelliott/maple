We report a rare case of radial tears in the roots of the posterior horns of both the medial and lateral menisci associated with a chronic anterior cruciate ligament tear. Treatment included an arthroscopic pullout suture combined with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. At the 3-year postoperative follow-up, a second-look arthroscopic examination showed the posterior horns of both menisci to be well healed on the tibia. Manual knee laxity tests were negative and no side-to-side difference was detected by a KT-1000 arthrometer. The patient was able to perform outdoor activities without residual symptoms.
