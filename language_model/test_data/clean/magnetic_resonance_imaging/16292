Isolated brain relapse is uncommon in Hodgkin's lymphoma and often linked with advanced or refractory disease.

We report two patients with stage IV Hodgkin's disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, who later developed neurological symptoms. Brain MRI demonstrated two different types of lesions. Histological findings were consistent with intracranial location of Hodgkin lymphoma. Both of the patients presented only with isolated CNS relapse of the lymphoma.

The two cases demonstrated the MRI appearance of intracranial involvement can be varied and mimic other disease processes in patients with a previous history of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thus, a biopsy is necessary for diagnosis and correct treatment.
