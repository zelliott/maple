Monosomy 1p36 is a newly delineated multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome characterized by mental retardation, growth delay, epilepsy, congenital heart defects, characteristic facial appearance, and precocious puberty. It is now considered to be one of the most common subtelomeric micro-deletion syndromes. This article reports new findings of choroid plexus hyperplasia and dextrocardia with situs solitus in a patient who had deletion of chromosome 1p26.33 with a brief review of the literature.
