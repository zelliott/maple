Prospective study of 30 patients suspected of suffering from far lateral lumbar disk herniation.

To assess the diagnostic and clinical value of a new technique 3-T magnetic resonance myelography (MRM) in patients with far lateral disk herniation.

No studies have reported regarding the usefulness of MRM images in assessing far lateral disk nor correlated it with clinical outcomes.

We evaluated 3-T MRM of 30 patients, whom we suspected of suffering from far lateral disk herniation. Using an assessment scale, 5 observers independently examined the images. We analyzed observer agreement and the accentuation of each image.

We found complete match and observer agreement for 3-T MRM for diagnosing far lateral disk herniation. Furthermore, 3-T MRM revealed the disease's severity on the basis of the nerve root exit zone angle differences.

MRM is an appropriate diagnostic tool and reduces the chance of misdiagnosis in far lateral disk herniation. Furthermore, through the use of this technique, we can evaluate postoperative clinical outcomes.
