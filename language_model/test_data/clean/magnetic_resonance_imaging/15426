Hemangiopericytoma is a rare tumor, arising from pericytes, which are perivascular cells belonging to the capillar walls.

A 41 year old man consulted for a mandibular tumor. The clinical and radiographic diagnosis was difficult. The biopsy performed in the operative room led to an embolization decided in emergency, and proved the definitive diagnosis. Despite the embolization, bleeding during surgical excision of the tumor compelled us to perform an external carotid artery ligature. The mandibular reconstruction was performed using a trapezium osteo-muscular flap.

As reported in the literature, the radiographic diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma is difficult, the malignant potential is variable and the recommended treatment is surgical excision.
