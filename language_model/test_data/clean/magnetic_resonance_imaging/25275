To evaluate the predictive value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on therapy outcome of combined chemoradiation in patients with primary carcinoma of the rectum.

Prior to standardized, combined, neoadjuvant chemoradiation, 16 patients with primary carcinoma of the rectum (cT3) were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Diffusion-weighted spin echo echo-planar images (SE-EPI) and contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted spin echo (SE) images at 1.5 Tesla were obtained. The mean ADC of the tumor region was calculated and correlated with the therapy outcome substantiated by postsurgical histopathologic staging.

Tumor down-staging (pT0-2) occurred in 9 patients (therapy responders) and no down-staging (pT3) in 7 patients (therapy non-responders). The mean ADC measured 0.476 +/- 0.114 x 10(-3) mm 2/s in the responder group and 0.703 +/- 0.085 x 10(-3) mm 2/s in the non-responder group. Comparison of the mean ADC between the groups reached statistical significance (p = 0.001).

The mean ADC might be a new quantitative parameter to predict therapy outcome of combined preoperative chemoradiation in patients with primary carcinoma of the rectum.
