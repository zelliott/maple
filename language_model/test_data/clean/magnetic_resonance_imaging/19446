To evaluate long-term effectiveness of a strategy for managing the aortic root and distal aorta according to the pathology in ascending aortic dissection.

From 1978 to 1995, 208 patients underwent operations for acute (n = 135) and chronic (n = 73) ascending aortic dissection. Surgical strategies included valve resuspension with supracoronary aortic root repair and ascending aortic graft for normal sinuses and valve (n = 135), composite valve and ascending aortic graft for abnormal sinuses and valve (n = 47), and valve replacement and supracoronary ascending aortic graft for normal sinuses and abnormal valve (n = 26). Resection extended into the arch only if the intimal tear originated in or extended to the aortic arch (n = 31).

Hospital mortality was 14%. Cardiogenic shock (P =.002) and concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (P =.001) were associated with increased risk; use of circulatory arrest (P =.0003) decreased risk. Survival was 87%, 68%, and 52% at 30 days, 5 years, and 10 years, respectively. Advanced age, earlier date of operation, composite graft, and arch resection were associated with decreased survival; residual distal dissected aorta was not. Reoperation was required for 5 proximal and 8 distal problems.

In both acute and chronic ascending aortic dissections, (1) circulatory arrest is associated with low early mortality; (2) with normal sinuses and valve, supracoronary repair of the dissected aortic root and valve resuspension is effective long term; and (3) residual distal dissected aorta does not decrease late survival and has a low risk of aneurysmal change and reoperation for at least 10 years.
