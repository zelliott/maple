One hundred patients with recently acquired, externally visible mandibular deformity and no history of previous extraarticular mandible fracture were selected for retrospective analysis. All had been investigated clinically and with radiography, tomography, and high-field surface-coil MR imaging to determine the presence or absence and extent of temporomandibular joint degeneration. Temporomandibular joint degeneration was found in either one or both joints of each patient studied. Chin deviation was always toward the smaller mandibular condyle or more diseased joint, and many patients either complained of or exhibited malocclusion, often manifested by unstable or fluctuating occlusion disturbances. Three radiologically distinct forms of degenerative vs adaptive osteocartilaginous processes--(1) osteoarthritis, (2) avascular necrosis, and (3) regressive remodeling--involving the mandibular condyle and temporal bone were identified in joints most often exhibiting meniscus derangement. Osteoarthritis and avascular necrosis of the mandibular condyle and temporal bone were generally associated with pain, mechanical joint symptoms, and occlusion disturbances. Regressive remodeling was less frequently associated with occlusion disturbances, despite remodeling of the facial skeleton, and appears to result from regional osteoporosis. Forty patients (52 joints) underwent open arthroplasty procedures, including either meniscectomy or microsurgical meniscus repair, at which time major radiologic diagnoses were confirmed. Surgical and pathologic findings included meniscus displacement, disk degeneration, synovitis, joint effusion, articular cartilage erosion, cartilage healing/fibrosis, cartilage hypertrophy, osseous sclerosis, osteophyte formation, osteochondritis dissecans, localized or extensive avascular necrosis, and decreased mandibular condyle mass and vertical dimension. We conclude that temporomandibular joint degeneration is the principal cause of both acquired facial skeleton remodeling and unstable occlusion in patients with intact dentition and without previous mandible fracture.
