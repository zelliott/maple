Traditionally, imaging of renal infections was largely through a multimodality approach. Excretory urography, ultrasonography, nuclear scintigraphy, and CT all played major roles; however, in recent years, CT has increased in prominence in the imaging and evaluation of renal infection. Part of the reason for this trend includes improvements in the availability of CT scanners and more timely access to them. Helical scanning technology has also greatly increased the quality and usefulness of the information CT provides. Most uncomplicated cases of acute renal infection in adults do not require imaging for diagnosis and treatment. When imaging is indicated, however, contrast-enhanced CT almost always is the study of choice. For cases in which renal calculi may be present, the study should also include noncontrast images through the kidneys.
