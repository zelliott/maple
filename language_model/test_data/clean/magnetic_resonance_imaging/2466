A 38-year-old male presented with a posterior fossa ependymoma with unusual extension from the cerebellopontine angle to the pineal region. Magnetic resonance imaging clearly demonstrated that these two components were continuous through the right ambient cistern. Computed tomography using a bone algorithm revealed enlargement of the right internal auditory canal. This case suggests that ependymoma can extend anywhere within the subarachnoid space along the path of least resistance.
