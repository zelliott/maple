Neuromas or Schwannomas are extremely rare among tumors of the larynx. They are Schwann cell tumors that can be difficult to distinguish from neurofibromas. They present usually as supraglottic masses, since they may arise from the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is the best diagnostic technique, conferring a high degree of suspicion. We present an exceptional case of a laryngeal neuroma, with a very long evolution, a large tumor volume, dyspnea and vocal cord fixation, with complete resolution through an external approach following surgical removal. The difficulties encountered with its pathological and clinical diagnosis are discussed as well as a review of the literature.
