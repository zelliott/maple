To ascertain the dynamic changes between the median nerve and flexor tendons in the carpal tunnel, MR images of 16 wrists in eight volunteers were studied in flexion, extension, and neutral positions. T1-weighted axial images, 600/20 (TR/TE) were obtained with the wrists straight, extended at 45 degree, and flexed at 45 degree. Each scan was evaluated with regard to positional changes of the median nerve and flexor tendons in the carpal tunnel as well as alterations in nerve shape. In the neutral position, the median nerve was found in one of two standard positions: either anterior to the superficial flexor tendon of the index finger or interposed more posterolaterally between this tendon and the flexor pollicis longus. During extension, the nerve always maintained or assumed an anterior position between the superficial index finger flexor and the flexor retinaculum, while the flexor tendons moved posteriorly. With flexion, the tendons shifted anteriorly toward the retinaculum, and the median nerve was found in one of three positions. It either remained in its anterior position between the superficial index finger flexor and retinaculum or became interposed between the superficial flexor tendons of the index finger and thumb or middle finger and ring finger. Nerve shape varied with its position. Anteriorly positioned nerves were flattened in the anteroposterior plane between the tendon and flexor retinaculum; this was greatest with flexion and least with extension. Interposed nerves were flattened in the mediolateral plane or rounded in configuration. In conclusion, the alignment of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, its shape, and its relationship to the flexor tendons were variable and dependent on wrist positioning. These findings may explain why certain wrist motions, flexion in particular, predispose a person to carpal tunnel syndrome.
