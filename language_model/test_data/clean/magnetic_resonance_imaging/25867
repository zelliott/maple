Opinions about the relation between the dimensions of the syrinx and the severity and distribution of symptoms in patients with syringomyelia are controversial. Therefore, this study investigates the relation of clinical symptoms, a disability score, quantified (1- and 2-dimensional) radiological findings (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and electrophysiological data (somatosensory and motor evoked potentials) in 22 patients with syringomyelia. There was a close relation between clinical symptoms and electrophysiological data. By both electrophysiological methods subclinical deficits could be detected. Furthermore, the results disclosed that the clinical symptoms, the degree of disability and the duration of the disease are not related to the dimensions of the syrinx or the electrophysiological results obtained by investigating the long ascending and descending spinal tracts of the lower limbs. Our findings suggest that, besides the syrinx, other factors not directly visible in the MRI are responsible for the development and progress of clinical symptoms.
