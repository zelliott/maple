The purpose of the study was to determine whether dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI allowed distinction of cerebral abscesses from cystic high-grade brain neoplasms.

In this small preliminary study, dynamic susceptibility perfusion MRI allowed distinction of cerebral abscesses from rim-enhancing high-grade gliomas. Validation of these results using a prospective large study is warranted.
