To determine the long-term outcome of 12 youthful patients with lumbar disc herniation, who, at the time of surgery, were 15 years old and younger (mean age at operation 14.3 years), we assessed their current clinical condition (mean follow-up time 6 years) with a questionnaire inquiring about symptoms and disability, and radiologically with an MRI of the lumbar spine. Clinically, only five patients (40%) were totally asymptomatic and seven patients (60%) had recurring symptoms, both and disability. On MRI, seven patients (60%) had persistent stenosing changes at the operated disc levels and eight patients (65%) also had disc degeneration at other lumbar levels. Despite the symptoms and quite severe radiological findings, the long-term outcome was assessed as good or moderate in eleven patients (90%). As far as comparisons are reasonable, our results appear somewhat less favourable than those in two previous paediatric series, but they agree with those in two recent large series of adults.
