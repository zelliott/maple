Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) hypermobility is noted only when it interferes with smooth mandibular movements. These interferences (viz. clicking sounds and jerky mandibular movements) result from condylar dislocation in front of the eminence at wide mouth opening, or alternatively in front of the articular disc (posterior disc displacement). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that condyles of hypermobile persons are positioned more anterosuperiorly to the crest of the eminence during maximum mouth opening than those of persons without TMJ hypermobility. Possible posterior disc displacement was also evaluated. Nine persons with symptomatic hypermobility and nine control persons free of internal derangements were included, their diagnoses being based upon opto-electronic movement recordings. Condylar positions during maximum mouth opening were analysed on magnetic resonance images with two slightly different methods, showing the degree to which the condyles are displaced around the eminence. No posterior disc displacements were found in any of the magnetic resonance images. After excluding an outlier and using both measurement methods, a small difference in condylar position was found between the two groups of subjects. The condyles of all hypermobile persons travelled beyond the eminence; however, so were the condyles of nearly half of the non-hypermobiles. The large overlap between both groups suggests that condylar position alone is not a good predictor for symptomatic TMJ hypermobility. It is probably the combination of condylar location in front of the eminence with a particular line of action of the masticatory muscles, which gives rise to functional signs of hypermobility.
