Brachytherapy with temporary implants may prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), but it is associated with relatively high costs and morbidity. This study reports the time to progression and survival after permanent implantation of iodine-125 seeds for recurrent GBM and examines factors predictive of outcome.

Forty patients with recurrent GBM were treated with maximal resection plus permanent placement of iodine-125 seeds into the tumor bed. A total dose of 120 to 160 Gy was administered, and patients were followed up with magnetic resonance imaging scans every 2 to 3 months.

Actuarial survival from the time of implantation was 47 weeks, with 7 of 40 patients still alive at a median of 59 weeks after implantation. Survival was significantly better for patients younger than 60 years, and a trend for longer survival was demonstrated with gross total resection and tumors with a low MIB-1 (a nuclear antigen present in all cell cycles of proliferating cells) staining index. Median time to progression was 25 weeks and, on multivariate analysis, was favorably influenced by gross total resection and patient age younger than 60 years. After implantation, 27 of 30 patients with failure had a local component to the failure. No patient developed symptoms attributable to radiation necrosis or injury.

Permanent iodine-125 implants for recurrent GBM result in survival comparable with that described in previous reports on temporary implants, but with less morbidity. Results are most favorable for patients who are younger than 60 years, and who undergo gross total resection. Despite this aggressive treatment, most patients die as a consequence of locally recurrent disease.
