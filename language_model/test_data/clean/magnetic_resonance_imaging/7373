Injectable fillers such as poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) and calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) have shown promising results in the treatment of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-induced facial lipoatrophy (FLA). However, the effects of these substances on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have not yet been described.

The authors analyze the association between the effects of treatment with semipermanent fillers on MRI and changes in quality of life (QOL).

Eighty-two human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with cART-induced FLA (grades 2-4) were enrolled in this prospective study. A mean volume of 58.2 mL (range, 12-105 mL) of PLLA (n = 41 patients) and 9.1 mL (range, 3-23 mL) of CaHA (n = 41) was injected in multiple sessions. The MRI examinations were performed prior to treatment and again 12 months after. The self-reported severity of FLA as well as QOL was measured using questionnaires based on Short Form 36, Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale formats.

Significant increases in total subcutaneous thickness (TST) of the injected regions could be identified on MRI in nearly all patients 1 year posttreatment. Patients reported that mental health and social and role functioning improved; depressive symptoms decreased after treatment. In addition, the increase in TST was positively associated with improvement of QOL.

This study confirms that treatment with both PLLA and CaHA not only increases TST but also is associated with improved QOL for HIV-infected patients. Furthermore, the study also demonstrates that MRI can show filler-induced neocollagenesis and quantify FLA treatment effects.
