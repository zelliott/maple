Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is an extremely rare intracranial tumor and is regarded as a low-proliferation tumor. We present two cases of primary intracranial epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and give an overview of the English literature pertaining to this disease. We described two new cases of primary intracranial epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and performed a search of MEDLINE (PubMed) using the words "epithelioid hemangioendothelioma". Only cases in the English language that were intracranially located and contained clinical information pertinent to the analysis were included. The tumor in case 1 originated from the right temporal bone and invaded the surrounding cranium, dura and temple muscles. The tumor in case 2 was located in the petroclival bone and had also invaded the surrounding cranium. Both tumors were well vascularized. The tumors were totally (case 1) or subtotally (case 2) removed with moderate blood loss. A total of 36 cases of intracranial epithelioid hemangioendothelioma were found in the literature. The tumor was typically diagnosed in young adults and infants. There was no sex predominance in adult patients, while in children, males were more frequently affected (M/F ratio, 3.5:1). Surgical removal was the main therapeutic protocol, and adjuvant therapy included radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Including the 2 patients presented here, a total of 38 patients were analyzed: 32 % showed local invasion, 24 % suffered a recurrence, 15 % had metastases, and the mortality rate was 15 %. Intracranial epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare, low-proliferation tumor, but it exhibits some clinically malignant behaviors, such as local invasion, recurrence and metastasis. Total resection is mandatory where possible, and radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are otherwise required. Preoperative feeding-artery embolization is recommended.
