Familial porencephaly is a rare disorder causing motor impairment, hemiplegia, mental retardation and epilepsy in variable degrees. Two families with porencephaly and apparently dominant inheritance are reported. Brain MRI findings are reviewed and described in seven affected individuals. Most patients also show white matter abnormalities in the cerebral hemisphere, also contralateral to the cystic lesion. In the first family an obligate carrier was identified who did not have a cystic lesion but clear abnormalities of the white matter. Although a predisposition for thrombophilia has previously been reported, we did not observe any genetic, environmental or epigenetic predisposition for the porencephaly. The lesions are most compatible with a deep venous thrombosis/ischemic event occurring in a late stage of pregnancy, not necessarily aggravated by perinatal asphyxia.
