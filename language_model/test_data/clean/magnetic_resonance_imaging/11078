Behçet's disease is a multisystem disorder commonly seen in Japan and in Mediterranean countries characterized by a vasculitis of unknown origin. In this work, we describe a case of a 47-year-old man with Behçet's disease of 28 years evolution who presented with a common lumbago and revealed to have a rare case of destruction of the third lumbar vertebra due to a giant pseudoaneurysm of the right iliac artery. In the discussion, we make a brief review of the literature on the subject and analyze the existence of three similar cases.
