The evolution of our understanding of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been facilitated by the technique of magnetization transfer, which has the ability to detect and categorize lesions that are both visible and occult by conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The methodology can be applied to individual MS lesions as well as to the global brain disease. The results of studies performed in centers throughout the world reveal multiple correlations with clinical parameters as well as greater specificity and sensitivity to lesion than other presently available MR measures.
