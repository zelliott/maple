We evaluated blood flow and oxygen metabolism in a patient with Lhermitte-Duclos disease using brain positron emission tomography. The lesion showed increased blood flow, reduced oxygen extraction fraction and normal metabolic rates of oxygen. These findings suggest that lesions of Lhermitte-Duclos disease may constitute hamartoma or hypertrophy rather than neoplasm.
