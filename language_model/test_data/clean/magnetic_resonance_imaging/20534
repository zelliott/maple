Intraoperative MRI has already fundamentally changed the way current brain tumor surgery is performed. The ability to integrate high-field MRI into the operating room has allowed intraoperative MRI to emerge as an important adjunct to CNS tumor treatment. Furthermore, the ability of MRI to successfully couple with molecular imaging (PET and/or optical imaging), neuroendoscopy and therapeutic devices, such as focused ultrasound, will allow it to emerge as an important image-guidance modality for improving brain tumor therapy and outcomes.
