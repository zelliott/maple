A 12-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital in May 1990. Since two years previously, he became restless and could not adapt himself to his new school mates and teacher. He came to refuse going to school, and his intellectual performance rapidly deteriorated, thereafter. During the following two years, he gradually became mutic and incontinent with dystonic involuntary movements, and was admitted to our hospital. Examination revealed melanoderma, mutism, dementia and grossly normal visual and auditory system except for bilateral optic atrophy. Volitional movements were severely limited because of marked truncal and extreme dystonia and spastic paresis. Urinary 17-KS and 17-OHCS were decreased. Serum cortisol did not increase normally on rapid ACTH test. Very-long-chain fatty acids in serum were increased. Serial CTs and MRI demonstrated marked ventricular dilatation and diffuse white-matter lesions involving the frontal lobes, corpus callosum, internal capsules, and less markedly parieto-occipital regions with slight calcification in the optic radiations. Those in the frontal lobes had been visualised in CTs taken 18 months after the onset. School refusal, the initial symptoms of the patient, is one of serious socioeducational problems in Japan. While the majority of children with school refusal might be of non-organic affections, those with apparent mental deterioration and behavioral abnormalities should undergo non-invasive CT or MRI evaluation during the early stage of the disorder. And if diffuse white matter lesions is suggested even in the frontal lobe, the possibility of adrenoleuko-dystrophy should be considered.
