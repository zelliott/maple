Within the last four years magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) developed very rapidly towards a well accepted screening technique for vascular examinations as a fast add on to conventional MR. This review describes the basic physical principles as well as the different methods like time-of-flight and phase-sensitive MRA for visualization of blood vessels. Different applications of 3D, 2D sequential and 3D multi-volume MRA are shown from various regions of the head and body. A short outlook to quantitative flow measurements is given in the last chapter including some interesting applications of these techniques which show the still expanding potential of magnetic resonance.
