Schwannomas are common in the central nervous system, but only a few cases in the pituitary fossa have been reported. Described here is a case of an intrasellar schwannoma associated with headaches and behavioural changes, which responded to subtotal excision of the lesion. The diagnosis of intrasellar schwannoma was made on the basis of a constellation of microscopic findings, especially histologic features and immunohistochemical markers. The clinical and laboratory presentation, surgical procedure used and microscopic findings are compared with those in the literature.
