The ability to generate in vivo maps of lactate may have significant diagnostic utility in staging and treatment planning of a wide variety of cancers. The double selective multiple quantum filter technique (SelMQC) has been shown to be effective for nonlocalized detection of lactate with little or no interference from other signals. Here the SelMQC technique has been combined with longitudinal Hadamard slice selection and chemical shift imaging (CSI) to yield slice-selective images of lactate. The technique is shown to be effective in phantoms and in WSU-DLCL2 xenografts implanted in flanks of SCID mice. Tumors exhibited an annulus of elevated lactate concentration surrounding a necrotic tumor core.
