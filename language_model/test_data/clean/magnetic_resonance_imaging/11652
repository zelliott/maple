Vinorelbine seems to cause less neurotoxicity than other vinca alkaloids because of its selective activity on mitotic cells over axonal microtubules. Clinical trials report very mild peripheral neurotoxicity with distal paresthesiae and there are no reports of myelopathy in these series of patients. The authors describe a patient who developed a rare event of myelopathy while on vinorelbine for non-small-cell lung cancer.
