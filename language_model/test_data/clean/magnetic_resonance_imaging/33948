We report a new case of supraglottic primary laryngeal lymphoma. The tumor was a B-cell, non-Hodgkin lymphoma with good response to polychemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although the head and neck region is a frequent site of origin of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas, laryngeal involvement is exceptional. Including this case, 88 primary laryngeal lymphomas have been reported in the literature.
