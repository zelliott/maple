Pre-operative and postoperative auditory function was reviewed retrospectively in 98 patients with vestibular schwannomas. According to their hormonal status, women were categorized as "premenopausal" and "postmenopausal". Before surgery, 48% of the women (65% premenopausal) and 16% of the men presented with sudden hearing loss. The degree of auditory function before operation was similar for women and men. Preservation of pre-operative hearing was possible for 41% of the women (21% premenopausal) and 59% of the men. Further details of the surgery and the results of histopathological examination were also compared for women and men. Our results support substantial evidence that hearing preservation after surgery of vestibular schwannoma is easier to accomplish for men than for women. The finding of significantly more sudden hearing loss in premenopausal women may suggest a hormonal influence on tumour growth, which may also be partially responsible for the difference in hearing prognosis between women and men.
