Positive modulation of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) α4β2 subtype by selective positive allosteric modulator NS-9283 has shown to potentiate the nAChR agonist ABT-594-induced anti-allodynic activity in preclinical neuropathic pain. To determine whether this benefit can be extended beyond neuropathic pain, the present study examined the analgesic activity and adverse effect profile of co-administered NS-9283 and ABT-594 in a variety of preclinical models in rats. The effect of the combined therapy on drug-induced brain activities was also determined using pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging. In carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia, co-administration of NS-9283 (3.5 μmol/kg, i.p.) induced a 6-fold leftward shift of the dose-response of ABT-594 (ED(50)=26 vs. 160 nmol/kg, i.p.). In the paw skin incision model of post-operative pain, co-administration of NS-9283 similarly induced a 6-fold leftward shift of ABT-594 (ED(50)=26 vs. 153 nmol/kg). In monoiodo-acetate induced knee joint pain, co-administration of NS-9283 enhanced the potency of ABT-594 by 5-fold (ED(50)=1.0 vs. 4.6 nmol/kg). In pharmacological MRI, co-administration of NS-9283 was shown to lead to a leftward shift of ABT-594 dose-response for cortical activation. ABT-594 induced CNS-related adverse effects were not exacerbated in presence of an efficacious dose of NS-9283 (3.5 μmol/kg). Acute challenge of NS-9283 produced no cross sensitization in nicotine-conditioned animals. These results demonstrate that selective positive allosteric modulation at the α4β2 nAChR potentiates nAChR agonist-induced analgesic activity across neuropathic and nociceptive preclinical pain models without potentiating ABT-594-mediated adverse effects, suggesting that selective positive modulation of α4β2 nAChR by PAM may represent a novel analgesic approach.
