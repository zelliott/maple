The aim of this work was to evaluate the clinic usefulness of Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance (RM) in the staging after surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy of the nonseminomatous germ cells tumours of the testis. The Authors discussed the CT and MR dimensional criteria for the diagnosis of retroperitoneal metastases of the nonseminomatous germ cells tumours and delineated their CT and MR morphologic appearances in detail. The density of the residual mass on CT was classified as solid, cystic and half-cystic. The retroperitoneal hematoma and lymphocele formed as a complication respectively of orchiectomy and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy can be misinterpreted to represent metastatic disease on post operative staging CT scans. Early recognition of this complication are crucial if unnecessary treatment is to be avoided. Finally the Authors evaluated, in patients affected from nonseminomatous germ cells tumours of the testis, the possibility to characterize with CT and MR imaging the retroperitoneal mass. The density and character of the residual mass on CT scan did not reliably predict the histology. On the basis of tumor consistency and signal intensity in T1 and T2 weighted images, MR cannot yet warrant any conclusion about the ultimate effect of chemotherapy.
