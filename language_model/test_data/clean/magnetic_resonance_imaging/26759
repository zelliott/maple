Choroid plexus tumors (CPTs) are uncommon primary intracranial tumors. Here, we describe two patients with CPTs of the cerebellum: one had a choroid plexus papilloma located in the left cerebellar hemisphere that presented as an irregular, lobulated and solid-cystic mass, whereas the other had a choroid plexus carcinoma that exhibited a poorly defined, mixed-intensity mass associated with invasion of adjacent brain parenchyma. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging showed prominent heterogeneous enhancement. CPTs should be considered in the differential diagnosis for irregular, heterogeneous and intensely enhancing masses that occur in the cerebellum.
