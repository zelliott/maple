This paper reports a case of a Jamaican young woman who experienced flaccid quadriparesis and bulbar weakness over a three-week period after a gastrointestinal illness. Nerve conduction studies confirmed an axonal type neuropathy consistent with the acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy variant of the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Recovery, although evident, was slow and was augmented after a course of intravenous immunoglobulin. The patient was discharged from hospital after three months but was re-admitted one week later and eventually succumbed to complications of the illness. This case serves as a reminder that Guillain-Barré syndrome is now the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis and should be considered early in all patients presenting with flaccid quadriparesis.
