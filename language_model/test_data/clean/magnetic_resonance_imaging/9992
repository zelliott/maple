The introduction of new flat-panel detector technology often forces us to accept too high dose levels as proposed by the manufacturers. We need a tool to compare the image quality of a new system with the accepted standard. The aim of this study was to obtain a comparable image quality for two systems-storage phosphor plates and a flat-panel system using intravenous urography (IVU) as a clinical model. The image quality figure was calculated using a contrast-detail phantom (CDRAD) for the two evaluated systems. This allowed us to set a dose for the flat-panel system that gave equivalent image quality to the storage phosphor plates. This reduced detector dose was used in an evaluation of clinical images to find out if the dose reduction from the phantom study indeed resulted in images of equal clinical image quality. The image quality was assessed using image criteria of the European guidelines for IVU with visual grading analysis. Equivalent image quality in image pairs was achieved at 30% of the dose. The CDRAD contrast-detail phantom makes it possible to find dose levels that give equal image quality using different imaging systems.
