A case of bipolar disorder subsequent to a mild head injury in a 15-year-old girl is reported. Review of the literature indicates that this is an extremely rare outcome. Lack of adequate follow-up studies makes it difficult to accurately predict type and severity of psychiatric outcome. Assessment and management involves ongoing consideration of both organic and psychosocial factors even after initial negative investigations.
