To determine the ability of MRI to diagnose morphological and functional changes in patients after Ross procedure.

During one year, 5 patients after Ross procedure were studied by MRI. T1-weighted spin-echo sequences in different orientations as well as cine sequences and a VENC sequence were used.

In all patients the morphology including the postoperative changes could be visualised by MRI. The cine sequences provided functional information on valvular and ventricular function. VENC-MR yielded an exact quantification of the regurgitant fraction.

MRI is capable of providing all important diagnostic information in patients after Ross procedure such as valvular and ventricular function and valvular and outflow tract morphology in a single examination.
