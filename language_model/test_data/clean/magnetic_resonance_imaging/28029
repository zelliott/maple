To demonstrate the usefulness of MR-imaging seven cases of suspected stress fractures are demonstrated and discussed (six stress fractures, one osteoid-osteoma). The results indicate that stress fractures of the tibia may be differentiated early and easily from tumorous lesions, especially in atypical cases. In one case the fracture line could be detected only by MRI. In this respect, MRI is of high diagnostic value in differentiating unclear bone anomalies.
