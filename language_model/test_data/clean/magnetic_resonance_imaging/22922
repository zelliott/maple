We reported a patient with sudden onset seizure resulting in prolonged amnesia. MRI revealed a T2 high signal lesion with swelling in the right medial temporal lobe. Because the MRI lesion remained to be the same in size for two months, biopsy specimens were obtained under informed consent to rule out the brain tumor. Based on histological findings showing brain edema without specific abnormal findings (malignancy, inflammation etc), we concluded that the temporal lesion was the edema induced by the seizure attack. In Japan, many papers on non-herpetic acute limbic encephalitis (NHALE) have recently been published. In their reports, seizures were frequently observed as a preceding symptom; moreover, clinical courses and MRI findings are similar to those of seizure-induced brain edema. The secondary brain edema induced by the seizure must be considered in patients with NHALE and other CNS disorders, especially if the patient has a history of the recent seizure.
