Tuberculosis is a mycobacterial infestation which generally involves the lungs. Primary bone tuberculosis without involving the joint is rare. A 35-year-old Pakistani immigrant presented with a mass and pain over the medial aspect of the knee that had persisted for 6 months. Clinical and radiological investigations revealed a tuberculous affectation of the distal epiphysis of the femur. We did not find any visceral organ involvement. Wide excision was performed, completed with antituberculostatic drugs for 9 months postoperatively. In the 2nd postoperative year, the patient was symptom-free, and the imaging test results were normal. Primary bone tuberculosis without joint affection is a rare presentation form of this disease and should be kept in mind in the diagnostic work-up of a mass of a bone lesion.
