The authors report a case of a 48-year-old male smoker who presented with respiratory distress and constitutional symptoms along with gynaecomastia and multiple pulmonary nodules. Based on normal physical and ultrasound findings of the testes, presence of markedly elevated serum Î² human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and biopsy findings of the lung a diagnosis of primary pulmonary choriocarcinoma was made.
