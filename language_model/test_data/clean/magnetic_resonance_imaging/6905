Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas account for 10 to 15% of all intracranial arteriovenous malformations. Tentorial dural arteriovenous fistulas with spinal medullary venous drainage causing spinal cord myelopathy are very rare, but have been previously described. We describe a case using a cranio-orbito zygomatic approach with intraoperative angiography for the surgical treatment of a tentorial artery dural arteriovenous fistula causing spinal cord myelopathy.

A 42-year-old male presented complaining of a 1-year history of incoordination and dizziness and a 2-month history of progressive myelopathy with bowel and bladder incontinence. The patient had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed along with cerebral and spinal angiography that revealed a right tentorial artery dural arteriovenous fistula with spinal medullary venous involvement down to T11. Angiographic embolization was attempted, but selective catheterization was unsuccessful. The patient underwent a cranio-orbito zygomatic approach with obliteration of the dural arteriovenous fistula. An intraoperative angiogram confirmed complete obliteration of the dural arteriovenous fistula.

Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas are a rare cause of spinal cord myelopathy. When a patient presents with suspicion of spinal dural fistula and negative spinal angiography, an intracranial origin should be suspected and a cerebral angiogram performed. Skull base approaches along with intraoperative angiography provide an alternative modality for obliteration of the dural arteriovenous fistula nidus, thereby eliminating the venous congestion and hence the spinal cord ischemia.
