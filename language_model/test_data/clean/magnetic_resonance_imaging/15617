Laryngeal atresia is a rare congenital cause of high airway obstruction that can lead to death if not correctly recognized and treated at birth. Postnatal management is difficult and the prognosis is often poor. We report a case of prenatal diagnosis of laryngeal atresia in a fetus that was delivered preterm at 29 weeks of gestation. Tracheotomy was performed as an ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) to guarantee patent airway, and laryngotracheoplasty was performed at 22 months of corrected age. A favorable ventilatory and neurodevelopmental outcome was observed at 33 months of age.
