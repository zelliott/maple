Functional neuroimaging in headache patients has revolutionized our understanding of these syndromes. Further insights into the pathophysiology of headache syndromes have been provided by innovative neuroimaging analysis using structural data. This review highlights the recent advances made in studying migraine using neuroimaging techniques.

Several independent studies have reinforced the crucial role for the brainstem in acute and probably also chronic migraine. Recently described structural abnormalities in the visual network of motion-processing areas could account for, or be caused by, the cortical hyperexcitability observed in migraineurs. Although data from morphometric studies are heterogeneous, a recent study suggests an increased density of brainstem structures and decreased grey matter in pain-transmitting areas in migraine patients.

Given the rapid advances in functional neuroimaging, in particular newer techniques such as voxel-based morphometry and magnetic resonance spectrometry, functional imaging continues to play a significant role and opens new avenues in targeting the neural substrates in individual primary headache syndromes.
