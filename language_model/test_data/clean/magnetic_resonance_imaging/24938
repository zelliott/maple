To present a case of tonic pupil associated with enhancement in the region of the ciliary ganglion on magnetic resonance imaging in a patient with sarcoidosis.

Observational case report.

A 52-year-old woman with sarcoidosis had a right pupil exhibiting sectoral palsy to light and light-near dissociation.

Topical administration of 0.1% pilocarpine demonstrated supersensitivity of the right pupillary sphincter muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast revealed enhancement in the region of the right ciliary ganglion.

Tonic pupil may be a manifestation of sarcoidosis, and in such cases, MRI may show enhancement at the level of the ciliary ganglion. Sarcoidosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of tonic pupil.
