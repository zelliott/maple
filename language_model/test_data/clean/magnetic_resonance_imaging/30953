Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is an infectious demyelinating brain disease caused by the JC virus that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host. We report a case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy successfully treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy and cidofovir in an adolescent patient perinatally infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
