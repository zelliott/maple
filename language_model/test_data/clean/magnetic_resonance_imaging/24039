Although uncommon, adrenalectomy occasionally is indicated in children. To date, this procedure has required either a laparotomy or a flank incision. The authors report the case of a child with episodic palpitations, diaphoresis, chest discomfort, and occipital headache who underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma without complication.
