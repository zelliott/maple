Often mentioned and not much documented, the lipoblastic meningioma is an unusual extra-axial benign tumor. It has spontaneously hypodensity in CT and appears with a high signal in MRI in T1-weighted sequence. Its vascularisation is rich and shows a strong contrast intake. Its resection is known as easy and its prognosis is excellent. The authors report here the observation of a 65 year old women having a lipoblastic meningioma. Literature is gone through and differential diagnoses are considered.
