To describe the clinical and neuroradiologic features and chromosomal mapping of a novel autosomal dominant disease affecting the basal ganglia.

The authors characterized a large family with autosomal dominant basal ganglia disease (ADSD) clinically and by MRI, MR spectroscopy (MRS), and SPECT. The authors performed a whole genome genetic linkage scan to map the underlying genetic defect.

The main clinical features of the disease are dysarthria and gait disturbance without any apparent reduction in life expectancy. MRI demonstrated a distinctive lesion pattern restricted mainly to the putamen and caudate nucleus. Genetic linkage analysis localized the causative genetic defect to a 3.25 megabase candidate region on chromosome 5q13.3-q14.1.

ADSD is an autosomal dominant basal ganglia disease mapping to chromosome 5q13.3-q14.1.
