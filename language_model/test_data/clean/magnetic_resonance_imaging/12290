Magnetic resonance (MR) neurography has progressed in the past 2 decades because of rapid technological developments in both hardware and software. In addition to improvements in high-resolution anatomic pulse sequences, functional techniques are becoming feasible. This article presents the current state-of-the-art three-dimensional anatomic techniques, discusses the advantages of functional techniques being exploited, and portrays novel contrast types and molecular techniques that are under development and promise a bright future for this rapidly evolving technique.
