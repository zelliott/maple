In this study large osteochondral defects on the weight-bearing surface of the medial and lateral femoral condyle were treated by transplantation of the autologous posterior condyle in 20 patients. The cartilage defects, type Outerbridge IV, ranged in size from 2 x 1.5 cm to 5 x 3.5 cm. 8 condyle transfers were done from 1984-1996 at the orthopaedic clinic of the university of Balgrist, ZÃ¼rich. 12 condyle transfers at the department of orthopedic sports medicine at the technical university of Munich from 1996-1998. Patients were operated before the condyle transfer, 2 times on average. In 9 patients a high tibial osteotomy was performed simultaneously. Clinical evaluation was done according to the Lysholm score. The Lysholm score improved in the patient serie from 1996 from preoperatively 62 (54-81) points to postoperatively 85 (74-95) points. The follow-up was on average 9.8 (2-26) months. 18 patients reported about pain relief, 2 patients didn't improve. We describe the operative technique. Despite the lack of long-term results the transfer of the autologous posterior condyle seems to be an effective alternative for the knee prosthesis, especially for young patients with a great cartilage damage in the weight bearing area.
