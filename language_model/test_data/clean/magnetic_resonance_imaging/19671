Infantile myofibromatosis (IM) is a nonmetastasizing locally invasive neoplasm. The behavior of the tumor is more hamartomatous than tumoral, and it is unclear whether the cell of origin is a fibroblast or a smooth muscle myocyte. Lesions typically present during infancy and range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. We present an unusual case of a patient with an atrophic variant of IM.
