Hibernoma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the vestiges of fetal brown fat. We present a case of interscapular hibernoma. Computed tomography scan showed a well-circumscribed, hypodense mass with peripheral enhancement, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed intermediate high T1 and T2 signal intensities with incomplete fat suppression. Although it is rare, hibernoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of lipomatous soft-tissue tumors. This is a benign tumor with no malignant potential. Complete excision is the treatment choice.
