Hypothalamic hamartomas are rare congenital malformations presenting with central precocious puberty, gelastic epilepsy and developmental retardation. We report a case of an 11-month-old girl with recurring bloody vaginal discharge. Diagnosis of hypothalamic hamartoma was made on the basis of clinical findings and specific features on magnetic resonance imaging of the hypothalamic region.
