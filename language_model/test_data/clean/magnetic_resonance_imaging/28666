A case of post-traumatic carotid cavernous sinus fistula complicated by coma-producing intraventricular tamponade in a 6-year-old boy is reported. Urgent surgical treatment included external ventricular draining, trapping and muscle embolization by the Jaeger-Hamby procedure. Follow-up cerebral angiography showed complete obliteration of the fistula. The child made an excellent recovery and now leads a normal life.
