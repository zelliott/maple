A large proportion of patients presenting on the acute medical take are frail and elderly and a significant proportion of these will have symptoms such as confusion, reduced mobility and electrolyte disturbances. These symptoms are typically attributed either to the iatrogenic effects of prescribed medications, disturbances in fluid balance and possible infective causes. We describe the case of a gentleman who presented with delirium, reduced mobility and hyponatraemia who was subsequently found to have pituitary failure secondary to pituitary apoplexy.
