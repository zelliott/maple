The present-day optimised surgery (concept of total mesorectal excision) with quality assurance by standardized pathologic examination, advances in radiotherapy and the possibilities of high-spatial-resolution MR imaging require reconsideration of pros and contras of neoadjuvant therapy and respective data. According to the resulting new proposal neoadjuvant long-course radiochemotherapy is indicated for patients with 1) fixed questionably R0 resectable tumors, 2) mobile tumors with the MRT finding of tumor involving the mesorectal fascia or 1 mm or less from it, 3) low rectal tumors extending below the levator origin and invading beyond the muscularis propria. If a high risk of local recurrence becomes apparent during surgery (tumor perforation, incision into or through tumor) or after pathologic examination (incomplete mesorectal excision, tumor 1 mm or less from the circumferential resection margin) adjuvant radiochemotherapy is indicated. In case of lymph node metastasis postoperative chemotherapy is given.
