The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes of patients treated with autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) for full-thickness chondral and osteochondral defects of the femoral condyles and patella.

A retrospective evaluation of clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients treated with AMIC for chondral and osteochondral full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee was performed with a mean follow-up of 28.8 Â± 1.5 months (range, 13-51 months).

Significant improvements in clinical outcome scores (IKDC, Lysholm, Tegner, and VAS pain score) were noted. The largest improvements were seen in the osteochondral subgroup (mean age 25.9 years), whereas patients treated for chondral defects in the patellofemoral joint and on the femoral condyles improved less. Patients in all groups were generally satisfied with their results. MRI evaluation showed that tissue filling was present but generally not complete or homogenous.

AMIC is a safe procedure and leads to clinical improvement of symptomatic full-thickness chondral and osteochondral defects and to regenerative defect filling. The value of AMIC relative to other cartilage repair procedures and to the natural course remains undefined.

Case series, Level IV.
