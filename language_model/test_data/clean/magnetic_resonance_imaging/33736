The role of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the management of carcinoma of the urinary bladder is reviewed and illustrated. In vivo and in vitro MR images of the normal urinary bladder, carcinoma, and surrounding structures are presented. Factors for optimal MR imaging of urinary bladder carcinoma are reviewed. Pulse sequence optimization, (endorectal) surface coils, and other new developments such as fast spin echo, subtraction turbo-fast low angle shot (FLASH), three-dimensional rapid acquisition gradient echo sequences, and the use of contrast agents are discussed. Finally, the value of MR imaging in staging urinary bladder carcinoma is compared with clinical staging, staging based on findings from computed tomography and intravesical sonography.
