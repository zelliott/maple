Two procedures were used with one subject to examine changes in the ear canal with jaw motion. Silicone ear impressions were examined to measure the effect of jaw position. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to define the three-dimensional structure of the canal and visualize key underlying tissue. Results showed that inexpensive impressions can detail changes in the cartilaginous region of the canal. Approximately a 25% change in this subject's ear canal with different jaw positions was observed in the anterior/posterior plane with essentially no change in the superior/inferior plane. This is likely related to asymmetric stress from action of the mandibular condyle on neighboring cartilaginous tissue. Solutions to jaw motion-induced feedback problems are suggested.
