The case of a 37-year-old woman with facial myokymia is reported. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electromyography (EMG) and brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) supported the clinical diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis (MS). MRI showed a single area of abnormal signal in the pontine region. The authors discuss the possible relationship between the brain-stem lesion and the electrophysiological abnormalities demonstrated by BAEPs and the EMG of facial muscles.
