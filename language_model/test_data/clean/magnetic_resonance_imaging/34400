A patient with acute cerebellar ataxia after enteric fever is described. MRI showed multiple hypointense areas in the subcortical areas of the cerebellum on T1-weighted images, and T2-weighted images showed hyperintense lesions in the corresponding areas. Based on these findings, the possible mechanisms of ataxia are discussed.
