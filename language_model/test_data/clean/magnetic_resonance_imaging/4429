A case of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IHP) is discussed with reference to a study of rats maintained on various low-calcium diets. A 45-year-old man complained of difficulty speaking, especially an inability to speak loudly and of fine finger tremors over the past 2 or 3 years. His brain MRI showed marked calcification in the bilateral basal ganglia and cerebellum and his in sera findings showed low calcium, extremely low levels in all kinds of examined parathyroid hormones and 1,25 (OH)2D, thus we diagnosed idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. His finger tremors stopped soon after administration of 1 alpha D3 2 microgram/day as verified by calcium, phosphorus and creatinine levels in sera, however, a brain CT one year later showed no changes in calcification. As reported earlier in studies of deposition in the soft tissues, especially central nervous system tissues of rats maintained on low-calcium diets, it is difficult to reduce calcium deposition if symptoms appear in adults. Therefore, it is necessary to start therapy as soon as possible in order to prevent additional calcium deposition in the early stage of IHP.
