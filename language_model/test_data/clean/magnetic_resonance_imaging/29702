This study evaluated the condyle-disc relationship on magnetic resonance image (MRI) in a group of subjects with silent temporomandibular joints (TMJs) when tested clinically with those in subjects with discernible temporomandibular sounds. Study design Twenty-five completely edentulous patients were selected to participate in this study. The study was based on bilateral MRIs of 15 patients (with articular sound) and 10 symptom-free volunteers (control).

It was noted that disc displacement was found in 45% of the TMJs with no history of articular sounds. In 6 TMJs of control group, a reducing disc displacement was found, and in 3 TMJs a permanent displacement was found. Disc displacements were identified in 70% of patients. Reducing disc displacement was found in 19 of these TMJs, whereas permanent displacement was found in 2 TMJs. In 9 of the joints of the symptomatic group, a superior disc position was found. Also verified was a significant association between reducing disc displacement and biconvex disc.

These observations demonstrated that internal derangements can not be associated to clicking joints or symptoms of temporomandibular disorders in elderly edentulous patients, and the presence of displaced discs seems to be associated to altered disc morphology, but not to osseous abnormalities.
