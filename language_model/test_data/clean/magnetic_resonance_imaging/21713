The "skew deviation" also called Hertwig Magendie syndrome is an ocular static disease. Two features are encountered: conjugate deviation and vertical divergence with one eye with upward gaze and the other with one downward gaze. The authors report a simple case in a 50 years old woman. The role of M.R.I. or C.T. scan in the diagnosis is emphasized. The pathogenic mechanism remains obscure.
