Cardiovascular MR imaging is unique in its ability to combine anatomic, physiologic, and functional information in a single examination. Established applications in the pediatric population include the evaluation of the child with a suspected thoracic aortic arch anomaly, vascular compression of the airway, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary arterial and venous abnormalities, and cardiac or paracardiac masses. The increasing availability of radiologists with the knowledge and commitment to cardiac imaging will allow this exciting technique to thrive in the future, to the benefit of our patients.
