Pterygoid fossa neoplasms in children are rare. Management of these neoplasms has been challenging because of tumor vascularity, difficult surgical access and complex anatomy from which these tumors arise. Surgical approach depends upon tumor extension and ability to obtain adequate exposure for successful tumor excision. We present three cases of an approach to the pterygopalatine fossa not previously described. The technique is cosmetically superior to the lateral rhinotomy approach and it preserves blood supply by leaving a portion of the periosteum attached to the maxilla. Furthermore, it avoids permanent hypesthesia/anesthesia of the midface with mobilization of the infraorbital nerve.
