A SPIO-phthalocyanine nanohybrid is developed as a bimodal contrast agent for Optical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The organic coating was covalently attached onto SPIO in a step-by-step approach. Each coated-SPIO was thoroughly characterized. The hydrodynamic size of the SPIO-Pc is ca. 60 nm with a coverage of ca. 690 Pc/SPIO.
