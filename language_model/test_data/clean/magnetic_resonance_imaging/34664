A six-year-old boy consulted an ophthalmologist, because another boy had hit his right eye with a tree branch. There were slight corneal erosions, and a superficial small wound in the oedematous upper lid. The erosions healed in 2 days, but the lid showed progressive ptosis and oedema. Computed tomography revealed a hyperdense, tight structure, which was suspected to be a foreign particle. An orbital exploration was made three times, but the foreign body was not found. After prolonged suppuration, two wooden particles appeared spontaneously 4 and 5.5 months after the trauma. After that, the suppuration subsided and the wound healed.
