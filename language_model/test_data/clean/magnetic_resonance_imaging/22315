The effect of the novel inhibitor of receptor-activated and calcium store-operated nonselective cation channels, (RS)-(3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline-1-gamma 1)-2-phenyl-N, N-di-[2(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl) ethyl]acetamide (LOE 908 MS), on focal cerebral ischemia was studied in halothane-anesthetized rats submitted to permanent suture occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). The treated group (n = 7) received subcutaneous injections of 30 mg/kg LOE 908 MS (in 1 ml saline) 10 min after vascular occlusion and again after 3 h. The untreated group (n = 11) was injected subcutaneously with 1 ml saline at the same times. Evolution of infarct was monitored by electrophysiological recording of EEG and cortical steady potential and by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging during the initial 6 h of vascular occlusion. The hemodynamic, biochemical, and morphological changes were studied after 6 h by combining autoradiographic measurement of blood flow with histological stainings and pictorial measurements of ATP, glucose, and tissue pH. In the untreated animals, the ischemic lesion volume [defined as the region in which the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water declined to below 80% of control] steadily increased by approximately 50% during the initial 6 h of vascular occlusion relative to the first set of data 10 min postocclusion. In the treated animals, in contrast, the ADC lesion volume declined by approximately 20% during the same interval. Treatment also led to a significant reduction in the number of periinfarct depolarizations. After 6 h of vascular occlusion, blood flow was significantly higher in the treated animals, and the volume of ATP-depleted and morphologically injured tissue representing the infarct core was 60-70% smaller. The volume of severely acidic tissue, in contrast, did not differ, indicating that LOE 908 MS does not reduce the size of ischemic penumbra. These findings demonstrate that postocclusion treatment of permanent focal ischemia with LOE 908 MS delays the expansion of the infarct core into the penumbra for a duration of at least 6 h and therefore substantially prolongs the window of opportunity for the reversal of the ischemic impact in the peripheral parts of the evolving infarct.
