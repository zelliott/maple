This study evaluated the correlative use of MRI methods and gross anatomy to monitor tendon displacement in the central region of the palm at rest and during flexion and extension of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints with respect to the corresponding neurovascular bundles (NVBs). In all of the samples the neutral and extended positions showed the NVB to be palmar with respect to the flexor tendons, while during flexion tendon displacement caused the NVB to be dorsal to both the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendons. T1-weighted MR images correlated with gross anatomical slides demonstrated that significant changes occur in the relative positions of the flexor tendons and associated NVBs of the palm upon flexion and extension.
