Chronic cannabis use is associated with cognitive impairment and has been identified as a risk factor for schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia show profound deficits in social cognition such as the ability to attribute mental states to others, referred to as "theory of mind" (ToM). Aberrant activation of the ToM network has been demonstrated across different phases of schizophrenia, including at-risk stages. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the ToM network in chronic cannabis users. Fifteen cannabis users received functional brain imaging during performance of a ToM cartoon story task. Findings were compared with 14 control subjects. Cannabis users showed less activation in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the right precuneus and cuneus, but greater activation in the left cuneus and the right anterior cingulate gyrus compared to healthy controls. These activation patterns resemble those found in at-risk populations, suggesting that cannabis use can affect the processing of social information similar to other risk factor constellations for psychosis.
