Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is frequently associated with retroorbital involvement, which typically responds slowly to the standard therapy of oral corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents. We describe the case of a 61-year-old man with WG, who developed marked retroorbital granulomatous inflammatory tissue and experienced a dramatic clinical and radiographic response to the administration of high dose intravenous (iv) methylprednisolone. We believe that high dose iv methylprednisolone may have distinct advantages over standard therapies in the treatment of retroorbital WG.
