Although there are multiple variations in acquisition protocols for breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, there is agreement that components of high-quality technique include a bilateral acquisition obtained with a dedicated breast coil. Further, key pulse sequences should be included and spatial and temporal resolution should be sufficiently high to assess lesion morphology and kinetics. Artifacts must be recognized and avoided. The American College of Radiology Breast MRI Accreditation Program requirements provide minimum standards to guide facilities in technique. MR imaging at 3 T is increasingly available and offers signal-to-noise ratio advantages over 1.5 T but also some technical challenges.
