Connective tissue adaptation, including the development of cartilaginous anlagen into bones, is widely believed to be related to dynamic, intermittent load and stress histories. Static stresses, on the other hand, are generally believed deleterious in tissue adaptation. Using serial MRI in a natural human experiment (manipulation and corrective casting of infant clubfoot), we have observed casting produces two effects: (1) the well recognized change in relative positions of the hindfoot anlagen; (2) a newly recognized immediate shape change in the anlagen. These changes seemingly enhance the rate of growth of the anlagen and of the ossific nucleus. The shape change or deformation in the anlagen would occur as a result of alterations in the magnitudes and directions of loading from soft tissue attachments and muscle activity and would necessarily be associated with changes in the stress states within the anlagen and, when present, the ossific nuclei. Given the known role of load and stress history in tissue adaptation, we presume the reduced stress histories influence the enhanced growth rates. These observations contradict some current theories of tissue adaptation since static, rather than dynamic stresses play a crucial role in accelerating the growth and development of anlagen in the infant clubfoot.
