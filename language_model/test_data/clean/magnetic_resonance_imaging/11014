In contrast to the opinion that prevailed in the 1980es, there is now increasing evidence that the plasticity of the human brain, i. e. its remarkable ability to adapt to and change with experience, is, under normal conditions, a lifelong phenomenon. Representations of the environment are associated with activations and biochemical modifications in neuronal networks, which will be stabilized, modified or will wither in the course of cumulated experience. The capability to modify the biochemistry of synapses as well as the growth and change in terms of rewiring of synapses, dendritic branching and glial cell proliferation via the dialogue of synapses and genes, results in specific changes in neuronal connectivity and function. On the neurotransmitter level, glutamate and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) as well as dopamine and serotonin, but also endorphin and encephalin, have a key position in this context. These neurotransmitter systems modulate neuronal plasticity on the neuronal level; on the behavioural level they influence affect, emotion, positive motivation and the correct evaluation of environmental stimuli. Experience, action as well as learning and memory are influenced by these systems. A basic thesis of this paper is that these mechanisms are involved in neuronal plasticity and that learning and memory are thus not only used and reused in structuring the CNS during the initial establishment of connections in the immature brain, in lifelong memory consolidation or the rewiring after brain damage, but can also be used to mould experience, learning und behaviour during psychotherapy and rehabilitation in adults.
