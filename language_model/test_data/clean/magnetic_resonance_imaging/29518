To assess the values of pulse sequences with ultrashort echo times (0.08 msec) for detecting and characterizing periosteum.

Two normal volunteers aged 33 and 58 years and 12 patients aged seven to 55 years were studied. A total of 10 of the patients had contrast enhancement with intravenous Gadodiamide. Two ovine tibias were examined before and after the periosteum was stripped from the bone.

High signal regions were observed adjacent to cortical bone in all parts of the skeleton imaged. They were generally more conspicuous after fat suppression and contrast administration. In the ovine tibia there was a reduction in the high signal normally seen at the surface of the bone after periosteal stripping. The detached periosteum produced a high signal. Mean T(2)* values for adult human periosteum ranged from 5.3 to 11.4 msec. After enhancement the signal intensity increased. In two patients with tibial fractures, increased periosteal signal was seen and this showed marked enhancement. Signals from periosteum could be simulated by fat, contrast-enhanced blood and artifacts.

The periosteum can be visualized with ultrashort echo time pulse sequences in health and disease.
