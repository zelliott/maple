Bioabsorbable screws composed of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) were used for graft fixation and studied prospectively with serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at 8, 16, and 24 months after autogenous patellar tendon anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in 10 patients. Conventional spin echo, proton density, and T2-weighted double echo sequences were obtained, as well as T2-weighted fat-saturated fast spin echo sequences. All but one of the screws (19 of 20) were evident in all serial scans. These showed minimal decrease in size over time. The one screw that had completely disappeared 8 months after reconstruction had cracked during insertion. None of the reconstructed ACL grafts showed clinical instability, persistent effusions, or detectable adverse reactions to the screws. Two patients developed abnormal signal in the tibial tunnel: one developed fluid anterior to the graft, and the other developed increased signal within the graft. The abnormal signal resolved with time in both patients. Other than the preceding changes, no abnormalities were detected on conventional sequences. Fat-saturated fast spin echo sequences showed a variable amount of increased signal around the tunnels, suggesting edema or fibrovascular marrow changes. The changes noted near the tunnels on the fat-suppressed scans most probably represent a general reaction to surgical insult rather than a reaction to the bioabsorbable screws, as similar changes were noted at the patellar harvest site.
