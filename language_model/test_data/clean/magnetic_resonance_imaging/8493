We present a case of unusual distribution of red marrow in a patient with extramedullary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In adults, hematopoietic marrow is usually located in the axial skeleton and the proximal aspects of the limbs, except for the epiphyses. Nodular islets of red marrow located in the epiphyseal and distal parts of the limbs may mimic tumoral infiltration and be mistaken for chloroma in a patient with AML.
