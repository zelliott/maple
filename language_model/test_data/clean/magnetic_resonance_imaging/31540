Ganglia of the knee joint are rare and are mostly an incidental finding during arthroscopy or MRI examinations. Usually their origin is intraarticular, arising from the menisci or ACL or PCL. Ganglia arising from the infrapatellar fat pad are rare and only few are mentioned in the literature. We report a case of infrapattellar ganglion in a 41-year-old female, which developed from the infrapattellar fad pad and with minimal intraarticular extension.
