In order to evaluate the diagnostic capabilities of MR Imaging in defining triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) lesions, 49 selected patients--21 with rheumatoid arthritis, 13 with traumatic injury and 15 with wrist fracture--presenting chronic wrist pain were examined with MR Imaging. The wrists of 12 healthy subjects were also studied as a control group. MR examinations were performed by means of a superconductive 1.0 T unit (Magnetom-Siemens); SE and GE T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences were employed to acquire images of the wrists on the coronal, axial and, if necessary, sagittal planes. The results showed peripheral TFC tears in 10 cases, central TFC lesions in 12 cases and TFC lesions with collateral insertion involvement in 9 cases. In 4 patients focal thickening of TFC without disruption was observed. The correct diagnosis was made in all the 19 surgically verified cases. Our experience confirms the clinical value of MR Imaging in the evaluation of TFC lesions in patients with chronic ulnar pain syndrome.
