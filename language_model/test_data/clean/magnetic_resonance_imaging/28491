An accurate knowledge of cerebral anatomy is important in order to evaluate the precise location of a cerebral lesion. Cortical structures are identified by knowledge of the adjacent gyri and sulci; however, white matter tracts are difficult to differentiate from one another due to the lack of clear anatomic landmarks. Therefore, even if MRI shows obvious white matter abnormalities, in some cases it is difficult accurately to localize the lesion. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the location of the main white matter tracts by using three-dimensional MR imaging. MRI study was performed by 1.5 Tesla (Signa: General Electric). Computer assisted analysis with Voxtool software (General Electric) was used to generate both surface brain and tomographic images. The exact anatomic basis of white matter signal abnormalities is important when analyzing patients with disconnective syndromes or neuropsychological deficits such as conduction aphasia, visuospatial deficit etc. This preliminary attempt at constructing a three-dimensional MRI white matter atlas of the brain may be helpful for evaluating the anatomico-clinical correlations in these patients, and also as teaching materials for the clinical (neurologic, neurosurgical), anatomic and radiographic disciplines.
