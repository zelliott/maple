The purpose of this study was to estimate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate plus glutamine (Glx) concentrations in the cortical tubers of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) using the MEGA-editing J-difference method and a stimulated echo-acquisition mode with a short echo time, and to determine which abnormality was more dominant between GABA and Glx in patients with TSC with epilepsy. This study included six patients with TSC (mean age, 4.3 years) and seven control subjects (mean age, 4.8 years). Measurements were obtained with a three-Tesla apparatus and postprocessing was conducted with an LCModel. The GABA level in the cortical gray matter (cgGABA) was calculated as a result of segmentation in voxels and from the literature values for gray and white matter ratios for GABA. Increased GABA and myo-inositol (mI) concentrations and a decreased N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentration were observed in the cortical tubers. The cgGABA level, and cgGABA/NAA and cgGABA/Glx ratios were also higher in patients with TSC than in control subjects. No significant difference was found in Glx concentration between patients with TSC and control subjects. Although the number of patients with TSC in this study was small, the increase in GABA and no significant change in Glx were consistent with previous neurochemical studies and support the hypothesis that brain GABA plays a key role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy during the process of neuronal development.
