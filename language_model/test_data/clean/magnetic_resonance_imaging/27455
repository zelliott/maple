Like other forms of laparoscopic surgery, laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (Lap-PD) is a minimally invasive procedure that can greatly reduce bleeding during surgery. We performed Lap-PD for a case of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. To remove the resected tissue from the body, we made a small incision directly above the line of transection of the distal pancreas (the cut stump). This procedure requires complex reconstructive procedures, which we performed through the same small incision. All reconstructive procedures, except for hepaticojejunostomy, were performed under direct visualization; hepaticojejunostomy was performed laparoscopically. The reconstructive surgery was effective and was as safe as open abdominal surgery. We also discuss the value of using an endoscopic linear stapler for Lap-PD pancreatic transection, to reduce extravasation of pancreatic fluid into the abdominal cavity during the resection of tumors involving the pancreatic ducts, such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.
