Epithelioid hemangioma is a rare and benign vascular tumor, most often occurring in the skin. Numerous other localizations, including bones, have been reported. The overall favorable clinical outcome of cutaneous epithelioid hemangioma is now well documented, but it still remains debated in osseous localization, as local recurrences and metastases have been described. We report a case of epithelioid hemangioma of the spine occurring in a 25-year-old male, and discuss main differential diagnoses. Recent studies tend to demonstrate that osseous epithelioid hemangioma, as cutaneous epithelioid hemangioma, should be considered as a benign tumor. Histologically, epithelioid hemangioma consists of a vascular proliferation with diffuse or lobular pattern and features vascular spaces lined by epitheliod endothelial cells with numerous lymphocytes and eosinophils. The main differential diagnosis is represented by epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, the surgical treatment of which must be more aggressive. Precise histological diagnosis is essential for accurate clinical management and to avoid overtreatment.
