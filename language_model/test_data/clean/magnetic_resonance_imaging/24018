Dysplastic gangliocytoma or Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD) is a hamartomatous malformation of the cerebellar hemisphere that usually presents with signs of increased intracranial pressure or symptoms of cerebellar dysfunction. In this paper, we report a case of LDD presenting with tinnitus, and postulate a probable mechanism for this unusual presentation.
