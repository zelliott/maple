Physical phenomena that occur during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the position of the patient inside the scanning tube necessitate adaptations of anesthetic techniques and devices. An anesthesia unit is presented that operates in close proximity to the patient without interfering with the imaging process. This unit enables the anesthesiologist to be close to the patient and his equipment, and minimizes the length of necessary tubing between patient and anesthesia apparatus. The unit consists of commonly used, commercially available devices with only minor modifications.
