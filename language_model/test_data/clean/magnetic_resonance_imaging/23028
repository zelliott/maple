Occipital brain injury associated with neonatal hypoglycemia can result in long-term disability, epilepsy, and visual impairment. The etiology of this pattern of injury is unclear; however, transient hyperinsulinism may be an independent risk factor. Magnetic resonance brain imaging can delineate the extent of brain injury and guide follow-up.
