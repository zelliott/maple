This report details a case of prostatic cancer associated with cystic degeneration. A cystic mass may occur in the pelvis for various reasons. A congenital cyst is associated with an abnormality in the paramesonephric (m√ºllerian) duct or mesonephric (wolffian) duct. An acquired cyst can be classified into three main types, retention, malignant and parasitic, however a cyst accompanying prostatic cancer is rare. In this particular case the size of the cyst under imaging was approximately 15 cm in diameter; this makes it one of the largest among those previously reported.
