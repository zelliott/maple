The phase-encoding scheme can significantly affect the quality of fast spin-echo (FSE) images because the echo amplitude is modulated as a function of the echo position in k-space. The effects of the modulation in two-dimensional FSE imaging include ghosting and blurring artifacts and resolution loss in the phase-encoding (PE) direction. In 3D FSE imaging, the use of two PE directions presents the opportunity for improved PE schemes. A new scheme for assignment of echoes to views in 3D FSE, termed generalized, has been developed. This scheme distributes T(2) effects along both PE directions, allowing considerable flexibility in the selection of blurring artifact appearance. In a set of simulations, phantom experiments, and in vivo experiments, the performance of the generalized PE scheme for 3D FSE imaging was compared with the performance of existing PE schemes. The results demonstrate that the generalized PE scheme can be used to reduce blurring artifacts greatly relative to other PE techniques that are presently in use. This approach to PE can be used to manipulate the blurring artifact appearance and to optimize acquisition time.
