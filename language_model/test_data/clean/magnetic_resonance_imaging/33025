Surgery for refractory extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE) in the pediatric age group has been reported to be associated with a high percentage of failure and relapse. We performed a retrospective study of 53 consecutive patients with epilepsy onset before 12 years of age, who underwent, mostly at a pediatric age, an individually tailored ETLE surgery (32 in frontal and 21 in posterior cerebral areas) for pharmacoresistant seizures; these patients were selected and followed by a single national tertiary care pediatric center. Mean age at seizure onset was 3.14 years, and mean age at surgery was 11.23 years. Complete seizure freedom was achieved in 75% of the subjects. Short duration of illness before surgery, MRI features, no invasive pre-surgical evaluation, a localized interictal and ictal pattern as well as the presence of ictal fast activity on scalp EEG, localized interictal fast rhythms and absence of a diffuse initial ictal modification during SEEG, a complete resection of the epileptogenic zone, a type II FCD, and the absence of acute postoperative seizures correlated in a statistically significant way with a seizure-free outcome. We conclude that the seizure outcome of ETLE surgery in a carefully selected pediatric population can be excellent.
