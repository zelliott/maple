Computed tomography (CT) perfusion is traditionally performed using iodinated contrast, but this can be problematic in patients with impaired renal function or contrast allergy. We report a case of a 63-year-old man whose medical history was complicated by chronic renal failure, which was exacerbated after placement of a left cervical internal carotid artery stent by 70% stenosis and left hemisphere perfusion deficit. On a follow-up clinic visit, because of the patient s chronic renal failure, CT perfusion was performed successfully using gadolinium without further renal complications.
