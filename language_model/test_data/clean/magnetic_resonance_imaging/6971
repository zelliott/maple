'Benign' brain tumors are a heterogeneous group of primary neoplasms representing 40% of primary brain tumors. Amongst neuroepithelial tumors, astrocytic neoplasms predominate, followed by oligodendroglial and mixed glial and glial-neuronal neoplasms. Less common are tumors of the ependyma, choroid plexus and neuroepithelial tumors of unknown origin such as chordoid glioma of the third ventricle. Neurosurgical intervention is indicated in order to establish a diagnosis, alleviate symptoms of mass effect, hydrocephalus, or hemorrhage, remove a seizure focus and decrease the cell pool at risk of malignant degeneration. As the majority of patients survive their tumor for years after initial diagnosis, the benefits of therapy must be carefully weighed against adverse treatment effects. This article, with a particular focus on surgical management, reflects the authors approach to the treatment of low-grade tumors of the brain parenchyma in the adult and reviews the pertinent literature published on this controversial issue.
