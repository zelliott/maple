The presence of a non-functioning tumor of the adrenal gland, which proved to be a myelolipoma, was the reason for a diagnostic approach to its etiology by means of the use of different imaging techniques (conventional radiology, angiography, E.C.O., C.A.T. and N.M.R.). As on most of the occasions, it was a question of a middle-aged patient, in this case a woman, displaying obesity and H.T.A. No symptom could be directly connected with the myelolipoma. We also used the clinical case to carry out a review of the different etiopathogenic and clinical aspects in order to lay down treatment guidelines.
