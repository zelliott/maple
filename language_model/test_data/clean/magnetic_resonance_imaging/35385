We investigated which brain areas show error-related activity during online motor control while errors occur independently from decision making. During motor tasks, error is a deviation from accuracy or correctness. The effect of the accuracy level on error-related brain activity is unclear. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we investigated how error-related brain activity, especially in fronto-medial wall areas, depended on motor accuracy (MA). Subjects performed a force tracking task with the thumb-index grip: to continuously follow a moving target on a monitor with a cursor which position was controlled by the force amount produced by the fingers. Task difficulty varied with changes in the cursor size (the smaller the cursor, the more difficult the task). We measured the motor accuracy (mean distance between the cursor center and the target) and the error amount (cursor out of the target). Errors were produced when motor accuracy was low and also when motor accuracy was high. For fMRI data processing, we defined a model based on both the error amount and the motor accuracy. The results showed that supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation increased with error and task difficulty independent of the accuracy of motor control. Interestingly, activity in the rostral part of left ACC only increased with error when the motor accuracy was low, independently from task difficulty. These results suggest a clear functional dissociation between dorsal and rostral ACC in error processing which depends on the amount of attentional resources allocated to motor accuracy.
