The annual incidence of parotid neoplasms are between 0,4-13,5 for 100.000 people, almost the fourth part of it with malignant histology. The ductal parotid carcinoma has a lower incidence and a high malignancy. In the last years, the imaging advances permit a better therapeutical approach, facilitating the realisation of more complex surgical techniques. We present a male patient 76 years old with a ductal parotid carcinoma affecting all the gland and contacting the mastoid. We insist that precise preoperatory exams of the tumorals lesions of the parotid area are important for an adequate surgical interpretation and to try a complexe extirpation.
