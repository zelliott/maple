Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) usually follows a viral infection or an immunization and is thought to be an immunomediated disease. We describe a patient with ADEM after multiple yellow jacket bee stings. The patient recovered after treatment with a high dose of methylprednisolone. Although the pathologic mechanism exact remains unclear, potential cross-reactivity between bee toxins and the central nervous system myelin could induce demyelination. ADEM should be considered a rare complication of bee stings.
