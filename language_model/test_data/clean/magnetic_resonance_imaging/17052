Spontaneous brain activity across many time scales influences sensory perception and human cognitive performance. Empirical insight into the underlying systems-level mechanisms has, however, remained fragmented. We review here recent studies on how wideband scale-free and scale-specific neuronal activity fluctuations together bias sensory processing and perceptual performance. We posit that these fluctuations constitute the neurophysiological foundation for both the trial-to-trial behavioral variability and the scaling laws governing psychophysical performance.
