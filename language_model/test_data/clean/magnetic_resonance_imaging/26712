In this study, we compared the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes between intragastric load of monosodium L-glutamate (MSG) and inosine monophosphate (IMP), which elicit the umami taste. An intragastric load of 30 mM IMP or 60 mM MSG induced a BOLD signal increase in several brain regions, including the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), lateral hypothalamus (LH), and insular cortex. Only MSG increased the BOLD signal in the amygdala (AMG). The time course of the BOLD signal changes in the NTS and the LH in the IMP group was different from that of the MSG group. We further compared the brain regions correlated with the BOLD signal change in the NTS between MSG and IMP groups. The BOLD responses in the hippocampus and the orbital cortex were associated with activation of the NTS in both MSG and IMP groups, but the association in the AMG and the pyriform was only in MSG group. These results indicate that gut stimulation with MSG and IMP evoked BOLD responses in distinct regions with different temporal patterns and that the mechanism of perception of L-glutamate and IMP in the gastrointestinal tract differed from that in the taste-sensing system.
