Case study on a 45-year-old female with progressive weakness and paresthesias in her lower extremities and a magnetic resonance image of an intramedullary mass at the level of C5-6 and a Klippel-Feil (KF) deformity ventral to the lesion.

Present an interesting case of an intramedullary mass coexisting with a ventral KF deformity with review of the medical literature on intramedullary masses and cervical spine biomechanics.

New York city, New York, USA.

Case study with discussion of neurosurgical and neuropathological findings and review of the literature.

The patient underwent open neurosurgical excisional biopsy of the intramedullary mass which revealed a non-neoplastic inflammatory mass that slowly resolved with medical management.

While no definitive etiology was found in this case we offer two interesting mechanisms: (1) maldevelopment of the cervical spine or (2) this inflammatory mass is in response to an abnormal motion at the level of the Klippel-Feil.
