The authors describe the treatment and results of thoracoscopic resection performed in patients with neurogenic tumors.

Seven patients with large intrathoracic paraspinal neurogenic tumors underwent a thoracoscopic procedure to achieve gross-total resection. All tumors were entirely intrathoracic and treated thoracoscopically except in one patient whose tumor had an intraspinal extension. Gross-total resection was achieved in all cases. Postoperatively, one patient developed Homer syndrome. The only other complication, transient intercostal neuralgia, resolved in all patients. Clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up examination in all patients demonstrated no evidence of recurrent disease (mean follow up 12.5 months).

Endoscopic transthoracic approaches can reduce approach-related soft-tissue morbidity and facilitate a patient's recovery by preserving the normal tissues of the chest wall, by avoiding rib retraction and muscle transection, and by reducing postoperative pain.
