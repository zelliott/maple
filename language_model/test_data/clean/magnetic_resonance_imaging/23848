To evaluate the validity of data derived from magnetic source imaging (MSI) regarding cerebral dominance for language in patients with intractable seizure disorder.

The authors performed functional imaging of the receptive language cortex using a whole-head neuromagnetometer in 26 consecutive epilepsy patients who also underwent the intracarotid amobarbital (Wada) procedure. During MSI recordings, patients engaged in a word recognition task. This task was shown previously to activate language areas in normal adults as well as in patients who undergo intraoperative language mapping, allowing confirmation of MSI findings. Language laterality indices were formed for both the Wada and the MSI procedures. In addition, clinical judgments regarding cerebral dominance for language were made using the two methods by independent raters.

Cluster analysis indicated excellent agreement between the quantitative MSI and Wada indices. Rater judgments showed almost complete agreement as well.

MSI is a promising method for determining cerebral dominance for language.
