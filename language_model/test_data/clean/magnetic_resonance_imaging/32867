In the last decade, the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in neonatal care for prematurely born infants has rapidly expanded and evolved. Recent investigations addressed many of the practical issues pertaining to image acquisition and interpretation, enabling high-quality MR images to be obtained without sedating medications in preterm infants at any institution. Expanded application has demonstrated that MRI provides superior ability to assess cerebral development and identify and define cerebral injury in comparison to other imaging modalities. Term equivalent MRI results have been shown to correlate with neurodevelopmental outcomes, providing improved predictive ability over other neuroimaging, clinical or physical examination measures. Regular utilisation of MRI in this population is fundamental to gaining the knowledge and expertise necessary for rational, accurate application. Ongoing experiences will continue to shape the nature and type of information available to clinicians and families using MRI, further refining its role as a routine element of neonatal care.
