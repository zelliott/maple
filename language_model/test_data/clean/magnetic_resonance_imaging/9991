The aim of this study is to evaluate the relation between bone bruise and (peri-)articular derangement and to assess the impact of bone bruise on presentation and short term course of knee complaints. We recorded MR abnormalities in 664 consecutive patients with sub-acute knee complaints. Patients were divided in four groups: patients with and without intra-articular knee pathology, subdivided in patients with and without bone bruise. We assessed function and symptoms at the time of MR and 6 months thereafter. Bone bruises were diagnosed in 124 of 664 patients (18.7%). Patients with bone bruise had significantly more complete ACL, lateral meniscal, MCL and LCL tears. Both with and without intra-articular pathology patients with bone bruise had a significantly poorer function at the time of MR (Noyes score of, respectively, 313.21 versus 344.81 and 306.98 versus 341.19). Patients with bone bruise and intra-articular pathology showed significantly more decrease in activity (decrease of Tegner score from 6.28 to 2.12 versus 5.70-2.55). At 6 months there were no significant differences in clinical parameters between the four groups. We concluded that bone bruise in combination with MCL tear is an important cause of initial clinical impairment in patients with sub-acute knee complaints. Clinical improvement within 6 months is more pronounced than in patients without bone bruise.
