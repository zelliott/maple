Tracheobronchomegaly is a rare disorder. A marked dilatation of the trachea and the main stem bronchi is the characteristic sign measured as an enlarged transverse diameter (mean +/- 3 SD). Bronchiectasis is usual. In about one third of the published cases a diverticulosis was described as demonstrated in one our cases. For diagnostic modern radiological methods (CT including 3 D reconstruction, MRT) and bronchoscopy are recommended. The number and seize of the diverticula are documented by tracheography or by bronchography. In a part of all cases of tracheobronchomegaly the cause of the disorder is known. Therefore a division into congenital and acquired tracheobronchomegaly is useful.
