A 62-year-old man consulted our hospital complaining of macroscopic hematuria. Intravenous urography showed a dilated terminal portion of the left ureter resembling a cobra head. Cystoscopy revealed multiple tumors on the ureterocele. There were no metastatic lesions on CT and MRI. Transurethral resection of the tumor and the ureterocele was performed and the pathological examination revealed transitional cell carcinoma on the ureterocele. This is the 4th case of urothelial cancer on a simple ureterocele reported in Japan.
