Five patients with intra-petrous facial neuromas were treated between 1993 and 1995. The most common symptom was facial paralysis in four cases and conduction hearing loss with a mass behind the tympanic membrane in one case. For all cases a MRI led to an accurate diagnosis of the tumoral invasion. Four patients had an operation (one middle cranial fossa approach, one transmastoidal approach and two transmastoidal approach and middle cranial fossa approach associated). Results are analysed and a discussion on the clinical and para-clinical diagnosis as well as the treatment method is realized considering the literature.
