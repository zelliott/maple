Ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) contrast agents for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. However, the images observed and the kinetic profiles obtained differ from one agent to another. In this study, BD IX rats received an intravenous penis injection of the USPIO contrast agents AMI-HS and AMI-227. A cytologic study of the liver was performed, and the data obtained were compared with those of MRI. Images acquired in light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, microanalysis and electron diffraction provided data on the cell categories involved in the processing of these contrast agents, the importance and modalities of each category relative to this processing, and the modalities of agent elimination. AMI-HS was rapidly removed from the bloodstream by Kupffer's cells and hepatocytes and then eliminated through bile ducts. AMI-227 remained much longer in the blood compartment since it was processed very slowly by endothelial and Kuppfer's cells in the near absence of hepatocytic participation and thus of elimination by the bile ducts. These results allowed us to base our interpretation of MRI sequences on cytologic observations.
