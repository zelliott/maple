To analyze which factors influence the operative outcome, and compare advantages and disadvantages of relative surgical approaches.

Eleven cases with the foramen magnum meningioma were operated by using posterior approach with lateral extension.

Complete removal of the tumor was performed in 7 patients (7/11, 64%), subtotal resection in 2 cases (2/11, 18%) and partial resection in 2 cases (2/11, 18%). There were no operative death and significant complication.

The posterior approach with lateral enlargement is sufficient to expose and remove foramen magnum tumors without expensive bone resection.
