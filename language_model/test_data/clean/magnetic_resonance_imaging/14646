Advances in the treatment of pediatric abdominopelvic malignancies have increased survival drastically. Imaging is critical in initial tumor characterization/staging, assessment of treatment response, and surveillance following therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is playing an increasing role in the care of these patients due to its lack of ionizing radiation, superior contrast resolution and the ability to characterize tumors based on tissue characteristics (e.g., T1 and T2 relaxation times). Modern MR techniques also allow for assessment of tumors based on functional characteristics. This article is focused on emerging MRI technologies and potential applications in the imaging of pediatric abdominopelvic malignancies.
