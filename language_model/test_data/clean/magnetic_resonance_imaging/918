We report on a patient with fibromuscular dysplasia who presented with a right-sided giant calcified cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm and two additional supraophthalmic ICA aneurysms. Endovascular closure of the right ICA using detachable balloons was performed with collateralisation of the right hemisphere via the right-sided posterior communicating and the anterior communicating arteries. Repeat angiography after 6 months demonstrated spontaneous complete regression of the two supraophthalmic aneurysms, although the parent vessel was still perfused. In comparison to the former angiography, the flow within the parent vessel was reversed due to the proximal ICA balloon occlusion. MRI demonstrated that the aneurysms were not obliterated by thrombosis alone, but showed a real regression in size. This case report demonstrates that changes in cerebral hemodynamics potentially lead to plastic changes in the vessel architecture in adults and that aneurysms can be flow-related, even if not associated with high flow fistulas or arteriovenous malformations, especially in cases with an arterial wall disease.
