The clinical and pathologic features of a mixed (composite) gliosarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor occurring in a 54-year-old male are presented. A large cyst and the presence of Rosenthal fibers are also unusual features of this tumor. To our knowledge, such a morphologically variegated tumor has not previously been reported.
