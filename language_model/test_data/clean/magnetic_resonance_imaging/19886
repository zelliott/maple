Several pre-operative work-up protocols have been used while selecting epileptic patients for surgery among different centers. The relative value of the different available pre-operative tests is still under discussion.

We report on the surgical outcome obtained in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy associated to mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and who were evaluated pre-operatively by interictal EEG and MRI alone.

Forty one patients with refractory unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy were evaluated using interictal EEG and MRI. MRI disclosed unilateral MTS in all patients. All patients had at least 4 interictal EEG recordings. All patients were submitted to cortico-amygdalo-hippocampectomy at the side determined by MRI.

Interictal EEG showed unilateral epileptiform discharges compatible with MRI findings in 37 patients; in four out of the 41 patients, bilateral discharges were found. Mean follow-up time was 4.3+/-1.1 years. Thirty-nine patients (95.1%) were classified as Engels Class I (70.6% Engel I-A). Two patients (4.9%) were rated as Engel's Class II. All patients in whom bilateral discharges were found were in Engels Class I. Pathological examination showed MTS in all patients.

It is possible to adequately select good surgical candidates for temporal lobe resection using MRI and interictal EEG alone. In patients with MRI-defined MTS we should expect a postoperative remission rate higher then 90%. The finding of MTS on MRI is the most important good prognostic factor after temporal lobe resection.
