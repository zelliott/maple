To describe the neuro-ophthalmic presentations of a rare intracranial tumor, hemangiopericytoma.

Retrospective multicenter case series.

The neuro-ophthalmic and radiographic features of hemangiopericytoma are reviewed. The clinical presentation may mimic meningioma and the pre-operative distinction between meningioma and hemangiopericytoma is important because the evaluation, management, treatment, and prognosis differ significantly for the two lesions.

We report five cases of intracranial hemangiopericytoma and review the neuro-ophthalmic findings of this uncommon entity.
