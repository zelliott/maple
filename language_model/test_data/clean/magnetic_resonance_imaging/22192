We describe a 27y old female systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient with salmonella bacteraemia who presented with fever, back pain and an enlarging heart size. A two dimensional echocardiogram (2D Echo) showed a mass in the right atrium. Subsequent computer tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies showed that this had become a ring shaped lesion at the posterior end of the interventricular septum with an area communicating with the right atrial cavity. At operation a ruptured mycotic aneurysm of the right coronary artery was found. This is the first report of an SLE patient with a coronary artery mycotic aneurysm due to salmonella and the first reported case of survival following rupture of such aneurysm.
