In a 45-year-old man, who was free of symptoms after a 3 1/2-month period of calf claudication, a diagnosis of cystic adventitial disease was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. At operation a 12 cm long intramural cyst of the popliteal artery, continuous with a cyst around a genicular arterial branch, was found. Total resection of the cyst and its branch was performed. We recommend computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging as the diagnostic tools of first choice in young patients who are free of arteriosclerosis and who have episodes of intermittent claudication of the calf.
