The hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology is the presence of inflammatory demyelinated lesions distributed throughout the CNS. Along with more diffuse tissue abnormalities, it is considered one of the major determinants of neurological deficit in MS. Conventional MRI has contributed to improve our understanding of MS pathology and has provided objective and reliable measures to monitor the effect of treatments. Advanced MRI techniques have offered the opportunity to quantify pathological changes in lesions, as well as in normal-appearing brain tissue and to characterize their dynamics. This review will discuss the characteristics and development of MS lesions and the contribution of conventional and quantitative MRI techniques to understanding pathological changes associated with them.
