Ultrasonography and CT-scanner remain the first choice nowadays concerning detection and preoperative work-up of pancreatic cancer. MRI offers interesting options for the detection of liver metastases, and high quality of ductal and vascular examination. Actually, while we await a larger diffusion of MR systems and radiological expertise this technique is preferentially indicated as a third-step procedure when ultrasonography and CT-scanner are normal despite a real suspicion. Otherwise, MRI permits with a single non-invasive examination a complete work-up useful to prepare palliative therapy in case of unresectable tumor.
