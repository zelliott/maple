The authors report their experience with the use of Magnetic Resonance (MR) in the follow-up of patients undergone aortofemoral bypass or substitution procedures for aneurysmal and/or steno-occlusive lesions of the aortoiliofemoral vascular bed. Twenty-eight patients, at least 2 years from aorto-bifemoral revascularization were evaluated by means of coronal and parasagittal MR planes (mean follow up 78.9 months). One exam over 28 was found to be not diagnostic; whereas the technique showed great usefulness in the morphological and haemodynamic evaluation of each of the graft sites explored (proximal anastomosis, graft body and limbs, femoral anastomosis and periprosthetic tissues) in the remaining 27 cases. The use of this method, in spite of some setting up problems peculiar to the type of examination, according to the authors is very promising because of the chance to obtain morphological and functional data at once and because of the interesting current and future developments of this diagnostic device.
