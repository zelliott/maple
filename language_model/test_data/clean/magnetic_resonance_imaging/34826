The sternoclavicular (SC) joint can be affected by a wide variety of pathologic conditions. Imaging is usually needed for diagnosis and staging. Although the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has become indispensable in the evaluation of most joints, MR has received little attention in SC joint evaluation. Recently, however, it has been shown that detailed MR images of the normal SC joint can be obtained. This pictorial essay explores the differential diagnosis of the abnormal SC joint and helps to determine the role of MR imaging in the SC joint imaging algorithm.
