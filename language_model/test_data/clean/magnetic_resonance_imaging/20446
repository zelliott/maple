To quantify the efficacy of vincristine and vinblastine in the treatment of complicated hemangiomas.

Retrospective review.

Charts were reviewed to identify patients treated with vincristine or vinblastine for complicated hemangiomas from August 2002 to October 2007. Only patients who received both a pre and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were considered. A database was created which includes patient gender, age at treatment initiation, rationale for treatment, hemangioma location, number of cycles of chemotherapy received, and complications of treatment. A single pediatric radiologist calculated lesion volumes from both pre and post-treatment MRI which were compared to quantify treatment response.

Seven patients (2 male, 5 female) met criteria. Mean age at treatment initiation was 20 weeks (median 14, range 5-60). Rationale for treatment included four patients (57%) with proptosis/orbital compromise and one patient each (14%) with heart failure, airway compression, and hemangiomatosis with rapid growth of multiple lesions. Patients received a mean of 2.86 cycles of chemotherapy (median 3, range 1-5). Twelve lesions were identified and analyzed for pre and post-treatment volume on MRI in the seven patients. Eleven of twelve (92%) lesions decreased in size after treatment. The mean volume ratio of hemangiomas at the conclusion of chemotherapy was 0.45 compared to pre-treatment size (median 0.18, range 0-2.19) Orbital compromise, airway compression, and cardiac failure either improved or resolved in all patients. Three complications of treatment were seen in seven patients (42%) including bacteremia with anemia, peripheral neuropathy and motor delay. All complications resolved after cessation of chemotherapy.

Treatment of complicated hemangiomas with vincristine or vinblastine can control growth and improve symptoms in the majority of patients. Treatment often requires multiple cycles of chemotherapy. Complications of treatment are common, but reversible.
