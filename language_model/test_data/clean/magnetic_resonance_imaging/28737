The availability of safe and partially effective disease modifying therapies necessitates changes in how neurologists monitor patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Neurologists need to make the diagnosis of MS as soon as possible to be able to initiate therapy early in the course of disease. In deciding whom to treat, neurologists should consider information on disease activity and burden acquired from the neurologic history and examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients not on a disease modifying therapy should undergo yearly clinical assessments and periodic cerebral MRI to monitor for changes in disease activity. Patients on disease modifying therapy should undergo regular clinical assessments to monitor for side-effects and disease activity. Cerebral MRI scanning may also be useful in assessing patients on therapy, particularly when considering changes in therapy.
