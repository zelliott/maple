The safety and efficacy of the oral iron-chelating agent deferiprone on magnetic resonance pallida iron concentration and on clinical status were investigated in 10 patients affected by pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration.

Nine patients (age range, 7-39 years) completed the study.

A significant median reduction in globus pallidus iron content as assessed by T2* relaxometry (and calculated R2* maps; P=.008) was observed at the end of the study. None of the patients demonstrated a change in clinical status as assessed by the Burke-Fahn and Marsden Dystonia Rating scales and by a health-related quality-of-life scale. Deferiprone was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events occurred.

Future trials assessing the clinical efficacy of chelating therapy should consider early symptomatic patients and a longer treatment period.
