In several experimental models, status epilepticus (SE) leads to secondary brain hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis. In humans, such phenomena have been rarely demonstrated, particularly in cases of SE involving the neocortical structures. We report a 36 year old woman that presented partial SE in May 1991 involving the right cerebral hemisphere. The patient was then treated in the intensive care unit with artificial ventilation and anesthesia by pentobarbital and clometiazole. MRI showed transient right parietal and temporal posterior cortical hyperintensity. The cause of SE was not determined. Three months later, the patient developed partial complex seizures with aura characterized by vertigo, nausea and auditory hallucination. Ictal video/EEG recording showed a clear right temporal posterior onset of the discharges. We speculate that status epilepticus created the lesions which subsequently caused the focal chronic epilepsy.
