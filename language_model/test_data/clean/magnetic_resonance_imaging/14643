Although many Müllerian duct anomalies do not require treatment, surgical intervention is sometimes necessary to enable sexual activity or to preserve fertility. The identification of these anomalies is important for optimal clinical management or surgical treatment. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a robust method for adequately evaluating and characterizing uterine and vaginal anomalies. The information provided by MR imaging allows for a more complete understanding of the malformation, facilitating management decisions and potentially changing the outcome. In this article, the embryology, classification, and MR imaging findings of Müllerian duct and related anomalies in children and adolescents are reviewed.
