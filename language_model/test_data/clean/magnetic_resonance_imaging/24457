We present the first case of concomitant intramedullary traumatic neuroma and spinal cord herniation. A 57-year-old woman injured her cervical spine with subluxation and cord compression at the C5-C6 level. After the operation, the patient received intensive rehabilitation for one year with well response. Unfortunately, she experienced weakness and progressive numbness extending to all the limbs later. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed spinal cord herniation at the C5-C6 level and pathology proved intramedullary traumatic neuroma. After the second operation, the paresthesia over the trunk and limbs persisted, and the patient was nearly totally assisted in her activities of daily living. The intramedullary traumatic neuroma and spinal cord herniation are rare causes in patients with spinal cord dysfunction. The case presented here indicates the possibility of the coexisting conditions leading to progressive neurologic deficits in patients with old spinal cord injury.
