We review the role of MRI in retinoblastoma and simulating lesions. Retinoblastoma is the most common paediatric intra-ocular tumour. It may be endophytic, exophytic or a diffuse infiltrating tumour. MRI can detect intra-ocular, extra-ocular and intracranial extension of the tumour. MRI is essential for monitoring patients after treatment and detection of associated second malignancies. It helps to differentiating the tumour from simulating lesions with leukocoria.
