Four noninvasive imaging modalities were used to quantitatively evaluate and compare tibial osteotomy healing in dogs. Quantitative computed tomography (QCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon absorptiometry (SPA), and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) were the four techniques examined. Bilateral tibial osteotomies were performed in 32 dogs divided into four groups. The osteotomies were stabilized with a 2-mm gap using unilateral external skeletal fixation. Dogs were anesthetized, imaged with the four noninvasive techniques, and killed at 2-12 weeks. Invasive techniques were used to determine: 1) the torsional properties of the bone; and 2) the local stiffness properties and calcium content within the bone. The techniques which had the strongest associations with the torsional properties of the osteotomies were QCT, SPA and DEXA. Generally, QCT and SPA had marginally stronger correlations than DEXA; but, overall, there were no differences between the techniques. MRI had the poorest associations with the torsional properties of the osteotomies. Generally, QCT had the strongest correlations with local material properties, such as indentation stiffness and calcium content. SPA had the second strongest correlations with calcium content and had the third strongest correlations with indentation stiffness behind DEXA. DEXA had the third strongest correlations for calcium content. With the exception of some of the correlations with indentation stiffness, MRI had the poorest associations with the local parameters studied.
