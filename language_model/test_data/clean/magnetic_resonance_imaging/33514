We report a case of a woman with L-Dopa resistant asymmetrical parkinsonism with a posterior fossa cyst compressing the lower brainstem on MR. She did not show improvement in any of her symptoms after cysto-cardiac derivation. It was not possible to delineate if this was a case of a new malformative syndrome or the coincidence of two different disorders.
