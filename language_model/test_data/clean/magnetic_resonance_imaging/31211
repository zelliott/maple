Endometrial carcinoma associated with pregnancy is rare. We present the case of a 39-year-old woman with endometrial carcinoma in the septate uterus detected 6 months after normal delivery.

The patient complained of vaginal bleeding from 32 weeks' gestation, and had a spontaneous vaginal delivery at 37 weeks. The bleeding continued after the delivery, but repeated endometrial cytology and biopsy did not reveal evidence of malignancy. An exploratory laparotomy was performed 6 months postpartum with suspicion of uterine myoma. A histological diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma was made based on examination of frozen sections from the hysterectomy specimen, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic/para-aortic lymphadenectomy were also performed. Histological examination revealed G3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation, which arose in the septum of the uterus and deeply invaded the myometrium. The patient received postoperative chemotherapy and is healthy with no evidence of disease 3 years after the treatment.

Although pregnancy-associated endometrial carcinoma is rare, careful examinations are needed when unexplained vaginal bleeding continued.
