Pregnant adolescent patients afflicted with Takayasu arteritis represent a clinical entity not seen by many. The care of such patients is often managed by multidisciplinary teams, where vascular surgeons are asked to provide input on cardiovascular implications during and after a pregnant state. Knowledge and understanding of the interaction between the two conditions allows for well-informed decision making and favorable outcomes with pregnancy, as well as proper long-term follow-up and care with appropriate clinicians.
