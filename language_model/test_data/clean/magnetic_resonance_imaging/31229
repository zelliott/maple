A group of 14 healthy female subjects was studied using MRI during 2 months of life-style intervention. A series of 21 water-suppressed images was used to determine the intra-abdominal fat volume before and after the controlled loss of weight. The average weight decrease was 8.2 %, but the average relative loss of visceral fat was 20.3 %, whereas subcutaneous fat decreased by 13.4 %. A small but significant increase of insulin sensitivity (decrease in fasting insulin and blood glucose) was observed, but no changes in lipoprotein parameters were demonstrated. There was a significant negative correlation (r=-0.633, p=0.028) between the relative abdominal fat decrease and the initial amount of subcutaneous fat.
