To evaluate the contribution of MRI exploration for the evaluation of orbital prothesis biocolonization.

We studied ten eyes of ten children who underwent enucleation for retinoblastoma and synthetic hydroxyapatite orbital implantation. Each patient was examined by MRI imaging with gadolinium within 2 months to 1 year.

After gadolinium administration, five implants showed an enhancement. Nodular enhancement around the implant was noted in one patient with a recurrence of retinoblastoma, and brain metastases were shown in two cases. None of the orbital implants was rejected.

Fibrovascular colonization reduces the risk of orbital implant migration. Magnetic resonance imaging is safe and effective in detecting extrusion or tolerance of the orbital implant.
