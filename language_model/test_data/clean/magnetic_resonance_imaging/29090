Rapid T(2) weighted (T(2)W) images would facilitate physicians being able to distinguish normal tissues, vessels, tumors, and thermal lesions from therapeutic devices throughout interventional MRI procedures commonly performed in open low-field scanners (e.g., 0.2 T). Conventional diagnostic MRI techniques have not been successful at low-field strength for fast T(2)W imaging during the guidance phase of interventional MRI (I-MRI) procedures. FISP and true-FISP methods yield T(1)/T(2)-weighted images and do not always provide sufficient contrast for device guidance or lesion assessment. As such, a variant of PSIF (a gradient reversed form of FISP) which collects the T(2)-weighted spin echo of the SSFP signal was developed and implemented at 0.2 T for use in I-MRI procedures. The sequence has a balanced readout gradient to reduce motion sensitivity. Asymmetric sampling toward the end of the TR cycle reduces T(2)* decay of the spin echo component in the SSFP signal. The sequence gives one image in 5-7 s in vivo with adequate SNR and T(2) contrast for interventional applications. Patient studies showed that the PSIF sequence variant demarcates many tumors not detectable by either FISP or true-FISP. Results from animal experiments suggested that it has potential to monitor thermal lesions during interstitial thermal ablation procedures. Magn Reson Med 42:335-344, 1999.
