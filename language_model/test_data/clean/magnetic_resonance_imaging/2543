Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency is a recently described inborn error of creatine biosynthesis that responds to treatment with oral creatine supplementation. The previously reported clinical features consist of developmental arrest and an extrapyramidal movement disorder. We describe a patient who presented with epilepsy, global developmental delay, and a persistently low plasma creatinine level. The diagnosis was established by measuring urinary guanidinoacetate and by demonstrating absence of the creatine/phosphocreatine peak in the patient's basal ganglia in 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The clinical and biochemical abnormalities responded to creatine replacement.
