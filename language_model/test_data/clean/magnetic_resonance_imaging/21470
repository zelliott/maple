During 1988 to 1992 18 patients with spondylodiscitis and neurological deficits were treated in our clinic. Tuberculous spondylodiscitis was diagnosed in 4 patients and 14 suffered from non specific spondylodiscitis. The mean age was 59 years (range 25-77). 16 (89%) of the patients had risk factors like diabetes mellitus, genitourinary tract infection, respiratory tract infection, rheumatism, intervertebral disc operation and old spine fracture. MR-tomography revealed the most valuable diagnostic method. 14 patients with progressive spinal cord compression, and root lesions because of gross vertebral damage and epidural abscess underwent operative removal of the focus with intercorporal spondylodesis. Postoperative neurological examination revealed improvement in 7 and no changes in the other 7 patients. In 4 patients with non specific spondylodicitis and radicular deficits conservative treatment was performed and spontaneous interbody fusion without persisting neurological complaints occurred.
