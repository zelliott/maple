Peritumoral vasogenic brain edema (PVBE) is a common accompaniment of malignant gliomas. It results from microvascular extravasation of plasma fluid and proteins through the interendothelial spaces. Tumor-associated cysts (TACs) are observed more commonly with benign gliomas that are not associated with PVBE. This study investigates the hypothesis that these morphologically distinct epiphenomena of microvascular extravasation are linked by a common pathophysiological mechanism involving vascular endothelial growth/permeability factor (VEG/PF), which has been implicated in vascular leak phenomena including ascites, malignant effusions, and brain edema. Furthermore, VEG/PF has been isolated from cultured glioma cells, and both VEG/PF protein and messenger RNA transcripts are expressed in brain tumor tissue. To further elucidate the relationship of VEG/PF to PVBE and TACs, the authors examined 34 pathological specimens for VEG/PF expression. Nineteen primary low-grade tumors, 11 primary high-grade tumors, and four gliosis controls were immunostained with a polyclonal anti-VEG/PF immunoglobulin G antibody. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantitate PVBE and to determine the presence of TACs and tumor enhancement. The study revealed that eight VEG/PF-negative specimens exhibited no significant edema, whereas 26 VEG/PF-positive tumors exhibited either significant PVBE or TACs. Notably, eight of nine benign TACs that were not associated with PVBE immunostained positive for VEG/PF. These data indicate a high degree of correlation between VEG/PF expression by gliomas and the occurrence of PVBE or TACs, irrespective of tumor grade, thus supporting VEG/PF's pivotal role as the common pathophysiological link between these processes.
