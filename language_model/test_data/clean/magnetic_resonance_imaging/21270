The aim of this study is to emphasize on the diagnostic effectiveness of fetal MRI that led to increased utilization in fetal medicine as well as its value in prognosis and decision making in the modern obstetric practice.

One hundred five (n = 105) pregnant women were referred for a fetal MRI examination after a high detailed ultrasound examination revealed a fetal abnormality. Fetal MRI was performed using 1, 5 Tesla units, with T1, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images. The findings were analyzed in comparison to the previous ultrasound findings, according to the fetal organ affected and the value of the MRI for therapeutic decision making was addressed. A statistical analysis was performed.

The fetal MRI provides a more accurate diagnosis compared to ultrasound examination, and when the ultrasound detects fetal anomalies, the MRI can efficiently either confirm or reject the finding, proving its high value for prenatal diagnosis and perinatal and management. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of fetal MRI as a screening tool approaches 100%.

Despite the fact that ultrasound is the method of choice for fetal screening, MRI can add up significantly to the diagnosis and management of congenital abnormalities and the indications for MRI continue to increase as new sequences and shorter acquisition times evolve.
