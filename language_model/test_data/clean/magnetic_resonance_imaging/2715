We have defined areas in the brain activated during speaking, utilizing positron emission tomography. Six normal subjects continuously repeated the phrase "Buy Bobby a poppy" (requiring minimal language processing) in four ways: A) spoken aloud, B) mouthed silently, C) without articulation, and D) thought silently. Statistical comparison of images from conditions A with C and B with D highlighted areas associated with articulation alone, because control of breathing for speech was controlled for; we found bilateral activations in sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum with right-sided activation in the thalamus/caudate nucleus. Contrasting images from conditions A with B and C with D highlighted areas associated with the control of breathing for speech, vocalization, and hearing, because articulation was controlled for; we found bilateral activations in sensorimotor and motor cortex, close to but distinct from the activations in the preceding contrast, together with activations in thalamus, cerebellum, and supplementary motor area. In neither subtraction was there activation in Broca's area. These results emphasize the bilaterality of the cerebral control of "speaking" without language processing.
