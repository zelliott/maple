Severe focal epilepsy is regarded as a clinical hallmark of Rasmussen encephalitis (RE). The authors report two children with progressive hemiparesis, contralateral hemispheric atrophy, and pathologic features characteristic for RE. At histologic diagnosis and over several months, neither patient experienced seizures. The report enlarges the clinical spectrum of RE and suggests that seizures are not an obligatory presenting symptom of the disorder.
