A 3-month-old male Japanese cat with feline parvovirus infection, showing central and cervical nerve abnormalities, was diagnosed as hydrocephalus and syringomyelia by use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The cat was maintained clinically by medical treatment even though he could not stand. The MRI scans obtained about 5 months later showed that the ventricles had increased in size and the cervical syrinx had extended into the thoracic spinal cord. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt was performed. One week after surgery, neurological conditions had improved. At the postoperative MR images, the ventricles had decreased in size and the syrinx in the cervical and thoracic spinal cord could no longer be seen. The cat was still alive and was able to walk well.
