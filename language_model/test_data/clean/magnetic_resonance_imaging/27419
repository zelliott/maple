Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a late-onset autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia caused by triplet CAG/CTG expansion in the ATX2 gene. The initial symptoms usually appear when subjects are in their 30s.Pediatric onset is less common and usually associated with larger triplet expansions. We here report the case of a 1-year-old girl who presented with facial dysmorphism,dystonic features, developmental delay, and retinitis pigmentosa.She was diagnosed as carrying an expanded CAG/CTG tract (92 repeats) before a molecular diagnosis of SCA2 was made in her father. Facial dysmorphism associated with developmental delay and retinitis pigmentosa in early childhood should prompt a careful family investigation for ataxia and study of ATX2.
