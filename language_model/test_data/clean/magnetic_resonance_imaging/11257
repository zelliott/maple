We report the case of a patient with eosinophilic fasciitis, a rare disease related to systemic sclerodermia and other fibrosing disorders. An involvement of the kidneys--like in this patient with proteinuria and hypoproteinemia--has been described in the literature but is very rare. We discuss diagnostic procedures and novel therapeutic options as combination therapies with steroids, methotrexate and ciclosporine A.
