Six cases with spinal arteriovenous malformation refractory to repetitive embolization therapy were reported. In these, de novo feeding arteries appeared after the emboli obliterated the proximal portion of the blood feeding system. Though the malformation disappeared after the embolization therapy in the angiograms of the original feeding arteries, the lesion was visualized in the follow-up angiogram from different segmental arteries via various collaterals. Through angiographic evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging were necessary to point out the "false angiographic disappearance" of the spinal arteriovenous malformation after the embolization therapy.
