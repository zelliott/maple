After advent newly developed imaging modalities, diagnosis for aortic dissection had been extremely easier as compared with at the time when we had diagnosed this lesion solely by angiography. Characteristics of intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for this lesion was reviewed. In particular, we described how much three dimensional reconstructed CT using ultrafast computed tomography (electron beam tomography: EBT) and helical computed tomography (HCT) contribute to diagnosis for this disease. Furthermore, it was commented upon how to diagnose for acute aortic dissection with modern diagnostic tools based on our praxis.
