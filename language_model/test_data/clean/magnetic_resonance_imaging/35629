Different therapeutic strategies have been tried when liver metastasis develops after a gastrectomy for gastric cancer, but the disease still has a poor prognosis. We present a 35-year-old woman who achieved complete radiological remission of liver metastases from advanced gastric cancer after a single therapeutic high intensity focused ultrasound session. Our observations suggest that high intensity focused ultrasound combined with chemotherapy may be an additional treatment option for patients with liver metastases from advanced gastric cancer.
