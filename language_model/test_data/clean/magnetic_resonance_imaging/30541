More recently, 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner become more clinically available, and clinical application of 3-T MR imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis is now feasible and being performed at many institutions. However, few prostrate 3-T MRI studies have been published. The increase in signal-to-noise ratio at 3 versus 1.5 T clearly improves spatiotemporal and spectral resolutions of the prostate. Thus, we asked whether 3-T MRI improves the localization and staging of prostate cancer versus 1.5-T MRI. To answer this question, this article reviews the current limitations of prostate 1.5-T MRI and addresses its pros and cons. Moreover, we present preliminary results of prostate 3-T MRI and introduce our experience for prostate 3-T MRI using a phased-array coil, with an emphasis on imaging sequences, for example, T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced, diffusion-weighted, and MR spectroscopic imaging.
