Superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis (SOVT) is a rare condition of multiple etiologies that generally presents with proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, periorbital edema, and occasionally decreased visual acuity. We describe a unique case of a two-year-old child presenting with extensive superior forniceal chemosis obstructing the visual axis after trauma in a motor vehicle accident. Angiography revealed complete thrombosis of the superior ophthalmic vein. Management and outcome are also discussed.
