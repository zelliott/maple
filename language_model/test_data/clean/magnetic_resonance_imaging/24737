To explore equation, if any, between findings of magnetic resonance imaging of pituitary gland and serum prolactin level.

The retrospective, descriptive study was conducted at the Department of Radiology, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, and related to patients' records from April 19, 2006 to April 23, 2009. Seventy patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging of brain for pituitary gland. Inclusion criteria were all patients referred with relevant clinical symptoms or deranged serum prolactin level. Patients who were claustrophobic or had a pacemaker, aneurysm clip, metallic foreign body in the orbit or with no laboratory investigation were excluded from the study. SPSS 19 was used for statistical analysis.

Of the 70 patients, normal imaging was noted in 29 (41.4%) patients. Out of these, 18 (62.06%) patients had normal and 11 (37.93%) had raised serum prolactin levels. Microadenoma was found in 23 (32.8%) patients. Out of these, 10 (42.47%) had normal and 13 (56.52%) had raised prolactin levels. Macroadenoma was found in 16 (22.8 %). Out of these, 8 (50%) had normal and 8 (50%) had raised prolactin levels. Pituitary cyst was located in 2 (2.8 %) patients. Out of these, 1 (50%) had normal and 1 (50%) had raised serum prolactin levels.

Magnetic resonance imaging of pituitary gland was not associated with serum prolactin levels in patients with clinical suspicion of pituitary abnormality. Therefore, regular monitoring of serum prolactin is suggested.
