A 82-year male consulted us for elevation of prostate specific antigen, diagnosed as prostatic adenocarcinoma (moderated differentiated). We decided to observe him under androgen deprivation therapy. During the 8 months of treatment, left hemi-paresis started to appear. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed the multiple brain metastases, suspected to have originated from the prostate cancer. Total 30 Gy radiotherapy could not establish the improvement of activity of daily living. We discuss the cases of brain metastasis associated with prostate cancer.
