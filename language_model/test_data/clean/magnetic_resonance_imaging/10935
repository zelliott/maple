Cystic echinococcosis is endemic in certain parts of the world. The growth of the cyst is often slow, and the liver and lungs are the most frequently involved organs. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms and epidemiological data, while ultrasonography is important for the classification of hydatid cysts. Although certain types of hydatid cysts are successfully treated by percutaneous aspiration, injection, and reaspiration, surgery remains the treatment of choice. We reviewed the current trends in the diagnosis and management of cystic echinococcosis, with special emphasis on hepatic and pulmonary involvement.
