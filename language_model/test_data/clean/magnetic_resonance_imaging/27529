To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) and mannitol in the treatment of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in eclamptic women.

This retrospective analysis includes 62 eclamptic women between 22 and 40 weeks of gestation who were diagnosed with PRES in a tertiary care center. To treat neurological symptoms, 34 women received magnesium sulfate (Group 1) and the remaining 28 received 20% mannitol (Group 2) at the discretion of treating physician.

Ten patients from both Group 1 (29%) and Group 2 (35.7%) were normotensive at admission. 59 of 62 patients presented with seizure. All patients underwent fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Parietooccipital region and cerebellum were the most commonly affected areas. The duration of treatment was significantly shorter in Group 1 than Group 2 (p < 0.001). Neurological examinations and the recovery after treatment were significantly better in favor of MgSO(4) group (p = 0.039).

Mannitol is not superior to magnesium sulfate in achieving neurological recovery. Magnesium sulfate seems to be the agent of choice for treatment of PRES.
