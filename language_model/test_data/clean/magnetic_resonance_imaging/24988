The feasibility and safety of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery for uterine leiomyomas is reported. Sequential sonications were delivered to nine targets. Temperature-sensitive phase-difference MR imaging monitored the location of the focus and measured tissue temperature elevations, ensuring therapeutic dose. MR images and hysterectomy specimens were evaluated. Six leiomyomas received full therapeutic doses, and 98.5% of the sonications were visualized. MR thermometry was successful in all sonications and cases. Focal necrotic lesions were seen in all cases at MR, and five were pathologically confirmed. MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound causes thermocoagulation and necrosis in uterine leiomyomas and is feasible and safe, without serious consequences.
