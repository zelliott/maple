We used volumetric MRI and analysis of areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to directly compare the extent of hippocampus-amygdala formation (HAF) and corpus callosum atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in different clinical stages of dementia. Based on neuropathological studies, we hypothesized that HAF atrophy, representing allocortical neuronal degeneration, would precede atrophy of corpus callosum, representing loss of neocortical association neurons, in early AD. HAF and corpus callosum sizes were significantly reduced in 27 AD patients (37% and 16%, respectively) compared to 28 healthy controls. In mildly- and moderately-demented AD patients, the ROC derived index of atrophy was greater for HAF volume than for total corpus callosum area. The index of atrophy of posterior corpus callosum was not significantly different from HAF at mild, moderate or severe stages of dementia. In conclusion, these findings suggest a characteristic regional pattern of allocortical and neocortical neurodegeneraton in AD. Our data indicate that neuronal loss in parietotemporal cortex (represented by atrophy of corpus callosum splenium) may occur simultaneously with allocortical neurodegeneration in mild AD. Moreover, ROC analysis may provide a statistical framework to determine atrophy patterns of different brain structures in neurodegenerative diseases in vivo.
