The blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulates the passage of molecules between the bloodstream and the brain. Overcoming the difficulty of delivery drugs to specific areas of the brain is a major challenge. The BBB exerts a neuroprotective function as it hinders the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the brain. Here, we provide an overview of the way in which peptides and nanotechnology are being exploited in tandem to address this problem. Peptides can be used as specialised coatings able to transport nanoparticles with specific properties, such as targeting. The nanoparticle can also carry a peptide drug. Furthermore, peptides can be used in less conventional approaches such as all-peptide nanoparticles. In summary, the combined use of peptides and nanotechnology offers tremendous hope in the treatment of brain disorders.
