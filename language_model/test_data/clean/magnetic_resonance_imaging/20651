Epithelioid angiosarcoma is a rare variation of an angiosarcoma and its localization in the bone is exceptionally infrequent. This report presents the case of a 48-year-old male with an epithelioid angiosarcoma of the scapula. In CT and MRI scans an inhomogeneous tumour with osseous destructions, lytic areas, central necrosis and marginal hyperperfusion was observed. The bordering skeletal muscles were already infiltrated. The tumour was treated initially with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by dose escalation, peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and resection of the lesion. Despite advanced local tumour stage at initial presentation, the patient is in complete remission.
