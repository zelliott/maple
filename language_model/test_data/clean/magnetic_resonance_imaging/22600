Paraneoplastic neurological disorders are a well recognized complication of malignancy.

A case report to expand the currently described clinical manifestations of type 1 antineuronal antibody (ANNA-1)-associated paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis to include coma.

We present an unusual case of fluctuating coma and rapid fulminant progression to acute respiratory failure from central alveolar hypoventilation caused by ANNA-1 paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis associated with small-cell lung carcinoma. Paraneoplastic infiltration of the brainstem and cerebellum, including respiratory and arousal centers, was documented on autopsy.

Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis should be considered as a possible cause of coma and central alveolar hypoventilation.
