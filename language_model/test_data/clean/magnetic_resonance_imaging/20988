Neurological complications of schistosomiasis remain exceptional even in hyperendemic area.

We report a 26-year-old Senegalese man, without past medical history, who was admitted for spastic paraplegia, acute retention of urine, and pain in low back and lower limbs. The final diagnosis was spinal cord schistosomiasis. Diagnosis was based on the endemic context, MRI medullar conus imaging, schistosoma serology in cerebrospinal fluid and blood, and the absence of other cause of myelopathy. Treatment was based on praziquantel, corticosteroids and physiotherapy. The outcome was favorable after a 2-year follow-up.

Schistosomiasis should be included in the differential diagnosis of myelopathy in patients living actually, or even traveled in the past, in endemic tropical areas.
