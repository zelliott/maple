Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the glial tumor with the highest grade of malignity. It mainly affects the cerebral hemispheres, presenting general or focal signs and symptoms, which depend on the size, the location of the lesion and rate of growth of the tumor.

To analyze the relationship between motor impairment and GBM topography.

We studied 43 cases of GBM, related to the age, gender, localization and motor impairment.

The occurrence of the tumor was preponderant in adults (mean age 55 years old), men (55.82%), and frontal lobe (approximately 40%). The principal motor impairment was hemiparesis, with the exception of 2 cases in the frontal lobe, 2 temporal, 1 parietal, 1 occipital and 1 frontotemporal.

The clinical-topographic findings lead to consider the infiltrative effects (broad lesions) are responsible for the motor impairment rather than compressive effects (located lesions).
