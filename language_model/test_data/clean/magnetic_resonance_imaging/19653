We describe the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in eight neonates with tuberous sclerosis complex to further delineate the spectrum of characteristic findings in these patients. In addition to the previously described characteristic brain MRI findings in neonates, which included cortical tuber, transmantle dysplasia, subependymal nodules, cerebral subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, white-matter anomalies, and hemimegalencephaly, we found one neonate with cerebellar subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and one patient who had a normal MRI and computed tomographic scan of the brain at 4 days of age but subsequently was found to have cortical tubers and subependymal nodules by MRI.
