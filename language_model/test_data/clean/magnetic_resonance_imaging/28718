Japanese encephalitis (JE) is associated with varying degrees of coma and brainstem involvement is frequent which can be evaluated and monitored by brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP). The present study has been undertaken to evaluate the BAEP changes and their role in predicting the outcome. Twelve adult patients with JE were subjected to CT scan, MRI and BAEP studies after detailed neurological evaluation. The severity of coma was assessed by Glasgow coma scale and outcome was defined at the end of 3 months into good and poor recovery on the basis of Barthel Index score (BI). The mean age of the patients was 28.3 years (range 14-50), and four of them were females. Most of the patients were comatose. The mean Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score was 7 (range 4-11). There were no brainstem signs or cranial nerve palsy. Cranial CT scan revealed thalamic hypodensity in four, whitematter oedema in three and left putaminal hypodensity in one patient. Cranial MRI was carried out in eight patients which revealed bilateral thalamic lesions in all, basal ganglia and midbrain lesions in three each and pontine and cerebellar lesions in one patient each. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials were recordable bilaterally. The absolute latency of wave I, II, III, IV and V and interpeak latencies (IPL) of I-V, III-V, and I-III were normal. The V/I amplitude ratio were significantly reduced in five patients. The BAEP abnormalities correlated with brainstem lesions on CT or MRI but not with severity of coma or outcome. The reduced amplitude ratio of wave V/I may be due to raised intracranial tension or brainstem involvement in JE.
