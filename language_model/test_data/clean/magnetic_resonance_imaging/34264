To assess the importance of intercenter variations when measuring magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) in the brain, six European centers measured MTR in normal white matter. MTR ranged from 9 to 51 percent units (25 sequences). The effective flip angle of the saturating pulse divided by the pulse repetition time (ENRsat degrees/msec) was a good predictor of MTR (MTR = 3.25 ENRsat).
