Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in Sarcoidosis poses a difficult diagnostic problem for the clinician. Neurologic involvement may occur long before the onset of symptoms. Contrast enhanced computerized tomography does not always reveal parenchymal and meningeal involvement. Recently gadolinium enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging has shown increased sensitivity in detecting CNS involvement. These findings however are not specific for sarcoidosis and one must consider appropriate clinical circumstances in arriving at the diagnosis.
