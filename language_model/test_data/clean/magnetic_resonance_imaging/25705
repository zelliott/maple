A wide spectrum of diseases involve the clivus and paraclival structures. Primary neoplasms, metastatic tumors, and inflammatory, vascular, and hematopoietic disorders are the most common abnormalities to arise from or directly involve the clivus. MR imaging exquisitely shows and helps characterize the diseases that affect this area. Sagittal and coronal MR imaging allows precise localization and evaluation of the signal characteristics of a mass, enabling a more specific diagnosis. The multiplanar capabilities of MR imaging provide superb visualization of the adjacent cranial nerves and vascular structures, aiding in surgical planning and radiation therapy. In this pictorial essay, the MR imaging, CT, and conventional radiographic findings of various clival and paraclival lesions are illustrated.
