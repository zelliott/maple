Cardiovascular magnetic resonance is a valid and accurate tool for the assessment of structural and functional disorders of the heart. Through combination of morphologic and functional studies, it is possible to form a quick diagnosis with a noninvasive examination. In this case, MR-imaging shows a pericardial effusion and a 5 x 5 cm large, well-circumscribed hematoma with displacement of the right coronary artery, which was also visible with other examination techniques as an unclear intracardial mass. At operation a large aneurysm of the right coronary artery was exposed, in addition to a hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
