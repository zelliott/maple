The primary intracranial development of olfactory neuroblastomas, outside olfactory epithelium, is rare. We report a case of primary sellar neuroblastoma without any aggressive histopathological features, managed solely surgically without adjuvant therapy, with good outcomes at 3 years. Primary sellar neuroblastomas mostly occur in women in the 4th decade with a context of a non-secreting pituitary tumour. Diagnosis is made on histopathological examination (small cells, fibrillary intercellular background, strong immunoreactivity for neurons markers, negative immunoreactivity for anterior pituitary hormones). Management is based on surgery. Adjuvant treatment is not consensual, largely depends on patient's conditions and aggressive histopathological features.
