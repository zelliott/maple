Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and may compromise ileoanal pouch function after restorative proctocolectomy, particularly if the pouch mesentery is involved. This usually necessitates pouch excision. The aim of this report was to describe the first known case of pouch salvage after surgery for a desmoid tumor arising from the pouch mesentery.

The management of a desmoid tumor involving an ileoanal pouch in a 21-year-old female is described and the literature reviewed.

The tumor was successfully excised completely after failed medical therapy, and pouch function was fully preserved.

This is a unique case highlighting the possibility of pouch salvage when affected by desmoid tumor.
