We report the clinical features of a middle-aged man who presented with multiple cranial nerve dysfunction and who, on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, proved to have a lesion of the clivus extending down to the body of the axis. Biopsy and limited excision showed this to be a tuberculous granuloma which grew M. tuberculosis on culture.
