To evaluate cerebral abnormalities in childhood idiopathic anatomic megalencephaly (MC) by means of different magnetic resonance (MR) modalities.

MRI, volumetry, spectroscopy, and cerebropetal blood flowmetry were performed in six children with idiopathic anatomic MC, and seven volunteers.

MRI revealed an increased ventricular system in five of six patients. A thalamic hamartoma was found in one patient and a Chiari I malformation was found in two. Volumetric analysis showed a disproportional increase of ventricular volume but normal subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume. Supratentorial volume was disproportionally increased compared to cerebellar volume. Intracranial volume correlated significantly with skull circumference. MR spectroscopy (MRS) N-acetyl aspartate/choline (NAA/Cho) peak ratios in WM were significantly higher in patients than in controls. Choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) peak ratios in WM were significantly lower in patients. Cortical gray matter (GM) MRS ratios were unaltered. Cerebropetal flow was increased in MC, possibly related to increased brain volume.

This study reveals associated developmental anomalies for idiopathic anatomic MC. A relative ventriculomegaly was found, which should not be misinterpreted as true hydrocephalus. In contrast to metabolic MC, MRS showed no severe disturbances. Total intracranial volume is correlated to skull circumference and cerebropetal blood flow.
