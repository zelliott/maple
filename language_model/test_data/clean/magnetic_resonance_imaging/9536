Over the last 10 years, the development of newer pulse sequences and applications in new clinical areas has enabled cardiovascular magnetic resonance to emerge as a powerful tool for the physicians to both diagnose and guide treatments of various cardiac pathologies. The greatest strengths of cardiovascular magnetic resonance include the assessment of ischemia and viability, evaluation of nonischemic cardiomyopathies, including myocarditis, pericardial disease, congenital heart disease, and tissue characterization of cardiac masses.
