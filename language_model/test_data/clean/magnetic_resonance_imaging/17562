Thanks to the development of image diagnosis and the spread of screening by ultrasonography, an increasing number of cystic lesions of the pancreas are being recognized. Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas is relatively rare among the cystic tumors of the pancreas in Japan. Herein, we report a case of serous cystadenoma that was difficult to diagnose. The tumor was located in the head of the pancreas, and it was indicated hypovascularity by enhanced computed tomography. These images did not indicate serous cystadenoma. After operation, we diagnosed correctly from the immunohistochemical examination. Although serous cystadenoma was believed to be in benign tumors, it has recently been revealed that serous cystadenoma has malignant potential. Therefore, serous cystadenoma that is difficult to diagnose should be completely resected.
