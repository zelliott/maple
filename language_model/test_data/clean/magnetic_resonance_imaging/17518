We present an unusual case of extracranial metastasis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) to the parotid gland and cervical lymph nodes. The patient had previously undergone two craniotomies to debulk a left frontal GBM, followed by radiotherapy. After the second craniotomy, while waiting for chemotherapy, the patient was re-admitted with a short history of a painful swelling of his left parotid gland. The initial diagnosis was infective parotitis; however, as there was no improvement with broad-spectrum antibiotics, CT was undertaken, which revealed a mass in the parotid gland with a necrotic centre and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Parotid gland biopsy revealed a parotid GBM metastasis. This case illustrates how GBM behaves in an aggressive manner even outside the CNS. A brief review of the literature and of the theories, which might explain the extra-neural metastasis of this tumour is also presented.
