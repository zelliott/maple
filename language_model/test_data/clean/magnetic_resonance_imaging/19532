We report a case of congenital hemangiopericytoma arising in the lower right leg of a 4-day-old male neonate. Despite the generally good prognosis associated with this neoplasm, a complete surgical excision has so far been recommended to avoid recurrences, because no definite criteria for determining whether or not the tumor will regress spontaneously have been established to date.
