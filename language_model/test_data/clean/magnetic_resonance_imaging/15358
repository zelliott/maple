Spinal cord/root compression is a rare complication of HL and usually seen in the setting of progressive, advanced disease. It is extremely rare to occur as an initial presentation of HL. We report a case of HL presented with bilateral cervical radiculopathy.

A case report of a 42-year-old woman who presented with C8 cervical radiculopathy and paraspinal mass with extradural extension in C7-T1. Biopsy revealed HL. This case report represents a case of HL presenting with epidural disease, with nerve root compression as the only apparent site of clinical involvement. A review of the literature of patients with HL presenting with spinal cord/root compression is presented.

Our patient received chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy. She achieved good recovery of her symptoms and complete response by radiologic criteria. Based on a review of the literature, Hodgkin's disease involving the spinal epidural space is very responsive to chemoradiotherapy with good prognosis for both functional recovery and complete response.

Chemoradiotherapy is a successful treatment for Hodgkin's disease presenting with spinal root compression. Surgery should be reserved for urgent decompression, if needed; palliation; and maintenance of function and stability.
