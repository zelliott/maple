To prospectively evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the knee performed by using a three-dimensional (3D) isovoxel sequence involving an acquisition time of approximately 3 minutes, with surgery as the reference standard.

The study was institutional review board approved. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Thirty knees of 29 patients (14 women, 15 men; mean age, 41 years) were prospectively examined by using a 3D isovoxel true fast imaging with steady-state precession (FISP) sequence with water excitation and secondary multiplanar reformations. All patients underwent arthroscopy within 12 days after true FISP MR imaging. Two blinded readers evaluated the MR images. Accuracy for detection of cartilage defects and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscal tears, interobserver agreement, and intermethod agreement were calculated.

Overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of isovoxel true FISP imaging for the diagnosis of cartilage defects were 45%, 83%, and 76%, respectively, for reader 1 and 63%, 82%, and 83%, respectively, for reader 2. Averaged (for readers 1 and 2) sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of isovoxel true FISP imaging were, respectively, 80%, 95%, and 90% for diagnosis of ACL tear; 100%, 82%, and 90% for diagnosis of medial meniscal tear; and 83%, 83%, and 83% for diagnosis of lateral meniscal tear. The standard MR sequences used at the authors' institution had overall sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies of 39%, 83%, and 71%, respectively, for reader 1 and 37%, 85%, and 76%, respectively, for reader 2. Averaged sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the standard MR sequences were, respectively, 70%, 100%, and 90% for diagnosis of ACL tear; 96%, 77%, and 85% for diagnosis of medial meniscal tear; and 83%, 77%, and 78% for diagnosis of lateral meniscal tear.

The diagnostic performance of knee MR imaging performed by using a 3D water excitation isovoxel true FISP sequence and an imaging time of approximately 3 minutes is comparable to the diagnostic performance of the MR sequences used as standards at the authors' institution.
