A radiofrequency (rf) coil design based on a slotted tube resonator which allows high-resolution imaging of the rodent brain with excellent anatomic definition on a standard G.E. CSI II 2.0-T MR imaging unit with no modification of existing apparatus is described. The coil is easily constructed and permits very rapid tuning to different loading conditions, allowing a high sample throughput.
