Two patients with multifocal pilocytic astrocytoma diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and confirmed by histopathological examination are reported. They presented distinct sites and mechanisms of metastasis: to distant ventricles through the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in patient 1 and to contralateral parenchyma, possibly through white matter tracts, in patient 2, a pathway not so far reported in pilocytic astrocytoma. Early detection of multifocal pilocytic astrocytoma by MRI may change treatment strategies and improve prognosis.
