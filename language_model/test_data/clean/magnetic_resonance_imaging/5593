Objective evaluation of breast asymmetry surgical treatment should consider not only breast shape but also breast volume.

For this study, 22 patients with primary breast asymmetry were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as linear measurements preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. The mean difference between the pre- and postoperative linear measurements was graduated from excellent to poor. Breast volume was estimated by MRI from axial reconstruction for three-dimensional application using the Cavalieri formula and specific software.

A strong correlation (r = 0.817) was found between the pre- and postoperative breast volumes, as increased or decreased by the surgical procedure. Patients with less postoperative volume differences tended to have the best ratings with linear measurements. When the same surgical procedure was performed bilaterally or when only one breast was treated by surgery, greater volume symmetry was observed.

Linear measurements and MRI are objective methods for evaluating postoperative symmetry, and when used in association, can help plastic surgeons to achieve favorable results in mammary asymmetry treatment.
