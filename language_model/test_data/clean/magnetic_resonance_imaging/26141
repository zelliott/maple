Imaging of uterine cervix carcinoma has evolved during the last decade. Recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging have expanded the role of MRI in evaluating the pathology of uterine cervix carcinoma. MRI is now the modality of choice for tumor staging, evaluating tumor response to treatment, diagnosing recurrences and for evaluating pregnant patients. MRI images will soon be used to calculate dosimetry for brachytherapy with matching and fusion software.
