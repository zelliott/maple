We report 3 individually different cases of primary chronic osteomyelitis. Neither the plasmacellular nor the sclerosing forms caused diagnostic or therapeutic difficulties whereas the case of a 40-year old male patient with a Brodie abscess in the tibial head could not be diagnosed unless the untreated abscess had perforated into the knee itself and empyema of the knee leaded to operative treatment and finally diagnosis of the Brodie abscess. Follow-up X-rays in weekly periods or MRT could have been helpful to avoid delayed diagnosis.
