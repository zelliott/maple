Our purpose was to evaluate the utility of clinicopathological and biological markers prior to treatment in predicting the immediate response to chemotherapy in cervical and endometrial adenocarcinomas. Twelve patients with locally advanced cervical adenocarcinomas and 16 patients with endometrial adenocarcinomas received intraarterial neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) consisting of cisplatin and doxorubicin before surgical resection. The decrease in tumor volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ([tumor volume before NAC - tumor volume after NAC]/tumor volume before NAC x 100) and the histologic response to NAC were assessed. Five factors prior to NAC (nuclear grade, pretreatment tumor volume, PCNA index, p53 protein expression, and DNA ploidy) were analyzed for correlation with the decrease in tumor volume and histologic response in cervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma, respectively. In cervical adenocarcinoma, patients with higher PCNA index tumor (> or = 40.2%) showed a significantly greater decrease in tumor volume than those with lower PCNA index (P < 0.05). In patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma, those with a smaller tumors (< 30.3 cm3) showed a significantly greater decrease than those with a larger tumors (P < 0.001). Tumors with higher PCNA index (> or = 31.5%) and negative p53 protein expression appeared to respond better than other tumors, but the difference was not statistically significant. Nuclear grade and DNA ploidy were not correlated with decrease in tumor volume either in cervical adenocarcinoma or in endometrial adenocarcinoma. Four cases of effective histologic response (2 complete responses [no microscopic residual tumor] and 2 marked responses [no macroscopic residual tumor]) were noted only in patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma who had a smaller tumor, higher PCNA index, and negative p53 protein expression. Pretreatment tumor volume and PCNA index were the only significant predictive factors (P < 0.05). Results suggest that the PCNA index in cervical and endometrial adenocarcinomas and the pretreatment tumor volume in endometrial adenocarcinoma appeared to be potentially useful in predicting the immediate response to the chemotherapy.
