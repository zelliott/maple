Knowledge of the influence of age on laryngeal dimensions is essential for all practitioners whose interest is the pediatric airway. Early cadaver studies documented that the larynx is conically shaped, with the apex of the cone caudally positioned at the nondistensible cricoid cartilage. These dimensions change during childhood, as the larynx assumes a more cylindrical shape. The authors analyzed laryngeal dimensions during development to determine if this relationship continues in unparalyzed children in whom laryngeal muscles are tonically active. The authors determined the relationships between the vocal cord, sub-vocal cord, and cricoid ring dimensions and the influence of age on these relationships.

Infants and children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging with propofol sedation had determinations of the transverse and anterior-posterior (AP) dimensions of the larynx at the most cephalad level of the larynx (vocal cords) and the most caudad level (cricoid). Most patients had an additional measurement (sub-vocal cord) at a level between the vocal cords and the cricoid ring. Relationships were obtained by plotting age against laryngeal dimensions and the ratio of laryngeal dimensions at different levels within the larynx.

The authors measured transverse and AP laryngeal dimensions in 99 children, aged 2 months-13 yr. The relationship between the transverse and AP dimensions at all levels of the larynx did not change during development. Transverse and AP dimensions increased linearly with age at all levels of the larynx. In all children studied, the narrowest portion of the larynx was the transverse dimension at the level of the vocal cords. Transverse dimensions increased linearly in a caudad direction through the larynx ( P< 0.001), while AP dimensions did not change relative to laryngeal level. The shape of the cricoid ring did not change throughout childhood.

In sedated, unparalyzed children, the narrowest portions of the larynx are the glottic opening (vocal cord level) and the immediate sub-vocal cord level, and there is no change in the relationships of these dimensions relative to cricoid dimensions throughout childhood.
