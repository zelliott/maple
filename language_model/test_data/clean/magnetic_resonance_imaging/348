To determine the type of ocular involvement in patients with neurosarcoidosis, and evaluate whether the type of eye involvement may help in the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis.

Retrospective, case history study. We reviewed the medical records of 46 patients who attended the sarcoidosis clinics at the Royal Brompton and Moorfields Eye Hospital over a 4-year period with a diagnosis of definite and probable neurosarcoidosis supported by laboratory investigations and exclusion of other causes for the neurological symptoms.

Cranial nerve involvement was the most common neurological manifestation in this series. Among the 27 patients with cranial neuropathy, lower motor neurone facial palsy was the most frequently seen in 19 patients (70.4%). Diplopia was seen in four patients (14.9%). In three patients, this was because of common oculomotor nerve paresis. Uveitis was the most common intraocular manifestation in patients with neurosarcoidosis. The majority of these patients (9, 64.3%) suffered from anterior uveitis, but in 35.7% of them the inflammatory process involved the posterior segment.

We found a higher incidence of ocular manifestations, including intraocular inflammation in neurosarcoidosis compared to that in systemic sarcoidosis elsewhere. The most common ocular complication seen in our series was anterior uveitis; however there were no associated clinical features of the uveitis in these series that could contribute to the differential diagnosis between neurosarcoidosis and other autoimmune disorders with neuro-ophthalmic features such as multiple sclerosis. Patients with neurological symptoms and associated intraocular inflammation should have a routine work-up for sarcoidosis. Investigations should include MRI scan of the brain and orbits and lumbar puncture in selected cases. Tissue biopsy should be attempted when clinically accessible lesions are available i.e., conjunctiva or lacrimal gland.
