Magnetic resonance (MR) images of three major flight muscles of chicks were obtained with surface coils using a 0.3 Tesla whole body imaging system (FONAR Beta 3000). The two fast muscles, pectoralis major (PM) and posterior latissimus dorsi (PLD), and a slow muscle, anterior latissimus dorsi (ALD), were identified in the axial, coronal, and sagittal images. The signal intensity (SI) of each muscle was electronically measured and its ratio to the background noise (S/N) was determined. Although visually the three muscles showed intermediate SI, the slow and fast muscles could be differentiated on the basis of their S/N values. These values were invariably higher in the slow muscles than in the fast muscles. To understand these differences, the muscles were excised and their mono- and multiexponential MR relaxation times (T1 and T2) were determined at 30 MHz. Multiexponential analysis enhanced the differences between the muscle types. With the sole exception of short T2, all relaxation components of the slow muscles were significantly longer than those of the fast muscles. These results suggest that elevation in the S/N, T1 and T2 values of muscles may not necessarily indicate a pathologic event, but may reflect the preponderance of slow fibers.
