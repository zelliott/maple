Local intra-arterial lysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) was performed in a 6 and 2/3-year-old patient with major cardioembolic ischemic stroke 48 hours after intracardiac surgery. Selective application of 2.5 mg rTPA (0.11 mg/kg body weight) resulted in recanalization of the occluded cerebral vasculature with good neurologic recovery.
