Twenty-four joints (10 knees and 14 ankles), with at least one manifestation of bleeding (proven by sonographic assessment), of 15 patients with haemophilia were investigated prospectively. For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation, the MRI scale of Nuss et al. was modified to a MRI score (max. 13 points/joint) to allow a comparison with the physical examination score (max. 12 points) and the radiological score (Pettersson score; max. 13 points). The number of joint bleeds correlated well with the degree of arthropathy P < 0.01). In all 16 joints with a maximum of two bleeds, no alterations were found by physical examination, or radiological and MRI assessment. Joints with three bleeds had physical examination scores between 0 and 2, Pettersson scores from 0 to 3 and MRI scores of 2. Joints with four or more bleeds had physical examination scores ranging between 3 and 7, radiological scores between 7 and 12 and MRI scores between 3 and 8. The MRI score describes initial joint alterations more precisely and earlier than other assessments, allowing a discerning estimation of the degree of arthropathy, as well as a follow-up of haemophilic arthropathy and an improvement after change of treatment. In addition, the modified MRI score seems to differentiate better between early and advanced signs of arthropathy than the MRI scale of Nuss et al.
