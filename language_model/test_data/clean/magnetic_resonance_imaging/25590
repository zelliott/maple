Twenty-six patients with thymoma, who had magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) before surgery, were studied. Twenty-six thymomas were classified into 11 non-invasive thymomas (Masaoka's clinical stage I) and 15 invasive thymomas (stage II, III, and IV). On MR imaging compared with histological findings, low signal intensity rim of the tumor was corresponded to fibrous capsule of the tumor, and linear and/or reticular low signal intensity lines in the tumor were corresponded to the fibrous septae dividing thymoma into lobules. The detectability of these findings by MR imaging was superior to that by CT. Margin of the tumor was smooth in non-invasive thymoma rather than invasive thymoma. The diagnostic accuracy of invasion to vessel, and pleura or lung on MR imaging and CT was compared with operative and histological findings. MR imaging was same as CT in its ability to detect tumoral invasion to vessel, and slightly superior to pleura or lung. In conclusion MR images clearly show the findings corresponding to pathologic specimens, and MR imaging combining with CT is useful to differentiate non-invasive thymoma to invasive thymoma.
