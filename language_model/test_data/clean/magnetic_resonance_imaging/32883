This study shows that by combining a double-quantum filtered magnetization transfer (DQF-MT) with an ultra-short TE (UTE) MRI that it is possible to obtain contrast between tissue compartments based on the following characteristics: (a) the residual dipolar coupling interaction within the biomacromolecules, which depends on their structure, (b) residual dipolar interactions within water molecules, and (c) the magnetization exchange rate between biomacromolecules and water. The technique is demonstrated in rat-tail specimens, where the collagenous tissue such as tendons and the annulus pulposus of the disc are highlighted in these images, and their macromolecular properties along with those of bones and muscles can be characterized. DQF-MT UTE MRI also holds promise because collagenous tissues that are typically invisible in conventional MRI experiments produce significant signal intensities using this approach.
