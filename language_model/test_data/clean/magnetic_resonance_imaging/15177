The aim of the study was to assess neuroimaging patterns of cerebral aspergillosis with magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 T). The clinical and imaging data of nine patients were reviewed. Patients were included in the study if the diagnosis of aspergillosis was confirmed by either biopsy, autopsy, aspergillus antigen determination and/or neuroradiological and clinical response to specific treatment. Four patients had single or multiple abscesses presenting as ring-enhancing lesions on T1-weighted images, hypointensity of the ring on T2-weighted MR images and low to high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging. Four patients had single or multiple infarctions affecting all compartments of the brain with hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in three of four patients, irregular parenchymal contrast enhancement in all patients and hemorrhagic transformation of the infarcted parenchyma in one patient. Diffusion-weighted images were positive in all ischemic areas. One patient with paranasal sinusitis developed a mycotic aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. Cerebral aspergillosis presents three principal neuroimaging findings: areas consistent with infarction; ring lesions consistent with abscess formation following infarction; and dural or vascular infiltration originating from paranasal sinusitis or orbital infiltration. Recognition of these patterns in cerebral aspergillosis may lead to more timely and effective diagnosis and treatment.
