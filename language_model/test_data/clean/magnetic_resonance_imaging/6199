Otoneurological and ultra low field MRI findings in multiple sclerosis patients: 22 patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS) underwent thorough neurological and otological examination, extensive ENG testing and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination of the central nervous system. All patients fulfilled the Schumacher criteria for a diagnosis of definitive MS. 20 of the patients had been included in previous otoneurological studies three to five years ago. The general disability assessed according to Hyllested's scale was: Class 1-7, Class 2-4, Class 3-6, Class 4-3, Class 5-2 patients. Thus 11 patients had none or only slight disability. Nevertheless, all patients showed abnormal findings when classified according to the Kurtzke disability scale, which reflects the involvement of separate neuronal entities. The ENG examination revealed abnormal findings in all patients. The most common abnormalities found were as follows: abnormal pendular test 19, ocular fixation index 18, optokinetic nystagmus 14, saccadic eye movements 14 and spontaneous nystagmus 12. 14 patients had uni- or bilateral abnormally slow adduction movements in the saccadic test consistent with internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which is caused by a lesion of the brain stem. MRI examination of the 21 patients studied revealed abnormal findings consistent with MS in sixteen cases. The lesions were unilateral in 5 and bilateral in 11 patients. The most common location for these abnormal findings consistent with MS plaques were in the white matter around the lateral ventricles. Plaques in the brain stem and/or cerebellum were found in only two cases despite numerous clinical and otoneurological findings that indicated the presence of functional lesions in these areas.
