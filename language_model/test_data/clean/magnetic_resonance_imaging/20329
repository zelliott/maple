We present a case of a 78-year-old woman who visited our hospital for chronic atrial fibrillation. She consulted an orthopedic surgeon for lumbar pain in August 2009 and has been followed up for osteoporosis. However, her lumbar pain became exacerbated. In December 2009, clinical examination revealed that the pain was caused by tuberculous spondylitis and iliopsoas abscess. Diffuse miliary shadow, which was undetected earlier, was noted on chest roentgenogram; she was diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis. Lumbar pain is common in elderly individuals and should be regarded as one of the tuberculosis symptoms, considering its atypical course in elderly patients.
