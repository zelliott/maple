In recent years, diagnostic imaging has become an important adjunct to conventional endocrine testing in the evaluation of adrenal gland dysfunction. This article discusses the role of imaging in the diagnostic workup of the following adrenal gland disorders: hypercatacholaminism, hyperaldosteronism, hyperadrenocorticism, and hypoadrenocorticism. The strengths and limitations of radiography, ultrasonography, scintigraphy, CT scanning, and MR imaging are addressed.
