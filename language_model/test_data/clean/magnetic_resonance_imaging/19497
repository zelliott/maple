Presellar extension of the bone window combined with removal of the sellar floor results in the transsphenoidal supradiaphragmatic intradural approach. One tuberculum sella meningioma and another suprasellar Rathke's cleft cyst confined to the pituitary stalk were removed via this approach. The presellar extension of the bone window was performed with the sublabial transseptal transsphenoidal technique. Furthermore, the dissection of the anterior intercavernous sinus, diaphragma sella, and arachnoid trabecula has allowed a wide surgical field of pre- and suprasellar areas and facilitates safe removal of lesions without significant surgical complications in selected cases.
