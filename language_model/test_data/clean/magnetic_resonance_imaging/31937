Highly uniform Fe3O4/SiO2 core/shell nanoparticles functionalized by phosphorescent iridium complexes (Ir) have been strategically designed and synthesized. The Fe3O4/SiO2(Ir) nanocomposite demonstrates its versatility in various applications: the magnetic core provides the capability for magnetic resonance imaging and the great enhancement of the spin-orbit coupling in the iridium complex makes it well suited for phosphorescent labeling and simultaneous singlet oxygen generation to induce apoptosis.
