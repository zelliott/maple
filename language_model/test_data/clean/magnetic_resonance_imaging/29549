This study describes several quality indicators of care in hospitalized stroke patients in Michigan from 1998 to 1999.

Median times from admission to head CT/MRI (89.5 minutes) and thrombolysis (113 minutes) exceeded recommended guidelines. Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis was used in only 13.8% of eligible patients.

Timing for brain imaging and acute ischemic stroke symptom onset need to be better documented, along with more provider education for routine deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
