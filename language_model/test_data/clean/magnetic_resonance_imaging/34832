We examined cranial MRI in 62 patients with CLD. Abnormal finding that high intensity area in symmetrical bilateral basal ganglia other than globus pallidum was found on both T-1 weighted images (T1WI) and fat suppression (chemical shift selective) images. This MRI finding was observed in 32 of 41 patients with cirrhosis while 1 of 21 patients with chronic hepatitis. This MRI finding was irreversible. The incidence of this MRI finding was correlated with severity of CLD and was statistically significant between in the patients with chronic hepatitis and those with cirrhosis. The contributing factors to the incidence of this MRI finding were severity of CLD and total bilirubin level by an analysis with logistic regression model. This MRI finding was detected clearer in a fat suppression imaging than in T1WI. The cause of this MRI finding was supposed not fat related substance by the finding of fat suppression imaging. This MRI finding would be useful for prediction of severity of CLD.
