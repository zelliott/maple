Two dogs developed discospondylitis caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus following thoracolumbar hemilaminectomy. Diagnoses were established by magnetic resonance imaging and radiography, respectively, in conjunction with culturing of microbial swabs. Treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics was first initiated. As soon as culturing results, confirming meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, and antibiograms became available, antimicrobial therapy was changed to gentamicin and trimethoprim/sulphadiazine. One dog, however, deteriorated further and was euthanased. The other dog improved on appropriate therapy. The first attempt to discontinue drug therapy four months after surgery led to a relapse. Antimicrobial therapy with chloramphenicol was then initiated and maintained for an additional four months. This dog is free of any relapses for 2.5 years. The veterinary surgeon should be aware of the possible involvement of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in postsurgical discospondylitis when choosing an antibiotic for initial antimicrobial therapy while culturing results are still pending.
