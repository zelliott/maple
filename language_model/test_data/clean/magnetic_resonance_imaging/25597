Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed in nine drug-dependent men with a primary diagnosis of opioid and/or cocaine dependence, and 10 age-matched, non-drug-dependent controls. Individuals were screened for the presence of gross cerebral abnormalities before T1 and T2 analyses. Regional T1 and T2 times were calculated on a single 5-mm thick axial slice positioned just below the caudal margin of the lateral ventricles, passing through the caudate and putamen. A voxel of interest (VOI) cursor was placed bilaterally within the putamen, caudate, frontal gray matter, frontal white matter, or posterior white matter. T1 and T2 values were determined for each VOI using an iterative chi 2 minimization program. T1 and T2 relaxation times did not differ significantly between the subject groups in any brain region studied. These results suggest that T1 and T2 relaxation times may not identify microstructural central nervous system changes resulting from chronic opiate and cocaine abuse.
