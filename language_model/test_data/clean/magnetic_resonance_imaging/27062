Diffusion tensor imaging was used to evaluate cerebral white matter in eight patients (ages 10-17), with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (3 congenital-onset, 5 juvenile-onset) compared to eight controls matched for age and sex. Four regions of interest were examined: inferior frontal, superior frontal, supracallosal, and occipital. The myotonic dystrophy group showed white matter abnormalities compared to controls in all regions. All indices of white matter integrity were abnormal: fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity. With no evidence of regional variation, correlations between whole cerebrum white matter fractional anisotropy and neurocognitive functioning were examined in the patients. Strong correlations were observed between whole cerebrum fractional anisotropy and full-scale intelligence and a measure of executive functioning. Results indicate that significant white matter abnormality is characteristic of young patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and that the white matter abnormality seen with neuroimaging has implications for cognitive functioning.
