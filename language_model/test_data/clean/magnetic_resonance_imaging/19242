We report two cases of cerebral venous angioma presenting as venous infarction, one in the left parietal lobe, the other in the left frontal lobe. Cerebral imaging demonstrated thrombotic occlusion of the draining vein of the venous angioma associated in the latter case with thrombosis of the anterior part of the superior longitudinal sinus. Both patients were free of coagulopathy. They were treated with anticoagulant therapy. One completely recovered, while the other was left with slight residual disability. Thrombosis of the draining vein has been reported in only 6 previous cases, of whom only 2 received anticoagulant therapy. Discovery of a venous angioma in the diagnostic workup of a patient with recent neurological disorders should raise the question of a possible occlusion of the draining vein and lead to an appropriate therapy.
