A 13-year-old girl presented with off and on headache for 1 year, hearing loss for 6 months and difficulty in closing eyes for 5 months along with mild cerebellar signs. Histopathologic evaluation of the tumor showed a rhabdoid meningioma (WHO Grade III).

Rhabdoid meningiomas are uncommon in children, and only 4 cases have been reported so far. None of them presented with cranial nerve involvement. This unusual presentation is reported here.

Though rare, rhabdoid meningiomas can occur in children. This, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first case of rhabdoid meningioma presenting with cranial nerve involvement.
