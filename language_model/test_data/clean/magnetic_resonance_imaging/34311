Gangliogliomas of the spinal cord are rare disease entities that occur in early childhood. Their occurrence in association with neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) has not been described. The authors describe the unique case of a 2-year-old child with stigmata of NF2 who harbored a spinal cord ganglioglioma that presented as a rapidly growing, exophytic intramedullary mass lesion at the cervicomedullary junction. Treatment consisted of complete surgical resection. Histopathological analysis of the lesion demonstrated a mixed population of neoplastic cells, of both neuronal and glial lineage, that supported the diagnosis of ganglioglioma.
