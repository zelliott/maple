Ten years follow-up of the first patients treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty.

Eighteen patients were retrospectively reviewed having undergone vertebroplasty in our centre between 1989 and 1998. Eight were treated for angioma, eight for osteoporotic compression and two followed for myeloma. They all underwent clinical and radiological evaluation in 2007 (standard X-rays, CT scan and MRI). These examinations were compared to prior baseline pre- and post-therapeutic images.

Radiological characteristic of cement remained unchanged in the long term and there was no modification of anatomical structures in contact with it. Even if the distribution of cement was asymmetrical there was no fracture of the treated vertebras at distance. Degenerative changes of discs facing the vertebroplasty were not more pronounced than for distant discs. We found no significant signal or density anomaly of disc in contact direct with cement. 38.8 % of the patients presented new fractures (n=30). Seventy percent of the fractures were multiple and contiguous. In the long term, all patients reported improvement of pain after the procedure.

In our series, we found a good stability of treatment over time. This study shows the long-term safety of percutaneous acrylic vertebroplasty, in particular harmlessness of cement for bone and discs in contact.
