Extragonadal teratomas in adulthood are exceptionally rare and usually not located within the cerebellum. We here report on a 66-year-old male patient clinically presenting with chronic occipital headache and episodes of severe vertigo. Neuroradiological investigations revealed a hemorrhagic tumor mass in the cerebellar vermis which was surgically removed and histologically diagnosed as mature teratoma. Hence, the presented case is extraordinary with regard to age, late clinical onset of symptoms and cerebellar location. Late clinical manifestation of the tumor in this case is probably due to an acute late-onset hemorrhage within the tumor.
