We report a case of metastatic eyelid and orbital carcinoma in a postmenopausal woman 8 years after mastectomy for cancer. MRI scan T1-weighted images with fat suppression revealed an intraconal lesion surrounding the left optic nerve in addition to the left lid tumor. Excision biopsy demonstrated tumor cells in an Indian file pattern. We diagnosed metastasis of breast carcinoma to the eyelid and orbit. Therapy with tamoxifen reduced eyelid and orbital metastases of carcinoma of the breast. Metastatic breast carcinoma should be listed as one of the causes of lesions of the eyelids.
