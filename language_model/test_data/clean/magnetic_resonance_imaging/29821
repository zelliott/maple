The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the costs of low-field (0.23 T) MRI- and CT-guided bone biopsies. The cost comparison consisted of 18 MRI-guided and 12 CT-guided bone biopsies performed during a 1-year period. The costs and activities of these two methods were analyzed by using activity-based cost accounting (ABC). The costs of MRI-guided bone biopsy (1205 Euro) were 2.55-fold compared with those of the CT-guided bone biopsy (472 Euro). The higher costs of the biopsy procedure in MRI were due to the higher material (5.57-fold) and personnel (2.73-fold) costs. The MRI-guided bone biopsies proved to be considerably more expensive than CT-guided bone biopsies. This was due to the higher material costs, especially the highly priced MRI compatible instrumentation and the longer procedure time. The MRI guidance in performing bone biopsies should be justified on the basis of the better accuracy and the lack of radiation. Evaluations of cost-effectiveness concerning MRI-guided bone biopsy are needed.
