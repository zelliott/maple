The rabdomiosarcoma (RMS) are infrequent tumors. They are principally described in infancy and located in 35% of the cases in head and neck. The nasopharynx localisation is relatively rare, being in these cases the tongue, palate and oral mucosa the preferent places of establishment. Classically the patient presented very low standard healing with surgery and radiotherapy. The introduction in the middle 70 of systematic chimiotherapy as complementary treatment, improved the survival rate in large scale. In this article the case of an adolescent patient, who presented a RMS at the level of the soft palate, the diagnostic procedure and the therapeutic decision adopted, after revision of the last studies at this respect, are described.
