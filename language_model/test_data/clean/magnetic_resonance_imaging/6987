Use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in individuals with orthopedic implants is limited because of the large distortions caused by metallic components. As a possible solution for this problem, we suggest the use of single-point imaging (SPI) methods, which are immune to the susceptibility artifacts observed with conventional MRI methods. A further advantage of SPI, based on the fact that signal encoding is achieved in ultra-short times (as short as tens of microseconds), is that they enable the direct visualization of the polymeric elements of the implants, allowing the detection of possible implant failures. We present in vitro SPI images of polymeric sockets of two hip prostheses together with artifact-free images of gelatin phantoms containing their respective metallic stems. These data underscore the great potential of the SPI technique for obtaining artifact-free images of individuals with large metal implants.
