A case of isolated primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the spine is presented along with a review of previous cases reported in the literature. An 80-year old immunocompetent man was admitted with progressive numbness and weakness of both lower extremities of 2 weeks' duration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervicothoracic spine revealed an extradural spinal mass at the T1 - T3 level, with invasion into the T3 vertebral body. The lesion was at first thought to be a metastatic tumour. Because of the manifestations of compression, the patient underwent laminectomy and posterior decompression. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. All other investigations (including computed tomography of the chest and abdomen, bone scan, peripheral blood examination and tumour marker examination) were negative for occult disease. This case demonstrates that neurosurgeons should be aware of the occurrence of isolated primary spinal lymphoma, which should be included in the differential diagnosis of metastatic tumours.
