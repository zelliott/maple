Dynamic shimming has been implemented in three pulse sequences on a commercial GE Signa 1.5-T imaging system. Multi-slice field maps are acquired before the imaging sequence, and linear shim terms and center frequencies are calculated for each slice. During the imaging scan, the linear shim terms and center frequency are set before each pulse sequence repetition according to the current slice. Acquisition of multi-slice field maps and calculation of shim terms and center frequency for each slice are accomplished in a matter of seconds. Pulse sequences require only minimal modification to add dynamic shimming capability. Results are shown for a fat saturation spin-echo sequence, a single-shot echo-planar gradient-recalled echo sequence, and a spiral acquisition gradient-recalled echo sequence. In all cases, dynamic shimming with shim currents and center frequency optimized for each slice is shown to give better results than constant shim currents and a single center frequency optimized for the entire volume of interest.
