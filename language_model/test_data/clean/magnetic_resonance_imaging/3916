Depiction of small-bowel pathologic conditions was optimized with use of a negative luminal contrast agent, spectral fat suppression, and gadolinium enhancement in an excised gut phantom. The method was applied in nine patients in conjunction with standard enteroclysis examinations. Bulk susceptibility effects of oral magnetic particles were canceled with use of a diamagnetic methylcellulose suspension. In the ileum, fat suppression and contrast between bowel wall and lumen was judged good or excellent in eight and nine patients, respectively. In eight of nine patients, additional mesenteric findings were depicted.
