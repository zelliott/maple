Estimation of liver volume using magnetic resonance (MR) images has been described previously. We have, however, not found a gold standard study, which analyzes the effect of section thickness on the estimation of liver volume. In the present study, five normal cadaveric livers were scanned in the horizontal plane using a 1.5 T MR machine (Signa 1.5T SYS#GEMSOW General Electronic, Wisconsin, USA). Consecutive sections at a thickness of 10, 7.5, 5 and 2.5 mm were used to estimate the total volume of the livers by means of the Cavalieri principle. The point counting and planimetry were used for the volume estimates. With a view to evaluating the accuracy of two techniques, all the estimations were done by the same observer. The estimated volumes concur with the actual volume of the livers obtained by the fluid displacement technique (p > 0.05). However, the section thickness has an over- or under-projection effect on the estimated volume. The obtained volume estimation results were analyzed to reveal the deviation principles of the estimates based on the section thickness. The most suitable section thickness for the liver volume estimation was assessed to be 4-5 mm. There were no significant differences between the estimation results of two methods (p > 0.05). The point-counting technique did, however, take less time than planimetry for estimating liver volume from MR images. Results also showed that the effect of section thickness on volume estimates using the two approaches could not be omitted and the values obtained could be calibrated using the proposed regression formula presented in this study.
