The subcortical response to peripheral somatosensory stimulation is not well studied. Prior literature suggests that somatosensory stimulation can affect dopaminergic tone. We studied the effects of electrical stimulation near the median nerve on the response to an amphetamine-induced increase in synaptic dopamine. We applied the electrical stimulation close to the median nerve 20 min after administration of 3mg/kg amphetamine. We used fMRI and microdialysis to measure markers of dopamine (DA) release, together with the release of associated neurotransmitters of striatal glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV), a marker used in fMRI, indicate that electrical stimulation significantly attenuated increased DA release (due to AMPH) in the striatum, thalamus, medial prefrontal and cingulate cortices. Microdialysis showed that electrical stimulation increased Glu and GABA release and attenuated the AMPH-enhanced DA release. The striatal DA dynamics correlated with the CBV response. These results demonstrate that electrical stimulation near the median nerve activates Glu/GABA release, which subsequently attenuate excess striatal DA release. These data provide evidence for physiologic modulation caused by electroacupuncture at points near the median nerve.
