Preoperative, operative and postoperative radiological examinations and operative notes of 31 patients with spinal arachnoid cyst operated on during 2002-2009 at the Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, were evaluated. Sixteen patients were male and 15 were female. All patients were managed surgically: extradural arachnoid cysts were managed by excision and intradural arachnoid cysts were managed by marsupialization. There was no recurrence in the 4 years of follow up.
