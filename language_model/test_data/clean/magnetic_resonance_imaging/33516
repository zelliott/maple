A 27-year-old woman presented during a football match with sudden cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. After electrical defibrillation the electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block. Ventriculography, echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an aneurysm in the basal part of the ventricular septum and another aneurysm on the anterior wall of the right ventricle. She had normal coronary arteries. Ventricular tachycardia was induced in the outflow tract of the right ventricle during electrophysiological study. She was treated surgically by aneurysmectomy and cryocoagulation. No ventricular tachyarrythmia could be provoked at postoperative electrophysiological testing. Histological examination of the right ventricular aneurysm showed the presence of noncaseating granulomas and scar tissue consistent with cardiac sarcoidosis. She had no other systemic manifestations of the disease. The patient was doing well and had no cardiac symptoms after the operation. She died suddenly of unknown cause 21 months later. No autopsy was performed.
