There is a great deal of interest in the development of nanoplatforms gathering versatility and multifunctionality. The strategy reported herein meets these requirements and further integrates a cell-friendly shell in a bio-inspired approach. By taking advantage of a cell mechanism of biomolecule transport using vesicles, we engineered a hybrid biogenic nanoplatform able to encapsulate a set of nanoparticles regardless of their chemistry or shape. As a proof of versatility, different types of hybrid nanovesicles were produced: magnetic, magnetic-metallic and magnetic-fluorescent vesicles, either a single component or multiple components, combining the advantageous properties of each integrant nanoparticle. These nanoparticle-loaded vesicles can be manipulated, monitored by MRI and/or fluorescence imaging methods, while acting as efficient nano-heaters. The resulting assets for targeting, imaging and therapy converge for the outline of a new generation of nanosystems merging versatility and multifunctionality into a bio-camouflaged and bio-inspired approach.
