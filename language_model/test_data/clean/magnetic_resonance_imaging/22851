A method is presented for 3D MRI in an extended field of view (FOV) based on continuous motion of the patient table and an efficient acquisition scheme. A gradient-echo MR pulse sequence is applied with lateral (left-right (L/R)) frequency-encoding direction and slab selection along the direction of motion. Compensation for the table motion is achieved by a combination of slab tracking and data alignment in hybrid space. The method allows fast k-space coverage to be achieved, especially when a short sampling FOV is chosen along the direction of table motion, as is desirable for good image quality. The method can be incorporated into different acquisitions schemes, including segmented k-space scanning, which allows for contrast variation with the use of magnetization preparation. Head-to-toe images of volunteers were obtained with good quality using 3D spoiled gradient-echo sequences. As an example of magnetization-prepared imaging, fat/water separated images were acquired using chemical shift selective (CHESS) presaturation pulses.
