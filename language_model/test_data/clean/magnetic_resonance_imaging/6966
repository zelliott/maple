Neurocysticercosis is a major cause of neurologic disease worldwide. The clinical presentations are pleomorphic depending on the stage and location of cysts in the nervous system. Most children (> 80%) present with seizures, particularly partial seizures; headache and vomiting are seen in about a third of cases. Diagnosis is made by either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. Single enhancing lesions are the most common finding. Visualization of a scolex confirms the diagnosis. Some cases have multiple cysts; the "starry-sky" appearance in cases with innumerable cysts is characteristic. Most children require anticonvulsants. Corticosteroids are indicated in those with cerebral edema. The efficacy of cysticidal therapy continues to be debated. Controlled studies suggest that cysticidal therapy helps in increased and faster resolution of CT lesions, but there is no conclusive evidence that it improves long-term seizure control. The prognosis in cases with single lesions is good; seizure control is achieved with a single anticonvulsant, and the recurrence rate is low. Children with multiple lesions have recurrent seizures. Extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis is rare in children and carries a poor prognosis. Neurocysticercosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of seizures and a wide variety of neurologic disorders, particularly in endemic areas.
