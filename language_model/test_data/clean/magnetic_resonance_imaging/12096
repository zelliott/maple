Audited cost data from two public hospital installations participating in a trial of the utilisation and efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging are presented. The data cover the period July 1987 to June 1988 when both installations had attained stable patterns of operation. One hospital operated a superconductive system and the other a resistive magnetic resonance imaging unit. Depreciation and salaries represented the major components of cost.
