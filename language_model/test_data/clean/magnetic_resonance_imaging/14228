The evaluation of tumor size by neurodiagnostic imaging is an important tool in determining disease progression or treatment efficacy. Apparent tumor size on any single slice image is sensitive to tumor shape and slice orientation. Volumetric measurements which use multiple, stacked images attenuate that sensitivity and can provide insights into tumor architecture. Volumetric measurements were made of induced canine gliomas using three common MR imaging protocols and with and without a contrast agent. Comparisons of the volumes described by each technique are made.
