Echinococcosis affecting the spine is rare. The authors present the case of a 23-year-old man in whom features of thoracic spinal cord compression were demonstrated. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine revealed an extradural cystic lesion involving the spine and paraspinal musculature. At surgery echinococcosis was confirmed, and subsequent histopathological examination also revealed Trichinella infestation of the paraspinal musculature. After undergoing decompressive surgery and albendazole therapy, the patient made a remarkable improvement. Although primary echinococcosis can affect the spine, concomitant infestation with Trichinella has not been reported. Surgery has to be followed by albendazole therapy.
