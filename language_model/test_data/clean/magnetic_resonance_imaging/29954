Orbital cavernous hemangiomas, particularly those within the retrobulbar space, are approached by neurosurgeons as well as by ophthalmic surgeons. Several surgical techniques have been applied over the past decades. Less traumatic approaches in this functionally and cosmetically important region are desirable. We describe a transconjunctival approach in 39 patients with orbital cavernous hemangiomas.

Thirty-nine patients with orbital cavernous hemangiomas were treated with transconjunctival orbitotomy. The clinical and radiologic characteristics of orbital cavernous hemangiomas were analyzed in the course of their appropriate treatment.

In all patients, cavernous hemangiomas were just behind the globe or were compressing it. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed orbital cavernous hemangiomas as round, well-defined intraconal masses. In 37 cases, the tumors were removed intact, and only 1 patient suffered permanent vision loss as a result of intraoperative hemorrhage. In the other 2 cases, the tumor fragments were incompletely removed. Visual acuity increased in 6 of the 9 cases with primary visual impairment. Thirty-two patients with primary proptosis were resolved completely. Six patients with visual field defect were also improved.

Retrobulbar intraconal cavernous hemangiomas can be removed successfully through a transconjunctival approach. However, if the tumor is close to, or touching, the orbital apex, adhering tightly to retrobulbar tissue, or combined with large draining veins, operation through other approaches must be considered.
