The value of magnetic resonance tomography in the diagnosis of paragangliomas in the head and neck has been studied and compared with CT and angiography. Magnetic resonance tomography on its own equals the accuracy of CT, but the use of Gd-DTPA improves diagnostic accuracy. In 19 patients with a glomus jugulare tumour, MR tomography with Gd-DTPA accurately diagnosed all tumours larger than 5 mm. In seven patients with a carotid body tumour, it was possible to arrive at an exact differential diagnosis. Sensitivity was better than that of CT or of sonography. Where there is clinical suspicion of a glomus tumour, magnetic resonance tomography with Gd-DTPA should be the first investigation; if there is a positive finding, angiography should be carried out to demonstrate the circle of Willis.
