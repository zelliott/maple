Numerous imaging techniques permit evaluation of regional pulmonary function. Contrast-enhanced CT methods now allow assessment of vasculature and lung perfusion. Techniques using spirometric controlled multi-detector row CT allow for quantification of presence and distribution of parenchymal and airway pathology; xenon gas can be employed to assess regional ventilation of the lungs, and rapid bolus injections of iodinated contrast agent can provide a quantitative measure of regional parenchymal perfusion. Advances in MRI of the lung include gadolinium-enhanced perfusion imaging and hyperpolarized gas imaging, which allow functional assessment, including ventilation/perfusion, microscopic air space measurements, and gas flow and transport dynamics.
