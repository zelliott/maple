Two cases of paraganglioma arising from the parasellar region are presented. Both occurred in middle-aged women who sought treatment of headaches but who had no endocrinological dysfunction; one case was associated with ophthalmoplegia from cavernous sinus involvement. Diagnosis in both cases was confirmed by typical histological appearance and cytochemical demonstration of immunoreactive chromogranin in tumor cells. The pathological features and possible pathogenesis of parasellar paragangliomas are discussed.
