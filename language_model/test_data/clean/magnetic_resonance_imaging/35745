MR tomograms of the spines of 121 patients were reviewed in order to assess the incidence and distribution of focal fat deposits in axial bone marrow. In addition, three cadaver spines were examined and cut with a band saw for macroscopic and histologic correlation. Yellow areas, histologically representing fatty replacement of hematopoetic marrow, were found macroscopically; their location was in precise correspondence to areas of focal enhanced signal intensity on T1-WI as well as T2-WI. The incidence of those focal fat spots was related to age, but not to sex; in different diseases like scoliosis, porosis and after cytostatic therapy of different malignomas they were found more frequently than in the average of the sample. Focal fatty replacement of hematopoetic bone marrow is obviously a normal phenomenon and should not be misinterpreted as a pathologic condition.
