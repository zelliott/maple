Because superparamagnetic iron oxide is actively taken into the reticuloendothelial system, the signal intensity observed on T2-weighted images is reduced not only in the liver but also in the spleen. There is no difference in the reduction in signal intensity in the liver after contrast between the ferumoxides and ferucarbotran, but the reduction in signal intensity in the spleen is considerable. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of T2*-weighted imaging to compensate for the reduction in signal intensity in the spleen by administering ferucarbotran.

We examined the images obtained from 35 patients who underwent MRI with ferucarbotran. T2-weighted images and T2*-weighted images were obtained before and after administration of ferucarbotran, and the changes in signal intensity in the liver and spleen were then analyzed.

A reduction in signal intensity was observed in the liver by both T2- and T2*-weighted imaging. In the spleen, the signal intensity was reduced on T2-weighted images but was not reduced on T2*-weighted images.

The reduction in signal intensity due to administration of ferucarbotran is low in the spleen. Thus, it was considered necessary to approach the problem of diagnosing ectopic splenic tissue using ferucarbotran with caution.
