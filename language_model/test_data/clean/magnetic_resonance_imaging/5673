This article reviews the regulations in force about the exposure of workers to the electromagnetic fields generated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and evaluates the impact of European Directive 2004/40/EC on the daily use of MRI. We provide a detailed review of the safety criteria stipulated in the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, in Spanish Royal Decree 1066/2001, and in European Directive 2004/40/EC about exposure to electromagnetic fields. In the case of European Directive 2004/40/EC, the European Union (EU) has introduced a law without adequately evaluating its repercussions. In response to alarms sounded by the radiological and general medical communities, the EU has decided to delay implementation of the Directive. Although the implementation of Directive 2004/40/ EC has been postponed until April 30, 2012, it remains in force. There remains the hope that the Directive will be reconsidered during this interval and that MRI workers will be exempt.
