We report a rare case of petroclival craniopharyngioma with no connection to the sellar or suprasellar region. MRI and CT images revealed a homogenously enhancing retroclival solid mass with aggressive skull base destruction, mimicking chordoma or aggressive sarcoma. However, there was no calcification or cystic change found in the mass. Here, we report the clinical features and radiographic investigation of this uncommon craniopharyngioma arising primarily in the petroclival region.
