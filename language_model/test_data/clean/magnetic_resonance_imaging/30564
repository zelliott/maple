The authors report the case of a 4-year-old boy with a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) related to an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) that was not found with good-quality magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR angiography. Both modalities were used serially in the acute phase and at 2 and 7 months of follow-up. Digital subtraction angiography identified the peripheral AVM when the patient experienced rehemorrhaging 1 year after his initial presentation. This case illustrates the need for a complete diagnostic evaluation including conventional angiography in cases of idiopathic ICH in children.
