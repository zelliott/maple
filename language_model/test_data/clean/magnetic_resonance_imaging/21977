The authors report a case of periarteritis nodosa (PAN) with an inaugural symptom of febril epilepsy. The patient was drug addict with hepatitis B and C virus. A toxoplasmic lesion originally noted on the cranial computed tomography scan was confirmed by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showing encephalitis, and a diagnosis of periarteritis nodosa was suggested by clinical signs and laboratory data. The responsibility of hepatitis B virus in the genesis of this PAN seems quite certain whereas possible others factors such as hepatitis C virus or cocaine are discussed.
