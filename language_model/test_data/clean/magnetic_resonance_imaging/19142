We presented the clinicopathological features of 8 cases of intraventricular neurocytoma, which was a rare, benign tumor of neuronal origin and affected young patients. In each case the intraventricular tumor existed near the foramen of Monro and/or body of the lateral ventricle, and was associated with ventricular dilatation. A CT scan demonstrated a well-circumscribed iso- or hyperdense mass with some calcification, intratumoral cysts of various sizes and a heterogeneous enhancement. MRI, which was performed in 4 cases, confirmed a mass of isointense or slightly hyperintense on T 1-weighted images, and with multiple sites of attachment (mainly to the septum pellucidum and the head of the caudate nucleus). While these neuroimaging features are helpful in eliminating alternative diagnosis such as ependymomas, choroid plexus papillomas, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and meningiomas, age of the patient and the tumor location within the lateral ventricle are important features for differential diagnosis.
