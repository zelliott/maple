In vivo structural (CT, MRI) and functional (SPECT, PET) brain imaging techniques have been widely used to study the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to identify definite biological markers of the disease. We used meta-analytic methods to synthesize this literature to determine what neuroanatomical structures best differentiate patients with AD from healthy normal controls. A total of 125 studies published between 1984 and 2000 that included 3543 patients with AD and 1698 normal healthy controls met inclusion criteria. We found that measures of the temporal cortices, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and inferior temporal lobes, along with the anterior cingulate cortex, associated with the largest magnitudes of effects and, hence, could serve as the most useful structures to help clinicians differentiate AD from healthy normal aging.
