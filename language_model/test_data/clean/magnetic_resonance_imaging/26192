Radiographic findings for a solitary plasmacytoma of the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus are reported. The diagnostic evaluation for this disease is discussed through use of plain images, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The treatment selected was radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed bone destruction, though this was not apparent on plain images. T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance images showed similar or high signal intensity relative to muscle; T(2)-weighted images showed hyperintensity.
