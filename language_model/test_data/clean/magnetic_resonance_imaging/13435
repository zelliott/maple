Sterno-costo-hyperostosis is an inflammatory rheumatic disease which is associated to pustulosis palmaris et plantaris. The origin of this disorder is unknown. We described the appearance as a "reactive" fibromatosis in connection with a hyperostosis of a clavicle, which could be demonstrated in a biopsy-probe and by NMR-technique.
