Surgical treatment of brainstem lesions has been encouraged after the development of magnetic resonance imaging. However, direct approaches to intra-axial lesions in the brainstem still carry a high risk of morbidity because the neuronal structures can be injured along the entry routes. We present two patients whose pontine cavernous angiomas were removed via incision of the lateral aspect of the pons with presigmoid approach. The first case, a 41-year-old woman, presented with paresis of the cranial nerves VI, VII, and VIII, and left hemiparesis progressing over 2 weeks caused by a cavernous angioma ventrally located in the lower pons. The second case, a 50-year-old woman, developed dizziness over 2 months due to a large cavernous angioma in the center of the pons. These lesions were totally removed through the presigmoid approach and no additional neurological deficits were observed. An image-guided navigation system was used for the craniotomy and removal of the lesion in the second patient. The presigmoid approach provides a safe route to intra-axial lesions in the pons. A technique for presigmoid craniotomy with one-piece bone flap under the image-guided navigation is also described.
