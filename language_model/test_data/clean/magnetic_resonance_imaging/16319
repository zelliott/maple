We report on a 63-year-old male who suffered from an ingrown toenail affecting the left first digit for several years. Medical history revealed that repeated vigorous nail plate trimming by the patient relieve the red, painful swelling of his great toe. Furthermore, Emmert onychoplasty as well as non-invasive procedures did not achieve improvement. A thorough surgical exploration of the affected area detected a nail spicule in the deeper paronychium. This was likely caused by improper cutting of the nail plate. Removal of the fragment in combination with partial nail plate excision, followed by phenol cauterization of the matrix resulted in full recovery.
