Hemophilic arthropathy is an incapacitating complication of severe hemophilia resulting from recurrent bleeding in the same joint. Open synovectomy has been used since 1969 to prevent recurrent hemarthrosis of target joints. Between 1988 and 1993 we performed open synovectomy of the ankle in five hemophiliacs aged 6 to 9 years with early-stage hemophilic arthropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging proved very useful for evaluating the severity of joint damage, usually underestimated on plain radiographs; for determining the degree of synovial membrane hypertrophy, which is a critical factor in the decision to perform synovectomy; for planning the surgical procedure and for explaining treatment failures. A decrease in the frequency of hemarthrosis episodes occurred in all five ankles. A repeat synovectomy was needed in one case and in another patient the frequency of hemarthrosis episodes increased somewhat after the fourth year. There was no loss of range of motion. Our data suggest that open synovectomy is effective and safe for reducing the frequency of hemarthrosis and that magnetic resonance imaging should be routinely performed before the procedure.
