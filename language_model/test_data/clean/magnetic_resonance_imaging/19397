The objective of this study was to compare enhancement patterns of a blood-pool contrast agent, Gadomer-17, with those of gadopentetate dimeglumine in bacterial abscesses and VX2 carcinoma in rabbits.

Fourteen rabbits with experimentally induced bacterial abscesses and VX2 carcinoma in both thighs underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging with Gadomer-17 and gadopentetate dimeglumine at a 24-hr interval. The enhancement ratios (postcontrast to precontrast signal intensities) of lesions in the same animal were assessed and correlated with microvessel density.

For Gadomer-17, the enhancement ratio of the abscesses (1.66 +/- 0.39) peaked 15 min after the injection, while that of the carcinoma (2.05 +/- 0.16) peaked at 10 min. The enhancement ratios of the carcinoma were consistently higher than those of the abscesses up to 30 min. For gadopentetate dimeglumine, peak enhancement ratio of the abscesses (2.30 +/- 0.75) was seen 5 min after the injection, while that of the carcinoma (2.32 +/- 0.51) was seen at 3 min. The enhancement ratios of the carcinomas were significantly higher at 1 min, but significantly lower at 20-30 min, compared with those of the abscesses, as a result of rapid decrease of enhancement ratios in the carcinomas. The microvessel density was 9.8 +/- 5.2 vessels per field of view for the abscesses and 36.3 +/- 9.5 vessels per field of view for the carcinoma (p < 0.001).

Delayed peak enhancement and slow decay were found in both bacterial abscess and VX2 carcinoma with Gadomer-17, whereas early peak enhancement and rapid decay were found especially in VX2 carcinoma with gadopentetate dimeglumine. Enhancement ratios on MR imaging with a blood-pool contrast agent correlated well with the microvessel density in bacterial abscess and VX2 carcinoma.
