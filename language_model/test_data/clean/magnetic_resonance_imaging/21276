Accumulating evidence suggests that extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling plays a significant role following acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Decorin (DCN) is a well-recognized molecule present in the ECM; however, the role of DCN in AIS remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate whether plasma concentrations of DCN are altered in patients following an AIS and whether they are correlated with matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) levels and other laboratory and clinical variables. Plasma concentrations of DCN were assessed in 102 patients with AIS (less than 7 days) and 120 control subjects using ELISA assays. The correlation between DCN concentrations and MMP-2 levels, Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) subtypes, stroke severity and risk factors were evaluated. The expression of DCN was significantly decreased in patients with AIS (P<0.001), particularly in the large-artery atherosclerosis (LAAS) group. The levels of DCN were positively correlated with MMP-2 (R=0.332; P<0.001), thus MMP-2 is an independent predictor of DCN concentration (P<0.001). DCN levels below 8,500 pg/ml had sensitivity and specificity values of AIS of 79.4 and 62.8%, respectively and DCN below 8,500 pg/ml was associated with AIS (OR=4.8; 95% CI: 2.1-11.1; P<0.001) following adjustment for potential confounders. In conclusion, for the first time, a reduction in DCN was detected in patients following AIS and these altered plasma concentrations were correlated with MMP-2. Larger studies are required to further investigate whether DCN is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.
