Ewing's sarcoma is rarely located at the base of the skull. We report a case of ethmoid Ewing's sarcoma. Diagnosis was established on microscopic examination. A complete surgical resection was performed, followed by cranial base reconstruction. During the postoperative period, a combined course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy was performed. We also present a review of the literature.
