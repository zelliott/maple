The objective was to measure the effect of 100% oxygen inhalation on T1 relaxation times in skeletal muscle. Healthy volunteers were scanned using three different MRI protocols while breathing medical air and 100% oxygen. Measurements of T1 were made from regions of interest (ROIs) within various skeletal muscle groups. Dynamic data of subjects breathing a sequence of air-oxygen-air allowed the calculation of characteristic wash-in and -out times for dissolved oxygen in muscle. Contrary to previous findings, a statistically significant decrease in T1 in skeletal muscle was observed due to oxygen inhalation. We report approximate baseline characteristic values for the response of skeletal muscle to oxygen inhalation. This measurement may provide new biomarkers for evaluation of oxygen delivery and consumption in normal and diseased skeletal muscle.
