Besides visual input and vestibular afferents, proprioceptive input from muscle spindle receptors of the neck region contributes to the perception of egocentric space. Using fMRI we performed a neck muscle vibration paradigm in humans in order to detect brain areas involved in processing changes of the head position in relation to the rest of the body. We identified a network of primary and secondary cortical areas: (I) regions that presumably receive direct proprioceptive thalamic input such as areas 3a, 2, S2 and the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), (II) foci in the intraparietal sulcus, motor and premotor areas, and the frontal eye field (FEF). Activation of the former reflect early stages of proprioceptive processing, nevertheless these areas contain polysensory subdivisions such as area 3aNv, which also receives vestibular afferents. Together with area PIVC and the vestibular field in area 2 (2v), area 3aNv constitutes the inner vestibular circuit, an interconnected cortical triangle of polysensory areas that project to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which is known to be involved in polysensory integration. With respect to possible analogies in the monkey, we speculate that the activation we observed in the PPC is closely related to the LIP and VIP regions of the macaque.
