This study describes high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in 55 patients with suspected metastatic spinal cord compression. MRI, principally using T1-weighted sagittal surface coil images, showed evidence of cord compression in 29 patients, and intramedullary masses in three patients. MRI clearly showed the site, nature and extent of the cord compression and gave useful additional information about the presence of bone marrow metastases and paravertebral soft-tissue masses. Comparison with conventional myelography was possible in 21 patients and MRI was superior or equivalent to myelography in 18 patients and inferior in three patients. MRI is the method of choice for the investigation of patients with suspected metastatic spinal cord compression.
