Because of the increasing incidence of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), it is essential to recognize this disease in order to start appropriate treatment. We present the characteristic CT and MRI features of this tumour. The findings of 32 CT and 31 MR of 37 immunocompetent patients with biopsy-proved PCNSL are reviewed. The main features are presented and analysed, and are discussed in comparison with proven literature data. Primary central nervous system lymphoma presents as supratentorial solitary lesions in approximately 80% of the patients and multiple lesions in 20%. In contrast to classical data, the lesions are located in deep structures only in one-third of the cases, and involve posterior fossa in 10% of cases. Most of the lesions are hyperdense or isodense (92%) on CT, hypointense or isointense on T1-weighted images, and only about 40% are hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Nearly all the lesions enhance, except after corticosteroid administration. They produce mild oedema and mass effect. Meningeal or ventricular enhancement are rare but suggestive. Calcification, haemorrhage or necrosis are scarce. Although PCNSL in immunocompetent patients have a variable CT and MR appearance, the imaging data often suggest the diagnosis.
