We report a case of epidural hematoma after a single epidural block. The patient was a 67-year-old woman with sciatica and osteoarthritis of the spine. She had no coagulopathy. She underwent a single epidural block without difficulty 3 times in 5 days. She had a lumbar MRI for an examination of the spine 4 days after the final epidural block. Subacute epidural hematoma of 0.8 x 1.5 x 3.0 cm was revealed on MRI at L 3-4. She had no new neurological symptoms. MRI 1 month later revealed a resolution of the hematoma. Epidural hematoma after an epidural block might occur in an outpatient with no bleeding tendency.
