In recent studies, several authors have highlighted and studied an altered blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in subjects affected by migraine with aura, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the migraine attack or during the period between two attacks. Using fMRI, we assessed a 27-year-old man affected by migraine with aura at two different times: during the migraine attack, and a fortnight later, in order to look for differences in regional cerebral blood flow after visual stimulation. In addition, during the attack-free period we carried out a series of electrophysiological examinations. Our results demonstrate different activation patterns of the occipital cortex during the asymptomatic period and during the migraine attack. Furthermore, the electrophysiological data obtained demonstrated altered activity due to the patient's disease.
