The three-dimensional visualization of orofacial tumours and adjacent organs at risk of infiltration is an important requirement for staging, therapy planning and follow-up. Artifacts from the mandible or metal implants often reduce the diagnostic power of computed tomography (CT). The value of 3D-ultrasound (3D-US) in respect to the standard methods CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was therefore analyzed.

Between 9/97 and 10/99 the visualization of orofacial tumours in 243 patients by 3D-US was examined, classified on a five-point scale and compared to the corresponding CT and MRI scans.

Complete visualization of the tumours was possible in 85.6 % by 3D-US, whereas the rates of MRI and CT were lower with 77.4 % and 61.3 % respectively, mainly because of artifacts. The best combinations of methods, 3D-US + CT (96.7 %) and 3D-US + MRI (95.1 %) gave almost equivalent results, whereas CT + MRI (83.5 %) was inferior. In 2.5 % of the cases none of the methods produced adequate results.

By free selection of sectional planes and direct correlation to the clinical findings 3D-ultrasound can improve staging, therapy planning and follow-up of orofacial tumours, especially in the case of small tumour size, dental crowns/inlays, metal implants or contraindications to MRI.
