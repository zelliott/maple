Here we report a 12-year-old boy with idiopathic neuralgic amyotrophy who had two episodes of shoulder pain followed by shoulder muscle atrophy and weakness at the age of 7 and 11 years, respectively. These symptoms were self-limited and disappeared within 9 months. During the second episode, electromyograph (EMG) revealed neurogenic changes in the deltoid muscle. Muscle imaging showed the right deltoid muscle atrophy with slightly high intensity areas on T1 and T2 weighted images in MRI. Muscle biopsy from the right deltoid muscle revealed neurogenic changes with denervating and reinnervating processes. Neuralgic amyotrophy is characterized by neuralgic pain followed by weakness and atrophy at a unilateral extremity and is usually self-limited. EMG and imaging studies showed focal neurogenic abnormalities, which were confirmed by muscle biopsy. Neuralgic amyotrophy usually occurs in young adults and it is very rare in children.
