Iron elevation is well-documented in the Parkinsonian midbrain but its cause and contribution to subsequent neurodegeneration remain unknown. Mice administered iron at doses equivalent to those found in iron-fortified human infant formula during a developmental period equivalent to the first human year of life display progressive midbrain neurodegeneration and enhanced vulnerability to toxic injury. This may have major implications for the impact of neonatal iron intake as a potential risk factor for later development of Parkinson's disease (PD).
