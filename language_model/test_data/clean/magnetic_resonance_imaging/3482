Myxoid (metaplastic) meningioma is a rare WHO Grade I meningioma subtype arising from the leptomeninges. It has unique Alcian blue stromal staining and distinctive cellular interdigitations, junctional complexes, and nucleolar pseudoinclusions on ultrastructural pathology that help to distinguish it from other meningioma variants. The authors describe the case of a rare left middle fossa, extraaxial myxoid meningioma in a 50-year-old woman to emphasize the important histological characteristics and observations essential for making a precise diagnosis. To their knowledge this is the seventh reported case of a myxoid meningioma in the literature and the sixth case in an adult; however, it is the first reported instance of myxoid meningioma in a patient presenting with intratumoral hemorrhage.
