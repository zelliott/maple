Magnetic resonance imaging is an established technique for imaging the shoulder because it demonstrates clearly the articular surfaces, medullary canal and the extra-articular soft tissues which can be affected in shoulder disorders. The value of MR imaging in the evaluation of the traumatized shoulder has been described [1]; however, few cases of MR imaging in nontraumatic disorders in children have been reported. We reviewed the findings in 55 children undergoing MRI of the shoulder for nontraumatic conditions and included selected cases showing a broad range of imaging findings.
