The purpose of this study was to determine the morphologic changes that occur in the upper airway of children during awakening from propofol sedation.

Children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging of the head underwent additional scans of the upper airway during deep sedation with propofol; this was repeated on awakening. Axial views were obtained at the most posterior sites of the pharynx at the levels of the soft palate and tongue. Measurements were then obtained of the anterior-posterior (A-P) diameter, transverse diameter, and cross-sectional areas at these levels.

Data were obtained on 16 children, aged 10 months to 7 yr. In both sedated and awakening states, most children had the smallest cross-sectional area of the pharynx at the level of the soft palate. During the sedated state, at the soft palate level, the transverse diameter was most narrow in 11 children, the A-P diameter was most narrow in 1 child, and they were equal in 2 children. During the sedated state, at the level of the tongue, the transverse diameter was most narrow in 9 children, the A-P diameter was most narrow in 5 children, and they were equal in 2 children. During awakening, at the soft palate level, the transverse diameter was most narrow in none of the children, the A-P diameter was most narrow in 13 children, and they were equal in 1 child. At the level of the tongue, the transverse diameter was most narrow in 4 children, and the A-P diameter was most narrow in 12 children. During awakening, the A-P diameter of the pharynx at the level of the soft palate decreased in 12 children, increased in 1 child, and remained the same in 1 child. (P < 0.001). The transverse diameter increased in 11 children, decreased in 1 child, and remained the same in 2 children (P = 0.001). The cross-sectional area at the level of the soft palate increased in 4 children, decreased in 8 children, and stayed the same in 2 children (P = 0.5). During awakening, the A-P diameter of the pharynx at the level of the tongue decreased in 11 children, increased in 4 children, and remained the same in 1 child. (P = 0.01). The transverse diameter increased in 11 children and decreased in 5 children (P = 0.07). The cross-sectional area at the level of the tongue increased in 7 children, decreased in 7 children, and stayed the same in 2 children (P = 0.9).

The dimensions of the upper airways of children change shape significantly on awakening from propofol sedation. When sedated, the upper airway is oblong shaped, with the A-P diameter larger than the transverse diameter. On awakening, the shape of the upper airway in most children changed such that the transverse diameter was larger. Cross-sectional areas between sedated and awakening states were unchanged. These changes may reflect the differential effects of propofol on upper airway musculature during awakening.
