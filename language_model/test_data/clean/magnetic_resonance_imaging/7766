Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is chronic inflammatory lesions of unknown origins. The preoperative diagnosis for tumors in the sinonasal cavity is difficult to distinguish between IMT and aggressive malignancy in most cases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the imaging features of IMT distinguishing the 2 types of tumors.

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were identified retrospectively with IMT in 14 cases and with aggressive malignancy in 38 cases in the sinonasal cavity proven by pathology. Imaging findings were evaluated, including the configuration, extent, margin, calcification, bone involvement, T1WI and T2WI signal intensity, and degree of enhancement.

There was a significant difference between IMT and aggressive malignancy regarding the configuration, extension, calcification, bone change, signal intensity and homogeneous on T2-weighted imaging, and degree of enhancement (P < 0.05).

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and aggressive malignancy have some different imaging features that could be helpful in the differentiation between the lesions. Bone erosion with sclerosis, calcification when present, typically homogenous and never hyperintense of T2 appearance, and mild enhancement played an important role in differentiating sinonasal IMT from malignancies.
