Juxta-articular osteoid osteomas as a cause of persistent pain of the shoulder, elbow and knee are presented basing on three own observations and a review of the literature. The sequence of the imaging examinations is equivalent to the osteoid osteomas in other localisations. CT permits a clear presentation of the nidus in the complex juxta-articular anatomy. Juxta-articular osteoid osteomas often show an absent or small perifocal osteosclerosis, whereas a laminar periosteal reaction was seen in all own cases.
