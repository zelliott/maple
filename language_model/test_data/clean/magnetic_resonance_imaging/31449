This case report highlights the need for detailed consideration of a patient's entire medical history before complex surgical management. This is a complex case of congenital urogenital anomaly that had obstetric complications. Our patient had a pelvic hematoma following a home birth, which was treated with pelvic artery embolization. We are fortunate to have local expertise in pelvic artery embolization and demonstrate excellent multidisciplinary management of a complex case.
