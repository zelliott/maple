An intracardiac tumour in an asymptomatic female infant was diagnosed by means of echocardiography and magnetic resonance. The natural history of this pathology in patients showing no symptoms of cardiac involvement is still unknown. The development of these modern diagnostic techniques, however, has made it easier to carry out longitudinal follow-up studies aimed at obtaining useful information about the prognosis and growth potentialities of these tumours.
