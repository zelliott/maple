Leiomyoma of the vagina is a very rare tumour of the lower urogenital tract. These slow-growing masses may be asymptomatic or present with pain, dyspareunia or urinary symptoms. Rarely, these tumours may present with life-threatening haemorrhage. These hypervascular tumours are treated by surgical excision. Preoperative embolization therefore may aid in devascularization of these tumours before surgical excision. We present the MRI features of a case of vaginal leiomyoma, which was managed by preoperative embolization and was then excised in toto. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report where preoperative embolization was performed before excision of a vaginal leiomyoma with minimal peroperative blood loss.
