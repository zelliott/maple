A 69-year-old man was referred to our department with gross hematuria. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the tumor directly invading the rectum. Biopsy of the tumor by transurethral resection demonstrated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level was normal. Because the tumor did not respond to hormonal therapy for a month, radical prostatectomy combined with rectal amputation was performed. Immunohistochemically, carcinoembryonic antigen was detected but PSA and prostatic acid phosphatase were not.
