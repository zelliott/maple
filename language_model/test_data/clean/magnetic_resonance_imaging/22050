Magnetic resonance imaging effectively defines and characterizes musculoskeletal pathologic lesions, particularly meniscal tears. Most studies comparing the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging and arthroscopic evaluation have been performed on high-field (1.5-T) systems. The effectiveness of a low-field (0.2-T), dedicated, extremity magnetic resonance imaging device in diagnosing meniscal tears was studied prospectively on 35 patients with knee symptoms who subsequently had arthroscopic evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging examinations were performed before surgery and were read by an experienced radiologist who was blinded to the results of the arthroscopic evaluations. Specificity was 100% for both the medial and lateral menisci. Sensitivity was 86% for the medial menisci, 89% for the lateral menisci, and 87% for both. Accuracy was 91% for the medial menisci, 97% for the lateral menisci, and 94% overall. The positive predictive values were 100% for the medial menisci, 100% for the lateral menisci, and 100% for both. The negative predictive values were 81% for the medial menisci, 96% for the lateral menisci, and 91% for both. The low-field magnetic resonance imaging system provided specificity and sensitivity that were equal to or better than previous reports with high-field systems. In particular, this low-field system eliminated the problem of false-positive results that has been found in some studies using high-field systems.
