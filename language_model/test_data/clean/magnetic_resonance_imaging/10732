Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) artifacts have been described in many articles published in the literature. We present the case of a 72 year old man who was admitted due to left inferior limb weakness. MRI imaging demonstrated an acute right infarction of the right posterior cerebral artery. In the right frontal lobe a metallic artifact was demonstrated as well. The artifact showed a central signal void and it was surrounded by a high signal intensity rim. His aortic valve had been replaced 12 years earlier. This indicates that the artifact is in fact due to a small metallic fragment embolization during cardiac surgery.
