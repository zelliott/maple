The goal of this study was to characterize the signal intensity (SI) pattern in the endolymphatic duct/sac from T2-weighted spin echo magnetic resonance (MR) images and T2*-weighted 3-dimensional (3-D) constructive interference in steady state (CISS) MR images that were obtained from a homogenous group of patients with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) associated with SLC264 (PDS) mutations.

A retrospective study.

Tertiary referral center.

Eleven subjects (22 ears), with at least 1 SLC26A4 mutation and bilateral EVA confirmed by temporal bone computed tomography, were enrolled.

The MR images of 22 ears were reviewed retrospectively.

The SI of the endolymphatic sac (ES) from 2 sequences were compared and reviewed. The presence of anomalies of the vestibule were also evaluated. In addition, the caloric test results were also reviewed to characterize the vestibular function in a subset of our cohort (12 ears).

T2*-weighted 3-D CISS MR images revealed a more variable SI in the enlarged endolymphatic system than did the T2-weighted images. There was a hierarchy for the order of SI loss from the endolymphatic system on the T2*-weighted 3-D CISS MR images. There were 3 cases where the SI loss from the intraosseous ES, on the T2*-weighted 3-D CISS images, was associated with an abnormal caloric response.

The SI of the ES observed on T2*-weighted 3-D CISS images of EVA patients, with SLC26A4 mutations, showed a distinctive pattern, and the results from this study suggest a potential role for the MR imaging in providing physicians with better information about the functional status of the inner ear.
