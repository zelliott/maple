The introduction of magnetic resonance imaging in spondyloarthritis constitutes the main improvement in imaging over the past two decades. X-rays remains the cornerstone of diagnosis, although magnetic resonance imaging is more sensitive in early stages of the disease. The primary advantage of magnetic resonance imaging is its ability to visualize soft tissue inflammation and inflammatory lesions within bone in three dimensions. Studies continue to appear describing its diagnostic utility, its sensitivity in early disease, its reliability, its predictive value for the detection of damage progression and its value in the assessment of certain complications. In this paper we review the characteristics of this imaging technique and the advantages and limitations of magnetic resonance imaging in spondyloarthritis.
