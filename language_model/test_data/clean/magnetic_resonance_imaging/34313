A case of a neurocytoma involving a nerve root of the cauda equina in a 46-year-old woman is reported. The patient presented with a 2-month history of progressive left lower-extremity weakness and pain and decreased ability to walk, as well as complaints of incomplete voiding. A magnetic resonance image revealed a 7-mm oval mass that was located intrathecally and extended from T-12 to L-1 and was adjacent to a nerve root. No lesions were identified at higher vertebral levels. The mass was excised. On histological examination it was found to have classical features of a neurocytoma. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a neurocytoma occurring in that region. A detailed histological description of this case and review of the pertinent literature are provided.
