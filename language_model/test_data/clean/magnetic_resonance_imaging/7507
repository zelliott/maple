The definite treatment of angiolymphoid hyperplasia is debatable. We report the case of a middle-aged man with an extensive angiolymphoid hyperplasia of the orbit that has been recalcitrant to multiple single-line treatments for 9 years. His previous treatment included several short courses of full-dose systemic steroids, debulking surgeries, and orbital radiotherapy. A stepwise multimodality treatment approach in this case could achieve a lasting satisfactory functional and cosmetic outcome.
