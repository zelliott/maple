A young male with adrenomyeloleukodystrophy (AMLD), diagnosed at the age of 25 years, presented with signs of bipolar affective disorder (BPD) concomitant with radiological findings of central demyelination. There was a marked deterioration of the earlier relatively benign neurological dysfunction, leading to fatal bulbar syndrome. The association of BPD with central demyelination in AMLD is in agreement with previously reported cases of this and other types of multifocal central demyelination diseases.
