A combined method of surgical treatment of glial tumors of the brain is proposed for decreasing risk of complications. The method includes microsurgical ablation of the main volume of the neoplasm and stereotaxic cryodestruction of the residual part of the tumor. Combined surgical treatment was used in 12 patients. The results obtained show that the proposed method elevates the efficacy of surgical method, facilitates increased indices of survival rate and maintenance of quality of life of the patients at the tolerant level.
