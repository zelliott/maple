To evaluate the usefulness of MR sequences for the differential diagnosis of spinal brucellar abscesses which mimic lumbar disc herniation.

We analyzed six patients with brucellar abscesses who had symptoms mimicking lumbar disc herniation. The study group consisted of three women and three men who were 15-67 (mean = 37) years old. Patients were imaged in the axial and sagittal planes with a I.0-T MR scanner using a spine coil.

The level of abscesses were accurate in 100% (six of six) of patients with MR imaging. MRI examinations revealed an extradural soft tissue mass which were iso- to hypointense compared to spinal cord on T1WI and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. By contrast study, diffuse homogeneous or slightly heterogeneous enhancements were seen.

Lumbar extradural brucellar abscess can have lumbar disc disease symptoms. MRI may non-invasively and rapidly reveal the presence of spinal abscess and degree of extension to the spinal canal. Extradural brucellar abscess should be included in the differential diagnosis of radicular symptoms caused by disc herniation.
