Exact localization of the spinal tumors is particularly important for differential diagnosis and surgery. Therefore, it was attempted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in localizing the spinal tumors exactly. Nineteen cases of spinal cord tumors, being localized in the intradural extramedullary, extradural and both intradural and extradural spaces, were studied with MRI. Intradural extramedullary tumors showed small CSF spaces just below and above the tumor which were demonstrated as CSF intensity on T1 and T2 weighted images. Although extradural tumors did not show CSF spaces, there was extradural sign or dural density between the tumor and the spinal cord. Intradural and extradural tumors were outlined as having both characteristics. Signal intensities of the spinal tumors were not characteristic for specific histology. Gd-DTPA was quite useful for accurate localization of the tumors. In comparison with myelography, MRI was superior to myelography in extradural tumors and equally useful for intradural and extradural tumors, but it was less diagnostic in intradural extramedullary tumors. In general, MRI was quite useful in localizing the spinal tumors exactly and the accuracy of MRI was quite high. In the near future this technique will replace myelography and other radiologic methods.
