We evaluated the relationship of corpus callosum atrophy and/or lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to functional hemispheric disconnection following closed head injury (CHI) in 51 pediatric patients, including mild CHI, moderate to severe CHI with extracallosal lesions, and moderate to severe CHI with callosal atrophy and/or lesions. Interhemispheric transfer of information was assessed using auditory, motor, tactile, and visual tests in patients and in 16 uninjured children. Total and regional callosal areas were measured from the midsagittal MRI slice by morphometry. The corpus callosum lesion group demonstrated a greater right ear advantage on verbal dichotic listening than all other groups. Areas of the posterior corpus callosum were negatively correlated with laterality indices of verbal dichotic listening performance and tachistoscopic identification of verbal material. The relationship of corpus callosum atrophy and/or lesions to asymmetry in dichotic listening is consistent with previous investigation of posttraumatic hemispheric disconnection effects in adults.
