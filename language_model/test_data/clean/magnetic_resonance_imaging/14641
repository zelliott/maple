This article addresses the current technique and protocols for magnetic resonance (MR) enterography, with a primary focus on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and a secondary detailed discussion of other diseases of the small bowel beyond IBD. A brief discussion of MR imaging for appendicitis is included, but the evaluation of appendicitis does not require an enterographic protocol. The focused key points and approach presented in this article are intended to enhance the reader's understanding to help improve patient compliance with the MR enterographic studies, overcome challenges, and improve interpretation.
