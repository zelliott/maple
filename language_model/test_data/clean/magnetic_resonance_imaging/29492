Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a condition with significant mortality and respiratory morbidity. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcome is not yet well documented.

The authors examined all cases of CDH at their institution over a 12-month period and performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain postoperatively.

Eight of 10 patients survived to have an MR brain scan. All 8 patients had cerebral injury detected on MRI, with a predominance of white matter and deep nuclear gray matter injury.

Cerebral injury detected with MRI is common in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The long-term significance of these MRI abnormalities is unknown, although the need for good long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up of infants with CDH is highlighted.
