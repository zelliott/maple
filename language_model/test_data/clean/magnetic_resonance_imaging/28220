Vaginal carcinoma makes up 1%-2% of all gynaecological tumours. Verrucous carcinoma of the vagina is even more rare--only 16 cases are reported in the scientific literature. A case of a complete regression after 60 Gy fractionated radiotherapy by a tumour 12 cm3 in size is reported. Most authors are of the opinion that radiotherapy causes anaplastic transformation of verrucous carcinoma. The minority view, that anaplastic transformation does not occur, is correct and is supported by our clinical and radiological data. The conflicting literature on vaginal verrucous carcinoma (VVC) is reviewed with reference to verrucous carcinoma at other sites.
