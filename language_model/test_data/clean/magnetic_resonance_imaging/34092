Focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) is being developed clinically for the non-invasive treatment of soft tissue tumours of the prostate, bladder, liver, kidney, muscle and breast. In the work described in this paper, the application of FUS is extended to investigate the potential to induce vascular occlusion, with the aim of applying the technique to problems in fetal medicine and oncology.

In this feasibility study the occlusion of femoral blood flow in vivo is demonstrated using an array of multiple single exposures of 1.7 MHz focused ultrasound. These were placed in two rows of four lesions at a focal depth of 5 mm. The 4660-W cm-2 (free field spatial peak intensity) 2-s exposures were placed 2 mm apart. Vascular patency was assessed using a Siemens Vision (1.5T) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging scanner with an extremity coil, and intravenous gadolinium contrast agent. FLASH and FISP MR sequences were used to obtain full 3D data sets providing information on soft tissue damage and perfusion.

Total vascular occlusion was achieved in four of nine cases and significant vascular disruption in five of nine cases. Refinement of the FUS technique and long-term studies are now indicated prior to initial clinical application in fetal medicine.
