28 patients with clinically confirmed head and neck tumours were examined by MRI. The results of a dynamic FLASH-2D sequence and a Gd-DTPA enhanced T1-weighted sequence were analysed and retrospectively compared with surgery and pathological findings. The extent of tumours was clearly defined by the dynamic technique in 21 cases. Furthermore, it was found to be superior for the purpose of demonstrating contrast behaviour and concerning T-classification. Here the dynamic FLASH-2D sequence proved to be an important supplement for preoperative diagnosis.
