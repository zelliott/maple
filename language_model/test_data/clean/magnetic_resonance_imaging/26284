Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are especially common in the younger athletic population. In 1998, more than 100,000 ACL reconstructions were performed. MR imaging examination has proved to be valuable in imaging and evaluating ACL reconstructions. This article reviews different surgical reconstruction procedures, indications for postoperative MR imaging, and the MR imaging appearance seen in routine ACL reconstructions and in complications associated with ACL reconstructions.
