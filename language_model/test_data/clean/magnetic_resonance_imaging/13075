Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is a monophasic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system involving the white matter, and to a lesser extent, the gray matter. Bilateral thalamic lesions have been reported in 12% of pediatric patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. In most cases, there is a benign clinical course and complete resolution of the lesions. Here, we describe a case in which acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is associated with severe neurological deficits and bilateral thalamic necrosis. Necrosis should be considered in cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis with persistent severe neurological deficits. Its presence is a poor prognostic indicator.
