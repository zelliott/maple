To assess the value of P760, a gadolinium chelate with slow interstitial diffusion and high relaxivity, for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of acute myocardial infarction in pigs.

First-pass gradient-echo MR imaging and spin-echo MR imaging were performed with P760 and then with gadoterate meglumine in eight pigs with occlusive acute myocardial infarction. P760 signal intensity enhancement and clearance were compared with those of gadoterate meglumine.

The first-pass enhancement ratio of P760 in normal myocardium was higher than that in infarcted myocardium (1.37 +/- 0.06 [SEM] vs 1.05 +/- 0.03, P = .03). The myocardial first pass showed a blood pool-like curve for P760. The blood pool enhancement ratio 40 seconds after injection was higher for P760 than for gadoterate meglumine (left ventricular cavity, 1.75 +/- 0.06 vs 1.45 +/- 0.06, P = .009). Spin-echo MR imaging showed improved contrast between normal and infarcted myocardium after P760 administration: The ratio before contrast material administration was 0.21 +/- 0.03, that at 15 minutes was 0.48 +/- 0.05 (P = .002), and that at 25 minutes was 0.47 +/- 0.07 (P = .003).

P760 is an MR imaging contrast agent characterized by low diffusion, a blood pool effect soon after low-dose administration, and fast elimination. This agent is useful for improved myocardial perfusion MR imaging of acute myocardial infarction.
