Using a small surface coil and limited field of view, the authors have generated 13 contiguous, 3 mm, transverse sections of the wrist of a cadaver. The identity of the structures recorded has been established by subsequent dissection of the cadaver. The article presents the 13 MR sections together with drawings identifying the recorded structures at each level. These anatomic sections are amplified by 7 transverse MR images showing alterations of the normal anatomy in clinical examples of wrist pathology.
