A new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent designed to mimic sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) and to target inflammation has been synthesized and characterized. The evolution of its proton longitudinal relaxivity as a function of the magnetic field (NMRD) and temperature has been studied. The exchange rate of the water coordinated to the metal has been assessed by oxygen-17 relaxometry. The transmetalation by zinc(II) ions and the noncovalent binding to human serum albumin have been evaluated. The results show no limitation by the residence time of the coordinated water molecule above room temperature, a higher stability of the complex versus transmetalation by zinc(II) ions than a parent complex, the clinically used Gd-DTPA-BMA, and negligible interaction with human serum albumin.
