Daclizumab is a monoclonal antibody specific for the IL-2R α chain (CD25). Daclizumab has been observed to have multiple mechanisms of action, which may contribute to beneficial effects in immune-related disease and particularly in relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). These include inhibition of activated immune cells, increase of regulatory natural killer cells, effects on dendritic cells, inhibition of innate lymphoid tissue inducer cells and altered responses involving IL-2 transpresentation. The antibody has shown considerable promise in open-label and early Phase II clinical trials when used as a monotherapy, or in combination with IFN-β. In recently completed randomized trials in RRMS, treatment with daclizumab monotherapy compared with placebo resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in relapses, active lesions on brain MRI and slowing of disability progression. A large Phase III trial in RRMS is ongoing.
