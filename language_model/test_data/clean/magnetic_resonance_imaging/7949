It has been described that hyperintensity in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) correlates with high-grade tumours, and high signal-intensity in T2-weighted (T2w) images identifies low-grade tumours. We aimed to investigate the potential of routine conventional MRI sequences, such as DWI and T2-w, to pre-operatively distinguish between low-grade and high-grade brain tumours in paediatric patients.

Two raters, blinded to the histological diagnosis, rated the aspect and signal intensity of MR images (T2w and DWI) from 37 children with newly diagnosed brain tumours. Histological diagnoses included 18 low-grade and 19 high-grade brain tumours.

The inter-rater agreement was 81-95%. High-grade tumours were never hypointense on DWI and low-grade tumours were usually hyperintense on T2w. Specificity was 100% for low-grade tumours and 90% for high-grade tumours. About 95% of the high-grade tumours and about 70% of the low-grade tumours were correctly diagnosed.

The combination of general morphological aspect of the tumours and signals on T2-w and DWI yield a high accuracy of pre-operative differentiation between low-grade and high-grade paediatric tumours.
