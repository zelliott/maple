The authors hypothesized that supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation in chronic cannabis users, studied 4 to 36 hours after their last episode of use, would disappear by Day 28 of abstinence during finger-tapping tests. Eleven cannabis users and 16 comparison subjects were scanned during right (RFT) and left (LFT) finger-tapping tasks on a GE 1.5 Tesla scanner retrofitted with a whole body echo planar coil. Image analyses were conducted in SPM99 using an ROI approach to define each Brodmann area (BA). Differences in cerebral activation were examined in the left and right primary motor cortex (BA4), SMA (BA6), and ACC (BA24 and BA32 separately). The authors found diminished activation for contralateral BA6 from Day 0 to Day 28. For LFT, the authors also found: ipsilaterally diminished BA6 activation on Day 7, but not Day 0 or Day 28; ipsilaterally diminished BA32 activation on Day 0, but not Day 7 or Day 28; contralaterally diminished BA 4 activation on Day 28, but not Day 0 or Day 7; and contralaterally diminished BA32 activation on Day 0 and Day 28, but not Day 7. For RFT, the authors found ipsilaterally diminished BA32 activation on Days 0 and 7 but not on Day 28; contralaterally diminished BA32 activation on Days 0, 7, and 28; and ipsilaterally diminished BA6 activation on Days 0, 7, and 28. These results suggest that residual diminished brain activation is still observed after discontinuing cannabis use in motor cortical circuits.
