Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has an expanding role as a preferred modality for the detection and characterization of myocardial viability.

Improving the accuracy of cardiac magnetic resonance for detecting viable myocardium has been one focus of investigators. In segments with intermediate transmurality of late gadolinium enhancement, dobutamine response improves the predictive power of cardiac magnetic resonance. A subtractive imaging technique with both short and long inversion times can enhance discrimination of subendocardial infarction and blood pool, but with increased noise and misregistration artifacts. Similar pharmacokinetics between cardiac magnetic resonance contrast agents and computed tomography contrast allows delayed enhancement imaging with computed tomography. Contrast between normal segments and scar remains vastly superior with cardiac magnetic resonance and no radiation is administered. Quantitation of blood flow demonstrated that resting myocardial blood flow is reduced in hibernating myocardium.

Because of its safety, accuracy, ease of interpretation, and increasing availability, cardiac magnetic resonance-based assessment of myocardial viability has quickly transitioned from bench to bedside. Routine clinical implementation has prompted improved diagnostic capabilities and easier image interpretation. As a research tool, cardiac magnetic resonance continues to provide valuable insights into the fundamental nature of viability.
