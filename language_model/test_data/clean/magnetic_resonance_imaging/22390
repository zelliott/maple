Identification of the lumbosacral (L-S) segment on magnetic resonance (MR) images is important for appropriate treatment of disease in the lumbosacral (L-S) area. In the study, data obtained from plain A-P radiographs of the L-S spine and sagittal MR imaging scans (sagittal T1- and T2-weighted sequences) of the L-S spine and sacrum with the coccygeal bone, are analyzed. Twenty-six children aged 10 to 14 years were examined for back pain. On the standard A-P radiographs of the L-S spine, a L-S transitional vertebra as classified according to the method of Castellvi et al. was found in 17 subjects. The problem arose as to whether this was lumbalisation or sacralisation, and how to determine which vertebra was L5 wich S1. On the sagittal MR imaging studies the same question applied. A need emerged for a simple method which would identify the L-S segment on the sagittal MR imaging studies of the L-S spine in children so that in case of a tumor, inflammation, spondilolystesis, or protrusion of a disc, the level in the L-S spine where the problem is localized can be accurately identified. To this objective we selected the method using detection of the S1 vertebra. This involved that, in addition to the sagittal MR imaging scans of the L-S spine, sagittal images of the sacrum and coccygeal bone be also obtained. on the T2-weighted sequence, the sacrum can be clearly distinquished from the coccygeal bone. By counting from the S5 up, the S1 vertebra can be accurately identified. Determination of the S1 vertebra enables detection of the L5 vertebra and, in turn, of all other lumbar vertebrae. In patients in whom a T2-weighted MR studies were done S1 could be precisely determined and so could the L5 vertebra. In this process, whether the patient had a transitional vertebra or whether there was lumbarisation or sacralisation was irrelevant.
