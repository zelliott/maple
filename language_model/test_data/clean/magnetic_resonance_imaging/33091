We report the case of a 44-year-old male patient with an aggressive silent corticotroph cell pituitary adenoma, subtype 2. In that it progressed to carcinoma despite temozolomide administration, anti-VEGF therapy was begun. MRI, PET scan and pathologic analysis were undertaken. After 10 months of anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) treatment no progression of the lesion was noted. The tumor was biopsied and morphological analysis showed severe cell injury, vascular abnormalities and fibrosis. Bevacizumab treatment has continued for additional 16 months to present with stabilization of disease as documented on serial MRI and PET scans. This is the first case of a bevacizumab-treated pituitary carcinoma with long-term, now 26 months, control of disease. The present findings are promising in that anti-angiogenic therapy appears to represent a new option in the treatment of aggressive pituitary tumors.
