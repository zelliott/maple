Diagnosis criteria of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been recently reconsidered, introducing the possibility to validate temporal dissemination with the use of MRI. In fact, MRI parameters may be considered as reflecting the biological activity of MS. MRI is used to monitor treatment in clinical trials. However, and except for particular circumstances, its use in routine follow-up of patients with MS is not recommended, because of weak correlations with clinical disability and technical difficulties of such follow-up.
