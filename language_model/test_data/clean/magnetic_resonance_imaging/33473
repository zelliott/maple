A technique is described that provides improved reproducibility of breath-holding for MR image acquisition by monitoring the superior-inferior (S/I) position of the diaphragm. The method incorporates detection of the level of inspiration using an MR signal, rapid display to the patient of diaphragm position to enable breath-hold adjustment, and triggering of image data acquisition once appropriate position is attained. The response time of the system is short, approximately 10 ms. Studies in six volunteers using this method demonstrate a considerable decrease in the S/I range of diaphragm position over 10 consecutive periods of suspended respiration. The mean range is 1.3 mm with the system, while it is 8.3 mm without using it. It is expected that this method will be of assistance in many abdominal and cardiothoracic studies that use breath-hold techniques.
