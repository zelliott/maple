Optic neuritis (ON) is a rare association of Q fever. We report the first case of ON associated with Q fever in Australia and review all previously reported cases in the medical literature. The impact of therapy with antibiotics and steroids on outcome is discussed. Q fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with apparent acute idiopathic ON.
