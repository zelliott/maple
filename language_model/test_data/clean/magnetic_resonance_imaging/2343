MT makes it possible to characterize tissue destruction in several CNS diseases, including AIDS-related diseases such as PML or HIV encephalitis. MR may be helpful in establishing diagnosis, disease burden, prognosis, and therapeutic efficacy. MT may also contribute to the investigation of the natural history of the diseases. The other application is in improving contrast after the injection of gadolinium chelates. This contrast improvement can be achieved routinely on any device and may be a good alternative to other methods, such as increasing dose or delay.
