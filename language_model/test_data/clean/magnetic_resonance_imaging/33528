Three patients with Gaucher's disease who underwent partial splenectomy have been followed for 3, 7 3/4, and 8 1/2 years. All have had significant regrowth of the the splenic remnant and some recurrence of hypersplenism. A review of all previously reported cases also substantiates the recurrence of splenomegaly and hypersplenism. Among new options for the therapy of Gaucher's disease, enzyme replacement therapy (Ceredase) holds great promise for effective treatment.
