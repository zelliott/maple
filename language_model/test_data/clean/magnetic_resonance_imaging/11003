Mylohyoid herniation of the sublingual gland has been a frequent finding at dissection of adult human cadavers and at retrospective studies of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the floor of the mouth. Even so, very few clinical reports exist. The present report describes an adolescent boy with a suspected submental tumour, which at MRI was shown to be caused by a mylohyoid hernia of part of an enlarged, but otherwise normal sublingual gland.
