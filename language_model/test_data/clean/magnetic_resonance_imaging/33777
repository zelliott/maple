Until recently the diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri has been made on postmortem examination. This article reviews the use of serial magnetic resonance imaging studies to suggest premorbid diagnosis of this condition. The following is a case report of a 14-year-old female who had a subtotal cortical resection of tumor and several years later developed a progressive dementia. At postmortem examination the diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri was made. Diffuse progressive white matter changes involving both hemispheres and brainstem, with increased thickness of the corpus callosum and without changes in cortical markings on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images, in this patient were highly suggestive of the diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri.
