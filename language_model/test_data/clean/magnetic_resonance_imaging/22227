In this report, a procedure to optimize inversion-recovery times, in order to minimize the uncertainty in the measured T1 from 2-point multislice images of the human brain at 4.1 T, is discussed. The 2-point, 40-slice measurement employed inversion-recovery delays chosen based on the minimization of noise-based uncertainties. For comparison of the measured T1 values and uncertainties, 10-point, 3-slice measurements were also acquired. The measured T1 values using the 2-point method were 814, 1361, and 3386 ms for white matter, gray matter, and cerebral spinal fluid, respectively, in agreement with the respective T1 values of 817, 1329, and 3320 ms obtained using the 10-point measurement. The 2-point, 40-slice method was used to determine the T1 in the cortical gray matter, cerebellar gray matter, caudate nucleus, cerebral peduncle, globus pallidus, colliculus, lenticular nucleus, base of the pons, substantia nigra, thalamus, white matter, corpus callosum, and internal capsule.
