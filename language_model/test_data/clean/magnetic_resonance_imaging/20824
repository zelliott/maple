Migraine has been found to be associated with patent foramen ovale. However, in practice, it is difficult to show that microemboli via patent foramen ovale can induce a migraine attack. Our patient showed transient sulcal hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images during a migraine attack. This supports the hypothesis that microemboli via right-to-left shunt may induce migraine attacks through transient occlusion of microcirculation.
