A method of 31P FLASH NMR imaging is described using a low flip angle excitation pulse and three-dimensional Fourier transform spectroscopic imaging (3DFT). In vivo high-resolution 31P NMR spectra are obtained for each of 32 x 32 image elements using a minimum measuring time of 1.5 min. 31P FLASH images of a rat showing the spatial distribution of phosphocreatine, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-ATP have been measured in a 4.7-T magnet with a spatial resolution of 6 mm.
