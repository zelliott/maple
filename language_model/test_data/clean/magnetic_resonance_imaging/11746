Visual and somatosensory evoked potentials are useful to identify patients at increased risk for developing Multiple sclerosis (MS). However Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is more sensitive and predictive. More studies are needed to determine the optimal sequence of evoked potentials and MRI that best predict the development of MS especially in monosymptomatic manifestations and in primary progressive MS.
