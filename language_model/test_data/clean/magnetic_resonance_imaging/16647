We report an extremely rare case of extramedullary plasmacytoma.

Case report and review of the English-literature concerning extramedullary plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma.

We present an unusual case of multiple extramedullary plasmacytomas, which, over a protracted course of 30 years, presented on different occasions at three separate sites in the head and neck. The patient was managed surgically on all occasions, and was disease-free at the time of writing.

Following review of the literature, we believe this to be the only case with this extremely unusual presentation. This case is noteworthy, not only because of the rarity of extramedullary plasmacytoma, but also because it highlights a number of important clinical issues. The diagnosis and management of extramedullary plasmacytoma require close cooperation between multiple disciplines.
