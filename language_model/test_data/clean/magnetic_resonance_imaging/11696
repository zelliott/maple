To evaluate the significance of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination (DRE), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as guide to perform prostate needle biopsy.

One hundred forty-eight patients suspicious of prostate neoplasm were undergone transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsy. The pathologic diagnosis was analyzed in association with the results of PSA, DRE, TRUS and MRI in various combinations.

The positive rate of biopsy was 43.9%. While abnormal DRE or PSA contributed in the detection of prostate cancer, serum PSA became more reliable when combined with DRE, TRUS or MRI, but the contribution of each of the three diagnostic procedures was not significantly different. The sensitivity of MRI was higher than that of DRE or TRUS, whereas TRUS was more specific than PSA or MRI.

RE and PSA can be used for preliminary screening of prostate cancer. When combined with TRUS and MRI, the positive rate of diagnosis is increased. So is the specificity of the diagnosis which helps avoid unnecessary needle biopsy.
