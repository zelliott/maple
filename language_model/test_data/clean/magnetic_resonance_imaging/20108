Although a transient lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) has been reported predominantly regarding patients with epilepsia, it is of rare occurrence, and its underlying biological basis remains unknown. This is a report of an SCC lesion in a patient with anorexia nervosa (AN).

The patient was a 15-year-old girl with childhood-onset (11 years) and a protracted course of AN. On admission, the patient showed no apparent neurological abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed a circumscribed lesion in the SCC. We treated her with nutritional rehabilitation supplemented with B vitamins.

One month later, the lesion completely disappeared, but her weight was not restored.

Treatment with B-vitamin supplementation may be beneficial for the treatment of patients with AN, in cases in which the disorder develops at an early age before brain maturation (i.e., childhood-onset cases), along with an enduring course of malnutrition.
