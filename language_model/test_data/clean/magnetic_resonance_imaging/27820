An 11-year-old girl presented with sudden sensory disturbance and left-sided muscle weakness. MRI revealed ischaemic change in the right lateral thalamus and the right internal capsule. During sonographic work-up of the cervical arteries, inflammation of the thyroid gland was noted. The results of the thyroid function tests and antibody titers confirmed Hashimoto thyroidits. Under high-dose corticosteroids, the girl had a full neurological recovery.
