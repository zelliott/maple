The major problem in MRI of the esophagus is the lack of a reliable oral contrast agent. To determine the value of Gd-DTPA as an oral contrast medium for the esophagus as a part of phase III clinical trial, 17 patients (10 esophageal neoplasms, 4 neoplasms of the pharyngo-laryngeal tract, 3 Zenker's diverticula) underwent MRI. The oral contrast medium is proposed in a new preparation: 5 cc of oral Gd-DTPA were emulsionated with 30 g of a low-density barium paste for esophageal CT (3% p/v). High signal intensity in the esophageal lumen was observed in all patients and in all sequences. In neoplastic lesions, the c.m. improved the definition of both the level of stenosis and the longitudinal extent of the lesion. In diverticula, the real and the false lumen could be demonstrated. In one patient the exam could not be completed. No adverse reactions were observed.
