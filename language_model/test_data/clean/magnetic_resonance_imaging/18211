Aim of this study is to present the most common diagnostic pitfalls in the diagnostics of wrist MRI. Wrist MRI was performer in 30 healthy individuals, with no history of wrist inflammation or wrist trauma. Particular attention was returned to intraosseous blood vessels and ligaments. If they were bigger than 2mm it was called "pseudo-erosion". In 13% of examined wrist we noted "pseudo-erosion". Intraosseous blood vessel canals were visible in all individuals, most commonly in capitate and lunate bones. Evaluation of MR images of wrist requires thorough training in interpretation of MR images. It is necessary to correlate the MRI findings with laboratory examinations and a clinical interview for minimizing the risk of misinterpretation.
