Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is a rare condition that often manifests as central precocious puberty (CPP). There is a lack of information available concerning the long-term effectiveness of surgery for the treatment of CPP due to HH. Here the authors describe 3 cases of CPP due to HH, with a follow-up ranging from 9 to 11 years after surgery. Three girls experienced breast growth and menses at 5-18 months of age and 5-36 months of age, respectively. Serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol concentrations ranged from 2.5 to 6.5 mIU/ml, 4.8-5.9 mIU/ml, and 47.9-133.0 pg/ml, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed that CPP was caused by HH. Lesions were resected using a right pterional approach. After surgery, endocrine hormone concentrations were normalized, breasts shrunk, and menses ceased in each patient. Moreover, all of them subsequently developed normally and experienced age-appropriate onset of puberty. Each patient's height and weight were normal at the most recent follow-up (9-11 years after surgery), and none had experienced learning difficulties. Central precocious puberty due to HH can be successfully treated with resection. In the 3 cases presented, this approach was associated with both short- and long-term efficacy.
