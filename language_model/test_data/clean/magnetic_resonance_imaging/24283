Highly cross-linked and biocompatible poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4'-sulfonyldiphenol) (PZS) were used to directly coat hydrophilic superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles by a facile but effective one-pot polycondensation. The obtained core-shell Fe3O4@PZS nanohybrids were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction spectra. Interesting, the size and T2 relaxivity of Fe3O4@PZS increased with increasing the mass ratio of Fe3O4 to PZS. All these nanohybrids could be internalized by HeLa cells but show negligible cytotoxicity. The PZS layer slowly degraded into less dangerous forms such as 4,4'-sulfonyldiphenol, phosphate and ammonia at neutral or acid atmosphere. Considering their excellent water dispersibility, colloidal and chemical stability, magnetic manipulation, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) properties, Fe3O4@PZS nanohybrids have great potential in MRI diagnosis of cancer.
