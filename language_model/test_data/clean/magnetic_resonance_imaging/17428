Predicting acute vascular events in vulnerable patients requires new strategies: biomarkers and imaging are among the major options. Adding perfusion and viability data to anatomical informations with MRI, isotopes or MSCT, will dramatically impact on our decisions to diagnose atherosclerotic patients. The present combination of MSCT scanners with PET or conventional scintigraphy enlarges capabilities of calcium scoring and coronary angiography to perfusion imaging. But MSCT alone, easy, accurate and conspicuous, already changed the face of daily practice in cardiology. Screening of very high risk populations and plaque imaging now are under clinical investigations.
