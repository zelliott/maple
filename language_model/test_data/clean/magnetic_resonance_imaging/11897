A 65-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to hospital because of exertional dyspnea. Transthoracic echocardiography showed diffuse hypokinesis of the left-sided ventricular wall, but was not clear enough to provide useful information because of the rotation of the cardiac apex and the presence of lung tissue. Systemic ventriculography showed that the left-sided ventricle with heavy trabeculations was morphologically similar to a normal right ventricle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) clearly revealed corrected transposition of the great arteries. Because this patient had no severe associated cardiac anomalies, systemic ventricular dysfunction is thought to be the major cause of exertional dyspnea. MRI is a useful non-invasive method for the rapid evaluation of cardiac morphology.
