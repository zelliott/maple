Fracture/dislocation is uncommonly reported in ankylosing spondylitis involving the lumbosacral spine.

We report an 18-month follow-up of a case of neurologically unstable traumatic fracture of the lumbosacral spine in ankylosing spondylitis.

Posterior decompression, alar-transverse fusion and instrumentation were performed. Anterior diskectomy and fusion were done 6 weeks later. There was solid bony fusion on follow-up and the patient had improvement of 2 Frankel grades and was able to ambulate.

Combined approaches and longer fixations to stabilise the spine may be required. In the lumbosacral spine, this poses a problem vis-Ã -vis limited levels of fixation in the sacrum.
