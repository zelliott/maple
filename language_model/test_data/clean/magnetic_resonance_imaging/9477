Schwannoma is a neurogenic neoplasm rarely found in the sinonasal tract. It is a benign tumor arising from the sheath of myelinated nerve fibers that may occur in any part of the body. Its diagnosis and treatment can pose certain challenges.

A 35-year-old woman presented to the senior surgeon with a nasal tip tumor that had been developing for almost 10 years. Ultrasound showed edema of the nose because of multiple solid nodes. The computed tomography (CT) scan did not show invasion of the bony framework around the tumor (maxilla, septum, nasal bones). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a deviation of the septum and well-defined round nodes at the nasal tip with a thick layer of skin around them. Resection of the tumor was performed using open rhinoplasty.

The limits of the excision were free of tumor, and histologic analysis of the tumor showed the characteristics of a schwannoma. At this writing, 2 years postoperatively, the patient is free of recurrence.

Schwannoma of the nasal tip is a benign tumor that gradually causes aesthetic and functional disorders. Radiologic examinations can assist in its diagnosis. The treatment is surgical excision and histologic analysis of the specimen.
