In cervical squamous cell carcinoma, solitary metastasis to and recurrence in the parenchyma of the spleen are uncommon in the absence of apparent disease in other sites. A case of a 50-year-old patient with a Stage IIa carcinoma of the cervix treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy followed by radiotherapy is reported. Serial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) antigen measurements have been performed for monitoring the course of disease, response to treatment, and detection of tumor recurrence. Recurrent disease was initially suspected on the basis of an elevated SCC level, 7.11 microg/ml (normal, < 1.5 microg/ml), subsequently confirmed by computed tomographic scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography of the abdomen and pelvis. Laparoscopic splenectomy followed by chemotherapy with cisplatin was performed. The SCC antigen level was within normal limits postoperatively. The patient was well and clinically free of disease for 5 months.
