We report on a case of thymic hypoplasia (DiGeorge syndrome) associated with tetralogy of Fallot in a newborn. The diagnosis was established on the basis of echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and surgical observations. In this paper, we emphasize that MRI may be used not only to characterize cardiovascular anomalies, but to diagnose thymic hypoplasia.
