A two-dimensional, flow-enhanced gradient echo pulse sequence for nuclear magnetic resonance angiography is described. It employs interleaved, presaturated slices to acquire data efficiently on imagers which favor interleaved acquisition over sequential acquisition for multislice imaging. It is useful on any imagers when the effective TR is extended to enhance the sensitivity to slow flow. The technique was applied to the region from aortic bifurcation to the iliac bifurcations of three normal volunteers. The right and left common iliac arteries and veins, the separation of the external and internal iliac arteries, and secondary branches were clearly depicted.
