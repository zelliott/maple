A 16-year-old adolescent boy presented with headache, dizziness, loss of consciousness, and a tonic-clonic seizure after heading a soccer ball in a competitive match. A computed tomographic scan of the head revealed an acute subdural hematoma with a mass effect. The patient was emergently referred to a tertiary care facility where he eventually recovered completely with conservative care. No predisposing medical conditions were found. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an intracranial hemorrhage secondary to the heading of a soccer ball alone in an otherwise healthy child without any underlying predisposing central nervous system abnormalities.
