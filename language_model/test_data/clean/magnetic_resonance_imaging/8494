The spring ligament complex is essential for the stability of the longitudinal arch of the foot and includes the ligaments between the calcaneus and the talus at the superomedial to inferoplantar aspect of the foot. Tears of the spring ligament complex are most commonly degenerative in etiology and secondary to concomitant abnormality of the posterior tibial tendon. We report MRI findings in a 30-year-old man who presented with traumatic rupture of the spring ligament complex, seen following dislocation of the talonavicular joint. We also describe the previously unreported MRI features of talo-cuboid impaction secondary to disruption of the spring ligament complex.
