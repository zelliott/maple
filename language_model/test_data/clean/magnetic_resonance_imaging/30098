Cranium bifidum is an unusual lesion in newborns. The majority of previously reported cases have described enlarged parietal foramina with some scalp and other congenital abnormalities. In this report the authors present the first case of complete cranium bifidum without any other anomaly. The cranial defect persisted for 3 years during the follow-up period. No hereditary or familial transition has been observed. The authors conclude that such an extremely rare occurrence of complete cranium bifidum may be a result of a coincidental mutation.
