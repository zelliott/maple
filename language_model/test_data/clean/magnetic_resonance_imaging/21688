We present a case of duodenal leiomyosarcoma studied with computerized tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Some differential diagnostic remarks are mentioned. The topographic abilities of MR to determine the exact origin of the tumor are stressed. A stellar "scar", hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2-weighted images (1 Tesla) in association with gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma was, at least to the best of our knowledge, never mentioned before in the literature.
