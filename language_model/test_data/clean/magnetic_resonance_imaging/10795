We performed blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MR imaging in 11 children younger than 5 y of age and 10 children older than 5 y of age. All but five of the children in the older age group were tested under light anesthesia. We examined the cerebral oxidative metabolism (CMRO(2)) associated with the processing of a flashed and a reversing checkerboard stimulus. These stimuli had been shown in a previous study to induce identical vascular responses. The reversing checkerboard activated twice the neuronal population of the flashed checkerboard, doubling the CMRO(2) associated with it. We compared the extent of activation for the positive BOLD response and found that it did not differ between the different age groups. We estimated the oxidative metabolism by examining the change in the local deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) concentration using Delta R2*. Because both stimuli induced the same vascular response, any increase in oxygen requirement would have to be met by the identical blood volume. Increasing CMRO(2) will therefore result in an increase in the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), which raises the local HbR concentration. In the younger children, both checkerboard stimuli produced identical, high HbR concentrations. In the older children, the HbR concentration to the flashed stimulus was significantly lower than to the reversing stimulus. We conclude that, for identical stimuli, the oxidative energy requirement associated with the cortical processing is higher in young children than in older children because the presence of superfluous synaptic connections in the immature visual system activates a larger neuronal population.
