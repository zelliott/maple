To estimate central visual field (30 degrees) of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (SM). SM was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging.

There was no posterior optic neuritis in the history of the disease. The visual acuity of examined the 28 eyes was 1,0. The results of static perimetry were analysed by regression analysis.

There were significant relationships between mean sensitivity (MS) and duration of the disease, stage of the disease (in Kurtzke gradation scale) and age. Mean defect (MD) was significantly higher in the upper half of central visual field and between 15-30 degrees (p < 0.05). We observed positive relationships between MD, short time fluctuation (STF) and corrected loss variance (CLV). We found negative correlations between MS, MD, CLV and STF. Mean reliability factor RF was < 10%.

Static perimetry seems to be a useful test in early diagnosis and monitoring of optic nerve neuropathy in SM.
