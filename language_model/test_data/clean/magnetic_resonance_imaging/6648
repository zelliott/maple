Accurate preoperative depiction of biliary anatomy is not always adequately accomplished by imaging techniques in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). We present the results of a prospective study designed to evaluate the ability of mangafodipir trisodium (Mn-DPDP)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography (MRC) for this purpose in a series of 25 adult living liver donors (LLDs). We also analyze if a simple or a more complex surgical procedure can be preoperatively suggested for biliary reconstruction in the recipients. Findings on MRC were compared with operative cholangiography (OC). A conventional distribution with a right hepatic duct (RHD) longer than 1 cm anticipated a simple procedure (duct-to-duct anastomosis or hepaticojejunostomy [HJ]). A shorter RHD or any variant were predictors of a more complex surgery (bench ductoplasty or multiple anastomoses). Agreement between MRC and OC in assessing the biliary anatomy was measured using the kappa statistic, and differences between the kind of surgery predicted at MRC and the biliary anastomosis performed were evaluated with Fisher's exact test. Normal variants were present in 16 / 25 donors (64%). MRC was accurate in depicting the pattern of bile duct distribution observed at OC in 22 / 25 (88%) donors (kappa = .831), and correctly predicted the complexity of biliary anastomosis in the recipient in 22 / 25 (88%) donors. No significant differences were observed between complexity of biliary surgery proposed at MRC and the final surgery performed (P = .002). In conclusion, Mn-DPDP-enhanced MRC is highly accurate in depicting the biliary duct anatomy and can be used preoperatively for surgical planning in LDLT.
