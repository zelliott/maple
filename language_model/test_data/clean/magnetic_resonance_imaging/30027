Aerococcus viridans is a microaerophilic, Gram-positive, catalase-negative coccus, found singly or in tetrads. To date, no case of spondylodiscitis due to this organism has been reported. We report what we believe to be the first case of spondylodiscitis caused by A. viridans, in a patient with decompensated liver failure, and discuss the possible pathogenesis of this rather uncommon pathogen in this case.
