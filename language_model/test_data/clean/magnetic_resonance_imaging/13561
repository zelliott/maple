Two cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, with metastases to the skull base, pituitary gland, sphenoid sinus, and cavernous sinus are reported. Patients presented with diplopia, retro-orbital headache, and multiple cranial nerves palsies. Pituitary metastases may require surgery as palliative treatment, and for the confirmation of histology. One of the current cases was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma prior to transphenoidal resection of the pituitary metastasis. The second patient was found to have hepatocellular carcinoma after review of histology, and the development of signs and symptoms relating to the primary tumour.
