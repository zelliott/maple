The aims of this study were to determine fractional anisotropy (FA) and the fibre density index (FDi) in the cervical spinal cord of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) by using diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) to identify possible differences between MS patients and controls.

We studied 27 patients with MS - nine with primary progressive (PPMS), nine with secondary progressive (SPMS) and nine with relapsing-remitting (RRMS) disease - and 18 healthy individuals as controls. Conventional and DTI sequences with diffusion gradients applied in 32 directions were obtained. The results were compared between healthy controls and patients, between healthy controls and individual forms of MS and between the three forms of MS. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t test.

The FDi in the three subgroups of patients and in controls showed a statistically significant difference. Using the t test, we found results from both PPMS and SPMS groups were different from controls. The correlation between FA and FDi was significant both in healthy controls and in MS patients evaluated as a single group.                                CONSLUCIONS:                  Despite the small group of patients, these findings suggest that FDi associated with FA is a sensitive parameter for assessing spinal cord damage in patients with MS.
