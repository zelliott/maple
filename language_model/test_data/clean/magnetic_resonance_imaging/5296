To elucidate the associations between Lp(a) levels and coronary and aortic atherosclerosis, we performed aortic MRI in 143 patients undergoing coronary angiography. Severity of aortic atherosclerosis was represented as plaque scores. Of the 143 patients, 104 had coronary artery disease (CAD). Thoracic and abdominal aortic plaques were found in 89 and 131 patients. Lp(a) levels increased stepwise with the number of stenotic coronary vessels: 15.7 (CAD(-)), 21.2 (1-vessel), 21.4 (2-vessel), and 22.9 mg/dl (3-vessel) (P<0.05). For aortic atherosclerosis, 143 patients were divided into quartiles by plaque scores. Lp(a) did not differ among quartiles of thoracic plaques: 17.1, 19.0, 23.5, and 21.2 mg/dl (P=NS), whereas Lp(a) increased stepwise with quartiles of abdominal plaques: 17.1, 19.2, 19.1, and 24.0 mg/dl (P<0.05). Lp(a) was an independent factor for CAD and abdominal aortic plaques, but not thoracic plaques. Thus, Lp(a) levels were associated with aortic atherosclerosis, especially in abdominal aorta, as well as coronary atherosclerosis.
