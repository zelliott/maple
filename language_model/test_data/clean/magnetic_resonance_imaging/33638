The T1 and T2 of kidneys in 5 normal volunteers and 27 patients with renal tumors were evaluated preoperatively using a magnetic resonance imager with a 0.1 T resistive electromagnet, and the T1 and T2 of the renal tumors were compared with the pathological findings: (i) the T1 and T2 of the normal renal medulla were longer than those of the normal renal cortex and psoas muscle; (ii) both T1 and T2 of renal pelvic cancer (RPC) were shorter than those of renal cell cancer (RCC, p < 0.05); (iii) the T2 values of RPC were significantly shorter than those of renal medulla (p < 0.01); (iv) the T1 and T2 of the normal renal cortex of subjects < 50 years old were shorter than those of subjects > or = 50 years old (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). These findings suggest that preoperative evaluation of the pathological findings of renal tumors may be possible by calculating the relaxation time using MRI under low magnetic field.
