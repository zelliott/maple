To investigate the value of CT and MRI as preoperative imaging technique for cochlear implant candidates.

Axial high-resolution temporal bone CT and T2-weighted FSE-MRI were performed in 26 patients with sensorineural hearing loss. Three-dimensional reconstruction of inner ear was compared between CT and MRI.

There were 1 case (2 ears) with Mondini malformation type I , 1 case (2 ears)with Mondini malformation type II , 1 case (2 ears) with inner fibrosis in 18 patients with congenital sensorineural hearing loss. There were 1 case (2 ears) with chronic suppurative otitis meadia, 1 case (2 ears) with inner ossification in 5 patients with postlingually deafness.

CT plays an indispensable role in evaluation of cochlear implantation. T2-weighted FSE-MRI is necessarily complementary to CT. MRI three-dimensional reconstruction of inner ear is better than CT.
