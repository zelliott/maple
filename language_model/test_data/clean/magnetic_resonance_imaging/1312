Seventy-one patients with lung tumors were studied by thoracic Ultra-low field MRI (L-MRI) and the efficacy of L-MRI is evaluated as compared with the dynamic CT scan. In staging of lung cancer, L-MRI is not useful because of its poor spatial resolution. Both T1 (Inversion recovery) and T2 (long SE) weighted images can differentiate secondary atelectasis from central tumors in 15 out of 18 (78%). This sensitivity is almost equal as that of dynamic CT. IR images with short inversion time (STIR) are particularly useful for their differentiation.
