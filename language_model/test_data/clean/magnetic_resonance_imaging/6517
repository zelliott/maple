The authors studied 32 patients to delineate the reliability of well-defined but frequently extended indications to define the ideal patient who will benefit from convex growth arrest. Mean age at the time of convex growth arrest was 29 (range 6-72) months, and average follow-up was 40 (24-120) months. Mean Cobb angle was 55 degrees (31-105 degrees) before surgery and 50 degrees (13-107 degrees) at final follow-up. Thirteen patients (41%) had a true epiphysiodesis effect, while 15 (47%) had fusion and 4 (12%) had progression. The age at surgery, magnitude, length and location of the curve, presence of intraspinal anomaly, and presence of sagittal plane or rib deformity were investigated in terms of the outcome, but none of these parameters was found to have an effect on the outcome. In conclusion, convex growth arrest is a safe and effective method in the management of the young patients with congenital spinal deformities. It can be performed for the balanced and cosmetically acceptable deformities of patients younger than 5 years of age regardless of the type, length, magnitude, and location of the curve, the existence of associated rib fusion, or the presence of sagittal plane abnormality.
