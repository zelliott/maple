Gangliogliomas are common in childhood, but rare in infancy. The authors report a rare case of ganglioglioma who had an initial episode of complex partial seizure in infancy. A two-year-old girl was admitted for the surgical treatment of intractable seizures. She presented with an annual episode of seizure at two months old. The CT scan at 2 months old showed a light high-density tumor in the left medial temporal lobe. However, she had no treatment because she had no seizure since then and her psychomotor development was normal. She was treated with anticonvulsants from 1 year and 10 months old since seizures recurred. She was admitted to our ward at 2 years old because the frequency of seizures increased. Plain CT on admission showed an enlarged high density mass in left medial temporal lobe. The T1 weighted images of MRI demonstrated the mass to be isointense compared with the cortex, with homogeneously contrast enhancement. Total removal of the tumor was performed and histological diagnosis was ganglioglioma. She is seizure-free after surgery and synaptophysin was useful for the histological diagnosis. This case may indicate that gangliogliomas can be a congenital brain tumor which slowly enlarges.
