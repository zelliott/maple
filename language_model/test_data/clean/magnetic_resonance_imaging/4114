A 14-year-old dog developed an acute onset of depression, disorientation, left hemiparesis,left hemianopia, left facial hypoesthesia, and a tendency to turn to the right. Based on these findings, a lesion affecting the right forebrain was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass within the right cerebral hemisphere resulting in compression of the right lateral ventricle and shifting the longitudinal fissure to the left. The lesion was hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense with focal regions of hypointensity on proton density-, and T2-weighted images, consistent with a subacute hemorrhage. At necropsy, there was a hematoma in the parietal portion of the right cerebral hemisphere. The hemorrhage was surrounded by numerous thin-walled veins, most likely a venous malformation. Magnetic resonance imaging of intracranial hemorrhage is reviewed.
