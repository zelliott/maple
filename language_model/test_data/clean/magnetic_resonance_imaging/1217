Symptomatic rheumatoid pachymeningitis is a rare extra-articular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical symptoms are non-specific and diagnosis is frequently made by exclusion. We present a 61-year-old woman with a 9-year history of rheumatoid arthritis presenting with deafness and progressive disability over a two month duration. She was diagnosed as having rheumatoid pachymeningitis based on the cerebral magnetic resonance imaging findings.
