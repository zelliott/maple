Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) and extrapontine myelinolysis (EPM) are well recognized syndromes related to rapid correction of hyponatremia and have been reported to show a variety of movement disorders. However, sequential observation of movement disorders as well as brain images has seldom been reported. We report a case of CPM and EPM presenting with various sequential changes in movement disorders including delayed choreic movement over 11 months; we present sequential brain magnetic resonance images showing increased T1 and decreased fat-suppression T1 signal intensity. We suggest that delayed low signal intensity, in the fat-suppression T1-weighted images, is a result of the destruction of myelin and by products. Damage to the myelin may cause various movement disorders in a delayed manner.
