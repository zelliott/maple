Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is known for its slow-growing but severely infiltrative nature with little tissue reaction. Although the masticatory muscles are often involved, their imaging features have not been well elucidated. We hereby report three patients with widespread ACC, which initially appeared with trismus and/or temporomandibular symptoms and involved the masticator space. Possible features of masticator space involvement are presented on magnetic resonance (MR) images. Masticatory muscle changes on MR images consisted of two aspects, namely, denervation changes and direct tumour invasion.
