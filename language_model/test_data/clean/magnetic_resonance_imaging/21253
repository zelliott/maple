The major aim of this paper is to review the present status of the techniques for the non-invasive imaging and quantification of insulin-producing pancreatic islet β-cells. Emphasis is placed on both the expansion of prior work already considered in a prior review and novel achievements. Thus, the use of d-mannoheptulose analogs, hypoglycemic sulfonylureas and glinides, neural imaging agents, neuro-hormonal receptor ligands and nanoparticles is first dealt with. Thereafter, consideration is given on optical imaging technologies, the identification of new β-cells specific binding and target proteins, the functional imaging of islets transplanted into the eye anterior chamber and in vivo manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.
