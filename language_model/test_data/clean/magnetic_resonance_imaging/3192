The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of transvaginal US (TVUS), CT, and MRI in detecting deep myometrial invasion in endometrial carcinoma.

Twenty-six patients with endometrial carcinoma were evaluated with TVUS, CT, and MRI. The depth of myometrial invasion was estimated in each examination. The invasion depth was categorized into no/superficial and deep and was compared to surgical and pathologic findings.

At pathologic examination, the depth of myometrial invasion was no/superficial in 16 patients and deep in 10. The accuracy/sensitivity/specificity of TVUS, CT, and MRI in detecting deep myometrial invasion were 69/50/81, 61/40/75, and 89%/90%/88%, respectively. The sensitivity and accuracy of MRI in detecting deep myometrial invasion were significantly higher than those of TVUS and CT (p = 0.049 for both sensitivity and accuracy).

We recommend MRI instead of CT or TVUS for the evaluation of the depth of myometrial invasion in endometrial carcinoma.
