We present a 16-year-old girl with asymptomatic liver segment herniation following aortic graft surgery for atypical coarctation of the aorta. The defect in the right hemidiaphragm was caused by the implantation of an ascending thoracic aorta to upper abdominal aortic bypass graft. The differential diagnosis of diaphragmatic defects as well as the role of various imaging modalities in establishing the diagnosis are discussed.
