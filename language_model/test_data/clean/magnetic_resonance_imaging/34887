Cerebrovascular disease is a major cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease, particularly in those with diabetes mellitus. Cardiac disease frequently presents itself atypically in diabetic patients. This awareness has led to earlier detection and treatment of cardiac disease in diabetic patients. Whether cerebrovascular disease may also present itself in a highly atypical fashion in the diabetic patient with end-stage renal disease has never been addressed. We report the case of a diabetic hemodialysis patient who had an extremely unusual manifestation of stroke. A 67-year-old diabetic hemodialysis patient had marked distress secondary to the sudden onset of a foreign body sensation in the oropharynx. Results of a laryngoscopy were negative; x-rays of the neck and computerized tomography of the head and neck showed no abnormalities. Neurologic evaluation revealed an inability to detect oropharyngeal stimuli and an absent gag reflex but no other deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an infarction in the left corona radiata that extended to the thalamocapsular region and external capsule, and a lacunar infarct in the right pons. Cerebrovascular disease in the diabetic patient with end-stage renal disease may present itself atypically, and we suggest that cerebrovascular disease in these patients merits the same level of suspicion as cardiac disease.
