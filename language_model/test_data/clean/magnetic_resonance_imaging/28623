A 33-year-old woman with inappropriate secretion of TSH and a 2-mm pituitary microadenoma is described. She had a high serum free T4 concentration (31 pmol/L) with an inappropriately nonsuppressible serum TSH concentration (0.93 mU/L). The alpha/TSH molar ratio was 2.3 and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement identified an area of low signal intensity in the left lateral pituitary gland. However, TSH secretion was not completely autonomous. There was a significant response to exogenous TRH stimulation and suppression by T3 administration. Therefore, it was difficult to rule out a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma with concomitant pituitary selective thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. A 2-mm microadenoma was excised via transsphenoidal surgery. The tumor cells were immunoreactive to antisera to alpha-subunit and minimally immunoreactive to antisera to TSHbeta. The patient's thyroid function normalized after surgery without medication. Because the adenoma could become large and intractable if the patient was treated inadequately, early diagnosis and treatment are important in patients with TSH secreting adenomas.
