The aim of this study was to evaluate high resolution T2(*)-weighted MRI--in our case a 3D CISS sequence--for the diagnosis of acoustic neuromas. Especially to be clarified was if high-resolution T2-weighted sequences can substitute T1-weighted contrast-enhanced sequences, and in which circumstances they can give important additional information when compared with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences.

The MR examinations were performed using a 1.5-Tesla unit with a circularly polarized head coil. All 20 patients (11 females, nine males, aged from 12 to 80 years) with acoustic neuromas underwent preoperative MRI with T2*-weighted 3D CISS (slice thickness, 0.7 mm; acquisition time, 8 min) and pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted 3D MP-RAGE (slice thickness, 0.9 mm; acquisition time, 8 min) sequences. The detectability of acoustic neuromas was evaluated following the consensus of three radiologists using a 3D work station (parameters: tumor presence, extent, nerve attribution).

All tumors were detected by both contrast-enhanced 3D MP-RAGE and 3D CISS and the diameters of the lesions were equally well measured. 3D CISS was the best sequence for the attribution of a lesion to a certain nerve. Labyrinthine involvement could be better detected using 3D CISS than contrast-enhanced 3D MP-RAGE.

High-resolution T2(*)-weighted MRI is a very sensitive method for tumor screening which can also detect even small meatal and labyrinthine neuromas. In the case of abnormal findings (other pathology or variations, e.g. vascular loops); however, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI is necessary in order to confirm the presence of a tumor with typical enhancement.
