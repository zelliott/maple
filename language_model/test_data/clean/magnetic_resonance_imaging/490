We report a very rare and successful surgery for primary malignant tumor of the sternum. A 73-year-old male, previously healthy, was admitted to our hospital because a chest computed tomography scan detected an abnormal shadow that suggested a sternal tumor destroying part of the sternum body. Aspiration needle biopsy demonstrated a primary sternal chondrosarcoma measuring 3 x 4 cm in diameter. The sternum below the second intercostal space was resected along with a 1-cm width of cartilage below the third rib on each side. Sternal reconstruction was performed with Composix mesh, titanium mesh, and Marlex mesh, using a right pectoralis major muscle flap translation. The patient was extubated just after surgery, and the postoperative course was uneventful. This procedure may be useful for repairing the detect after wide sternotomy.
