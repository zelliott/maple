The aim of the study was to report the clinical characteristics, radiological imaging methods, and management of patients with fibrous dysplasia.

A retrospective review of 12 patients. Distribution of the cases according to the clinical and radiological features was described.

The age range was from 9 to 55. Sphenoid bone was the most common involved area in our cases. Simple cystic degeneration was observed in three cases and aneurysmal bone cyst in one case.

Radiologic findings are characteristic but not pathognomonic. Our management is to follow nonsymptomatic cases or surgical intervention to stop progression of a lesion or to resolve compression symptoms.
