Whereas avascular necrosis of the scaphoid after a fracture is well-documented, idiopathic avascular necrosis of the scaphoid (Preiser's disease) is rare. Little is known of the aetiology of the condition and even less about the best course of management. We describe a rare case of bilateral Preiser's disease. Possible aetiological factors and a summary of the current concepts of management are discussed.
