In the controversial field of a continuously changing neurology with the problem of rising medical costs, the perspectives of modern neurology at the beginning of a new century are described by four aspects: 1. Relatively new are the studies of neuropsychiatric symptoms in neurologic diseases. An immediate diagnosis and treatment of these symptoms can improve the outcome of the neurologic disease. 2. An example for the progress in investigative methods by medical technology is magnetic resonance imaging which allows a more refined diagnosis and which improves and reevaluates the importance of the clinical examination. There is a warning on the other hand about unnecessary and badly planned examinations. 3. Advances in clinical neurology are mentioned by describing neurogenetic diseases, infectious neurologic diseases and new forms of dementia. 4. Some therapeutical aspects concerning neuroprotection and neurologic intensive care are discussed. Finally, the aims for the training of future neurologists are briefly outlined.
