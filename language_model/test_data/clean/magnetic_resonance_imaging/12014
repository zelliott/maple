The authors report 2 cases of deliberate methanol intoxication explored by Computed Tomography and MR Imaging. These two methods gave similar results showing bilateral areas of putaminal necrosis. This characteristic finding is of great diagnostic value in these clinically-oriented cases. MRI gives better anatomical details and may reveal small haemorrhagic lesions.
