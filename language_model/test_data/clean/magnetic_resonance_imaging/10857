We report a case of a metastatic intrapelvic tumor arising from esophageal cancer. The patient, a 74-year-old man, visited our hospital with the chief complaint of gross hematuria. Magnetic resonance imaging and cystoscopy revealed a huge intrapelvic tumor which invaded the bladder, rectum, sigmoid colon and left ilium. The patient underwent total pelvic evisceration with ileal conduit and colostomy. Pathologic diagnosis of the intrapelvic tumor was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Preoperatively, gastrointestinal fiberscopy revealed an esophageal tumor, and biopsy showed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, the intrapelvic tumor was diagnosed as metastatic tumor from esophageal cancer.
