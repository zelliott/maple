During a four year period, 21 patients with intracranial arteriovenous malformations, and six with cavernous angiomas, were operated at Hvidovre Hospital. Of these, 16 had ruptured. There was one operative death, and five displayed normal perfusion pressure breakthrough during the post-operative course, one of these disabling. Radical surgery was performed in 21 cases, for the main part of the ruptured cases with ensuing good quality of life, and for the unruptured cases with elimination of the risk of bleeding, in addition to seizure control.
