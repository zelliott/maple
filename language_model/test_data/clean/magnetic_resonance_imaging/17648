In everyday gynecological clinical practice imaging modalities are becoming more and more important. Depending on the site of pathology itself, CT and MR have certain advantages and disadvantages, which are important to know in order to choose adequate diagnostic procedure.

Benign conditions such as myomas, inflammatory processes and genital tract abnormalities are major indications for MR imaging. In oncology, it is necessary to perform staging of the disease by imaging modalities. Tumors of the vagina and vulva are diagnosed by clinical examination and imaging modalities are used for staging. In cervical carcinoma it is very important to define stages of the desease and invasion of the surrounding structures which is better seen on MR, but invasion of parametria can be visualized by CT as well. For endometrial cancer MR imaging is a modality of choice. For ovarian cancer both modalities are in use, CT is less expensive and gives enough information. New possibilities with MR imaging using an endovaginal coil in diagnosis of stress incontinence are also discussed.
