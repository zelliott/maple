The cerebellum, which is important for movement control and planning, is often affected by many neurological conditions. Until now there has been limited information regarding how the function of the cerebellum impacts driving ability. This study used fMRI with an integrated virtual reality driving simulator to determine which aspects of driving performance are related to the cerebellum in healthy drivers (Experiment 1). It also investigated drivers with focal cerebellar lesions to identify how damage to this brain region impairs driving abilities. The results showed that cerebellar functioning is responsible for motor-speed coordination and complex temporal-motor integration necessary to execute driving behaviours. As predicted, drivers with cerebellar damage, showed significantly compromised speed control during basic driving conditions, whereas their ability to perform during interactive driving situations was preserved. New insights into neural mechanisms and brain plasticity regarding driving behaviour are discussed. Strategies in assessing and rehabilitating drivers with related neurological conditions are provided.
