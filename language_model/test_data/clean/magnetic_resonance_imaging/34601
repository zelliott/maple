High spatial resolution dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed with a phased-array body coil is a useful tool for evaluating hepatocellular carcinoma. The examination consists of fast spin-echo T1- and T2-weighted images obtained in a single breath hold; multisection, dynamic, fast gradient-echo images obtained in a single breath hold; and contrast material-enhanced images obtained in the arterial-dominant and delayed phases. Hepatocellular carcinoma, with its predominantly arterial blood supply, usually appears hyperintense on arterial-dominant phase images and isointense or hypointense relative to liver parenchyma on delayed-phase images. Hepatocellular carcinomas, especially those larger than 1.5 cm, contain a fibrous capsule or an inner septum, which allows them to be differentiated from other tumors. These characteristics are particularly important in the diagnosis of hypovascular hepatocellular carcinomas, which do not have an arterial blood supply and thus do not enhance. Extracapsular invasion, a relatively common finding in advanced cases, is seen as a nodular enhancing area that projects into the surrounding liver parenchyma adjacent to the main tumor on arterial-dominant phase images and as an iso- or hypointense area on delayed-phase images. Portal vein invasion appears as an obstruction of the vein, and portal vein tumor thrombi appear as intermediate-signal-intensity masses. The technique can also be helpful in the follow-up of treatment.
