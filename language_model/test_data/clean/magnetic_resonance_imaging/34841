We report the MR findings in two cases of acute suppurative perithyroiditis. MR has the advantages over other imaging modalities of being able to distinguish areas of inflammation from adjacent normal tissue and of allowing imaging in planes which more accurately demonstrate the extent of the lesion. MR imaging is one of the most useful methods to evaluate this entity.
