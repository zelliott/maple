Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis and management of gestational trophoblastic disease. Ultrasonography is the initial investigation of choice for the diagnosis. Pelvic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is used as a problem-solving tool for assessment of degree of local invasion. Chest radiography is the recommended initial radiographic staging modality, and chest computed tomography is performed if the radiograph is negative. (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography has been shown to be useful in assessing the active or viable sites of metastases, thereby determining the need for tumor resectability in chemoresistant disease.
