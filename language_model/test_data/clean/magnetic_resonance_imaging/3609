A novel and facile approach is developed to synthesize a magnetic nanoparticle (iron oxide)-doped carbogenic nanocomposite (IO-CNC) for magnetic resonance (MR)/fluorescence imaging applications. IO-CNC is synthesized by thermal decomposition of organic precursors in the presence of Fe(3) O(4)  nanoparticles with an average size of 6 nm. IO-CNC shows wavelength-tunable fluorescence properties with high quantum yield. Magnetic studies confirm the superparamagnetic nature of IO-CNC at room temperature. IO-CNC shows MR contrast behavior by affecting the proton relaxation phenomena. The measured longitudinal (r(1) ) and transverse (r(2) ) relaxivity values are 4.52 and 34.75 mM(-1)  s(-1) , respectively. No apparent cytotoxicity is observed and the nanocomposite shows a biocompatible nature. In vivo MR studies show both T(1)  and T(2) * contrast behavior of the nanocomposite. Fluorescence imaging indicates selective uptake of IO-CNC by macrophages in spleen.
