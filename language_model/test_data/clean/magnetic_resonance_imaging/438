Factors such as instability and impingement lead to early cartilage damage and osteoarthritis of the hip joint. The surgical outcome of joint-preserving surgery about the hip joint depends on the preoperative quality of joint cartilage.For in vivo evaluation of cartilage quality, different biochemically sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures have been tested, some of which have the potential of inducing a paradigm shift in the evaluation and treatment of cartilage damage and early osteoarthritis.Instead of reacting to late sequelae in a palliative way, physicians could assess cartilage damage early on, and the treatment intensity could be adequate and based on the disease stage. Furthermore, the efficiency of different therapeutic interventions could be evaluated and monitored.This article reviews the recent application of delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) and discusses its use for assessing cartilage quality in the hip joint. dGEMRIC is more sensitive to early cartilage changes in osteoarthritis than are radiographic measures and might be a helpful tool for assessing cartilage quality.
