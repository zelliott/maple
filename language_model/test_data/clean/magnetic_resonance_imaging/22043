Extraforaminal disk herniation has been recognized with increasing frequency. When the herniated disk (HD) fragment detaches and migrates away from the spinal column, it can be confused with other space-occupying paraspinal lesions.

A 63-year-old female presented with right leg pain and weakness. A magnetic resonance image showed a right psoas muscle mass. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) established a diagnosis of HD.

The cytologic appearance of HD is characteristic. When correlated with clinical findings, the diagnosis of HD can be established by FNAB.
