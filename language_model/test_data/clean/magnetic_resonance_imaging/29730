The authors describe two patients in a Japanese family with autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay. They presented early onset spastic ataxia, sensorimotor neuropathy, nystagmus, slurred speech, and hypermyelinated retinal nerve fibers. The authors identified a homozygous missense mutation (T7492C) in the SACS gene, which resulted in the substitution of arginine for tryptophan at amino acid residue 2498 (W2498R).
