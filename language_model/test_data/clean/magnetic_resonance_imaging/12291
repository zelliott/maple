Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is a specialized technique that is rapidly becoming part of the diagnostic algorithm of peripheral nerve pathology. However, in order for this modality to be considered appropriate, its value compared with current methods of diagnosis should be established. Therefore, radiologists involved in MRN research should use appropriate methodology to evaluate MRN's effectiveness with a multidisciplinary approach. This article reviews the various tiers of research available to assess the clinical value of a diagnostic modality with an emphasis on how to evaluate the impact of MRN on diagnostic thinking and therapeutic decisions.
