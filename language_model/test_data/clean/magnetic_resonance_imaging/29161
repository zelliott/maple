We report a case of venous angioma revealed by seizure after a non hemorrhagic venous infarct. The initial neuroradiological work-up with CT scan, angiography and brain MRI evidenced the venous infarction with abnormal contrast uptake. The control MRI 3 months later showed clear involution of the venous infarct. Non-hemorrhagic venous infarction on venous angiomas are exceptional. Only 2 cases have been reported in the literature. Impaired venous drainage could be implicated.
