Tuberculosis of the central nervous system is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing nations where it accounts for 10 to 30% of intracranial space-occupying lesions. It preferentially affects young subjects, predominantly male. MRI and in particular new methods, including magnetization transfer and diffusion-weighted imaging, are useful for positive and differential diagnoses of central nervous system tuberculosis and surveillance during treatment.
