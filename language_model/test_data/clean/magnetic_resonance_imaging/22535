Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the CNS leading to clinical disability in 250,000-350,000 young adults in the USA and Europe. The disease affects both white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) tissues of the brain and spinal cord. While WM disease is easily quantified using currently available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, identification and quantification of GM disease present a daily challenge. Nonconventional brain and spinal cord MRI techniques, including magnetization transfer, MRI spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging, have improved our understanding of MS pathology in the deep GM. The sensitivity of high-resolution MRI obtained at a high magnetic field will improve the detection of spinal cord and brain cortical GM disease. The appropriate use of the above-mentioned techniques has the potential to more accurately explain the level of disability in MS patients.
