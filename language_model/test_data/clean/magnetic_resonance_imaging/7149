We present a case of intrahepatic cystic cholangiocarcinoma with unusual radiologic appearance. Computed tomography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic mass with thick wall, that mimicked liver abscess, and cystic or necrotic metastasis. The fluid in the cyst was not mucinous and was negative bacteriologically. Histologic examination showed cholangiocarcinoma with large cavities resulting from necrosis.
