A 61-year-old woman with low grade obesity index complained of general fatigue. Cardiomegaly had been present since the age of 45. According to a roentgenogram on admission, her cardia-thoracic ratio was 61%. Pericardial effusion was strongly suspected because of extra echo spaces on both posterior and anterior walls, and unsynchronized echocardiograph waves of epicardium and pericardium. However, values of dynamic CT measured at areas equivalent to the extra echo spaces were -120. On admission, T1-emphasized MRI image showed a high signal density in those areas. After significant weight reduction, the abnormal values and signs of the clinical examinations, as well as the patient's complaints were attenuated or disappeared. Together with these results, cardiomegaly of the patient was diagnosed to be due to excessive fat deposit between the epicardium and cardiac muscle. Dissociation between mildness of obesity index and excessive deposition of fat in the pericardium was discussed from the point of view of body mass index and time course of fat deposition.
