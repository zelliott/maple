Rathke cleft cysts are commonly found on autopsy but are seldom symptomatic. Conventional treatment of these lesions consists of transsphenoidal drainage with partial excision of the cyst, and recurrence is rare. Alternatively, the instillation of absolute alcohol into the cyst has been described in several reports, with no complications. The authors report on a woman with Rathke cleft cyst that recurred three times after the initial treatment; the lesion was treated with alcohol cauterization on the final recurrence with devastating complications. This 51-year-old woman presented in 1992 with headaches and visual disturbances. Admission magnetic resonance imaging revealed a sellar/suprasellar lesion that was treated with conventional surgery and was subsequently confirmed to be a Rathke cleft cyst. The patient again presented with recurrence of the cyst at 22, 26, and 31 months after the initial presentation. On the final recurrence the cyst was treated with alcohol cauterization. Postoperatively, the patient awoke blind and suffered a seizure from leakage of the alcohol. The patient remains completely blind in both eyes and is also anosmic and has left lid ptosis and exotropia, which signify damage to the first through third cranial nerves. Rathke cleft cysts have been known to recur after primary surgery; however, this is the first report of a single cyst recurring three times despite conventional surgical treatment. Additionally, this is the first report in which devastating complications from alcohol cauterization of the cyst have been described. The authors therefore advocate caution when attempting alcohol cauterization and advise that meticulous care be taken to ensure the patency of the cyst.
