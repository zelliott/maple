The management of chronic mandibular dislocation is controversial: many advocate conservative treatment, whereas others believe surgery can improve the symptoms and prevent dislocation recurrence. We report 7 consecutive cases of hyperdivergent patients with recurrent mandibular dislocation, who were treated using combined maxillary surgery that allowed the modification of the facial pattern from dolichofacial to mesofacial. At a 1-year follow-up, all patients did not have any episode of mandibular dislocation; moreover, a general improvement of symptoms associated with temporomandibular joint disorders was observed.
