Gelastic seizures are characterized by inappropriate, stereotyped laughter and are often first recognized when other epileptic manifestations occur. They are frequently associated with hypothalamic hamartomas. Central nervous system developmental abnormalities are rarely reported with gelastic seizures. There is only one case report of gelastic seizure caused by holoprosencephaly. We report a 2-year-old girl with multiple brain structural abnormalities including tectal tumor (possibly hamartoma), multiple subependymal nodules, and holoprosencephaly. She developed seizures during the newborn period and presented with gelastic seizure and simple partial seizure at 3 months of age.
