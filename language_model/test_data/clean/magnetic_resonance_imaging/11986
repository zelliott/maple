The dependence of 1/T1 on the magnetic field strength (the relaxation dispersion) has been measured at 37 degrees C on autopsy samples of human brain gray and white matter at field strengths corresponding to proton Larmor frequencies between 10 kHz and 50 MHz (0.0002-1.2 T). Additional measurements of 1/T1 and 1/T2 have been performed at 200 MHz (4.7 T) and 20 MHz (0.47 T), respectively. Absolute signal amplitudes are found to be proportional to the sample water content, not to the "proton density," and it is concluded that the myelin lipids do not contribute to the signal. Transverse magnetization decay data can be fitted with a triple exponential function, giving characteristic results for each tissue type, and are insensitive to variations of the pulse spacing interval. The longitudinal relaxation dispersion curves show characteristic shapes for each tissue type. The most striking difference is a large dispersion for white matter at very high fields. As a consequence, the relative difference in 1/T1 between gray and white matter shows a marked maximum around 10 MHz. Possible implications for MRI are discussed. A weighted least-squares fit of the dispersions has been performed using a four-parameter function of the form 1/T1 = 1/T1,w + D + A/(1 + (f/fc)beta'). The quality of the fit is superior to that of other functions proposed previously. The results of these fits are used to predict image contrast between gray and white matter at different field strengths.
