Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura (HSP) is a multisystemic vasculitis. Nervous system involvement is usually underestimated. Headaches, mental status changes and seizures are the most frequent neurologic symptoms. Ataxia and mononeuropathy are both very rare. We present an 11-year-old boy with HSP who suffered from ataxia during the initial presentation and peripheral neuropathy at the time of a relapse. Brainstem vasculitic involvement was shown by magnetic resonance imaging, while cranial tomography was normal. All the neurologic symptoms and signs resolved following bolus methylprednisolone administration. Ten months later he had a second course of HSP with skin and renal involvement. A percutaneous renal biopsy, which was performed due to persistent hematuria, revealed mesangial proliferation with IgA deposition. During that period the patient experienced pain and numbness in the right foot and leg; electromyography showed signs of mononeuritis multiplex involving the right posterior tibial nerve. The patient responded to steroid therapy.
