Malignant subfrontal (olfactory) peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are exceedingly rare. Although meningiomas are the most common subfrontal extra-axial lesions, it is important to recognize that MPNSTs, which are radiographically similar to meningiomas, can also be present in this location. MPNSTs require more aggressive surgical and postoperative management than meningiomas. In this paper, we describe a patient with a subfrontal MPNST with unusual histological characteristics and present a review of the literature. A 49-year-old woman presented with chronic sinusitis and progressive headaches. A neurological examination revealed left-sided anosmia. Brain-imaging studies revealed a large left subfrontal mass with extension into the frontal and ethmoid sinuses and the nasal cavity. The patient underwent both a bifrontal transbasal craniotomy and a transnasal approach for an attempt at total resection of both the intradural and extradural components of the MPNST. The patient was treated postoperatively with radiation therapy, and had no evidence of recurrence at her follow-up examination 1-year after treatment. Subfrontal PNSTs are extremely rare and usually benign. The specific cell and nerve of origin for these tumors remains unknown. Our case shows that these rare lesions can present as a malignant variant and thus require aggressive surgical and postoperative management to provide long-term tumor control.
