Between October 1991 and December 1995, a total of 22 patients (23 knees) underwent meniscal transplantation with nonirradiated, cryopreserved allografts. Implantation was arthroscopically assisted using bone plugs to prevent meniscal extrusion and maintain weight-bearing functional position. Patients were evaluated with an average follow-up of 40 months (range, 13 to 69 months) using the International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, and Tegner scoring systems. The most significant finding was pain reduction after implantation. Lateral and standing anteroposterior radiographs were obtained on all patients at follow-up with an average joint space loss of 0.882 mm (range, 0 to 3 mm). Magnetic resonance imaging was preformed on both knees in 12 of the 22 patients at an average of 24.4 months postoperatively. On average, the allograft meniscus was 63% (range, 31% to 100%) the size of the normal meniscus. Clinical results showed improvement of preoperative pain in all patients. Although patients continue to have good pain relief following their meniscal allograft transplantation, the average shrinkage in the size of the meniscus as shown on magnetic resonance imaging is a concern.
