Chondroblastoma is a relatively uncommon but benign bone tumor that is typically found in a long-bone epiphysis. Reports of this type of tumor in the carpals have been rare, and even fewer cases of such tumors in the triquetrum have been reported. Here, we present classical findings of a chondroblastoma at an unusual location, the triquetrum, in an adolescent. Fat-suppressed T2*-weighted imaging revealed a hyperintense tumor matrix replacing the bony trabecula of the triquetrum, which had not been addressed in previous literature. Radiography-based differential diagnosis of a bubbly lesion in the hand of an adolescent, even in the small carpal bones, should include chondroblastoma.
