Isolated angiitis of the central nervous system (IAC) is an idiopatic, recurrent vasculitis confined to the CNS involving small blood vessels. We describe the clinical, angiographic, and neuropathological data in two patients with IAC and delineate the main clinical and neuropathological features in both cases as well as the importance of a complete autopsy for discovering subclinical vasculitic lesions outside the CNS. Patient 1 concerned a 40 year-old-man that evolved for the last three years, initially with focal seizures, headache, and neurological focal deficits, later on the left sided hemihyposthesia and preferentially left parieto-occipital dysfunctions. He presented an oligoclonal band in CSF with slight hyperproteinorraquia and 25 lymphocytes. A cerebral angiography was compatible with angiitis and a leptomeningeal/cerebral biopsy showed lymphocytic vasculitis in the leptomeningeal and intraparenchymatous cerebral small vessels. These results lead to start a treatment with Cyclophosphamide associated to high dose of steroids. The patient clearly improved and now is almost asymptomatic. Patient 2 concerned a 67 year-old-man that evolved for 4 years with encephalic ischemic lesions distributed and confined throughout the brain stem and cerebellum, temporary remissions occurred and the patient required high-dose steroids and Cyclophosphamide to improve. Conventional and MRI angiographies only suggested the diagnosis that was confirmed at autopsy. The patient died after a massive pulmonary thromboembolism and a complete necropsic study showed abundant lymphocytic infiltrates, without granulomatous lesions, in the intraparenchymatous and leptomeningeal cerebral small vessels specially at the brain stem and cerebellar level where many demyelinated greyish areas and few infarctions were to be seen. The inflammatory cells were, in both cases, predominantly CD4+ T lymphocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
