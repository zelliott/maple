Treatment of high-risk localized prostate cancer remains inadequate. The authors performed a phase 2 multicenter trial of neoadjuvant docetaxel plus bevacizumab before radical prostatectomy.

Eligibility included any of the following: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >20 ng/mL or PSA velocity >2 ng/mL/y, cT3 disease, any biopsy Gleason score 8 to 10, and Gleason score 7 with T3 disease by endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 T. Also, those with ≥50% biopsy cores involved and either Gleason score 7, PSA >10, or cT2 disease were eligible. Patients were treated with docetaxel 70 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for 6 cycles and bevacizumab 15 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for 5 cycles. The primary endpoint was partial response by endorectal MRI.

Forty-one patients were treated. Median age was 55 years (range, 40-66 years). Baseline characteristics included: median PSA, 10.1 ng/mL; cT2, 49%, cT3, 32%; and Gleason score 8 to 10, 73%. Thirty-eight of 41 (93%) patients completed all 6 cycles. Grade ≥3 adverse events were rare, although 3 of 41 (7%) experienced febrile neutropenia. Twelve patients (29%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 16%-45%) achieved a >50% reduction in tumor volume, and 9 patients (22%; 95% CI, 11%-38%) achieved a >50% post-treatment decline in PSA. Thirty-seven of the 41 patients underwent radical prostatectomy; there were no complete pathologic responses.

Neoadjuvant docetaxel and bevacizumab is safe, and results in reductions in both tumor volume and serum PSA, in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in prostate cancer, and perioperative antiangiogenic therapy in general, requires further elucidation through ongoing and planned trials.
