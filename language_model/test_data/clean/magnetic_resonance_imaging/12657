Neurocognitive outcome of preschool children, prenatal diagnosis of isolated mild ventriculomegaly compared with 2 control groups.

Case-controlled study at the University Hospital of Tel Aviv between October 1999 and December 2002. Study groups consisted of 12 children with bilateral isolated mild ventriculomegaly, and 16 children with unilateral isolated mild ventriculomegaly, mean age 4.4 years, prenatally diagnosed by both ultrasound and fetal magnetic resonanace imaging. Control groups consisted of 16 children with normal prenatal magnetic resonance imaging and 16 regular kindergarten children. A neurodevelopmental examination and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children were performed.

The neurodevelopmental and Kaufman scores were within normal range in the study groups. No significant differences between the study and control groups for most measures; however, Kaufman achievement score was significantly lower for the bilateral isolated mild ventriculomegaly group (P < .05) compared with the kindergarten children.

Preschool children with isolated mild ventriculomegaly performed within normal range compared with the controls. Nevertheless, a significant percentage of the children demonstrated developmental difficulties, lower achievement scores, justifying early school years follow-up.
