Mucocele of the appendix due to endometriosis is extremely rare, and there are only 10 previously reported cases in the English literature. We report a case of mucocele of the appendix due to endometriosis and provide the first review of the literature. A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of recurrent right lower abdominal pain during her menstrual periods. Colonoscopy revealed submucosal tumor-like elevations of the appendiceal orifice. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen suggested cystic lesions near the appendix. Consequently, mucocele of the appendix was suspected preoperatively. An open ileocecal resection was performed. Multiple cystic lesions were observed around the appendix. The cystic lesions contained mucus. Histopathological examination was consistent with a mucocele of the appendix due to endometriosis. The postoperative course was uneventful. We present the first review of the literature to clarify the clinical features.
