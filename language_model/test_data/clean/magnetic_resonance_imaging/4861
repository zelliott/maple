A 45 year old female presented with painless swelling over the inner side of both eyes since one year. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed well defined lesions in the bilateral lacrimal sac area with extension along the naso-lacrimal duct. Systemic work up showed polyclonal hyperglobulinemia, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and anemia. The patient also had subcutaneous swelling in thoracic area over back. The histopathology of the bilateral excised tumor and fine needle aspiration cytology of thoracic swelling was consistent with features of Rosai-Dorfman syndrome.
