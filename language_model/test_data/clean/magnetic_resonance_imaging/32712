A family with dystonia associated with dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH), mental deterioration, and tissue calcification is described. The proband possessed an adenosine deaminase acting on the RNA 1 gene (ADAR1) mutation Gly1007Arg. This ADAR1 mutation could disturb RNA editing at Q/R sites of glutamate receptor in the brain and increase Ca(2+) influx into neurons, which is thought to induce dystonia and mental deterioration. The observations in our family raise the possibility that the ADAR1 mutation might be a direct cause or a predisposing factor for heredodegenerative dystonia. Further investigation of ADAR1 mutations will shed light on the genotype-phenotype correlation in DSH.
