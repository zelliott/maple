In a 25-year-old woman with episodic periorbital-temporal pain who eventually developed a sixth nerve palsy, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion predominantly in the Meckel cave that was found to be a capillary hemangioma arising from the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Hemangiomas of the Meckel cave must be considered in cases of facial pain with a sixth nerve palsy. even if there are no clinical findings of trigeminal neuropathy.
