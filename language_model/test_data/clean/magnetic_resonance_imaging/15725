The advantages of array coil imaging in human whole-body MR systems are well known and have gained relevance in many applications and MR techniques. In the field of small-animal studies, this concept has become increasingly important. In this work, three different phased-array coils for performing MRI on mice are presented. For imaging at 300 MHz, a four-channel receive-only phased-array coil is introduced. One two-channel and a four-channel transmit/receive setup operating at 750 MHz show the feasibility of array coil imaging at 17.6 T. All of these coils show excellent performance and deliver high-quality MR images of mice.
