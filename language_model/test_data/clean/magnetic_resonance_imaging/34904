Clinico-radiological profile of 25 patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy due to tuberculosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma and metastases is presented. The main objective was to study the signal intensity pattern of the mediastinal lymph nodes both in plain and contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and find out its potential value in the diagnosis. Fifteen patients of tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenopathy, 5 patients of Hodgkin's lymphoma and 5 patients of metastatic lymphadenopathy were studied by 1.5 T Siemens, Magnetom. Both intensity and enhancement pattern were evaluated. Tuberculous lymph nodes appeared isointense in both T1WI and T2WI. On contrast administration multiple hypointense foci were seen in 14 out of 15 patients. The metastatic lymph nodes revealed solitary or multiple hyperintense central foci in T2WI, whereas the lymphomatous lymph nodes revealed heterogenous intensity. Though the lymphomatous nodes revealed mild to moderate type of enhancement, the metastatic nodes revealed dense enhancement of the multiple foci which were seen in noncontrast images. Hence, the MR characteristics of the mediastinal nodes may be useful index in evaluating the aetiology of the mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
