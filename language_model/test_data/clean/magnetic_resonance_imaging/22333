To investigate the corrective results of congenital scoliosis with type II split spinal cord malformation.

By reviewing the medical records and roentgenograms of congenital scoliosis patients with type II split spinal cord malformation that underwent corrective surgery, septum location and length, curve type, coronal and sagittal Cobb's angles, apical vertebral rotation and translation, and trunk shift were measured and analyzed.

A total of 23 congenital scoliosis patients with type II split spinal cord malformation were studied, 6 cases were due to failure of segmentation, 8 cases due to failure of formation, and the remaining 9 cases due to mixed defects. The fibrous septums were located in the thoracic spine in 8 patients, lumbar spine in 4 patients, thoracic and lumbar spine in 10 patients, and from cervical to lumbar spine in 1 patient The septum extended an average of 4.9 segments. Corrective surgeries included anterior correction with instrumentation in 2 patients, posterior correction with instrumentation in 11 patients, anterior release and posterior correction with instrumentation in 6 patients, anterior and posterior resection of the hemivertebra and posterior correction with instrumentation in 4 patients. The pre- and postoperative coronal Cobb's angles, apical vertebral translations, apical vertebral rotations, trunk shifts were 61.9 degrees and 32.5 degrees (P < 0.001), 48.9 mm and 31.5 mm (P < 0.001), 1.2 and 1.1, 12.7 mm and 8.2 mm, respectively. The average correction rate of coronal Cobb's angle was 47.5%. The sagittal balance was also well improved. The fibrous septums were all left in situ. There was no neurological complication.

For congenital scoliosis with type II split spinal cord malformation, positive correction results with no neurological complication may be obtained without resection of the fibrous septum.
