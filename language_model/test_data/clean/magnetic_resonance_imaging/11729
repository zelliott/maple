In this article we report a 44 year old male with chronic alcoholism as antecedent and Wernicke Korsakoff s syndrome, studied with brain CT, MR and SPECT. In this work we review the different conclusion obtained with different studies and in different stages of the chronic alcoholism disease.

Although several authors have described impaired frontal blood flow in the Wernicke Korsakoff s syndrome, in our case the parietal, temporal and occipital cortex were the most affected.
