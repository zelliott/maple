Spinal hemangioblastoma usually leads to large intramedullary cysts. Until recently clinical and conventional radiological examination was often not able to detect single or multiple tumor niduses at the wall of a secondary syringomyelia cyst. Thus during surgical exploration the tumor not infrequently was missed, leading to misinterpretation of the pathological entity as syringomyelia, spinal gliosis or low grade spinal astrocytoma. This often resulted in explorative biopsy or decompressive laminectomy. Clinical deterioration postoperatively was not uncommon due to the remaining tumor and increasing spinal cord enlargement. Now magnetic resonance imaging allows the exact preoperative localization of the medullary lesion apart from the accompanying cysts and facilitates differential diagnosis of primary syringomyelia or other spinal cord neoplasms. Microsurgical techniques and laser-assisted resection have improved the outcome. We report on eight patients with spinal hemangioblastoma treated in our clinic since the installation of magnetic resonance imaging and laser-assisted microneurosurgery.
