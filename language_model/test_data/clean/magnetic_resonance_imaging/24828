Acute calcific discitis is a rare condition in the pediatric population and has been reported in only 2 instances in the adult population. This report describes a case of acute calcific discitis that uniquely presented in the adult cervical spine. A 22-year-old woman presented with the chief complaint of sudden-onset neck pain. Nonsurgical management, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, provided moderate symptom relief. Radiography revealed nucleus pulposus calcification at the C2-3 level. Contrast-enhanced MRI did not reveal any additional abnormalities. Further nonsurgical management, including physical therapy and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, led to complete symptom relief within 6 months. Follow-up imaging demonstrated that the calcification had nearly resolved. Acute calcific discitis should be managed conservatively; the prognosis for a complete recovery is excellent. The pathophysiology of the disorder is yet to be elucidated, and the disorder is not exclusive to the pediatric population.
