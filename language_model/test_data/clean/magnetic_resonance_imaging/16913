Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is caused by single or multiple cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks in the spine with the prototypical symptom of postural headache. One of the characteristic MRI features in SIH is intracranial venous engorgement. This report presents a case of SIH with engorgement of the bilateral superior ophthalmic veins (SOVs) which resume their normal diameters by the third day of successful epidural blood patches (EBPs). We define this phenomenon as the "reversal of the SOV" sign.
