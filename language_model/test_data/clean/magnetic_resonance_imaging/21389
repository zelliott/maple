The aim of this prospective study was to compare the painful subacromial gliding limitation of the supraspinatus tendon (SGLS) during dynamic ultrasonography, the features of magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA), and the maximum intra-articular injection volume to predict decreased joint capacity of the shoulder joint.

Between January 2003 and August 2011, 67 patients prospectively underwent ultrasonography including dynamic examination and MRA. Ultrasonography and ultrasonography-guided injection of contrast medium was performed before MRA, and each SGLSdU was compared with injected contrast volume, which was assumed as the maximum joint capacity and MRA features.

Forty-seven patients (70.1%) were revealed as SGLS-positive, and 20 patients (29.9%) were revealed as SGLS-negative by dynamic ultrasonography. Pearson's correlation coefficient between SGLS and the injection volume was -0.764 (P < 0.001). The value between SGLS and MRA features was 0.711 (P < 0.001). The mean injected volume of the SGLS-positive (22.0 ml) and negative group (10.7 ml) was significantly different (P < 0.001).

SGLS at ultrasonography correlated well with MRA features and the maximum intra-articular injection volume. This sign could predict the decreased capacity of the shoulder joint, an important feature of adhesive capsulitis, and increase the usefulness of dynamic ultrasonography.

• Dynamic ultrasound is increasingly used in the evaluation of the shoulder.                                  • This can assess subacromial gliding limitation of the supraspinatus tendon (SGLS)                                  • SGLS appeared inversely proportional to the maximum volume of intra-articular injection.                                  • Dynamic ultrasonography findings correlated well with MR arthrographic features of adhesive capsulitis.
