This is a case report of bilateral unicameral bone cysts located in the hamate bones of a 22-year-old man. Unicameral bone cysts are rarely seen in the bones of the hand or bilaterally. In this case the diagnosis was made clinically using both radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging studies, and verified by microscopy of the biopsied specimen. Treatment consisted of curettage, autogenous bone grafting, and immobilization. To our knowledge there has not been any record in the literature of symmetrical unicameral bone cysts in the carpal bones.
