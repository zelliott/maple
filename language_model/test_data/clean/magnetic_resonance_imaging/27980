A 36-year-old male presented with an intramedullary spinal cord arteriovenous malformation with hematomyelia but without subarachnoid hemorrhage, manifesting as lower body sensory impairments and leg weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to localize the lesion. Myelotomy allowed excision of the lesion and his sensory impairments improved.
