Alveolar adenoma of the lung is a rare benign neoplasm with distinctive gross and microscopic findings. Radiographically, alveolar adenoma usually presents as a well-circumscribed, peripheral, solitary nodule. The authors describe the contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging features of alveolar adenoma of lung. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the presence of a cystic space with central fluid and thin-rim enhancement. These findings are suggestive of a benign nodule, and alveolar adenoma of lung should be added to the differential diagnosis of nodules that demonstrate this pattern of enhancement and are probably benign.
