Between the complications of frontal sinusitis orbital or intracranial are the most frequent encountered (meningitis, abscesses and empyemas). All are secondary to thrombophlebitis of veins communicating the intracranial cavity with the frontal sinus. Frontal osteomyelitis secondary to sinusitis, the so-called Pott's puffy tumor, is a much more rare aftermath in the antibiotic epoch. Pott's puffy tumor must be suspected in patients with frontal headache followed by frontal oedema. Concerning the diagnosis clinical suspicion is essential and must be settled throughout computerized tomography and/or magnetic resonance or even bone scintiscan. The paper report 2 cases, one an orbital periostitis, at the beginning of the disease, which was recovered with medical antibiotic treatment and another one, an osteomyelitis somewhat evolved requiring surgery through frontal osteoplasty. Perusal of etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of this complication.
