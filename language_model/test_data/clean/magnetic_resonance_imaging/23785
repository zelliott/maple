A 19-year-old woman presented with left-sided sensorineural hearing loss. She was found to have a left cerebellopontine angle tumour, thought to be an acoustic neuroma on MRI, and was treated with radiosurgery. There was no evidence of tumour on MRI at 6 months. After 1 year, she was admitted with further neurological symptoms. Repeat MRI showed multiple craniospinal tumours. Biopsy of the cerebellar tumour revealed it to be a primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET). This is a rare tumour in this age group and its management is discussed.
