We have studied 20 patients with liver tumor (hepatoma 12, hemangioma 6, metastatic tumor 2) using inversion recovery snap shot FLASH dynamic MR imaging. After intravenous injection of Gd-DTPA, serial 17 images were obtained during 7 minutes. Hepatoma showed central enhancement on early phase (0-20 sec) in 11 patients and absent or less enhancement than surrounding liver parenchyma on late phase (1-3 min) in 12 patients. Hemangioma showed peripheral enhancement on early phase in 6 patients, and slight to moderate enhancement on late phase in 5 patients. Peripheral slight enhancement were seen on late and delayed (5-7 min) phase in two patients with metastatic liver tumor. These characteristic enhancement patterns should facilitate differential diagnosis of liver tumors.
