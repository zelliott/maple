We used event-related fMRI to identify the brain regions engaged during explicit and implicit sequence learning (ESL and ISL, respectively). Twenty-four subjects performed a concurrent ESL and ISL task. Behavior showed learning in both conditions. Prefrontal (PFC), striatal, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and visual regions (V1, V2 and V3) were engaged during both ESL and ISL. With ESL there was increased activity in the visual regions on the predictable (i.e. learned pattern) trials. With ISL, however, there was a relative decrease in activity in visual regions. The opposite patterns in the visual regions highlight the different effects of ESL and ISL. The learning process was distinguished from the result of learning, by fitting subjects' functional magnetic resonance imaging data to their learning curve. This analysis revealed more extensive PFC activity during ESL and caudal ACC activity specific for the result of learning analysis, when the expected response was violated. Our results suggest a relative dissociation of the brain regions engaged during ESL and ISL, whereby ESL and ISL can be viewed as partially distinct but overlapping parallel processes.
