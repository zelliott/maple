A programmable preemphasis system has been developed for eddy-current compensation in gradient sets with or without active screening. Preemphasis parameters are nonvolatile but can be changed rapidly when working with interchangeable gradient sets. The design allows easy retrofit to existing systems. A method for setting the preemphasis is presented, together with specimen results.
