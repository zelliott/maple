The dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) of the amphibian embryo is a key embryonic region involved in body axis organization and neural induction. Using time-lapse microscopic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we follow the pregastrula movements that lead to the formation of the DMZ of the stage 10 Xenopus embryo. 2D and 3D MRI time-lapse series reveal that pregastrular movements change the tissue architecture of the DMZ at earlier stages and in a different fashion than previously appreciated. Beginning at stage 9, epiboly of the animal cap moves tissue into the dorsal but not into the ventral marginal zone, resulting in an asymmetry between the dorsal and the ventral sides. Time-lapse imaging of labeled blastomeres shows that the animal cap tissue moves into the superficial DMZ overlying the deeper mesendoderm of the DMZ. The shearing of superficial tissue over the deeper mesendoderm creates the radial/vertical arrangement of ectoderm outside of mesendoderm within the DMZ, which is independent of involution and prior to the formation of the dorsal blastoporal lip. This tilting of the DMZ is distinct from, but occurs synchronously with, the vegetal rotation of the vegetal cell mass [R., Winklbauer, M., Sch√ºrfeld (1999). "Vegetal rotation, a new gastrulation movement involved in the internalization of the mesoderm and endoderm in Xenopus." Development. 126, 3703-3713.]. We present a revised model of gastrulation movements in Xenopus laevis.
