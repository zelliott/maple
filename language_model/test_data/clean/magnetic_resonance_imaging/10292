Ganglioneuromas are rare, benign, well-differentiated, slow-growing tumors, composed of ganglion cells and Schwann cells. Ganglioneuromas are derived from the neural crest cells and can arise anywhere from the base of the skull to the pelvis. We present and discuss the clinicopathologic and radiographic features of two patients with ganglioneuroma arising from the sacrum, a rare anatomic location.
