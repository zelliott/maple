Ninety subjects with complaints of low back pain sustained in a recent motor vehicle accident were studied for their incidence of abnormal findings on lumbar magnetic resonance imaging. The results were compared to other studies reporting a high incidence of abnormal findings on magnetic resonance imaging in asymptomatic subjects. Appropriateness of magnetic resonance imaging in some groups is questioned.
