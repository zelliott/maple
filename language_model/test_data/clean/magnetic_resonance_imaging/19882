The use of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis, staging, and management of breast cancer is rapidly increasing. MRI has the ability to detect malignancy that is occult to physical exam, ultrasound, and mammography. These qualities necessitate methods for MRI-guided tissue sampling. This article reviews all previously published and currently accepted methods for MRI-guided tissue sampling. The data to support these techniques are provided where appropriate. A detailed technique for vacuum-assisted breast biopsy is included. We will also review the data on other MRI-guided breast interventions such as transcutaneous tissue ablation.
