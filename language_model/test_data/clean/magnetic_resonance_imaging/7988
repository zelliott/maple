Patients diagnosed with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) need bilateral gonadectomy (orchiectomy) for malignancy risk reduction. Imaging of the gonads (testicles) prior to surgery is recommended. Ultrasonography has typically been used. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides better localization of the gonads and pre-surgical planning.

In this case series, we describe how MRI was utilized in planning surgical gonadectomy in 3 patients with complete AIS and to review the literature regarding MRI and AIS.

MRI prior to surgery was helpful in localizing and planning for removal of the gonads while preventing injury to other structures. Surgical specialists with experience with inguinal dissection were appropriately consulted when an inguinal dissection was likely to be needed to complete the gonadectomy.
