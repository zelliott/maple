We have presented two cases of chronic disabling exertional headaches following a minor head trauma. MRI studies of the cranio-cervical junction showed Chiari Type I malformation, without bony occipito-cervical dysplasia. Headaches after a mild trauma are a common finding. The exertional character of the headache can lead the clinician to his diagnosis in cases involving long-term complaints.
