A case of monophasic intra-articular synovial sarcoma in the right knee of a 39-year-old active duty serviceman treated with a transfemoral amputation is presented. The patient was evaluated for right knee pain and fullness. After further workup, the patient underwent computed tomography guided biopsy, with the tissue specimen consistent with intra-articular synovial sarcoma. The patient elected for a transfemoral amputation rather than limb or joint-sparing surgery. The gross specimen measured 3.5 × 3.0 × 1.7 cm in the posteromedial knee. No metastatic lesions were seen on positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy have not been utilized. The transfemoral amputation adds to the uniqueness of this report and is discussed with a review of the multimodality treatment toward intra-articular synovial sarcoma in prior published literature.
