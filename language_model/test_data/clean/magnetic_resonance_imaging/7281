Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Cardiac involvement may occur, leading to an adverse outcome. Although early treatment to improve morbidity and mortality is desirable, sensitive and accurate detection of cardiac sarcoidosis remains a challenge. Accordingly, interest in the use of advanced imaging such as cardiac MR and PET with (18)F-FDG is increasing in order to refine the clinical workup. Although the field is still facing challenges and uncertainties, this article presents a summary of clinical background and the current state of diagnostic modalities and treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis.
