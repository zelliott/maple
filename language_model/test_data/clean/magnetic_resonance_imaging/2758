Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated that Gd-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (Gd-DTPA), which normally does not cross the blood-brain or blood-CSF barriers, does so approximately 40 min after administration of glucose to a vitamin B1 deficient rat. The period of the onset of this blood-CSF or blood-brain barrier dysfunction coincides with our previous observations of accumulation of glutamate or glutamate derivatives following an equivalent glucose load under identical conditions of thiamin deficiency, consistent with a relationship between these two observations. The dysfunction was reversed when a thiamin deficient animal was made thiamin replete.
