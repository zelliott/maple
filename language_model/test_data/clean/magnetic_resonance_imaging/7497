Previous studies have shown that single or multiple treatments by focused ultrasound are effective and safe. However, most include focused ultrasound only and not radio-frequency treatment. There is paucity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements and pictures in the literature. This study aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and pain and satisfaction levels of the combination therapy of focused ultrasound and radio-frequency for improving body contours. Thirty-two Asian patients received 3 sequential treatments every 2 weeks in the abdominal region. Safety parameters and adverse events were recorded. The subjects' pain and satisfaction levels were evaluated using a five-point Likert scale. Two patients underwent MRI study randomly. There was a mean reduction in circumference of 3.91 ± 1.8 cm (p ≤ 0.001). In MRI measurement, the average in fat thickness reduction was 21.4 and 25% on the upper and lower abdomen, respectively. There were three mild and self-limited localized adverse events. The satisfaction survey showed that 71.9% was satisfied with the results, while pain level evaluation showed that 90.5% felt no pain. Combination therapy of focused ultrasound and radio-frequency for noninvasive body contouring is an effective, safe, and painless procedure in Asians. Although the change is minor compared to traditional surgical procedure, it is real, definite, and effective.
