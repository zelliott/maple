Our purpose was to evaluate how well diffusion-weighted MR imaging shows viral or bacterial encephalitis in comparison with conventional MR imaging that includes T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery sequences.

In nine of the 13 patients examined, diffusion-weighted imaging was superior to other diagnostic imaging sequences (fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery sequences in eight patients and a T2-weighted spin-echo sequence in one patient). Diffusion-weighted imaging can serve as a method of detecting early encephalitic changes.
