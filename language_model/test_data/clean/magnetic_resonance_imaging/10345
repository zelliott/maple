Changes after radical prostatectomy (RP) may present potential pitfalls in the interpretation of pelvic MRI studies in post-RP patients. One such change is retained seminal vesicles (SVs). The purpose of this study was to characterize the MRI features and evaluate the frequency of retained SV remnants in patients after RP.

Retained SV remnants are a common finding after RP. Most are fibrotic distal tips. Recognition of SV remnants may prevent their misinterpretation as local recurrences.
