Amyloid deposition in the seminal vesicle is a not unusual finding at autopsy. A case of MR findings of amyloid deposition in the seminal vesicles with urinary bladder cancer is reported. Invasion of the seminal vesicle could not be excluded on T2-weighted imaging, but gadopentetate dimeglumine may be useful in its ability to differentiate amyloid deposition from seminal vesicle tumor invasion.
