We wanted to assess the MR imaging findings of ovarian cystadenofibroma and cystadenocarcinofibroma, and we wanted to find clues for making the differential diagnosis between them.

The MR images of 12 pathologically proven cystadenofibromas and two cystadenocarcinofibromas were reviewed, with a focus on the internal architecture, signal intensity and enhancement.

All the tumors appeared as multilocular cysts, except for a single unilocular cystic mass and a single solid mass. The previously reported characteristic MR findings of cystadenofibroma (a multilocular cystic mass with a T2-dark-signal-intensity solid component containing small cystic locules) were found in only 43% of the tumors (6/14). Diffuse or partial thickening of the cyst wall with T2-dark signal intensity without a definite solid component was as common as the previous reported findings (6/14). Two cystadenocarcinofibromas showed more prominent solid portions with higher T2-signal intensities and stronger enhancement than did the cystadenofibromas.

Diffuse or partial thickening of the cyst wall with dark-signal-intensity in multilocular cystic masses may suggest ovarian cystadenofibroma, and this type of appearance may be as common as the previously reported characteristic appearance. A prominent solid component with a higher T2-signal intensity and strong enhancement are the typical findings of cystadenocarcinofibroma.
