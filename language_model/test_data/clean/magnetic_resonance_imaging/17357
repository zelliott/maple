Desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma is a rare World Health Organization (WHO) grade I tumor commonly arising in early infancy and usually presenting with both solid and cystic components. We report a case of a large midline-enhancing desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma in which newly formed cysts in communication with lateral ventricles contained highly proteinaceous fluid. Proteomic analysis of the fluid showed three proteins not normally found in cerebrospinal fluid. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor sample showed that the desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma produced a high concentration of ceruloplasmin, which probably accounts for most of the 30- to 40-fold increase in protein compared with normal cerebrospinal fluid. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ceruloplasmin secretion by a brain tumor, and ongoing studies on the mechanism might yield novel approaches to reducing cyst production and protein content in an otherwise stable solid tumor.
