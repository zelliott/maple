Chest pain is the most common presenting symptom of coronary artery disease. The assessment and appropriate management of patients with acute chest pain and non-diagnostic electrocardiograms (ECGs) remain a continuing clinical problem, with major logistic and financial implications for health-care providers. Cardiovascular imaging is at the forefront of health care, experiencing rapid changes over the recent years, particularly with the use of advanced medical technologies. Imaging techniques like acute rest myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), echocardiography, electron beam computed tomography (CT), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multi-detector CT (MDCT) have been used recently in the evaluation and triage of patients with chest pain in addition to the conventional investigations such as ECGs and cardiac biomarkers in the chest pain units. The annual potential cost savings, by incorporating the routine use of acute rest MPI in patients with low-to-moderate risk and non-diagnostic ECGs are substantial. The high negative predictive value of a normal resting MPI in patients with chest pain for myocardial infarction and future cardiac events is well established. Echocardiography is also considered to be useful but the technique is operator dependent and at present there is insufficient data to support its use. Cardiac MRI is expensive and time consuming and there is insufficient diagnostic and prognostic data to make it suitable for chest pain patients at present. There has been increasing interest in MDCT recently, especially with the advent of 64-slice CT but the sensitivity and specificity in chest pain patients are no better than MPI so far.
