Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) has been considered for development as a biomarker and analytical tool for evaluation of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we utilized analysis of the amplitude low-frequency ﬂuctuations (ALFF) to determine changes in intrinsic neural oscillations in 72 patients with PD. Two different frequency bands (slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz) were analyzed. In the slow-5 band, PD patients compared with controls had increased ALFF values mainly in the caudate and several temporal regions, as well as decreased ALFF values in the cerebellum and the parieto-temporo-occipital cortex. Additionally, in the slow-4 band, PD patients relative to controls exhibited reduced ALFF value in the thalamus, cerebellum, and several occipital regions. Together, our data demonstrate that PD patients have widespread abnormal intrinsic neural oscillations in the corticostriatal network in line with the pathophysiology of PD, and further suggest that the abnormalities are dependent on speciﬁc frequency bands. Thus, frequency domain analyses of resting state BOLD signals may provide a useful means to study the pathophysiology of PD and the physiology of the brain's dopaminergic pathways.
