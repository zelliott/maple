Imaging of the preterm infant brain has advanced dramatically beyond the earliest era of transillumination. Computed tomography (CT), a crucial innovation during the early 1970s, allowed noninvasive visualization of intracerebral lesions, particularly hemorrhage. The capability to document brain injury in the preterm infant led to better clarification of links to developmental outcomes. With the development of cranial ultrasound (CUS), and more recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT is used rarely for imaging the brain of preterm infants. Despite extensive experience with neonatal neuroimaging, significant questions still remain. Substantial controversies exist pertaining to when and how neuroimaging should be performed and how images should be interpreted.
