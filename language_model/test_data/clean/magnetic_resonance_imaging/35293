A 69-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with persistent hiccups. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were performed and revealed a glioblastoma multiforme localised in the right temporal lobe. After resection, the hiccups disappeared, suggesting that temporal areas are involved in control mechanisms of hiccups. A month later, the patient was readmitted because of skin, mucosal and soft tissue bleedings. Laboratory findings showed a prolonged aPTT, a low factor VIII activity and a factor VIII inhibitor, leading to the diagnosis of acquired haemophilia A. Acquired haemophilia A is a potentially life-threatening haemorrhagic disorder resulting from the presence of antibodies against factor VIII. We believe that this disorder developed due to exposure of factor VIII(-like) tumour antigens to the immune system. This case illustrates two yet unknown complications of a glioblastoma multiforme: persistent hiccups and acquired haemophilia A.
