The tethered cord syndrome (TCS) is a congenital malformation with a pathologic fixation of the spinal cord in the spinal canal. It presents clinically as musculoskeletal, cutaneous, urological and neurological manifestations. The diagnosis is based on the clinical manifestations and on the MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) of the lumbar spine. It is usually diagnosed in childhood, but the symptoms can appear in adult life.

We reviewed all the cases of TCS in the adult diagnosed in our hospital between 1998 and 2005. The following parameters were evaluated: mean age at onset, initial symptoms, signs, MRI findings and outcome.

Four 22 to 72 year old patients were diagnosed. The age at onset varied from 16 to 52 years old and the diagnosis took between 2 and 20 years to be established. The most frequent initial symptoms were the muscular atrophy and the motor weakness in the lower extremities. Two patients exhibited cutaneous stigmata (one had hypertrichosis and the other one a lipoma in the sacrum area) and one a partial agenesis of the sacrum. The most frequent MRI finding was a low lying cord with a lipoma in the sacrum area. In three patients the cord was detethered surgically, but only two of them improved.

The TCS is an uncommon disease in adult, which is usually diagnosed very late in the adult. Because of its insidious and non specific symptomatology, and of its potential surgical treatment, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of medullar syndromes and polyneuropathies.
