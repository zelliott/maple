To report a unique case of an orbital mass with atypical histopathologic features that although overlap with other granulomatous disorders, likely represents orbital involvement of systemic sarcoidosis.

Observational case report.

A 51-year-old woman presented with an orbital mass and was found to have mild proptosis and restriction of ocular motility. The remainder of her ophthalmic exam was unremarkable. Excisional biopsy revealed ill-defined granulomas with central necrosis, chronic inflammation and sclerotic collagen; several features consistent with granuloma annulare. Further systemic workup including laboratory and radiologic studies were compatible with a diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis.

Our case emphasizes the importance of a complete systemic workup with the detection of an orbital granuloma to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
