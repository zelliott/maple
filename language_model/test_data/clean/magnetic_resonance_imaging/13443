Small glomus jugulare tumors can be operated on successfully. The intraoperative risk of bleeding may be reduced by preoperative irradiation or angiographic embolisation. Patients with advanced tumors (bone destruction, paralysis or cranial nerves and/or invasion of brain) are at high risk if they are operated on. In these cases radiotherapy is an effective alternative with a fairly low complication rate. Prerequisites for successful irradiation are assessment of treatment volume and treatment planning by CT, sophisticated stereotactic irradiation techniques, application of high energy photons and reliable immobilisation measures. Furthermore it is possible to deliver higher doses, leading to regression of the tumor and its symptoms. The technique is illustrated by two characteristic cases. Although irradiation alone can achieve tumor remission the long term prognosis remains doubtful.
