We describe magnetic resonance findings in three patients with small bowel intussusception from different etiologies including idiopathic, adenomatous polyps, and hamartomatous polyps. Magnetic resonance findings showed a bowel-within-bowel appearance in two patients and a coiled-spring appearance in one patient. These findings were best shown on T2-weighted images, and clear definition was present on breathing independent T2-weighted images using half fourier acquisition snap shot turbo spin echo T2-weighted images.
