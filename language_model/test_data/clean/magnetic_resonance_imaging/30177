Brain herniation from hemispheric mass lesions injures mainly the upper brainstem around the tentorial incisura. While mechanical tissue compression is usually the process of deterioration and injury, the primary injury mechanism in some patients is early brainstem ischemia from arterial compromise as demonstrated by this patient's magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pathology.
