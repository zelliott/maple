Intracranial stab wounds are low-velocity, penetrating injuries to the brain and fatality and outcome significantly depend on route, depth and location of cranial penetration. Due to the effective barrier provided by the adult calvarium, most injuries occur through the orbitae or temporal regions where bony layers are thin. Self-inflicted intracranial stab wounds are an even rarer form of traumatic brain injury, with common entry points being the orbital space and the nose. Intracranial brainstem injuries mostly result in death, with reported penetration areas being the pons or midbrain.

The following report reviews a first reported case of self-inflicted intracranial stabbing via a trans-oral route with lesions to the medulla oblongata and cerebellum. Unlike previous cases of low velocity penetrating injuries to the brainstem, the patient underwent full neurologic recovery after manual knife removal and intensive rehabilitation.

Self-inflicted transcranial injuries have been mentioned only briefly and sporadically in the literature. This article highlights a rare case of self-inflicted intracranial stabbing with a not yet reported entry route and brainstem lesion. Unlike the other fatal outcomes associated with such injuries, the patient underwent full neurological and functional recovery through a comprehensive approach that included intensive rehabilitation.
