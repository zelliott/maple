We report the case of a 24-year-old man with a congenital meniscoid articular disc of the triangular fibrocartilage complex with extensor carpi ulnaris tenosynovitis. His young age, the normal articular cartilage, the lack of degenerative changes at the margins of the defect and its bilateral occurrence made this diagnosis likely. A congenital defect of the articular disc of the triangular fibrocartilage complex should not be misinterpreted as a traumatic rupture and is usually asymptomatic.
