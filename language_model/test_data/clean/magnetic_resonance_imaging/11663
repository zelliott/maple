We present a case of neurofibroma of the nasal cavity treated by endoscopic surgery. A 71-year-old female had complained of left-sided nasal obstruction for the past four years. Anterior rhinoscopy, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tumour involving the left nasal cavity. Histological and immunohistochemical examination showed the tumour to be a neurofibroma. The tumour was resected with endoscopic surgery. Neurofibroma arising in the area of the nose and paranasal sinuses is rare. We discuss the clinical and pathological characters of neurofibroma arising in the nasal cavity.
