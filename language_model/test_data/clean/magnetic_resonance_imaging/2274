MRI can demonstrate subtle morphological changes of the right ventricle in patients with idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia (RVOT). The present study examines the incidence and significance of right ventricular (RV) abnormalities detected by MRI with respect to the site of successful radiofrequency catheter ablation of the clinical tachycardia.

The study population comprised 20 patients (mean age, 40+/-12 years) undergoing elimination of recurrent RVOT by radiofrequency catheter ablation. MRI studies were performed before ablation to assess RV volumes and function, as well as structural abnormalities of the RV myocardium. Ten healthy age- and sex-matched subjects served as control subjects. The successful ablation sites, as documented by radiographs of the catheter position, were compared with MRI findings. Patients with RVOT showed no difference in respect to RV volumes and ejection fractions compared with control subjects. Whereas RV abnormalities were limited to prominent fatty deposits of the right atrioventricular groove extending into the inlet portion of the RV wall in 2 of 10 control subjects, MRI studies demonstrated morphological changes of the RV free wall in 13 (65%) of 20 patients with RVOT, including presence of fatty tissue (n=5), wall thinning (n=9), and dyskinetic wall segments (n=4). Eight of these patients had additional fat deposits, thinning, or a saccular aneurysm in the RV outflow tract, corresponding with the ablation site in 6 patients.

In RVOT, structural abnormalities of the right ventricle can be detected in a substantial number of patients despite normal RV volumes and global function. MRI abnormalities within the RV outflow tract are significantly associated with the origin of tachycardia.
