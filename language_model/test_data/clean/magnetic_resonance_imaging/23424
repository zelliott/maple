Some lesions such as cyst, loose body, and mass around the knee joint tend to localize at the posterior aspect of the proximal tibia. Although arthroscopic procedures of the knee joint's posterior compartment have been developed through posteromedial, posterolateral, and posterior trans-septal portals, the posterior aspect of the proximal tibia remains difficult to access and manipulate. We report an arthroscopic loose body removal and cyst decompression on the posterolateral aspect of the proximal tibia using a posterior trans-septal portal. This area represents a blind spot in knee arthroscopy.
