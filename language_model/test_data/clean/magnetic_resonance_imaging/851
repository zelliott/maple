To review the imaging methods used for the evaluation of disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to evaluate the results of their application in pharmacological trials.

Literature articles dealing with radiology, echography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with RA were evaluated in a non-systematic fashion.

Conventional radiology is the gold standard for the evaluation of disease progression in RA because of its diffusion, economy, and standardization. Different techniques have been proposed to evaluate radiological damage of the joints, with the Larsen's and Sharp's methods being most widely used. These methods are commonly used for the evaluation of the ability of DMARDs to slow RA progression. Among traditional DMARDs, gold salts, sulphasalazine, methotrexate, cyclosporin, and leflunomide have shown efficacy in slowing the appearance of new erosions. The same effect has been recently demonstrated for infliximab plus methotrexate, anakinra and etanercept. However, conventional radiology has several disadvantages, because it is monoplanar and has a low sensitivity to change. Newer imaging techniques, such as echography and MRI are extensively studied and have been used occasionally in the mediumterm evaluation of DMARDs, with promising results.

Although conventional radiology is still the gold standard for the evaluation of disease progression in RA, newer techniques are increasingly studied. In particular, standardization of echographic and MRI imaging of the joints is in progress.
