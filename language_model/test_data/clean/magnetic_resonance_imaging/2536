We report a 65-year-old male with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) who developed bilateral vocal cord abductor paralysis (VCAP). The patient was admitted to our hospital because of impaired gait. He was well until two years earlier, when he began to walk unsteadily. During the next two years, dysarthria and dysphagia developed and his gait worsened gradually. On admission, neurological examination showed impaired vertical and incomplete lateral gaze. His speech was slow and monotonous. Contractures were found in the neck muscles and elbows. The deep tendon reflexes were increased in the upper and decreased in the lower extremities. Babinski sign was negative. Snout and forced grasping reflexes were elicited. He showed marked bradykinesia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a midbrain tectum atrophy. Single photon emission tomography showed severe hypoper-fusion in the frontal cortex. No improvement was provided by the administration of levodopa-carbidopa, bromocriptine, droxydopa and amitriptyline. One month after admission, inspiratory stridor developed at night. The laryngofiberscopic examination demonstrated VCAP. An emergency tracheostomy relieved his respiratory distress. Although VCAP rarely occurs in neurodegenerative disorders other than multiple system atrophy, attention to VCAP should be required in PSP patients.
