Our experience indicates that the most accurate information concerning abnormalities in the breast is obtained by a dynamic technique, in which the signal intensity before and after contrast medium injection is compared. Up to the present, only a small number of sections (1 to 5) could be obtained by dynamic MR, so that only 30-50% of the breast, depending on its size, could be examined. The availability of gradient systems, with rapid switching and high gradient amplitude and duty cycle, makes it possible to obtain a larger number of sections. A new multi-section gradient echo sequence is described, which enables one to examine the entire breast using a dynamic technique (136 images of both breasts in 14.4 minutes). Subsequent automatic post-processing, using a graphic programme, results in quantitative evaluation of the contrast images. This new sequence can be applied to dynamic MR investigations of all large organs.
