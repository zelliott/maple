The bifrontal craniotomy approach used to be associated with a high percentage of olfactory tract damage. We present our experience with this technique, that was used with excellent results in a series of 11 patients that underwent the surgical approach described in this paper. We support the idea that bilateral subfrontal craniotomy allows a wide operative exposure as well as the complete anatomic and functional preservation of the olfactory tracts bilaterally.
