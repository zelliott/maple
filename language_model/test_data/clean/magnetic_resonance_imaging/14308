Thirteen MRT investigations of the knee region of nine children with neuroblastoma stage IV/III were performed in order to demonstrate bone-marrow metastases. The MRT-findings were correlated with bone-marrow cytology, immunofluorescence, and mIBG-scintigraphy. MRT showed a high sensitivity in demonstrating bone-marrow abnormalities, although bone-marrow aspiration and mIBG-scintigraphy will still be needed to make a specific diagnosis. On the other hand, signs of bone-marrow involvement in MRT investigations without positive findings in bone-marrow cytology and mIBG-scintigraphy may be the first evidence of bone-marrow metastases.
