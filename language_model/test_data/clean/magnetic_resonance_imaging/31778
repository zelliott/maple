Intradiscal biacuplasty (IDB) is a novel bipolar cooled radiofrequency system for the treatment of degenerative disk disease. We present the results of a pilot trial with 6-month follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: Fifteen patients, 22-55 years old, underwent one- or two-level IDB treatment of their painful lumbar discs. All had chronic low back pain >6 months, back pain exceeding leg pain, concordant pain on provocative discography, disc height >50% of control, and evidence of single- or two-level degenerative disc disease without evidence of additional changes on magnetic resonance imaging. IDB was performed under fluoroscopy using two radiofrequency probes positioned bilaterally in the intervertebral disc. Thirteen patients completed follow-up questionnaires at 1, 3, and 6 months. Pain disability was evaluated with Oswestry and Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaires.

Median visual analog scale pain scores were reduced from 7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6, 8) to 4 (2, 5) cm at 1 month, and remained at 3 (2, 5) cm at 6 months. The Oswestry improved from 23.3 (SD 7.0) to 16.5 (6.8) points at 1 month and remained similar after 6 months. The SF-36 Physical Functioning scores improved from 51 (18) to 70 (16) points after 6 months, while the SF-36 Bodily Pain score improved from 38 (15) to 54 (23) points. Daily opioid use did not change significantly from baseline: from 40 (95% CI 40, 120) before IDB to 5 (0, 40) mg of morphine sulfate equivalent 6 months after IDB. No procedure-related complications were detected.

Patients showed improvements in several pain assessment measures after undergoing IDB for discogenic pain. A randomized controlled study is warranted and needed to address the efficacy of the procedure.
