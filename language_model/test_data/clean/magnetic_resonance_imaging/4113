Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) were performed on a dog with a two year history of unilateral exophthalmos occurring two years following head trauma. On CT images, an expansile enhancing mass was present along the right intracranial cavernous sinus and extended through the orbital fissure into the retrobulbar space. With MRI, the structure appeared as a signal void due to the presence of rapidly flowing blood. Gadolinium enhancement of the adjacent brain was not present. A vascular origin of the lesion was confirmed with MRA. Based on the CT and MRI findings, the enlarged cavernous sinus and associated ophthalmic plexus were believed to represent an arterialized aneurysm, most likely the result of traumatic arteriovenous fistulization. Treatment consisted of surgical enucleation. At the time of this report, 29 months later, the dog remains free of clinical signs.
