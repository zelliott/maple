We have investigated proton magnetic resonance spectra of the basal ganglia in 41 medication-free outpatients with major depression, prior to starting an 8-week standardized trial of open-label fluoxetine, and 22 matched comparison subjects. Upon completing the trial, depressed subjects were classified as treatment responders (n = 18) or nonresponders (n = 23), based on changes in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Depressed subjects had a lower area ratio of the choline resonance to the creatine resonance (Cho/Cr) than comparison subjects. This statistically significant difference between the depressed subjects and comparison subjects was more pronounced in the treatment responders than in the nonresponders. There were no differences in the relative volumes of gray matter or white matter in the voxel used for proton spectroscopy in depressed subjects relative to comparison subjects. These results are consistent with an alteration in the metabolism of cytosolic choline compounds in the basal ganglia of depressed subjects and, in particular, those who are responsive to fluoxetine.
