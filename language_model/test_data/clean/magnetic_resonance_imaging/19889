We report our experience with 11 cases of foramen magnum meningiomas, eight originating inside the posterior fossa and three in the caudal region. The mean age of the patients was 50.8 years and the main complaint was cervical headache for at least 18.6 months and at the neurological examination, tetraparesis and deficit of the lower cranial nerves were very often observed. All patients were submitted to surgical treatment, always with exposition of the vertebral artery at the entry zone in the dura mater of the posterior fossa, with partial removal of the occipital condyle in only three cases. Total resection was obtained in seven patients and partial removal in the other four due to adherences to vessels and nerves. The prognostic was related to the neurological condition before surgery.
