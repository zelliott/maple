To assess the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the investigation of patients with suspected but nonproven vertebral metastases 45 consecutive patients referred in a 6 month period with known primary malignancy and back pain in whom an isotope bone scan was reported as equivocal were studied. All patients had abnormal isotope uptake localized to the spine. Twelve patients were shown to have bony metastases on plain X-ray. In the remainder, where X-rays showed normal or benign appearance, MRI of the spine was offered. Twenty-four patients underwent MRI examination which showed vertebral metastases in 11 cases. Magnetic resonance imaging is shown to be a useful, noninvasive, complementary investigation for evaluation of patients known to have malignant disease and suspected of having vertebral metastases on bone scintigraphy.
