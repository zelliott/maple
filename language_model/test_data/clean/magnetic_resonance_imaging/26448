A new portable magnetic resonance imaging device was built. Spatially resolved NMR was achieved by placing a gradient coil pair and a Helmholtz pair type radio-frequency probe in the gap between two antiparallel polarized permanent magnets. The flat face of the low-field (nu(proton) = 20 MHz) apparatus allowed for the study of arbitrarily large objects in situ. Relaxation time weighted 1D images were achieved over a 15-mm field of view by a single-point spin-echo sequence. A phase encoding time on the order of 200 micros permited the scanning of a wide range of heterogeneous materials.
