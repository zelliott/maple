A patient in whom a variety of abnormal EEG findings can be elicited by elimination of central vision and fixation demonstrates fixation-off sensitivity. The underlying mechanisms of fixation-off sensitivity and its relationship with alpha rhythm remain unclear. To obtain a better understanding of this issue, we used a whole-head magnetoencephalograph to study an epileptic child with fixation-off sensitivity resulting in a 3-Hz, large-amplitude oscillation (300 microV) over the occipital regions on the EEG. Magnetic source localization revealed alpha activity around the calcarine fissure and surrounding parieto-occipital areas. Magnetic sources of abnormalities relating to fixation-off sensitivity, however, usually were located deeper in the brain, suggesting more extensively distributed sources, with involvement of the cingulate gyrus and the basomesial occipitotemporal region. Distributions of the sources of both types of activities show independent clusters but also an appreciable domain of overlap. Our findings indicate that abnormalities related to fixation-off sensitivity can emerge in thalamocortical networks, with larger and more anterior cortical distribution than those that generate alpha rhythm. Transition in the type of oscillation appears not only to depend on a change in cellular dynamics but also to be reflected in a different spatial distribution of the underlying neuronal networks.
