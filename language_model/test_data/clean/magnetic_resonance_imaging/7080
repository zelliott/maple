Primary leiomyosarcoma of the heart is very rare, and in most cases the diagnosis is performed during postmortem examinations. We report on a 71-year-old woman with a large leiomyosarcoma of the right atrium. The preoperative diagnosis of cardiac tumor was made by 2-D echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, and MR-imaging, and was confirmed by histological and immunhistological findings of the resected part.
