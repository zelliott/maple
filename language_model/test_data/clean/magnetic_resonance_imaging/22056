We studied the appearance of retinoblastoma on unenhanced and gadolinium-enhanced images and the accuracy of tumour staging with MR imaging. The MR images were obtained in 18 children with retinoblastoma and compared with histopathological findings after enucleation. The MR imaging included T1-weighted and dual-echo T2-weighted images before, and T1-weighted images after, gadopentetate dimeglumine injection. The contrast between tumour and ipsilateral vitreous strongly increased (57 %) after gadolinium on T1-weighted images (p = 0.004). Tumour was strongly hypointense as compared with ipsilateral vitreous in all patients using heavily T2-weighted (TE = 120 ms) images (p = 0.001). The estimated T2 of tumour (mean 96 + 14 ms) did not correlate with histological grading or degree of calcification. Unenhanced T1-weighted MR images rightfully excluded extrascleral growth in 16 of 16 cases, but its presence was confirmed after enucleation in only one of 2 abnormal MR scans. Invasion of the optic nerve behind the cribriform plate was confirmed in 2 of 3 abnormal gadolinium-enhanced MR scans, but also in 1 of the 15 cases in which MR images were normal. The T2-weighted images were useful in assessing retinal detachment. We conclude that heavily T2-weighted images, unenhanced T1-weighted images and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MR images are complementary in characterizing and staging retinoblastoma.
