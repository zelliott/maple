Right hemiparesis with an ipsilateral hypesthesia and ataxia developed in a 57-year-old man. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a left thalamic lacune bordering the medial portion of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. This finding implicated some pathogenetic mechanism of ataxic hemiparesis.
