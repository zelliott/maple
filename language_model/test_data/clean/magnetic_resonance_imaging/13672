Aggressive angiomyxoma is a rare and nonmetastasizing soft tissue tumor of the pelvis and perineum and occurs almost exclusively in adult females. It infiltrates locally and has a high risk of local recurrence. Recommended treatment of the symptomatic patient is wide excision with tumor-free margins and close postoperative monitoring. Herein, a case of aggressive angiomyxoma in an adult male is described, which arose in the scrotum over 12 months. The tumor showed an intermediate signal on T1-weighted MRI images. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images showed good enhancement. Wide excision of the tumor was performed. The surgical specimen measured 7 x 5 x 5 cm in size and weighed 80 g. The tumor's surface was smooth and had a gelatinous cut surface. Grossly, it was encapsulated with a pleura-like membrane and had a finger-like projection. Microscopically, sections showed many walled vessels of various sizes, collagen fibrils, a loose myxoid background. and spindle stroma cells. MRI and CT showed the angiomatous and myxomatous nature of the tumor wall. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report to describe MRI findings in scrotal angiomyxoma.
