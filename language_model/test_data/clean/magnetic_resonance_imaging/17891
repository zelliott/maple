Categorization is essential for interpreting sensory stimuli and guiding our actions. Recent studies have revealed robust neuronal category representations in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). Here, we examine the specialization of LIP for categorization and the roles of other parietal areas by comparing LIP and the medial intraparietal area (MIP) during a visual categorization task. MIP is involved in goal-directed arm movements and visuomotor coordination but has not been implicated in non-motor cognitive functions, such as categorization. As expected, we found strong category encoding in LIP. Interestingly, we also observed category signals in MIP. However, category signals were stronger and appeared with a shorter latency in LIP than MIP. In this task, monkeys indicated whether a test stimulus was a category match to a previous sample with a manual response. Test-period activity in LIP showed category encoding and distinguished between matches and non-matches. In contrast, MIP primarily reflected the match/non-match status of test stimuli, with a strong preference for matches (which required a motor response). This suggests that, although category representations are distributed across parietal cortex, LIP and MIP play distinct roles: LIP appears more involved in the categorization process itself, whereas MIP is more closely tied to decision-related motor actions.
