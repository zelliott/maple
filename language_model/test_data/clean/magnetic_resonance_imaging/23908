A magnetic resonance imaging method is described for measuring the magnetic susceptibility difference between two homogeneous macroscopic compartments in contact with each other. A boundary condition is derived for the interface of the two compartments. This boundary condition predicts that across the interface there is a resonant frequency jump, which is a function of interfacial orientation relative to B0 field and the difference in susceptibility of the two sides. Based on this relationship, the magnetic susceptibility difference between two materials can be obtained from MR gradient echo imaging using signals from both sides in the vicinity of the boundary. This method is demonstrated by solution phantom experiments.
