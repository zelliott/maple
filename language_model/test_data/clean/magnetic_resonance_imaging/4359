Peroneal nerve injury usually results from fracture of the fibula neck or direct pressure from an ill-fitting plaster cast. Clinically, these patients present with "drop foot." Compression neuropathy caused by a ganglion is rarely encountered. This report concerns the clinical and radiologic evaluation of a 57-year-old man admitted to our clinic with left drop foot. A mass compressing the peroneal nerve at the level of the fibula neck was excised totally and diagnosed as a ganglion.
