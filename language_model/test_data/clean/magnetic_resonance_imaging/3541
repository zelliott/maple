Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a modality widely used to assess shoulder abnormalities in children. A thorough understanding of the development of the shoulder and adequate MR techniques are crucial in the radiologic evaluation. The immature skeleton is particularly vulnerable to insults such as trauma, infection, and inflammation, and responds in unique ways. The pediatric shoulder can also be affected by complex congenital deformities such as brachial plexus injuries. In addition, certain neoplasms can be seen specifically in the young patient. MR imaging plays a critical role in the initial diagnostic evaluation and in assessing posttreatment responses.
