Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are generally thought to have a congenital cause. This is the first report of an angiographically proven de novo cerebral AVM in an adult patient without previous vascular abnormality.

A 26-year-old African-American woman developed multiple cranial nerve deficits and ataxia over the course of a few days after a streptococcal throat infection. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed a hyperintense signal in the midbrain with extension into the diencephalon. A cerebral angiogram performed at that time to exclude vasculitis revealed normal cerebral vasculature. The patient was treated with corticosteroids, and symptoms resolved. Subsequently, at the age of 32, this patient presented with a severe headache and emesis, but with no focal neurological deficit.

The patient's cranial computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed a right posterior temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and cerebral angiography revealed a new 3- by 2-cm AVM. The patient underwent microsurgical resection of the AVM and associated hematoma. Postoperative angiography revealed no evidence of residual AVM.

This study details the case of a woman who developed a de novo cerebral AVM during a 6-year period. This report challenges the conventional belief that all AVMs have a congenital cause.
