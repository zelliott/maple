Early studies reported comparative results of functional outcomes between robot-assisted (RARP) and retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP). However, well-controlled single-surgeon prospective studies comparing the outcomes are rare.

To compare functional outcomes after RARP and RRP performed by a single surgeon, and to identify factors predictive of early return of continence and potency.

A total of 763 consecutive patients undergoing RP between 2007 and 2010 were prospectively included and serially followed postoperatively for comparative analysis.

RARP was performed in 528 patients, and 235 underwent RRP.

Continence was defined as being completely pad free. Potency was defined as having erection sufficient for intercourse with or without a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor. Continence and potency recovery were checked serially by interview and questionnaire at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 mo postoperatively. Cox proportional hazards method analyses was performed to determine predictive factors for early recovery.

After the initial 132 cases, patients who underwent RARP demonstrated faster recovery of urinary continence compared to RRP patients. Potency recovery was more rapid in the RARP group at all evaluation time points, beginning from the initial cases. In multivariate analysis, younger age and longer preoperative membranous urethral length seen by prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated statistical significance as independent prognostic factors for continence recovery; younger age, surgical method (RARP vs RRP), and higher preoperative serum testosterone were independent prognostic factors for potency recovery. The limitations of the present study were that it was nonrandomized and used interview to evaluate potency recovery.

Patients after RARP demonstrated superior functional recovery. Moreover, membranous urethral length on preoperative MRI and patient age were factors independently predictive of continence recovery, while patient age and higher preoperative serum testosterone were independent prognostic factors for potency recovery.
