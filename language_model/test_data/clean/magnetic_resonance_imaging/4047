We used magnetic resonance (MR) myelography in ten patients with injuries to the brachial plexus and compared the findings with those obtained by conventional myelography and postmyelographic CT (CTM). In the presence of complete nerve-root avulsion (seven cases), a post-traumatic meningocele was detected by MR myelography. In injuries to the upper roots (three cases) MR myelography showed abnormal findings with a high signal intensity in the nerve root, obliteration of the damaged nerve root, or enlargement and obliteration of the root sleeve. No pseudomeningoceles were detected in these upper-root injuries by MR myelography and CTM. The overall accuracy of detection of damaged nerve roots or root sleeves was better with MR myelography than with conventional myelography and was similar to that of CTM. MR myelography is non-invasive, relatively quick, requires no contrast medium, provides imaging in multiple projections, and is comparable in diagnostic ability to the more invasive, time-consuming techniques of conventional myelography and CTM.
