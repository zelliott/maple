Forty-two children treated for gangliogliomas were reviewed to identify the best methods of detection and management. Thirty-two of the tumors were supratentorial, four infratentorial, and six were in the spinal cord. Twenty-five patients presented with seizures; the mean duration of symptoms was 5 years in contrast to 1 year in non-seizure patients. Of 31 children studied by computed tomography (CT), calcification in the tumor lesion was found in 19. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormal high-signal intensity on T2 imaging in six of eight patients. All patients underwent surgical resection and were diagnosed pathologically. Twenty-four patients had total resection, and 14 underwent temporal lobectomies including hippocampectomy. The management of this tumor remains surgical resection without the need for any adjuvant therapy.
