Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is a rare disease of which prognosis could be adverse if diagnosis is delayed. Certain diagnosis is sometimes made complex because of undercurrent symptoms with pre-eclampsia or hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme, low platelet (HELLP) syndrome. Several reports announce an increase of incidence and illustrate cases confirmed by non-invasive methods. They permit early diagnosis and improve morbidity and mortality. Reviewing seven of the most important series of AFLP, we demonstrate how to use ultrasonography or computed tomography scan to confirm AFLP. However, liver biopsy should be realised after delivery in case of uncertain diagnosis.
