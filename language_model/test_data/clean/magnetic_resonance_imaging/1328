Despite recent technical advances in diagnostic imaging (computerised tomography, magnetic resonance), intramuscular haemangiomas are relatively uncommon and often difficult to diagnose. Angiosarcomas are probably the most important tumour to be differentiated from hemangiomas, in order to define the optimal therapeutic approach. Only biopsy allows a proper preoperative diagnosis, although this diagnostic technique involves some risks. Total excision is the treatment of choice. Radiotherapy has been employed without substantial results. A review of the literature and a case report are presented here.
