A case of a penetrating oral foreign body presenting with an aural polyp is described. The possibility of a penetrating oral injury should be considered whenever a child's fall is unwitnessed, as it is easily overlooked. An underlying foreign body should be considered in cases where an aural polyp fails to respond to standard therapy. MRI may be the best imaging technique to identify plastic foreign material.
