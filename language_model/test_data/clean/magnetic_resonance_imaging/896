A variety of acquired disorders cause chorea, such as hypoxia-ischemia injury, drugs, toxins, infections, autoimmune disorders, and endocrine and electrolyte abnormalities, but rarely subdural hematoma. We report the case of a 76-year-old woman who presented with sudden onset of generalized choreiform movements 1 day prior to admission. Computed tomography revealed a bilateral lateral convexity subdural effusion, which was later confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging as a chronic subdural hematoma. After surgical evacuation of the subdural hematoma, the choreoathetoid movements ceased completely. We propose that transient ischemia in the bilateral subcortical regions was from compression and distortion of the brain by the bilateral hematomas and resulted in generalized chorea.
