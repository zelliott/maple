We report the MR imaging findings of a solitary fibrous tumor involving the parapharyngeal space. The tumor was a well-circumscribed solid mass with a lobulated contour. It had the same signal intensity as the muscle on T1-weighted MR images, heterogeneously high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and homogeneous strong enhancement after the administration of contrast material. It mimicked a tumor originating from the deep lobe of the parotid gland.
