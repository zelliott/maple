Retrospective study on the results of surgical treatment of compressive cervical myelopathy in patients more than 75 years of age.

To investigate clinical features and surgical outcomes of compressive cervical myelopathy in aged patients and to discuss the role of surgical treatment.

There are few data focused on the outcomes of surgery in patients with cervical myelopathy who are more than 75 years of age.

Seventeen patients with compressive cervical myelopathy who underwent surgery were reviewed. The average age at the time of surgery was 77.2 years. Posterior decompression in 15 patients and anterior decompression in 2 patients were performed. Neurologic deficits before and after surgery were assessed using a scoring system proposed by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA score). Independence of daily living was evaluated. Radiologic features were examined with radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical results were compared with those of patients less than 65 years old as a control.

The preoperative mean JOA score was 6.1, the postoperative maximum JOA scores averaged 11.4, and the recovery rate was 48.4%. These were significantly inferior to scores in those less than 65 years of age. All seven of the patients who could not walk even with aids before surgery became independent in daily activities after surgery. At the final follow-up, the mean JOA score had decreased to 10.7 and the recovery rate to 39.1%. Five of nine patients whose follow-up periods were more than 5 years showed decreases in JOA score, although all patients were still ambulatory.

Surgical decompression for cervical myelopathy appears to be beneficial, even in patients more than 75 years of age, in improving neurologic function and ability to engage in activities of daily living.
