An unusual case of Type I Chiari malformation that became symptomatic after closed head injury is reported. The patient manifested transient upper extremity weakness, persistent lower cranial nerve dysfunction, and cerebellar signs that slowly resolved. Magnetic resonance images showed tonsillar ectopia but no displacement of the brain stem or syringomyelia. Type I Chiari malformation should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with upper extremity weakness, lower cranial nerve palsies, or cerebellar signs after trauma.
