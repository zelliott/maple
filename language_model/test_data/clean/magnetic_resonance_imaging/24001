Phase contrast velocity imaging is a standard method for accurate in vivo flow measurement. One drawback, however, is that it lengthens the scan time (or reduces the achievable temporal resolution) because one has to acquire two or more images with different flow sensitivities and subtract their phases to produce the final velocity image. Without this step, non-flow-related phase variations will give rise to an erroneous, spatially varying background velocity. In this paper, we introduce a novel phase contrast velocity imaging technique that requires the acquisition of only a single image. The idea is to estimate the background phase variation from the flow-encoded image itself and then have it removed, leaving only the flow-related phase to generate a corrected flow image. This technique is sensitive to flow in one direction and requires 50% less scan time than conventional phase contrast velocity imaging. Phantom and in vivo results were obtained and compared with those of the conventional method, demonstrating the new method's effectiveness in measuring flow in various vessels of the body.
