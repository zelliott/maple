Lyme disease involves multiple organ systems including in 10-15% of cases, the nervous system. Cranial neuropathies are observed in the second stage of the disease. The facial nerve is the most frequently affected nerve (20-30%). Facial nerve enhancement may be associated with cochleovestibular nerve abnormalities and can mimick an intracanalicular pseudomass. We present post-gadolinium enhancement of multiple cranial nerves associated to an intracanicular enhancement illustrated in a patient referred for a facial nerve palsy and presenting a Lyme disease. We discuss the differential diagnosis.
