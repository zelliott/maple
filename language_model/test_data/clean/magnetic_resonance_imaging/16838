We present a case of a third ventricle colloid cyst in a 65-year-old patient who was managed conservatively with neuroimaging surveillance. To our surprise, the cyst underwent spontaneous regression 19 months after initial diagnosis. To our knowledge there has only been one similar case previously reported in Glasgow, United Kingdom in 2008.
