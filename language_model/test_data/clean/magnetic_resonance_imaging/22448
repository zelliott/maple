The authors describe the case of a 72-year-old woman with dural plasmacytoma revealing an immunoglobulin (Ig) G-kappa multiple myeloma (MM). She presented with headaches and left hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a right frontal extraaxial lesion arising from the dura mater, and biological studies revealed hypercalcemia, hyperproteinemia, and a serum gamma globulin peak. A diagnosis of IgG-kappa MM was based on microscopic examination and immunohistochemical analysis of the dural plasmacytoma as well as on signs of systemic myeloma after surgery. The patient died 3 years after the first symptoms of MM despite systemic chemotherapy and no recurrence of the dural plasmacytoma. Myelomatous involvement of the dura mater is a rare occurrence given that only three cases have been reported to date. Nevertheless, this pathological entity should be differentiated from solitary dural plasmacytoma (SDP) because the prognosis is radically different. Progression seems to be correlated with systemic disease in contrast to the long-term survival associated with SDP. Careful systemic evaluation should be made in such a presentation to rule out MM, which would require different management and has a different prognosis.
