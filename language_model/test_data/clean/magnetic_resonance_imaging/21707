The study presents a case of transverse myelitis in a 22 year old male. MRI was used to establish the diagnosis. It ought to be mentioned that, according to the medical literature, cases with paraplegia and total sensory loss have a rather poor prognosis. Hence the described case is a rare example of transverse myelitis which was successfully treated.
