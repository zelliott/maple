The astrocytic contribution to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in metastatic and primary malignant brain tumors is not well understood. To better understand the vascular properties associated with metastatic and primary malignant brain tumors, the authors systematically analyzed the astrocytic component of the BBB in brain neoplasms.

Twelve patients who underwent resection of metastatic or primary brain neoplasms (4 metastatic lesions, 2 low-grade astrocytomas, 2 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 4 glioblastoma multiforme) were included. Clinical, MRI, operative, histopathological and immunohistochemical (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], CD31, and aquaporin 4 [AQ4]) findings were analyzed.

Intratumoral regions of MRI enhancement corresponded with breakdown of the normal astrocyte-endothelial cell relationship in the BBB in metastatic deposits and malignant gliomas. Metastases demonstrated lack of perivascular GFAP and AQ4 on CD31-positive intratumoral vessels. At the metastasis-brain interface, normalization of GFAP and AQ4 staining associated with intraparenchymal vessels was observed. Intratumoral vasculature in enhancing regions of high-grade gliomas revealed gaps in GFAP and AQ4 staining consistent with disintegration of the normal astrocyte-endothelial cell association in the BBB. Intratumoral vasculature in low-grade and nonenhancing regions of high-grade gliomas maintained the normal astrocyte-endothelial cell relationship seen in an intact BBB, with GFAP- and AQ4-positive glial processes that were uniformly associated with the CD31-positive vasculature.

Regions of MRI enhancement in metastatic and primary malignancies correspond to areas of breakdown of the physiological astrocyte-endothelial cell relationship of the BBB, including loss of normal perivascular astrocytic architecture on GFAP and AQ4 immunohistochemistry. Nonenhancing areas are associated with preservation of the normal astrocyte-endothelial cell relationship of the intact BBB.
