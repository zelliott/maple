To visualize the permeability changes in the blood-inner ear barriers of guinea pigs with acute mitochondria dysfunction and in patients with acute hearing loss using contrast agent-enhanced MRI.

An animal model of acute mitochondria dysfunction-induced hearing loss was created by introducing 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) intratympanically in guinea pigs. Vestibular disorder and hearing loss were evaluated. An MRI was performed at 2 h after either intravenous (IV) or intratympanic administration of dimeglumine gadopentetate (Gd-DTPA), using 3D fast-recovery fast spin-echo (FRFSE) and 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. The inner ears of patients with acute hearing loss were imaged using a 3D-FLAIR sequence with a 3 T MRI machine at 2 h post-IV injection with Gd-DTPA at a routine dosage.

Guinea pigs treated with 3-NP showed severe hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. MR imaging with a 3D-FLAIR sequence at 2 h post-IV injection of Gd-DTPA was an optimal method for visualizing transport augmentation through the blood-inner ear barriers. Apoptosis appeared in the stria vascularis and Reissner's membrane of cochleae treated with 3NP. Similar MRI changes were observed in patients with SSHL and Ménière's disease 2 h post-IV injection with Gd-DTPA using the 3D-FLAIR sequence.

Variations of Gd-DTPA transport through the blood-inner ear barriers induced by mitochondria toxin was visualized in guinea pigs using a clinical 3.0 T machine. IV injection of Gd-DTPA with 2 h of waiting time and imaging with 3D-FLAIR are optimal methods. The MRI observation of the inner ear in the animal model was translatable to patients with acute hearing loss, using an IV injection of Gd-DTPA at the routine dosage.
