Positron emission tomography and the glucose metabolic tracer [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose were used to evaluate the relationship between regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRglc), age, and performance on a delayed response (DR) test of memory in the aged monkey. Eleven aged animals, 21-26-years old, were included in the analysis. Regional CMRglc, normalized to values for the entire brain, were determined for the dorsal prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and temporal cortex. The aged animals exhibited significant DR deficits relative to a cohort of normal young monkeys. Variability in DR performance among the aged subjects was significantly correlated with relative hippocampal rCMRglc, and chronological age was a reliable predictor of orbitofrontal rCMRglc ratios. This pattern of results suggests that DR impairments in the aged monkey may partly reflect age-related dysfunction distributed among multiple limbic system structures that participate in normal learning and memory. Overall, the findings support the use of positron emission tomography in efforts to define the relationship between cognitive performance, age, and brain physiology in nonhuman primates.
