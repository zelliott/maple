Although melanoma of the right atrium is a rare cardiac tumor, melanoma in general has a high propensity to involve the heart. Unfortunately, however, when the tumor is involving the heart, widespread metastasis ensues and hence surgery becomes a questionable option. We report a case of a young female who presented with an advanced skin primary melanoma and regional lymph node involvement and a metastasis into the right atrium. Postoperatively tumor dissemination was controlled with adjuvant chemotherapy. A vigorous attempt aiming at tumor clearance followed by adjuvant multimodality therapy along with a tumor surveillance program may improve survival even in advanced cases.
