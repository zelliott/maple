The authors describe the case of a 15-year-old boy who underwent resection of a large left temporal tumor. During a normal postoperative course, computerized tomography (CT) scanning demonstrated a spherically hyperdense structure near the internal carotid artery, enlarging on a control CT scan. A suspected false aneurysm was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging; angiographic studies were negative. The authors believed they were dealing with a thrombosed false aneurysm and they performed operative revision. Intraoperatively the "aneurysm" could be dissected off the internal carotid artery and no lesion of the arterial wall was obvious. Histological findings showed a fresh blood clot. This case demonstrates that a blood clot may mimic an aneurysm on CT and magnetic resonance studies, which has not been described earlier. The origin of the blood clot remains unclear.
