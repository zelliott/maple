We synthesized a radiosensitizer KADTF, consisting of a hypoxic radiosensitizer, KU2280, bound to the side chain group of Mn-metalloporphyrin, which accumulates in tumor tissue. In the in vitro colony-forming activity test using HeLa cells, KADTF enhanced the effect of radiation under hypoxic conditions. Radiation therapy at 20 Gy, 1.5 h after infusion of KADTF (0.15 mM/kg), inhibited tumor growth more markedly than did a single radiation treatment. A clear tumor MR images of the SCCVII tumor was obtained at 1.5 h after administration of KADTF (0.1 mM/kg).
