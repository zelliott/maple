A 30 year old female with a fusiform aneurysm of the cervical vertebral artery causing nerve root compression and associated with neurofibromatosis-1 was successfully treated with endovascular methods which resolved the mass effect. This is the first report demonstrating the reduction of the mass effect of an aneurysm on a cervical nerve root with endovascular treatment by using MR neurography.
