Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic condition associated with increased risk of abnormal brain development. The relationship between a specific type of brain malformation and a distinct cognitive sign/deficiency remains unknown. This study investigated the frequency of brain malformations in children with neurofibromatosis type 1, and the impact of those brain malformations on cognitive performance. A retrospective examination was performed of cranial magnetic resonance imaging and clinical records in 604 neurofibromatosis type 1 patients. Eighteen patients with brain malformations and intellectual evaluations were available and compared to a subset of neurofibromatosis type 1 patients (n = 20) without brain malformations. The most common brain malformations included hypothalamic hamartomas and Chiari I malformation. More complex migration disorders were also observed. Comparisons of cognitive profiles between groups revealed differences in patients with hamartomas compared with those manifesting Chiari I malformations or control subjects. As a group, those with hamartomas demonstrated below-average global intellect, whereas patients with Chiari I or no malformations performed in the average range. Disorders in cell organization, expressed as brain malformations (hamartomas or more complex defects), may comprise part of the expression of organizational and developmental defects in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and possibly other rat sarcoma gene-mitogen activated protein kinase pathway disorders.
