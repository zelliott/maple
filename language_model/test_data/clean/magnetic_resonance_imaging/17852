The default mode network (DMN) has been linked to a number of mental disorders including schizophrenia. However, the abnormal connectivity of DMN in early onset schizophrenia (EOS) has been rarely reported.

Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to investigate functional connectivity (FC) of the DMN in 32 first-episode adolescents with EOS and 32 age and gender-matched healthy controls.

Compared to healthy controls, patients with EOS showed increased FC between the medial frontal gyrus and other areas of the DMN. Partial correlation analyses showed that the FC of medial frontal gyrus significantly correlated with PANSS-positive symptoms (partial correlation coefficient  = 0.538, Bonferoni corrected P = 0.018).

Although the sample size of participants was comparable with most fMRI studies to date, it was still relatively small. Pediatric brains were registered to the MNI adult brain template. However, possible age-specific differences in spatial normalization that arise from registering pediatric brains to the MNI adult brain template may have little effect on fMRI results.

This study provides evidence for functional abnormalities of DMN in first-episode EOS. These abnormalities could be a source of abnormal introspectively-oriented mental actives.
