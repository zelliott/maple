In the present study, we examined whether active range of neck motion (AROM) differed between persons with and without a diagnosis of whiplash-associated disorder type 2 (WAD2) and explored whether magnetic resonance (MR)-verified lesions of specific ligaments or membranes at the craniovertebral junction was associated with increased or decreased motion in any particular direction among the WAD2 patients. A CROM goniometer was used for registration of flexion, extension, side bending (left and right) and rotation (left and right), respectively. The neck structures considered were the alar and the transverse ligaments, and the tectorial and the posterior atlanto-occipital membranes. Our study comprised 87 WAD2 patients and 29 control persons without any known neck injury. For comparing mean values of AROM between the groups, t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used. WAD patients had on average a shorter range of active motion for all movements compared with the control group. The difference was statistically significant for all measures considered, except side bending to the left. Among the WAD patients, increasing severity of lesions to the alar ligaments was associated with a decrease in maximal flexion and rotation. A similar pattern was seen for lesions to the transverse ligament, but the trend test was not significant. An abnormal posterior atlanto-occipital membrane was associated with shorter range of left rotation, with a significant trend test both in analyses with and without adjustment for lesions to other structures. No significant association was found in relation to lesions to the tectorial membrane, but very few persons had such lesions. These findings indicate that soft tissue lesions may affect neck motion as reflected by AROM. However, since lesions to different structures seem to affect the same movement, AROM alone is not a sufficient indicator for soft-tissue lesions to specific structure in the upper cervical spine.
