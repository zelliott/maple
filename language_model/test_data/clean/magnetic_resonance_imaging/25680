We examined neuroradiological computerized tomography (CT) findings and the clinical course of four Japanese children with glutaric aciduria type I (GA1) whose enzyme activity of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase was undetectable. Brain CT in all cases examined showed low density white matter, fluid collection in bilateral frontotemporal regions (particularly surrounding the Sylvian fissures), enlargement of the lateral ventricles and slight atrophy of the basal ganglia. Although these findings seemed to be characteristic for GA1, they were unlikely to be more extended, at least over 2 years after infancy. The low density white matter was observed more evidently in the neonatal or early infantile periods than in later periods. The degree of enlargement of fissures in bilateral frontotemporal regions about the Sylvian fissures appeared to correlate with the severity of symptoms such as dystonia or choreoathetosis. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) in one case showed bilateral linear-shaped low intensity in areas of the external capsules and putamen on a T1-weighted image. These CT and MRI findings, as well as clinical symptoms such as choreoathetosis or dystonia, may suggest that metabolic abnormalities in GA1, such as glutaconate, are toxic to the extrapyramidal tract system in the central nervous system, and that the clinical symptoms of the patients are attributable to atrophy of basal ganglia. Brain CT may be useful in diagnosis and evaluation of the clinical course of GA1 patients.
