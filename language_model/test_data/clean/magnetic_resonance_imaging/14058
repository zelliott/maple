Our objective was to confirm that it is feasible to take images of the male and female genitals during coitus and to compare this present study with previous theories and recent radiological studies of the anatomy during sexual intercourse. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to study the anatomy of the male and female genitals during coitus. Three experiments were performed with one couple in two positions and after male ejaculation. The images obtained confirmed that during intercourse in the missionary position, the penis reaches the anterior fornix with preferential contact of the anterior vaginal wall. The posterior bladder wall was pushed forward and upward and the uterus was pushed upward and backward. The images obtained from the rear-entry position showed for the first time that the penis seems to reach the posterior fornix with preferential contact of the posterior vaginal wall. In this position, the bladder and uterus were pushed forward. A different preferential contact of the penis with the female genitals was observed with each position. These images could contribute to a better understanding of the anatomy of sexual intercourse.
