Lesions of the glenoid labrum and ligamentous structures commonly occur secondary to shoulder trauma and are a frequent cause of shoulder joint instability. Numerous eponyms, acronyms and subclassifications are used to describe the often confusing array of bony and labro-ligamentous abnormalities of the shoulder. This aim of this review is to illustrate the relevant features of these lesions and to provide a systematic and practical approach to imaging of the shoulder using MR arthrography.
