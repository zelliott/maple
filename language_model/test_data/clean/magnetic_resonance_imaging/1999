Congenital nasal epidermoid cyst without associated facial dysmorphism is an uncommon anomaly that is often asymptomatic. We report a case of occult nasal epidermoid cyst in a 12-year-old boy with initial nonspecific symptoms of fever, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. An enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a cystic lesion in the frontal skull base with expansion of the foramen cecum and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, accompanied with meningitis. An emergent surgical intervention was undertaken, and an infected epidermoid cyst was confirmed by pathology. He recovered uneventfully during a 4-week treatment with parentally-administered antibiotics. This significant case report demonstrates the importance of MRI in the early diagnosis of a life-threatening intracranial infection from an otherwise occult infected congenital nasal epidermoid cyst in children.
