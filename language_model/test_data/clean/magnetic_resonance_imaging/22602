Marchiafava-Bignami disease is a rare disorder of an unknown aetiology that is marked by focal demyelinisation in the corpus callosum. Chronic alcohol abuse plays an important role in its development. Its course is unfavourable, although rare cases of clinical improvement confirmed in MRI have been reported. Until now, no case of Marchiafava-Bignami disease diagnosed intra vitam was so far described on the territory of Poland. The authors present such a case with favourable course. A 52-year-old male with chronic alcoholism was hospitalised due to altered consciousness which developed subacutely prior to admission. The first MRI scans yielded demyelinating lesions in the corpus callosum. The clinical and radiological findings were consistent with the diagnosis of Marchiafava-Bignami disease. Thiamine, vitamin B12, folic acid and amantadine were administered, which resulted in an improvement in both motor and cognitive functions. Control MRI scans revealed remyelinisation of the corpus callosum. Hence, this technique proved itself to be useful in monitoring the course of the disease.
