In a now 53-year-old woman, who suffered from recurrent syncope and dizziness, a biatrial myxoma originating from the interatrial septum was resected nearly 4 years ago, and the resulting septal defect was closed by a Dacron patch. In the symptomless patient the recurrent myxoma was revealed by echocardiography. The left atrial myxoma was surgically removed without repeat heart catheterization. This case underlines the importance of regular, echocardiographic follow-up examinations in patients in whom a myxoma has been excised. In case of suspicious findings, an additional transesophageal examination or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging should be performed.
