A mega-corpus callosum (CC) is not a common manifestation of neurological disease. Previous reports of patients with a constellation of findings including megalencephaly, perisylvian polymicrogyria, distinct facies, psychomotor retardation and mega-corpus callosum were designated as having megalencephaly, mega-corpus callosum, and complete lack of motor development [OMIM 603387; also referred to as megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-mega-corpus callosum (MEG-PMG-MegaCC)] syndrome. Three patients were initially reported with this syndrome, and a fourth was reported recently. Another case had similar findings in utero and upon autopsy. We present an additional patient who conforms to this phenotype; however, he is not megalencephalic, but has a normal head circumference in the setting of short stature. This patient is also noted to have abnormal saccades and mask-like facies. His motor function is more developed than in the other reported patients and was further improved by treatment with L-DOPA/carbidopa, which was started because of his extrapryramidal symptoms and signs which were associated with low cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) catecholamine levels.
