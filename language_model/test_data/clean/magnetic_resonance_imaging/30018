Hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) are rare congenital lesions of the tuber cinereum presenting with the classic triad of gelastic epilepsy, central precocious puberty (CPP) and developmental delay. In light of the important and diverse consequences of precocious puberty for affected children and their families, a correct diagnosis without delay is imperative. We present here a rare case of a 7-month-old infant girl with CPP and HH who was successfully treated with depot gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue is presented.
