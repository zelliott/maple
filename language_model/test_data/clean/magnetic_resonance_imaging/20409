We report a case of an adult patient who presented a febrile coma linked to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encephalitis. EBV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood serology and PCR in blood was consistent with an EBV reactivation. First cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at day 1 was normal but a second MRI at day 13 showed anomaly compatible with a hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis. Treatment consists of intravenous corticotherapy and aciclovir during 21 days. Evolution was favourable with complete neurologic recuperation and no intercurrent lymphoma or vasculitis in 6 months follow-up.
