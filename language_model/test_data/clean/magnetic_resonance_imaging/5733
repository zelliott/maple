Avulsion fractures involving the radial wrist extensor tendons are extremely rare. Only 8 avulsion fractures of the extensor carpi radialis longus and 7 avulsion fractures of the extensor carpi radialis brevis have been previously reported. We know of no case involving an isolated avulsion fracture of the base of the third metacarpal where the extensor carpi radialis brevis attachment to the fracture fragment was still completely intact. This article reports a patient with an isolated avulsion fracture of the extensor carpi radialis brevis insertion treated by open reduction and internal fixation. The avulsion fracture was the result of a poor punching technique. The patient healed uneventfully, and returned to full painless activity. The senior author (S.W.B.) of this article is a former Tae Kwon Doe instructor and includes some editorial comments on proper technique for punching to avoid injury.
