A 32-year-old female presented with a right renal mass detected by abdominal ultrasound examination at a routine medical check up. Computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance images revealed a solid tumor in the upper pole of the right kidney measuring 1.5 cm in diameter. Partial nephrectomy was performed on suspicion of the renal cell carcinoma. Histologically, the tumor is composed of small, uniform, epithelial cells with scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic round nuclei that formed a tubular or glomerular-like structure. The histological diagnosis was metanephric adenoma.
