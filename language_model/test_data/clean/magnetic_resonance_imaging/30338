Auditory aura is a rare symptom in focal epilepsy. It has been described in autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features, but is, in general, poorly documented. We report on a 7-year-old, right-handed boy, who suffered seizures characterized by positive auditory illusions with verbal and gestural automatisms and noticeable attempts at covering his ears. Clinical evaluation and video-recording of the seizures, confirmed that most of the ictal behavior was deliberately directed at trying to prevent the unpleasant sensations reaching his ears.
