Magnetic resonance imaging is superior to radiographic and scintigraphic examination for pathologic evaluation of the musculoskeletal system. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates increased sensitivity and specificity compared with radiographic evaluation, and equal sensitivity and increased specificity compared with scintigraphic examination. Two case studies of magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of heel pain involving a calcaneal stress fracture and a capillary hemangioma are presented.
