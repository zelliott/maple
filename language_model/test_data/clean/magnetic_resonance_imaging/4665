We report three cases of oesophageal complications due to pressure necrosis secondary to screws post anterior plate fixation of the cervical spine. Two of the patients were treated using primary closure; and the third by conservative treatment, which consisted of wound drainage and an external orthotic device application. We recommend the early surgical closure and removal of the metallic implant with debridement as the first option of treatment. In the event that this option is not suitable, we suggest that wound drainage, tube feeding and parenteral antibiotics may be an appropriate alternative.
