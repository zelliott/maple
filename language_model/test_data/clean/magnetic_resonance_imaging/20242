Pre- and postoperative fMRI was performed in patients with rolandic gliomas to evaluate factors influencing motor function after surgery.

The study population consisted of 9 right-handed patients (mean age, 43.3 years; range, 25-67, 2 female/7 male) affected by high-grade gliomas growing within or adjacent to the rolandic cortex. Patients had a diverse onset and evolution of their disease. All patients underwent morphological imaging and fMRI on a 3-T scanner before and after surgery. Postprocessed imaging data were analyzed off-line using SPM.

Patterns of activation in real-time maps and SPM were similar when coregistered head motion artifacts did not exceed more than 50% voxel size of the echo-planar imaging sequence. Movements of the hand opposite the affected hemisphere showed activation of the cMI in all patients. Coactivation of the iMI occurred in 5 patients. The cMII was activated in 4 patients, all with excellent postoperative motor function. The iMII and SMA were activated in patients with a good functional outcome. When the unaffected hand was tested, this activation pattern was similar. Postoperative fMRIs were comparable with the preoperative scans.

Postoperative evaluation is feasible and may add confirmatory information to preoperative findings in selected patients. Bilateral activation of primary and secondary motor areas may be the correlate for compensatory recruitment of additional functional areas and a predictor for better functional outcome.
