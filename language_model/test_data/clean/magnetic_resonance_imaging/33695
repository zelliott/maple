Chest wall involvement by a peripheral lung neoplasm, found in 4-8% of the cases, makes a difference in both staging and surgical approach. In the evaluation of the regional extent of the tumor, the radiologist must give the surgeon as much information as possible about relationships between lung neoplasm and chest wall structures, to correctly evaluate stage-T2 cancers and differentiate them from stage-T3 cancers. The authors report the results of a study made to assess the value of Computed Tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to define chest wall invasion by a peripheral bronchogenic carcinoma. To this purpose 25 patients with primary peripheral lung neoplasm were studied with CT, US and MRI and the results were compared with surgical findings by means of TNM classification. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 68% and 74% for CT, 74% and 72% for US and 88% and 86% for MRI, respectively. CT, which still plays the major role in staging lung cancer, seems to get the worst results because of its impossibility to differentiate the cancers adjoining the chest wall from those showing signs of initial invasion. In these cases the use of the other imaging techniques (US, MRI) depends on their availability and on the specific experience of the radiologist.
