Our aim was to investigate the usefulness of multisection dynamic MR imaging using a 3D FLASH technique during breath holding in assessing myometrial invasion by endometrial carcinoma.

Twenty-eight endometrial carcinomas were evaluated with pathologic correlation. Dynamic MR imaging was performed using the 3D FLASH technique during breath holding. We compared accuracy in the assessment of myometrial invasion by endometrial carcinoma between T2-weighted images, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, and dynamic MR images.

The accuracy rates in estimating myometrial invasion with T2-weighted images, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, and dynamic MR images were 64.3%, 67.8%, and 85.7%, respectively. Statistically significant differences were seen between dynamic MR images and both T2-weighted images and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images.

Multisection dynamic MR imaging using the 3D FLASH technique during breath holding is useful for the evaluation of myometrial invasion by endometrial carcinoma with polypoid growth or an unclear junctional zone on T2-weighted images.
