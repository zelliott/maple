To evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic confidence of MRI with an open low field System (Magnetom open, Siemens, Germany) in children with predominantly traumatic disorders.

Conventional X-rays and MRI examinations have been evaluated in 55 children. MRI was performed at an open 0.2 T MR-unit. The study protocol comprised coronal STIR-sequence, an angulated T2 weighted TSE-sequence and T1 weighted SE-sequence.

MRI showed ligamental rupture in 33/50 (60%) cases. Injuries of the ATFL were most frequent (27/33); osseous ligamental tears occurred in approx. 50% of all cases. Fractures of the distal tibia and fibula were diagnosed in 28/55 children. 15/28 cases showed an involvement of the epiphysis. We found occult fractures in 11/28 children. Fractures, diagnosed by conventional x-rays, were excluded in 6 cases. Therapy changed in 35/55 patients on the basis of MRI-findings.

Low-field MRI of the ankle joint in children and adolescents is able to show numerous pathological conditions. We recommend low-field MRI of the ankle in children with persistent or unclear pain of the ankle joint and inconspicuous conventional x-ray.
