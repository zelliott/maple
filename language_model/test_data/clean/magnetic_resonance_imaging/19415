Acute vascular lesions limited to the midbrain can yield varied disturbances of eye movements. They are more often infarcts than hemorrhages.

We present the case of a 49 year old, non-hypertensive man who presented with sudden onset of bilateral up and down gaze palsy. CT defined a unilateral hemorrhage in the right mesencephalic tegmentum.

Cases of upward and downward gaze palsy in association with unilateral upper midbrain hemorrhage are very uncommon. We present a new case.
