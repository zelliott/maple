Intracranial schwannomas not arising from the facial, trigeminal, or vestibular nerves in the absence of neurofibromatosis are extremely rare. We report a case of a schwannoma arising in the region of the anterior tentorial hiatus and posterior cavernous sinus. A 17-year old girl presented with headaches and intermittent diplopia. An MRI of the brain revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass adjacent to the free edge of the tentorium, superior to the cerebellopontine angle. An orbitozygomatic pterional craniotomy was done with complete resection of the tumor. Postoperatively, the patient remained neurologically intact. The clinical presentation and treatment of schwannomas arising in this location are discussed.
