Recurrent cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), as a manifestation of paraneoplastic angiitis and revealing of nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease (NLPHD), is an extremely rare condition. We herein report a 55-year-old man who developed recurrent CVT despite efficacious anticoagulant therapy and subsequent stenting of the superior longitudinal sinus. Progressive neurological deterioration ensued and a body scan revealed axillary lymph nodes. Pathological analysis led to a diagnosis of NLPHD. Conventional angiography showed CVT and multiple arterial narrowings. A paraneoplastic primary cerebral angiitis with prominent venous structure involvement was suspected. Immunotherapy using rituximab and steroids provided a dramatic recovery. This case of CVT due to paraneoplastic cerebral angiitis is a rare condition and represents a new, very rare manifestation of nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease.
