The case of a female patient who had undergone mastectomy for infiltrating ductal carcinoma and come to the Orthopedics Division for lumbosacral pain unresponsive to conventional treatment is discussed. Pelvic X-ray, CT and scintigraphy were performed. The presence of multiple areas of selerosis of the pelvis and proximal femurs were documented. The differential range could be limited to osteoblastic metastasis and osteopoikilosis. The diagnosis of osteopoikilosis was established based on scintigraphy which proved the absence of uptake of the radiotracer.
