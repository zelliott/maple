Idiopathic syringomyelia is a disease with variable clinical course. We report here two cases of spontaneous resolution of cervical syrinx in adults previously diagnosed of Chiari-syringomyelia complex. They are added to the nine cases previously reported, and documented the need for careful surgical indication in this disease based on the radiological images of spinal cord cavitation.
