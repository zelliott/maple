DC00166e and acute unilateral deafferentation of the auditory periphery (auditory and vestibular afferents) can induce changes in the central nervous system that may result in unique forms of tinnitus. These tinnitus perceptions can be controlled (turned on and off) or modulated (changed in pitch or loudness) by performing certain overt behaviors in other sensory/motor systems. Clinical reports from our laboratory and several other independent sources indicate that static change in eye gaze, from a neutral head-referenced position, is one such behavior that can evoke, modulate and/or suppress these phantom auditory events. This report deals with a new clinical entity and a form of tinnitus that can be evoked directly by cutaneous stimulation of the upper hand and fingertip regions. In 2 adults, cutaneous-evoked tinnitus was reported following neurosurgery for space-occupying lesions at the base of the skull and posterior craniofossa, where hearing and vestibular functions were lost completely and acutely in one ear (unilateral deafferentation) and facial nerve paralysis (unilateral deefferentation) was present either immediately following neurosurgery or had occurred as a delayed-onset event. Herein, we focus on the phenomenology of this discovery, provide perceptual correlates using contemporary psychophysical methods and document in one individual cutaneous-evoked tinnitus-related neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In a companion paper, neuroanatomical and physiological interactions between auditory and somatosensory systems, possible mechanistic accounts and relevant functional neuroimaging studies are reviewed.
