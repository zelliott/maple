Multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) usually shows poor responsiveness to dopaminergic medications. We herein describe a patient with MSA-P who exhibited a good response to pramipexole but not to an ordinary dose of L-dopa. Positron emission tomography (PET) displayed severely impaired presynaptic dopaminergic availability and relatively preserved postsynaptic D2 receptor binding capacity. The pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated relatively low bioavailability for L-dopa and adequate plasma levels of pramipexole, even at baseline, on a stable daily dose. The PET features and pharmacokinetic differences between L-dopa and pramipexole indicate the presence of unique therapeutic responses to dopaminergic medications in the patient.
