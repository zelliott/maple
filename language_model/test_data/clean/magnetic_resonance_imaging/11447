The options for peripheral joint imaging in inflammatory joint diseases have increased markedly over the last few years. High-frequency ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging in particular appear to have a large potential in the diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication of these diseases. However, the new methods have still to be fully validated. In clinical practice, it is essential to use a validated method, generally conventional radiography, as the first "basic" imaging modality. As newer methods may provide significant additional information, it is also very important that the value of these is evaluated in scientific studies. This article reviews current knowledge of conventional radiography, computer tomography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of peripheral joints in inflammatory joint diseases.
