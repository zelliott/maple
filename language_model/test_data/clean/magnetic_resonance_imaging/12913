To investigate the perception of fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by women confronted with the necessity of a targeted prenatal examination because of suspicion of an abnormality, in order to develop a pre-scan information leaflet tailored to the information requirements of these women.

Sixty-two women were assessed by qualitative interview immediately before and after scanning. Data were analyzed by means of a qualitative content analysis. The transcribed interviews were coded within established categories, including knowledge of the purpose of the exam, understanding of the procedure, expectation of the baby's reaction, satisfaction with pre-information, experience of fetal MRI, distressing conditions during scanning, anxiety and suggestions for improvement of the scanning procedure.

Pre-scan interviews indicated 66% of our sample to be well-informed about the purpose of fetal MRI. A realistic, detailed description of the examination was given by 37%. Only 32% expected the scanning to be safe for their baby. Despite the overall good tolerance of fetal MRI (63%), post-scan interviews revealed that 58% of women had experienced anxiety during MRI, which was partly due to the fearful perception of intensified fetal body movements during scanning. The quality of the pre-information leaflet was rated as sufficiently informative by 68% of the women. Suggestions for improvement were centered on physical conditions, the presence of the partner during scanning, and the availability of pre-scan briefings.

Based on women's needs, detailed information about the fetal MRI procedure should be provided, containing clear-cut explanations about the purpose, course, method and possible distressing conditions. A leaflet describing these details should be given to women by the referring physician well in advance of the examination, and the woman given the opportunity to discuss unclear points.
