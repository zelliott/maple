Castleman's disease is an atypical lympho proliferative disorder comprising hyaline vascular elements, plasma cells, or a mixture of both, which can present in unicentric or multicentric fashion. Resection of unicentric lesions is typically curative, but multicentric disease, also characterized by constitutional symptoms and a poorer prognosis, often requires treatment with chemotherapy, radiation, steroids, or immune modulators. Castleman's disease is rarely diagnosed in the orbit. The authors present the clinical and histopathological findings of a 17-year-old who was found to have a focal lesion in her orbit. She was successfully treated with surgical resection and was free of disease recurrence or other sequelae at 10-months follow up.
