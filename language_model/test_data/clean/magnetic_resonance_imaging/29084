A transceive RF birdcage coil designed for very high field with a novel matching scheme was implemented with the specific geometry chosen for the human knee. This coil design incorporates a hinge for greater patient accessibility. Volunteer human subjects were studied using spin-echo and 3D gradient echo sequences for image acquisition. The higher signal-to-noise and improved tissue contrast obtained from this high-field system, coupled with the optimized coil design, improves visualization of the structural detail in articular cartilage, which is not seen well at conventional field strengths. This has important clinical implications, as newer medical and surgical treatments become available for the treatment of early cartilage degeneration. Magn Reson Med 42:215-221, 1999.
