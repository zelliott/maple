Contemporary technological developments revolutionized management of brain tumors. The experience with information-guided surgery of gliomas, based on the integration of the various intraoperative anatomical, functional, and histological data, is reported.

From 2000 to 2009, 574 surgeries for intracranial gliomas were performed in our clinic with the use of intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) with magnetic field strength of 0.3T, updated neuronavigation, neurochemical navigation with 5-aminolevulinic acid, serial intraoperative histopathological investigations of the resected tissue, and comprehensive neurophysiological monitoring. Nearly half of patients (263 cases; 45.8%) were followed more than 2 years after surgery.

Maximal possible tumor resection, defined as radiologically complete tumor removal or subtotal removal leaving the residual neoplasm within the vital functionally-important brain areas, was attained in 569 cases (99.1%). The median resection rate constituted 95%, 95%, and 98%, for WHO grade II, III, and IV gliomas, respectively. Actuarial 5-year survival was significantly worse in WHO grade IV gliomas (19%), but did not differ significantly between WHO grade III and II tumors (69% vs. 87%).

Information-guided management of gliomas using low-field-strength ioMRI provides a good opportunity for maximal possible tumor resection, and may result in survival advantage, particularly in patients with WHO grade III neoplasms.
