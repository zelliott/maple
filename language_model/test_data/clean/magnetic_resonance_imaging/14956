Radiological studies can confirm or rule out competing diagnoses for musculoskeletal injuries and pain. Obtaining a detailed history and physical examination is pivotal for localizing the pain generator and choosing the most appropriate imaging studies, based on the suspected injured tissue. Judicious use of imaging is important to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure, minimize cost, and avoid therapy targeting asymptomatic imaging abnormalities. This article compares and contrasts the diagnostic imaging commonly used for detecting musculoskeletal injuries.
