Neuroblastoma is the foremost malignant neoplasm of the fetus and neonate. It is a tumor of the sympathetic nervous system that originates from the neural crest which etiology is largely unknown. Due to its general variability in outcome, neuroblastoma has long been considered one of the most enigmatic of cancers. Although technological advances in ultrasonography have possible intrauterine detection, prenatal diagnosis is still a rare event. This kind of tumor has a high morbidity and mortality rate due to the metastatic risk. Early detection of the tumor is critical to improve outcome. We report a case of retroperitoneal neuroblastoma diagnosed at 32 week of gestation.
