Optimization of pelvic MRI by a new concept of water-equivalent bowel contrast agent.

We performed contrast enhancement of the bowel by oral application of 1000 ml of an aqueous mannitol solution one hour before pelvic MRI. In addition we performed an enema by 250 ml of water in one patient.

Oral and rectal contrast enhancement of the bowel was tolerated without complications by our patients. Pelvic MRI was improved by a better delineation of the bowel.

The concept of water-equivalent bowel enhancement is promising. It must be assessed by further studies; in particular, it must be compared with the available concepts of positive and negative bowel contrast enhancement.
