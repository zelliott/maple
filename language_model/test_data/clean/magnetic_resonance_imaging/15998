We evaluated the ability of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to identify acute new-onset heart failure (HF) with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), whether or not in relation to underlying coronary artery disease (CAD), in patients with no clinical evidence of associated ischaemic cardiomyopathy.

Hundred consecutive patients admitted with acute new-onset decompensated HF and EF <40%, with no clinical or electrocardiographic data suggestive of CAD. The patients were classified according to the presence or absence of significant CAD (stenosis > or =70% in at least one major vessel). Twenty-one patients (21%) had significant CAD. Seventy-nine (79%) had no lesions. Eighteen of the 21 patients (85%) with CAD had subendocardial/transmural LGE. In the diagnosis of CAD, LGE has a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI, 80-91) and specificity of 92.4% (95% CI, 87-96), respectively, with a negative predictive value of 96% (95% CI, 90-99). It has an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.906 (95% CI, 0.814-0.998).

In patients with new-onset HF and LVSD for whom there are no clinical and exploratory data suggestive of ischaemic heart disease, CMR with LGE is an excellent means of ruling out significant CAD and is a valid alternative to angiography.
