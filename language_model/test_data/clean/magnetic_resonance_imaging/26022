Primary tumors of the heart are usually benign, with the malignant forms being rare. In this article we report the case of an angiosarcoma with the only manifestation being a cardiac tamponade. When the patient being admitted to the hospital, an important differential diagnosis was pulmonary tumor. A mass in the right atrium was later detected in the echocardiogram. Further image studies, such as MRI, showed spectacular images of this mass suggestive of neoplasm. An intra-operatory biopsy diagnosed the mass as an angiosarcoma. Since there was no evidence of primary neoplasm in other studies carried out, the neoformation was diagnosed as a primary angiosarcoma. Surgery was carried out with a survival of only 13 months after the procedure. We also use this case to make a brief review of the primary tumors of the heart, especially angiosarcomas.
