We measured serial changes in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW) and in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 1 to 3 hours after induction of acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) in rats, to assess the rate of development of cytotoxic edema and ischemic brain damage observed in this model. Cortical ADC values underneath the hematoma in ASDH rats (n = 12) were significantly lower than those in sham-operated rats (n = 5) at 1 hour. By 3 hours, the area of ADC abnormality had further increased. The lesion areas, as percentage of hemispheric areas on 1- and 3-hour ADC maps, correlated significantly with those on the histologic sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The results indicate that DWI with ADC mapping may provide a valuable diagnostic tool for monitoring of early pathologic changes following subdural hematoma in head-injured patients.
