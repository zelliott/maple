Ovarian Brenner tumor is an uncommon epithelial tumor that accounts for 1.5% to 2.5% of all ovarian neoplasms. These tumors are usually benign. Whereas the magnetic resonance imaging features of benign Brenner tumors have been described, reports of malignant findings are limited. We report a case of borderline malignant Brenner tumor that imaged as a cystic lesion with papillary projections and solid elements.
