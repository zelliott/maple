The authors report a newly devised nerve stimulator and its clinical application in thoracoscopic surgery. The stimulator is a monopolar system, that has a long extension between the electrodes and the handle. The stimulator is inserted into the chest cavity through a portal, and is used to distinguish motor nerves from the surrounding tissue and to determine whether there is nerve involvement with tumor. The tumor is then safely and rapidly resected by thoracoscopic technique and the major nerves are spared. This method was used in two clinical cases, with excellent results obtained, and with no major complications.
