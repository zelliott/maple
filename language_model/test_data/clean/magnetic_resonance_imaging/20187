The authors have retrospectively studied the trends in etiology, symptoms, and rate of recurrence for adolescents with disk herniations to determine the age at onset of symptoms, mechanism of injury, familial history, pattern of symptoms, level of herniation, method of treatment, and rate of recurrence. The review revealed a higher incidence of adolescent lumbar disk herniations in female patients and a higher percentage of patients with a family history than previously reported. Leg pain continues to be the primary presenting symptom in this group of patients and is often not recognized as the radicular pain of a herniated disk by the primary care physician. This reflects a lack of understanding of the relationship of the presenting symptoms to the pathology of the herniated nucleus pulposus, causing a delay in referral to the spine specialist.
