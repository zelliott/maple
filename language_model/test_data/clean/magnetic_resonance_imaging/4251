To review the risk factors and the radiological appearance of insufficiency fractures of the sacrum and acetabular roof.

Twenty patients with sacral and acetabular roof insufficiency fractures were reviewed retrospectively. There were 16 women (80%) and 4 males (age range 48-86 years, excluding an 8-year-old boy). Thirteen patients had a known tumour, and nine had received pelvic irradiation. All patients, except one who was asymptomatic, presented with low back or hip pain. In patients with a known tumor, metastases were suspected. Plain radiography (20), bone scintigrams (16), MR examinations (20), and bone densitometry (14) were performed. Nine patients also each had a CT scan.

In three cases the CT scan performed 10-25 days after onset of symptoms was interpreted as normal. MR examination performed a few days after the CT scan showed in each of these three patients a fracture line with a band of edema. Scintigraphy was very sensitive, but the H-shaped pattern of sacral uptake, specific for an insufficiency fracture, was detected in only three of 16 cases. The earliest MR sign was medullary edema, seen as early as 18 days after the onset of symptoms. On spin echo (SE) T1-weighted images (T1WI), the hypointense signal of edema could mask a fracture line. On SE T2WI the fracture line could be detected within the hyperintense edema (10 of 17 patients with examinations including SE T2WI). However, in four patients a fracture of the sacrum was not seen on T2WI, these having been obtained in the axial plane. For this reason, intravenous gadolinium was injected, revealing a fracture line in 12 of 14 examinations, or fat suppression sequences were performed, revealing a fracture line in five of five cases. The total number of fractures detected was 17 [15 fractures of the sacrum (bilateral in 10 cases) and two of the acetabular roof]. At a later stage, the edema resolved and the fracture was clearly seen. The two cases of fracture of the acetabular roof were easily recognized at MRI, particularly in the sagittal plane.
