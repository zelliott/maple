Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) proved to be an important diagnostic tool in the correct staging of bladder neoplasms. The advantage of multiplane imaging and high soft-tissue contrast may be extended by the use of MRI contrast media such as the gadoliniumdiethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid complex. In 60 patients with suspected or proved bladder tumors, the results of preoperative gadolinium-enhanced MRI were correlated with the histopathologic findings. The staging accuracy of infiltrating tumors was 83% and sensitivity and specificity 86% and 83%, respectively. Three tumors could only be localized after administration of gadolinium. All active tumors demonstrated significant contrast enhancement after intravenously injected gadolinium. Small papillary tumors or carcinoma in situ remain problematic to preoperative staging procedures. The advantages of gadolinium-enhanced MRI will best be employed in the exact pretherapeutic staging of infiltrative bladder neoplasms or in restaging procedures after chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
