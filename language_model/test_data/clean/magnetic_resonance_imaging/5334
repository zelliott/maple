Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) allows non-invasive assessment of the coronary arteries and simultaneously can provide measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The accuracy of newer MSCT generations (64-slice or more) for assessment of LVEF compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) has not been evaluated in a meta-analysis.

To evaluate, via a systematic literature review and meta-analysis, whether MSCT can assess LVEF with high accuracy compared with MRI and TTE.

Electronic databases and reference lists for relevant published studies were searched. Twenty-seven eligible studies provided mean LVEF% with its standard deviation (SD) measured by MSCT versus MRI and TTE. Meta-analysis of weighted mean difference (WMD) and Bland-Altman method were used to quantify the mean difference and agreement between MSCT compared with MRI and TTE.

The results of combining 12 studies showed no significant difference in LVEF% between MSCT and MRI with a WMD of -0.11 (-1.48, 1.26, 95% CI), p=0.88. Bland-Altman analysis showed excellent agreement between MSCT and MRI with a bias of 0.0 (-3.7, 3.7 ± 1.96SD) with 95% CI. The results of combining 15 studies showed no significant difference in LVEF between MSCT versus TTE measurements with a WMD of 0.19 (-1.13 to 1.50; 95% CI), p=0.87. Bland-Altman analysis showed excellent agreement between MSCT and TTE with a bias of 0.3 (-4.7, 5.7 ± 1.96SD) with 95% CI.

The newer MSCT generations can provide accurate LVEF measurement compared to MRI and TTE. MSCT represents a valid technique for the combined evaluation of LVEF and coronary artery disease.
