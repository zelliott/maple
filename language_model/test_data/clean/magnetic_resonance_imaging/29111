In specific clinical situations, endoscopes offer better visualization than the microscope during acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) surgery and can therefore decrease the incidence of the postoperative complications of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and recurrence of tumor. This study was undertaken to determine if the use of adjunctive endoscopy provides complementary information to the operating surgeon during surgery for acoustic neuromas.

Seventy-eight patients with acoustic neuromas underwent tumor excision by two neurotologists (PAW., D.S.P.), together with their respective neurosurgical partners, via a retrosigmoid (suboccipital) approach (n = 68), translabyrinthine approach (n = 7), or middle cranial fossa approach (n = 3). Endoscopy with a rigid glass lens endoscope was used during tumor removal to examine posterior fossa neurovascular structures, and after tumor excision to inspect the internal auditory canal (IAC), inner ear, and middle ear, depending on the approach used. One of the authors (D.S.P.) has not used adjunctive endoscopy during resections via the translabyrinthine and middle cranial fossa approaches, and therefore, these cases were excluded from the data collection and analysis.

Complete tumor excision was achieved in 73 patients. Endoscopy allowed improved identification of tumor and adjacent neurovascular relationships in all cases. In addition, residual tumor at the fundus of the IAC (n = 11) and exposed air cells (n = 24) not seen with the microscope during retrosigmoid approaches were identified endoscopically. In one of the translabyrinthine cases, the endoscope allowed identification of open air cells not visualized with the microscope. None of the 78 patients developed CSF rhinorrhea. Incorporating the endoscope did not significantly increase operative time.

Endoscopy can be performed safely during surgery to remove acoustic neuromas. The adjunctive use of endoscopy may offer some advantages including improved visualization, more complete tumor removal, and a lowered risk of CSF leakage.
