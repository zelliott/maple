We present the cases of ten patients who underwent postoperative magnetic resonance assessment after dislocation injuries of the cervical spine and treatment with anterior interbody fusion and titanium implants. Eight patients had spinal cord injuries and two had nerve root disorders. In two patients who had intracranial haematomas and dislocation fractures of the cervical spine, MRI proved useful for identification of parenchymal spinal cord injuries as the reason for transverse lesions. Severe MR findings of the parenchymal spinal cord injuries (haematoma or transection) correlated with complete transverse lesions (4 patients) and oedema of the spinal cord, with incomplete transverse lesions (3 patients). MR enables us to examine the spinal cord after operations to ensure that correct spinal cord decompression has been achieved (3 patients). MRI is useful for detecting disc protrusion or chronic spinal stenosis in patients with titanium implants. All in all, MRI is an important modality in the evaluation of the posttraumatic cervical spine.
