The syndrome of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an uncommon cause of postural headache. We describe three patients with classical low pressure headache associated with low CSF pressure, one of whom presented with sudden deafness and another with a unilateral VIth nerve palsy. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed bilateral diffuse subdural fluid collections in all three cases. Follow up MRI scans performed on two patients at 6 months demonstrated partial resolution of the subdural collections but persistent striking meningeal enhancement despite clinical recovery. These findings differ from previous reported cases wherein clinical resolution of postural symptoms was preceded or closely followed by resolution of the MRI changes.
