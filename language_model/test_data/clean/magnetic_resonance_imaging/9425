Anti-TNFα agents represent an outstanding advance in the symptomatic control of patients with ankylosing spondylitis presenting an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Anti-TNFα antagonists have demonstrated efficacy and safety in the long-term but continuous therapy is needed for an adequate control of symptoms. After the failure to a first anti-TNFα agent, the use of a second TNFα antagonist seems to be effective and safe. Despite the fast and continuous suppression of bone inflammation, demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging, the beneficial effect of treatment with TNFα antagonists on the radiological evolution has not been demonstrated to date in ankylosing spondylitis. It seems that insights into new therapeutic molecular targets implicated in the process of ossification are needed.
