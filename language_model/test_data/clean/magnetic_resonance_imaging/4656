Immediate diagnosis of rejection is essential for the prognosis of a renal transplant. To differentiate between rejection and acute tubular necrosis, 48 examinations (31 patients) were evaluated by Magnetic Resonance Imagining and Duplex Doppler ultrasound, and compared to the clinical outcome and histology. Sensitivity of MRI and Duplex Doppler was 82% (14/17), specificity was 77% (24/31) and 84% (26/31), respectively. Even when the results of both methods matched well, due to the extensive financial and technical efforts MRI may only be used as an additional tool for diagnosis.
