The value of MRI was evaluated retrospectively in 32 patients with clinically confirmed soft tissue sarcomata. The results were compared with the clinical findings and with computed tomographic scans. All patients were examined for recurrent residual tumor, the majority after surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Regardless of the tumor site, MR was superior to CT or at least equivalent. The normal postoperative anatomy was well delineated. Discrimination of recurrent or residual masses from post-treatment fibrosis was good. Bone destruction, especially tumor-induced cortical erosion, was better defined with CT. MRI is an appealing modality for the diagnostic work-up and for the follow-up following treatment of thoracic and abdominal sarcomata in children. The use of Gd-DTPA meant T2-weighted image sequences of the chest and abdomen were unnecessary.
