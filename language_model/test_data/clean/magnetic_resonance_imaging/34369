In hemochromatosis, areas of normal hepatic magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensity indicate the presence of iron-free-nodules, which are strongly suspected of being neoplastic. The goal of the study was to define the prevalence and the nature of these iron-free MR nodules at the time of diagnosis in 116 patients included in a prospective study assessing the accuracy of MR imaging (MRI) in the quantification of liver iron overload.

Seventy-nine of the 116 patients had homozygous hemochromatosis on a phenotypic basis. Fifteen-millimeter-thick contiguous slices were performed using T1- and T2-weighted gradient echo sequences with a 0.5 Tesla magnet.

Six of 79 homozygous hemochromatotic patients had one or more MR iron-free nodules. Five of the six patients proved to have malignant tumors. Four of six iron-free nodules were hepatocellular carcinoma (5% in the hemochromatosis group and 17.5% in hemochromatotic patients with severe fibrosis).

The present data confirm the high prevalence of liver cancer at the time of diagnosis, mainly in cirrhotic patients greater than 45 years of age, and indicate that, when performing MRI for liver iron quantification, a complete hepatic MRI examination is preferable to a simple signal measurement in patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma.
