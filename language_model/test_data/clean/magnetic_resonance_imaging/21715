We performed MRI volumetric measurements of the amygdala (AM) and hippocampal formation (HF) in a group of 43 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy not controlled by optimal drug treatment. Fifteen patients (35%) had a history of prolonged febrile convulsions (PFC) in early childhood; 30 patients underwent surgery, and histopathology was available in twenty-four. The mean values of AM and HF volumes ipsilateral to the EEG focus were significantly smaller than those of normal controls. The volumetric measurements showed a more pronounced atrophy of the AM in patients with a history of PFC, although the HF volumes were also smaller in this group. Patients with a history of PFC had a higher proportion of more severe mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) compared with those with no PFC. These findings confirm a correlation between early childhood PFC, the severity of atrophy of mesial structures, and MTS.
