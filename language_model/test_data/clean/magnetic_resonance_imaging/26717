In patients with renal impairment, the incremental benefits from administration of contrast media for imaging studies need to be carefully assessed relative to the potential increased risks of worsening renal dysfunction and systemic adverse effects. This review provides an overview of risk and benefits of iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast agents; examines their relationships to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), respectively; and discusses various clinical strategies to minimize the risk of CIN and NSF. Specifically, renal imaging strategies aimed to minimize the adverse effects of contrast media as well as alternatives to iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast-enhanced renal imaging are proposed with emphasis on non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.
