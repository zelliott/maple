Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in Europe and the United States, and a major cause of mortality. Early detection of colorectal cancer and its precursors reduces mortality and morbidity, and a minimally invasive screening tool is essential for high patient acceptance and participation. To achieve this goal, computed tomographic colonography and magnetic resonance (MR) colonography have been introduced. A wide variety of methods of bowel preparation, colon distension, and imaging exists for MR colonography. This article presents an up-to-date overview of the status of MR colonography in screening for colorectal cancer, and its diagnosis.
