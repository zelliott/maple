Colloidal and calcified cysts are considered responsible for seizure in neurocysticercosis (NCC); however, calcified cysts have also been reported in asymptomatic individuals. We carried out a MRI-based study in a rural pig farming community of North India to detect the various stages, locations and numbers of the cyst in asymptomatic individuals and compared them with symptomatic NCC cases to see its association with occurrence of seizures. A total of 107 asymptomatic family members of 29 symptomatic NCC confirmed cases were evaluated clinically, immunologically and by neuroimaging for NCC. MRI-based staging of the parasite was done in both groups, and compared to look for the differences, if any. Thirty-one (29.0%) asymptomatic family members of symptomatic cases were diagnosed to have NCC. There was no difference in proportion of colloidal/degenerating and calcified stages of the parasite between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups; however, significantly higher proportion of the asymptomatic populations had vesicular stage of the parasite (P=0.029). Our findings show that a large number of individuals harboring different stages of cysticerci in their brain remain symptoms free and question the belief that the degenerating/calcified stages of the parasite are primarily responsible for seizure occurrence in NCC.
