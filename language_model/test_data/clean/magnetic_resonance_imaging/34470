Primary intraventricular haemorrhage (HIVP) is a rare condition, of diverse aetiology and variable course. We present a series of eight cases of HIVP diagnosed by CT and analyze the different aetiologies.

A retrospective series of 8 cases diagnosed by CT, the risk factors, clinical behaviour, complications and prognosis are evaluated. Neuroimaging findings (CT, MR and/or DIVAS) are described.

The most commonly associated factor is arterial hypertension (75%). Clinically, presentation was uniform as evidence of sudden intracranial hypertension with signs of meningeal irritation with little or no neurological focal signs. The commonest complication was hydrocephalus (25%) and the chances of survival in most cases were good. Three causes of bleeding were found: an arteriovenous malformation, an aneurysm and a blood coagulation disorder. Three hypertensive patients with no obvious cause of bleeding had periependimary laguna infarcts.

HIVP is an unusual condition of diverse aetiology, uniform clinical presentation and has a good short term prognosis. We suggest that pathology of the small vessels, induced by hypertension, may play a part in the aetiology of a subgroup of patients with no obvious cause of bleeding.
