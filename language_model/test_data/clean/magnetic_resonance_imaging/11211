A dysfunction of the paralimbic system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The temporal pole (TP) is a relevant component of the paralimbic circuit. Functional and structural imaging studies have shown circumscribed abnormalities in the TP. Subjects were 30 controls and 30 schizophrenia patients. Cortical surface size and gray matter volume of the TP were accurately measured to explore the morphology of the TP cortex and the relationship of TP measures to clinical variables in patients with schizophrenia. Correlations between structural measures and clinical dimensions, duration of illness, and cumulative neuroleptic exposure were determined. Neither macroscopic abnormalities in the TP nor differences in the pattern of asymmetry were demonstrated. The TP volume was correlated negatively to the psychotic and disorganized dimension scores. No other significant correlations were found. No morphological abnormalities in the TP were found in patients with schizophrenia. Interestingly, a reduction in the TP volume, a higher-order multimodal association cortex, was associated with the severity of disorganized and psychotic symptoms.
