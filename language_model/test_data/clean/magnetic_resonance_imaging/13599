Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can help to diagnose acute ischemic stroke. Other nonischemic disorders may show abnormal signals with DWI. The authors report two cases of Wernicke encephalopathy with DWI signal changes in characteristic midline locations, one with reduction in apparent diffusion constant and one without. DWI abnormalities may suggest early thiamine deficiency and are useful in diagnosing Wernicke encephalopathy.
