High-resolution prenatal ultrasound can allow for early detection and monitoring of many fetal anomalies, including those involving the globe and orbit. We describe a case of a congenital orbital cyst detected and monitored by prenatal transvaginal ultrasonography.

After detection of a congenital orbital cyst, serial transvaginal ultrasound examinations were performed through the remainder of the pregnancy to monitor the growth and development of the fetus and the orbital cyst.

A large retrobulbar orbital cyst causing extreme proptosis was detected at 23 weeks of gestation and monitored through the remainder of the pregnancy. Lack of growth, benign behavior, and appropriate interval fetal growth without destruction of adjacent structures was noted. After birth, early surgical intervention allowed for complete surgical excision of the cyst without the need for enucleation or exenteration. Fifteen months after excision, the patient wore a scleral shell and had a good cosmetic appearance with good ocular motility.

Prenatal ultrasound may allow for early detection of orbital masses. To our knowledge, this report describes the first case of a congenital orbital cyst detected and monitored by prenatal ultrasonography.
