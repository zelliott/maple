A 29-year-old woman with swelling, multiple nodules and discharging sinuses of her right foot is presented. A single nodule on the sole was excised 15 years ago and since then she has had recurrent attacks of swelling and discharging sinuses that improved partially with antibiotics. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) revealed an ill-defined mass predominantly with low signal intensity on T2W images. Within the granulomata, multiple unenhancing foci, with low T1W and T2W signal most likely representing the fungal balls or grains were detected. Histopathological examination revealed large clusters of microorganisms resembling fungal hyphae and bacteria, which were surrounded by mixed inflammatory infiltrate cells and stained positively by PAS and Gomori's methenamine silver stain. As minimal regression was seen on MRI with 4 months' itraconazole (200 mg day(-1)) treatment, co-trimoxazole (160 TMP/800 SMX b.i.d.) was added to treatment. Complete remission was established by MRI examination after 10 months with this combination therapy.
