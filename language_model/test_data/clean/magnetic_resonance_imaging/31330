Tumour responses to treatment are still largely assessed from imaging measurements of reductions in tumour size. However, this can take several weeks to become manifest and in some cases may not occur at all, despite a positive response to treatment. There has been considerable interest, therefore, in non-invasive techniques for imaging tissue function that can give early evidence of response. These can be used in clinical trials of new drugs to give an early indication of drug efficacy, and subsequently in the clinic to select the most effective therapy at an early stage of treatment.
