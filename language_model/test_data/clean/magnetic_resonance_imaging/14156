The feasibility of obtaining in-plane magnetic resonance (MR) vascular images in the presence of a vascular stent and the value of infusing an MR contrast agent during imaging was assessed. Coronal and sagittal MR imaging at 1.5 T was performed on six dogs with tantalum aortic stents using single-section gradient echo (GRE) imaging and MR angiography techniques before and during intravenous infusion of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). In-plane gradient echo (GRE) imaging and MR angiography clearly showed flow within the stented vessel as increased signal, with a minimum amount of stent-related artifact. Infusion of Gd-DTPA significantly increased the signal of flowing blood and allowed for better delineation of the stented aortic lumina. Our results demonstrate that in-plane GRE imaging and MR angiography can potentially be used as noninvasive methods for evaluating vascular patency in the presence of MR-compatible endovascular devices. In addition, Gd-DTPA infusion during MR vascular imaging clearly enhances the definition of flowing blood in the lumina of stented vessels.
