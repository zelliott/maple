This study examined brain asymmetries elicited during visuomotor tracking. Thirty-two healthy participants performed a fixed gaze, dynamic, pinch force, visuomotor tracking task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. The dynamic task required the subject to press a rubber bulb with the thumb to trace a cosine square wave varying in force amplitude from 0-500 cN and having a frequency of 1.5 Hz. Response hand order and direction of the stimulus presentation (right-to-left or left-to-right) were permuted across participants. Two forms of functional cerebral asymmetry were observed, hemispheric specialization and homologous lateralized response. The superior portion of the right middle frontal gyrus and the left supplementary motor area appeared specialized for VM tracking regardless of response hand used or stimulus movement direction. Lateralized effects appeared in the primary sensorimotor hand area, putamen, parietal operculum/posterior insula, dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, precuneus, and middle occipital gyrus. These lateralized areas of activation surfaced when either response hand or direction of stimulus movement was manipulated. The VM task used in this study activated asymmetrical neural activity in the vertically organized skelotomotor system and in sensory systems involving visual attention or proprioception.
