The aim of this study was to evaluate the MR findings of anal carcinoma using an external pelvic phased-array coil before and after chemoradiation treatment. 15 patients with carcinoma of the anal canal underwent T(2) weighted and short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) imaging before and after chemoradiation. Images were reviewed in consensus by two radiologists. At pre-treatment imaging, the tumour size and stage, signal intensity and infiltration of adjacent structures were recorded. MR imaging was repeated immediately after chemoradiation, every 6 months for the first year and then yearly. Tumour response was assessed by recording change in tumour size and signal intensity. Prior to treatment, the mean tumour size was 3.9 cm (range, 1.8-6.4 cm). Tumours appeared mildly hyperintense at T(2) weighted and STIR imaging. There was good agreement in T staging between clinical examination and MR imaging (kappa = 0.68). In 12 responders with long disease remission, a greater percentage reduction in the size of MR signal abnormality in the tumour area was observed at 6 months (mean 54.7%; 46-62%) than immediately after treatment (mean 38.6%; 30-46%) (p = 0.002, t-test). 7/12 showed stabilization of T(2) signal reduction in the tumour area after 1 year, and 5/12 showed complete resolution of signal alterations at 2 years. Pelvic phased-array MR imaging is useful for local staging of anal carcinoma and assessing treatment response. After treatment, a decrease in tumour size accompanied by reduction and stability of the MR T(2) signal characteristics at 1 year after chemoradiation treatment was associated with favourable outcome.
