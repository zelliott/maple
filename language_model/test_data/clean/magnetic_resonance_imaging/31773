We describe two cases of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) affecting both femoral condyles in the same knee. The patients presented with recurrent episodes of pain and swelling, but these were initially thought to be 'growing pains'. Eventually, a delayed diagnosis of bicondylar OCD was established and both patients were referred for further management. After assessing the extent of the disease on MRI, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation was performed to treat the defects of the lateral condyle in each case, with a plan to address the medial defects at a later stage. Proposed theories on the aetiology of the condition and available methods of treatment are discussed. A diagnosis of OCD should be considered in young patients with persistent knee pain and effusions, and MRI is the investigation of choice for early detection.
