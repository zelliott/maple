Localised amyloidosis of the larynx is uncommon and poorly understood. The precise etiology and pathogenesis are not entirely clear. It usually presents with hoarseness, pain and/or difficulty in breathing. We present the case of a 42-year-old woman with primary localised laryngeal amyloidosis who presented with hoarseness and dyspnoea. Biopsy of the specimen revealed amyloid.There were no signs of any systemic disease in the patient and diagnosis was established histopathologically. She was treated surgically by microlaryngoscopy under general anaesthesia. At 6 months, the patient's voice and breathing had both improved substantially.
