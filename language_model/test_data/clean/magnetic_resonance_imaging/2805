Foot disease in patients with diabetes mellitus is multifactorial and results from a combination of peripheral neuropathy, vascular compromise and superimposed infection. Foot complications in diabetic patients are common and account for more hospital days than any other aspects of their disease. Therefore, familiarity with the spectrum of findings in the different imaging modalities appears essential. Radiographically, significant changes include Charcot joints of the tarsus (destructive type) and bone absorption of the forefoot (mutilating type). In diabetic foot problems, magnetic resonance imaging and leukocyte scintigraphy appear to be the most effective tools for detection of osteomyelitis, and a negative study makes osteomyelitis unlikely. However, the findings of both techniques in active, noninfected neuropathic osteoarthropathy may be indistinguishable from those of osteomyelitis.
