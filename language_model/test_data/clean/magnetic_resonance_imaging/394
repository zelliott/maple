Water-soluble biocompatible rhamnose-coated Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles of 4.0 nm are obtained by covalent anchorage of rhamnose on the nanoparticles surface via a phosphate linker. These nanoparticles present superparamagnetic behavior and nuclear relaxivities in the same order of magnitude as Endorem that make them potential magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents of a second generation, where the saccharides represent also specific ligands able to target lectins on skin cells.
