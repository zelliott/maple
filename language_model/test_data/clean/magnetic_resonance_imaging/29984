We report a patient who developed a complete left homonymous hemianopia from mass effect of a solitary skull metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After chemoembolization and resection, the visual field defect improved markedly. This is the first reported case demonstrating this phenomenon in HCC. It supports aggressive treatment of a solitary skull metastasis in this setting.
