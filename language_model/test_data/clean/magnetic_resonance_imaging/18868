The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging device outperforms the quality of CT images for diagnosis related to soft tissues. The cartilage structure is intermediary between soft tissue and bones. The methodology to compare visualisation quality of two different CT and MR techniques was developed. It enabled to evaluate the equipment priority. Before carrying out the comparative analysis of cartilage structure images the method of reducing radiation dose for a CT examination has been developed. It was based on relationship between CT adjustment parameter (reconstruction increment) and image quality. The method enabled to carry out CT examination with a considerably reduced radiation dose for a patient and the medical personnel, taking part in the experiment.
