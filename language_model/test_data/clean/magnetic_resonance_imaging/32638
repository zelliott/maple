Patients with ipsilateral neglect (IN) bisect lines toward contralesional space. It has been posited that IN might be induced by an attempt at compensation, as part of the crossover effect, where patients with an ipsilesional bias when bisecting long lines, cross over and develop a contralesional bias on short lines or as a release of an approach (grasp) behavior that might be attentional or intentional. To test these alternative hypotheses we had a patient with IN from a right medial frontal lesion bisect lines that contained no cue, a left-sided cue, a right-sided cue, and bilateral cues. If this patient had ipsilateral neglect (IN) because of a crossover effect or compensation, right-sided cues should have influenced bisection more than left-sided cues. We, however, found that only left-sided cues induced a significant change (left-sided deviation) providing support for the attentional-approach (grasp) hypothesis. Further support of this contralesional attentional grasp hypothesis comes from the observation that this patient also had ipsilesional extinction to simultaneous stimuli.
