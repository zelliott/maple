The acetabular labrum is a fibrocartilaginous structure attached to the acetabular rim. It increases the surface area of acetabulum and stabilizes joint. Acetabular labral tears are an important cause of intractable hip pain in adults. We report a cause of an acetabular bucket handle tear of the right hip, caused by femoroacetabular impingement that was diagnosed and treated successfully with hip arthroscopy.
