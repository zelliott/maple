Oral appliances have been a popular treatment option for subjects with obstructive sleep apnea. However, little information is available on how brain activation induced by respiratory challenge is modulated by mandibular advancement with these appliances. We hypothesized that the brain activation caused by respiratory stress may be alleviated by mandibular advancement. Respiratory stress was induced in 12 healthy subjects by resistive inspiratory loading. The effects of mandibular advancement during resistive inspiratory loading were assessed subjectively by using a visual analog scale. These effects were also evaluated objectively by using blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. The score for the visual analog scale significantly decreased with mandibular advancement. Cortical deactivation, in association with mandibular advancement, was localized to several specific regions, including the left cingulate gyrus and the bilateral prefrontal cortexes. These regions are known to be involved in respiratory control. Our results suggest that mandibular advancement with an oral appliance appears to be useful for reducing respiratory stress, based on both subjective and neuronal criteria.
