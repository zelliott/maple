The anterior approach to the vertebral column is indicated in the tumors or traumas of the vertebral body with prevalent anterior expression. This method allows to control easily all the structures in front of the rachis. Furthermore, the current reconstructive techniques require the exposure of a long tract of the vertebral column. The Authors report their experience with the anterior approach in 22 patients (9 males, 13 females) affected by different pathologies: 10 primary tumors divided as follows: 4 sacral chordomas, 1 L1 chordoma, 2 sacral neurinomas, 1 L5 malignant melanotic schwannoma, 1 D9 osteoblastoma, 1 D6 intraspinal cavernoma, and 1 D3 myeloma; 4 metastatic tumors (2 D10, 1 L4 and 1 L5); 5 fractures of the vertebral body (1 L1, 1 L1-L2, 2 L4 and 1 L5); 2 echinococcal cysts respectively arising from the D11 body, the sacrum and ilium. The Authors overall performed 8 thoracotomies, 6 for dorsal location; in 1 case of L1-L2 fracture a thoracophrenolaparotomy was performed; in 7 cases involving the L3-L5 segment an abdominal anterolateral extraperitoneal approach was followed; finally in 6 cases a transperitoneal laparotomy to approach the sacrum and ilium was performed.
