Toxocariasis is a worldwide human helminthiasis, which is mostly asymptomatic and caused by toxocara canis, a roundworm in dogs. These can cause visceral larva migrans syndrome in humans who ingest contaminated soil. CNS manifestation with a focal mass lesion is very rare, seizures often being the first symptom.

We describe an 11-year-old girl presenting with a generalized epileptic seizure and eosinophilia in blood. Under antibiotic therapy under the assumption of toxoplasmosis the lesion did not decrease and surgical resection was considered. We used computer-assisted surgery (CAS) for careful tissue resection. Postoperatively the diagnosis of toxocariasis was confirmed and albendozole medication was administered for 7 days. The patient developed well without neurological deficits or seizures.

We conclude that although neurological involvement is rare in toxocariasis, a cerebral infection in a child with epileptic seizures and eosinophilia should be considered.
