We presented the case of a 58-year-old woman with spinal sarcoidosis at the C4-C6 level. The lesion itself as visualized with magnetic resonance imaging, and its neurological findings responded favorably to treatment with prednisolone. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment values for somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and central motor conduction time (CMCT) also showed improvement. Analysis of SEP and CMCT can be a useful tool for following up spinal sarcoidosis.
