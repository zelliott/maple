In the presented case, the radiologic, endoscopic and surgical findings of a gossypiboma that migrated into the stomach are presented. A 63-year-old woman presented with epigastric pain, and her clinical and laboratory findings were compatible with pancreatitis. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a foreign body at the greater curvature of the stomach. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass consistent with a gossypiboma that had migrated into the stomach transmurally. This is a first case of a gossypiboma diagnosed endoscopically.
