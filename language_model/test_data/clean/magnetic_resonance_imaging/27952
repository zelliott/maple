The following contribution presents a continuous MRT analysis of the contraction and relaxation processes of healthy left ventricles giving reference values for contraction and relaxation velocities. For the total ventricle we have Vsyst. r. total = 342 +/- 47% LVEDV/sec and Vdiast. r. total = 303 +/- 59% LVEDV/sec. In relation to the end-diastolic (tomographic) volume (EDSV) significantly greater changes in volume per unit of time were measured apically compared to basal (systolic: 411 +/- 89% EDSV/sec apical vs 261 +/- 35% EDSV/sec basal; diastolic: 810 +/- 145% EDSV/sec apical vs 245 +/- 70% EDSV/sec basal). Occurrence of the end-systolic minimal volumes of apical tomographic layers was delayed against the total ventricle by 22.4 +/- 7.9% t syst. Within the ventricle there was systolically a redistribution of the proportions of volume from apical to basal.
