Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation has an unproven role in the management of late-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy: theoretically justified through the engraftment of enzyme-replete haematopoietic progenitors and restoration of capacity for sulphatide catabolism in neural tissue through enzyme recapture, the long-term outcome is unknown. The rarity of the psycho-cognitive variant and slow progression of late-onset disease impairs evaluation of treatment. We report detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessments after haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in a patient with a late-onset psycho-cognitive form of metachromatic leukodystrophy. Cognitive decline, indistinguishable from the natural course of the disease, was serially documented over 11 years despite complete donor chimaerism and correction of leukocyte arylsulphatase A to wild type values; subtle motor deterioration was similarly noted and progressive cerebral volume loss was evident upon magnetic resonance imaging. Sensory nerve conduction deteriorated 17 months post-transplantation with apparent stabilisation at 11-year review. Haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation was ineffective for this rare attenuated variant of metachromatic leukodystrophy. In the few patients identified pre-symptomatically or with early-phase disease, clear recommendations are lacking; when transplantation is considered, umbilical cord blood grafts from enzyme-replete donors with adjunctive mesenchymal stem cell infusions from the same source may be preferable. Improved outcomes will depend on enhanced awareness and early diagnosis of the disease, so that promising interventions such as genetically modified, autologous stem cell transplantation have the best opportunity of success.
