Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging can potentially assess the dynamics of left ventricular (LV) early diastolic filling.

Fifteen participants underwent phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging on a 1.5-T whole-body Avanto scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). Left ventricular intracavitary velocities were measured in 3 orthogonal directions. Imaging parameters included a repetition time of 92.45 milliseconds, an echo time of 2.88 milliseconds, a flip angle of 30 degrees, and a velocity-encoding range of 100 to 150 cm/s.

The color vector analysis provided a visual assessment of LV diastolic flow. In normal subjects, there was rapid organized early diastolic flow that extended from the mitral valve to the LV apex. In patients with LV diastolic dysfunction, organized high-velocity flow stopped in the mid-left ventricle.

Four-dimensional phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance can differentiate between normal and abnormal diastolic flow propagation within the left ventricle.
