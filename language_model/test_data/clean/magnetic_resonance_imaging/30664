Progressive or recurrent high-grade gliomas are characterized by a very poor prognosis, and the relevance of second-line chemotherapy is still unassessed. Although it has been reported that liposomal anthracyclines and carboplatin show some activity in these patients, their association has never been investigated. We have treated six children with recurrent high-grade glioma after surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and one child with progressive teratoid/rhabdoid tumor with the combination of liposomal daunorubicin and carboplatin plus etoposide. Five out of seven children showed a major response and the 29 month progression-free survival was 38%. The above regimen was feasible and children showed only little and transient hematological toxicity. In our opinion, these results justify further investigation of the above combination chemotherapy for recurrent or progressive malignant brain tumors in children.
