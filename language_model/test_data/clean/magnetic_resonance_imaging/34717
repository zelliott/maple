To describe the MR features of primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma and to determine whether there is a correlation with histopathologic findings.

The MR images, pathologic specimens, and clinical records of 23 patients with primary CNS lymphoma were reviewed. The imaging and pathologic characteristics were tabulated and compared by using the standard tests for association in a two-dimensional contingency table.

A total of 61 lesions were present in 23 patients; 12 patients (52%) had multiple lesions. All lesions were isointense or hypointense on T1-weighted images, and 53% were isointense or hypointense on T2-weighted images. Twenty patients received intravenous contrast material, and 43 (91%) of 47 lesions enhanced. The three patients who had nonenhancing lesions received steroids before the initial MR studies. Enhancement patterns differed between the immunocompetent and the immunocompromised hosts, with the latter group harboring a higher percentage of rim-enhancing lesions. Twenty-seven (44%) of the lesions were centered in a cerebral hemisphere and 14 (23%) were centered in the central gray matter. There was a statistically significant correlation between a higher degree of necrosis histologically and hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR images. The degree of necrosis also showed a positive correlation with rim enhancement.

Primary CNS lymphoma has a variable MR appearance that correlates with the severity of intratumoral necrosis. These imaging characteristics, as well as lesion location, mean lesion size, and proclivity to harbor necrosis, are altered in the immunocompromised host.
