The supracondylar process is a bony spur at the anteromedial surface of the distal humerus. It is associated with the Struthers' ligament, running from its apex to the medial epicondyle. Symptoms may occur due to fracture and entrapment of nerves (most frequently the median nerve) and/or blood vessels underneath the structures. We report a case in which we used MRI and high-frequency ultrasound to investigate the supracondylar process, the Struthers' ligament, and its surrounding structures. Ultrasound is a useful alternative to MRI during the workup of potential entrapment syndromes.
