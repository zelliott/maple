Iliopsoas impingement is a new arthroscopic diagnosis that refers to an anterior labral injury caused by the iliopsoas tendon. Currently, there are no preoperative criteria to establish the diagnosis of iliopsoas impingement. The goal of this study was to determine whether there are imaging criteria that would identify iliopsoas impingement on preoperative MR arthrography.

This study compared the preoperative MR arthrograms of 23 patients who had iliopsoas impingement diagnosed at hip arthroscopy with the arthrograms of 24 patients who did not have iliopsoas impingement found at hip arthroscopy. All of the arthroscopies were performed by a single orthopedic hip surgeon. In all cases of impingement, there was an isolated injury to the labrum at the 3-o'clock position. All were treated by arthroscopic iliopsoas tenotomy performed at the labral level. The MR examinations of the 47 patients were evaluated independently by two musculoskeletal radiologists who were blinded to the diagnosis. The following characteristics of the iliopsoas tendon at the level of the anterior labrum were evaluated: lateral dip, increased signal intensity (SI) between the iliopsoas tendon and labrum, irregularity of the deep margin of the iliopsoas tendon, edema within the iliopsoas tendon or capsule at the 3-o'clock position, presence of a labral tear at the 3-o'clock position, dimensions of the iliopsoas tendon, and location of iliopsoas tendon as it passed the labrum. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal Wallis test, Fisher exact test, and Cohen kappa. Values for p less than 0.05 were considered significant.

Nineteen women (mean age, 35 years) and four men (mean age, 36 years) had central iliopsoas impingement. Sixteen women (mean age, 38 years) and eight men (mean age, 35 years) did not have central iliopsoas impingement (p=0.318). For the impingement and nonimpingement groups, lateral dip of the iliopsoas tendon was seen in 15 of 23 (65%) and 17 of 24 (71%) for reader 1 and 18 of 23 (78%) and 11 of 24 (46%) for reader 2, respectively (p=0.76 and 0.036, respectively). There was no difference between the groups for increased SI between the iliopsoas tendon and labrum (p=0.38 and 0.82, respectively), irregular deep margin of the iliopsoas tendon (p=0.61 and 0.35, respectively), thickness of the iliopsoas tendon (p=0.33), or tendon or capsule edema (p=0.37 and 0.77, respectively). Reader 1 found 20 of 23 and reader 2 18 of 23 labral tears at the 3-o'clock position in the iliopsoas impingement group, with 13 of 24 and 10 of 24 in the non-iliopsoas impingement group respectively (p=0.024 and 0.017, respectively). The combined iliopsoas tendon width for both readers was 10.2 mm (range, 8.1-14.3 mm) in women and 11.9 mm (range, 11.1-13.4 mm) in men in the iliopsoas impingement group (p=0.0285), and 11.0 mm (range, 9.0-12.6 mm) for women and 11.8 mm (range, 8.7-15.1 mm) for men in the non-iliopsoas impingement group (p=0.159). The iliopsoas tendon most commonly crossed the labrum at the 3-o'clock position in both groups (p=0.83-0.17).

An acetabular labral tear at the 3-o'clock position should suggest the diagnosis of iliopsoas impingement.
