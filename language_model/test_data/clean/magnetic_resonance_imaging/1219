Whereas a number of studies suggest that the ApoE polymorphism is not associated with disease susceptibility in multiple sclerosis (MS), results with regard to disease severity, however, are conflicting. Some studies suggest an unfavourable role of the epsilon4 allele. This study was performed to assess the association of the ApoE polymorphism with both disease susceptibility and disease course in a large group of MS patients using clinical and MRI measures. In addition the data were combined with available data from the literature.

In a group of 408 patients with clinically definite MS, genotype distribution was compared with that of 144 healthy controls. Combined analysis of published data on the association of ApoE polymorphism with MS was performed. Demographic and clinical findings were recorded and related to the ApoE genotype. In a subgroup, longitudinal MRI findings were available and related to the ApoE genotype.

No significant differences were found in the distribution of genotypes between MS patients and controls. Combined analysis of published data showed a slightly increased susceptibility for MS in epsilon2-carriers. Disease characteristics (including age at onset and onset type), disease severity (progression index, time to reach EDSS 6) and MRI findings (lesion volumes and atrophy measures) were not associated with carriership o epsilon2 or epsilon4.

In this cohort no association of the ApoE genotype with disease susceptibility nor clinical and MRI measures could be identified. However, combined analysis of published data could not definitely exclude the possibility of a minor role for epsilon2-carriership in MS.
