Studies of mouse cerebral vasculature to date have focused on the circle of Willis without examining the morphological distribution of blood vessels through the rest of the brain. Since mouse models are frequently used in brain-related studies, there is a need for a comprehensive cerebral vasculature atlas for the mouse with an emphasis on the location of vessels with respect to neuroanatomical structures, the watershed regions associated with specific arteries, as well as a consistent nomenclature of the cerebral vessels. This article describes such an atlas, based on a combination of magnetic resonance and computed tomography technology to yield high-resolution volumetric and vasculature data on CBA mouse. This three-dimensional vasculature dataset provides an anatomical resource for future mouse studies.
