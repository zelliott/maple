Axiography may be useful in the evaluation of condyle motion and the effects of internal derangements on this motion. Fifty-one patients were selected by one investigator (RHT) to provide a representative sample of asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects for the following categories: (1) normal disk position, (2) disk displacement with reduction, (3) disk displacement without reduction and (4) disk displacement without reduction associated with degenerative joint disease. Axiography was performed by a separate investigator (KGP) in a blinded fashion. The diagnosis of the presence of internal derangement was based on the tracings only. All subjects had bilateral magnetic resonance imaging scans to evaluate for the presence or absence of internal derangement. The diagnostic sensitivity was 0.64, which indicated that axiography is marginal at identifying disease when present. The negative predictive value was 0.78, which indicated that axiography is accurate in the detection of normal disk condyle relationship.
