Although it is well known that executive processes supported by the frontal lobe develop during childhood and adolescence, only one functional imaging study has used the Stroop task to investigate the relationship between frontal lobe function and cognition from a developmental point of view. Hence, we measured brain activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex of children with functional near-infrared imaging during an event-related, color-word matching Stroop task and compared results with a previous study, conducted with the same paradigm in adults. In children, the Stroop task elicited significant brain activation in the left lateral prefrontal cortex comparable to adults. However, the hemodynamic response occurred later in children than adults. Individual brain activation due to Stroop interference varied much more in children than adults, which was paralleled by a higher behavioral variance in children. Data suggest that children differed in their individual cognitive development independent of their chronological age more than adults. Brain activation due to Stroop interference increased with age in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in correlation with an improvement of behavioral performance. In conclusion, our results indicate that neuromaturational processes regarding resolution of Stroop interference may depend on increased ability to recruit frontal neural resources.
