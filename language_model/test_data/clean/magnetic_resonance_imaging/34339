RV changes may be generalized into dilatation and hypertrophy. Increased preload results in ventricular dilatation. Increased afterload causes hypertrophy. Change in the shape of the RV resulting from increased afterload and myocardial hypertrophy induces tricuspid regurgitation, which superimposes changes of chamber dilatation onto those of hypertrophy. Sustained ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy frequently progresses to RV failure. In these cases, RV systolic function decreases in association with elevation of RV and right atrial diastolic pressure. Changes in the wall thickness and shape of the RV are variable, and depend upon the severity of the volume or pressure load presented, as well as its duration and rate of progression. Because the RV is an anterior cardiac structure, it occupies little of any heart border. Therefore, the sensitivity of plain film examination to RV disease is limited. Inferential diagnosis of RV disease can often be made based upon identification of other radiographic changes, notably the state of the pulmonary circulation, and the position of the heart in the chest. Conventional contrast right ventriculography may be used to assess the size and position of the RV, as well as associated acquired and congenital lesions that result in RV dysfunction. Due to the unusual shape of the RV cavity, however, and the unpredictable manner in which it dilates, accurate quantitative analysis by this technique is limited. Furthermore, the common association between RV disease and pulmonary hypertension limits the applicability of this imaging technique for evaluating patients with RV disease. Multiplanar MR imaging allows direct demonstration of changes in RV size and wall morphology. Furthermore, application of Simpson's rule to tomographic slices acquired at ventricular diastole and systole allows direct, accurate, and reproducible quantitative analysis of ventricular volume and myocardial mass, allowing radiographic assessment in patients for diagnosis, as well as longitudinally during medical management or after surgical treatment for congenital and acquired diseases that result in RV dysfunction.
