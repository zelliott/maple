Metastatic spreading is a rare complication of meningioma. We report a subcutaneous metastasis from an atypical meningioma of the tentorium. A 69-year-old man presented with a meningioma of the tentorium. The tumor was totally resected. The histological diagnosis was atypical meningioma. The tumor recurred two years later and was irradiated. Despite irradiation, the tumor progressed and was resected three years later. Five months following the second surgery, an isolated subcutaneous mass developed at the skin incision and was resected. The histological examination of the subcutaneous tumor showed histological features of atypical meningioma. Surgery of atypical meningioma carries the risk of iatrogenic metastasis, despite previous irradiation.
