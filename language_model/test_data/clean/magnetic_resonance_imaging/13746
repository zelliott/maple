We report here an autopsy case of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the liver in a 63-year-old man who had hypercalcemia and an elevated serum level of parathyroid hormone-related protein. At autopsy, primary squamous cell carcinoma of the liver was found, without distinct preceding or associated hepatic or biliary diseases; no extrahepatic primary focus of squamous cell carcinoma was found. Bone involvement was not demonstrated, either radiologically or pathologically. Immunohistochemically, parathyroid hormone-related protein was detectable in the squamous cell carcinoma cells and it may have been responsible for the hypercalcemia. Such a case has not been reported so far in the English-language or the Japanese literature.
