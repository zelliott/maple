The aim of this study was to determine the effects of VEGF treatment on             focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Rats were administered PBS or VEGF at concentrations             of 10, 20 or 30 µg/ml. The effects of VEGF on the rat infarct volume and neurological             deficits were investigated. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe             the ultrastructure of the cerebral cortex. Treatments with VEGF reduced the infarct             volume and improved neurological functions. VEGF increased microvessel generation             and also inhibited apoptosis in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. For the             rats in the 30 µg/ml VEGF group, an even higher number of proliferative endothelial             cells were observed by electron microscopy. In conclusion, VEGF treatment has             protective effects on focal cerebral ischemia in rats.
