To introduce a new method for osteoplastic anterolateral vertebrotomy without fusion to resect multilevel cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament.

A multilevel vertebral column graft containing portions of the intervertebral discs is cut with a microsurgical saw from the anterolateral part of the vertebra via a thin lateral gutter placed in advance. A sufficiently wide oblique operative field is provided for resection of the ossified ligament with this method, and only a narrow bony defect remains after simple replacement of the vertebral graft. Postoperatively, patients are allowed to walk, usually within 2 to 3 days, wearing simple cervical collars.

Twelve patients underwent resection of the ossified ligaments in two to five vertebral bodies. Clinical results were satisfactory except in one patient, who died as a result of a pulmonary embolism that occurred 10 days after surgery. In all of the other patients, the vertebral column grafts were fused within a few months, and there were no graft-related problems. Postoperative lateral radiographs revealed that cervical alignment was preserved, with intervertebral mobility at the operated segment in flexion-extension views.

The osteoplastic anterolateral vertebrotomy method provided a sufficiently wide operative field for satisfactory resection of multilevel cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, simplifying graft replacement and postoperative patient care. The cervical alignment was preserved.
