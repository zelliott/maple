This report describes a patient with a headache and a bitemporal hemianopsia immediately following endoscopic ethmoid and sphenoid sinus surgery. Computed tomographic imaging revealed tension pneumocephalus caused by surgical interruption of the boundaries between the sinus(es) and the anterior cranial cavity. The delineation of the central chiasmal injury required follow-up magnetic resonance imaging.
