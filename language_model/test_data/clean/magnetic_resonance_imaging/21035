Different imaging methods applied in the evaluation of a patient with unilateral active Graves ophthalmopathy (GO) are shown in the present paper. 99mTc-Anti-TNF-α scintigraphy is proposed as a promising method, not yet described, for the diagnosis of active ocular disease. It consists of labeling a human monoclonal antibody directed against TNF-α molecule (adalimumab) with technetium (99mTc). The method is based on the demonstration of TNF-α as one of the cytokines enrolled in the initial active phase of GO development. The method may give the perspective to link diagnosis and therapy, including new target-based modalities.
