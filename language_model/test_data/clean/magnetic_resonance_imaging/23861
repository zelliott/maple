Fatigue is an unexplained but common and disabling symptom in MS. We assessed fatigue in 71 patients with MS and identified MS-fatigue (MSF) and MS-nonfatigue (MSNF) groups. Fatigue severity did not correlate with regional or global MRI plaque load or atrophy assessed by conventional sequences. No significant differences were noted in any MRI measures between MSF and MSNF groups. We suggest that brain MRI disease topography or severity does not explain fatigue in MS and that fatigue is likely due to mechanisms poorly characterized by conventional MRI.
