Cervical pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy. The treatment ranges from medical treatment with methotrexate to hysterectomy.

We report two cases of cervical pregnancy with fetal cardiac activity that were successfully treated with multidose methotrexate.

Due to the possible severe complications of cervical pregnancy and its surgical management, multidose methotrexate treatment in hemodynamically stable women is an appropriate option.
