The primary imaging modality for evaluation of ovarian cystic lesions is pelvic ultrasonography. Most ovarian cysts are benign and demonstrate typical sonographic features that support benignity. However, some ovarian cystic lesions have indeterminate imaging features, and the approach to management varies. This article discusses how to recognize and diagnose different types of ovarian cystic lesions, including an approach to management. The learning objective is to recognize imaging features of ovarian cystic lesions.
