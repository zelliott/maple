Recurrent parotitis is rare in childhood. Its occurrence is characterized by recurrent episodes of swelling and pain in the parotid gland, which are usually accompanied by fever and malaise. Inflammation usually resolves spontaneously during adolescence. The disorder is a condition of unknown etiology. Sialectasis and stricturing occurs in the distal ducts, whereas inflammation of the gland and duct epithelium is probably caused by a low salivary flow rate. Which one can be considered the primary event or secondary change remains unknown. The main-stay of diagnosis is sialography, which depicts typical intraparotidal duct system lesions as strictures or ectasias and excludes sialolithiasis. We here report two 10-year-old male monovular twins who suffered from recurrent swelling and pain in only their left parotid glands. Symptoms were noted approximately every 6 weeks in both patients strictly. Characteristic sialectasis of the distal ducts was demonstrated by magnetic resonance-sialography. Our findings support the hypothesis that recurrent parotitis is caused by a congenital abnormality of the salivary gland ducts. Diagnostic imaging was performed by magnetic resonance imaging during the acute phase of the disease. This technique helps to make the diagnosis without retrograde application of a contrast agent.
