Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are described in selected patients with cervical radiculopathy and a cervical soft disc herniation, treated by anterior cervical discectomy (ACD) without fusion. Six months postoperatively, 45 patients underwent MRI examination using a 0.5 T superconductive unit. T1- and T2-weighted spin echo sequences were acquired on sagittal and axial planes. A low signal intensity on T2-weighted images was visualized at the ACD level in all patients. Five patients were found to have a slight kyphosis at the discectomy level. There was no residual disc material at any ACD level. In 5 patients, areas of diminished signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images on adjacent vertebrae was noticed, indicating sclerosis of the cortical bone adjacent to the ACD level. In 3 patients, cervical disc protrusions without impression on the dura were visualized postoperatively: 2 below and 1 above the ACD level. One patient developed a cervical disc herniation without complaints one level above the operated one. No patient developed infolding or degenerative swelling of the ligamenta flava and no intrinsic cord abnormalities were present. MRI provided useful information on pathology, allowing a non-invasive evaluation following ACD and enabling a better understanding of surgical consequences.
