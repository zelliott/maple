The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of extraperitoneal laparoscopic para-aortic lymphadenectomy for lymph node recurrence of gynecological cancers.

Seven patients underwent extraperitoneal laparoscopic para-aortic lymphadenectomies for suspected lymph node recurrence, detected by magnetic resonance image or CT scan. The suspicious nodes were removed through an extraperitoneal laparoscopic approach.

The median age of patients was 51 years (range: 39-67). The median operating time was 207 min (range 120-300). There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The median nodal yield was 7.3 (range: 1-15). The median hospital stay was 2.5 days (range: 2-3). Histological examination revealed metastasis in 6 of the 7 patients.

The extraperitoneal laparoscopic para-aortic lymphadenectomy for lymph node recurrence of gynecological cancers is a safe and feasible procedure which should be considered in the case of possible recurrence.
