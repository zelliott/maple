In this ongoing study, we are trying to make Visible Korean Human (Mar 2000--Feb 2005). The complete MRIs and CTs of the Korean cadaver's entire body are scanned. The cadaver is serially-sectioned at 0.2 mm thickness without any missing images. The anatomical structures in the sectioned images are segmented. The Visible Korean Human is expected to be more helpful than Visible Human in the following ways. First, the Korean data will be more helpful in diagnosing and treating the patients belonging to the yellow race. Second, MRIs and CTs of the entire body at 1 mm thickness will be more helpful in studying the MRIs and CTs. Third, sectioned images without any missing images will be more helpful in making the complete 3D images. Fifth, small pixel size (0.2 mm x 0.2 mm) and thin thickness (0.2 mm) of sectioned images will be more helpful in showing the small anatomical structures greater than 0.2 mm. Sixth, the additional segmented images will be more helpful in making the 3D image and virtual dissection software. The Visible Korean Human will be the basis for making better 3D image and virtual dissection software which will be more helpful in medical education.
