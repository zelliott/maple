This paper describes an interaction system called the DextroBeam designed for manipulating objects in 3D space while looking at a 3D stereoscopic display located in front of the user. Three-dimensional interaction is two-handed and is achieved by means of a stylus with a single button or switch. We have been planning several neurosurgical cases with the DextroBeam, including the separation of Nepalese Siamese twins in April 2001, and have conducted a course on surgery of the Temporal Bone (as part of the 9th ASEAN ORL Head and Neck Congress in Singapore, March 2001).
