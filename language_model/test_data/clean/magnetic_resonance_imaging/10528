We assessed midsagittal corpus callosum size in sickle cell disease (SCD) and its relationship to lesion volume, lesion location, and cognitive functioning. Twenty-eight children with SCD and 16 demographic controls completed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological testing. Corpus callosum (CC) size was smaller for children with silent infarcts (n = 8) or overt stroke (n = 8) than for those without visible infarcts (n = 12) or control participants. Lesion volume was a robust predictor of IQ and other cognitive scores; total CC size did not typically add explanatory power for these measures. The size of the rostral body of the CC, however, independently predicted measures of distractibility, speeded production, and working memory. Posterior CC size was also decreased among many of the children with SCD, even in the absence of visible infarcts in this region. Brain morphology appears to provide additional information about SCD-related effects on the brain above and beyond visible infarcts.
