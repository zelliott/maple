Recent advancements in high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology (3 T and higher), providing increased signal sensitivity and images with more prominent contrasts intrinsic to the brain, offer new opportunities for assessing brain alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this article, the principle benefits of high field MRI for PD research are described and new findings at high magnetic fields are reviewed. Several high field MRI methodologies, including structural MRI, imaging of brain iron, diffusion tensor imaging, arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging, rotating frame imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are critically reviewed for their potential roles in studies of PD.
