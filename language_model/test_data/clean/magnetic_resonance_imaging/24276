Metastasis to the foot is rarely presented in the literature. We describe a 56-year-old woman with nonspecific pain in the left foot, ankle, and knee for 3 months. The patient was diagnosed as having urothelial carcinoma with metastasis to the left lower extremity, including the foot. This diagnosis was reached through the combined efforts of radiologic techniques and biopsies. This case discusses the importance of paying close attention to the details of the history and physical examination, performing appropriate tests, and obtaining suitable referrals.
