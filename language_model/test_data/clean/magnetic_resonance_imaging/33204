Surgical planning for refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy (rMTLE) relies on seizure localization by ictal electroencephalography (EEG). Multiple factors impact the number of seizures recorded. We evaluated whether seizure freedom correlated to the number of seizures recorded, and the related factors.

We collected data for 32 patients with rMTLE who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy. Primary analysis evaluated number of seizures captured as a predictor of surgical outcome. Subsequent analyses explored factors that may seizure number.

Number of seizures recorded did not predict seizure freedom. More seizures were recorded with more days of seizure occurrence (p<0.001), seizure clusters (pâ‰¤0.011) and poorly localized seizures (PLSz) (p=0.004). Regression modeling showed a trend for subjects with fewer recorded poorly localized seizures to have better surgical outcome (p=0.052).

Total number of recorded seizures does not predict surgical outcome. Patients with more PLSz may have worse outcome.
