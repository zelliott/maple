Osteoporosis is characterized by bone loss and deterioration of the trabecular bone (TB) architecture that leads to impaired overall mechanical strength of the bone. Bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is currently the standard clinical metric assessing bone integrity but it fails to capture the structural changes in the TB. Recent research suggests that structure contributes to bone strength in a manner complementary to BMD. Besides parameters of scale such as the mean TB thickness and mean bone volume fraction, parameters describing the anisotropy of the trabecular architecture play an important role in the characterization of TB since trabeculae are preferentially oriented along the direction of local loading. Therefore, the degree of structural anisotropy is of pivotal importance to the bone's mechanical competence. The most common method for measuring structural anisotropy of TB is the mean-intercept length (MIL). In this work we present a method, based on the three-dimensional spatial autocorrelation function (ACF), for mapping of the full structural anisotropy ellipsoid of both TB thickness and spacing and we examine its performance as compared to that of MIL. Not only is the ACF method faster by several orders of magnitude, it is also considerably more robust to noise. Further, it is applicable at lower spatial resolution and is relatively insensitive to image shading. The chief reason for ACF's superior performance is that it does not require binarization, which is difficult to achieve in the limited spatial regime of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. MIL and ACF have been applied to high-resolution magnetic resonances images of the tibia in a group of ten healthy postmenopausal women by comparing the structural anisotropy and principal direction of the computed fabric tensor for each method. While there is fair agreement between the two methods, ACF analysis yielded greater anisotropy than MIL for both TB thickness and spacing. There was good agreement between the two techniques as far as the eigenvectors of the fabric ellipsoids were concerned, which parallel the bone's macroscopic axis.
