Cerebral phaeohyphomycosis is a rare diagnosis that designates a central nervous system (CNS) infection by dematiaceous fungi. These organisms most commonly cause cutaneous infections in humans, but much less commonly, they cause CNS disease with evidence of neurotropism. We describe here the clinical course and post-mortem findings in a fatal case of cerebral phaeohyphomycosis occurring in an 80-year-old man. He had a long and complex past medical history and approximately 7 weeks prior to his death, he presented to an outside institution with imaging findings reported to be consistent with a cerebrovascular accident. He was treated with thrombolytic therapy and sent to a rehabilitation program. Approximately 2 weeks prior to his death, he was transferred to our institution with worsening chronic heart failure symptoms. Imaging after admission showed a ring-enhancing lesion and the differential diagnosis shifted to include a primary neoplasm vs. an abscess. There was a downward clinical course and neurosurgical biopsy was declined secondary to predicted poor outcome. A full autopsy was performed and confirmed the pre-mortem imaging findings of a cerebral abscess with multiple satellite lesions. The histologic and microbiologic findings were characteristic of cerebral phaeohyphomycosis. Microbiological features and disease characteristics of these organisms as well as incidence and populations affected are also discussed.
