Sports radiology is a new radiological subspecialty. Traumatic sports-related injuries can be acute, but are more frequently caused by over-use. Close collaboration between the treating physician and radiologist optimizes the choice of the best imaging technique to confirm the tentative diagnosis and to determine the treatment plan. Conventional radiology is indicated when a bone injury is suspected. In the case of discrepancy between the x-ray findings (no abnormality) and the clinical findings (presence of symptoms) additional investigation is, however, indicated. Ultrasound is the indicated technique for lesions of superficial soft tissue, such as tendons and muscles. MRI is very valuable in both acute and over-use injuries involving bone and soft tissue.
