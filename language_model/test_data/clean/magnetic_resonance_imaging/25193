Leigh syndrome (LS) is a heterogeneous disorder, usually due to a defect in oxidative metabolism. Typically, signs and symptoms commence in infancy or childhood, although rare cases of adult onset have been described. Progressive deterioration is the norm. The authors describe a 22-year-old woman with partial cytochrome c oxidase deficiency who developed fulminant LS following an acute febrile illness and who subsequently showed dramatic clinical and neuroradiologic improvement.
