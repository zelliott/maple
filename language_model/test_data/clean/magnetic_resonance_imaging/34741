Serial MRI is an important measure of disease progression in evaluating the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Accurate comparisons of scans for lesion activity and lesion volume require precise repositioning of patients. A simple, reproducible repositioning method is described. In a multicenter treatment trial of MS using beta-interferon-1b, this method has been successful, with only 1.1% of scans being rejected because of poor repositioning.
