The somatostatin analog octreotide has been demonstrated to improve optic tract compression caused by pituitary macroadenomas within hours of its administration and/or reduce tumor size in some patients. We report the results of a prospective multicenter study of the effects of octreotide on visual function and tumor size in patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas or gonadotropin-secreting adenomas.

Twenty-four patients with visual defects caused by histologically confirmed macroadenomas were administered octreotide via continuous subcutaneous infusion, as follows: 100 micrograms the 1st day and, if necessary, 200 micrograms the 2nd and then 100 or 200 micrograms three times daily if visual function improved. Vision was assessed after 4 days, 1 month, and 2 months, including tumor size evaluation. Visual improvement was defined by a net gain of at least 2/10 in acuity and/or of more than 20% of the surface of one isopter (a reduction in tumor volume of > or = 20% of the initial measurement); opposite changes were defined as deterioration.

Visual improvement was noted in 13 of 24 patients, 10 of 23 patients and 9 of 22 patients, and was not noted in 11 of 24 patients, 14 of 23 patients, and 13 of 22 patients after 4 days, 1 month, and 2 months, respectively. After 2 months, three adenomas had shrunk, three had not changed in size, and one had increased; visual function improved in the seven patients with these adenomas. Octreotide was discontinued in 13 patients for lack of efficacy.

The incidence of visual improvement and tumor shrinkage noted in this study was higher than previously reported. Our data suggest that early onset of visual improvement might help in deciding which patients profit from octreotide. However, concomitant gain in visual acuity with deterioration in visual fields or visual improvement with an increase (moderate) in tumor size can occur.
