The objective of this study was to define the normal gross anatomic appearance of the adult equine tarsus on a low-field magnetic resonance (MR) image. Six radiographically normal, adult, equine tarsal cadavers were utilized. Using a scanner with a 0.064 Tesla magnet, images were acquired in the sagittal, transverse and dorsal planes for T1-weighted and the sagittal plane for T2-weighted imaging sequences. Anatomic structures on the MR images were identified and compared with cryosections of the imaged limbs. Optimal image planes were identified for the evaluation of articular cartilage, subchondral bone, flexor and extensor tendons, tarsal ligaments, and synovial structures. MR images provide a thorough evaluation of the anatomic relationships of the structures of the equine tarsus.
