A 40-year-old patient was seen because of a three-month history of low back pain unresponsive to standard therapy. Crush fractures of T12 and L2 were seen on plain radiographs. A magnetic resonance imaging study disclosed lesions of all the vertebral bodies from T12 to the sacrum sparing the disks and epidural space. Histologic features of a vertebral biopsy specimen was consistent with malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the bone. The multifocal distribution caused some reluctance to accept this diagnosis, which was, however, confirmed by detailed immunohistochemical studies and reevaluation of the histologic slides by independent observers who were unaware of the initial diagnosis. Chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cisplatin was started but the patient died 15 months after the diagnosis. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma mainly affects the metaphyses of the long tubular bones. The spine is a very uncommon site of localization of this tumor. The multifocal spinal lesions in our patient may have been produced by metastases from an unidentified primary or by direct spread via the perivertebral soft tissues of a primary located in a vertebral body. The management of malignant fibrous histiocytoma relies on a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Although complete excision of the tumor can be followed by prolonged survival, the prognosis is bleak in unresectable forms.
