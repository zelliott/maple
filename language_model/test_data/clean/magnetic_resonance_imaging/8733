Use of continuous EEG in the ICU setting is increasing. The EEG electrode continues to be a weak link in the chain from recording to interpretation. The technical difficulties of maintaining artifact-free, low impedance data collection are magnified by the ICU environment and prolonged duration of monitoring often required for these patients.

We describe a case demonstrating the longest reported continuous use of subdermal wire electrodes.

Subdermal wire electrodes offer a safe method to overcome technical challenges while maintaining high-recording quality. Their advantages and disadvantages are considered in specific circumstances and in comparison to other electrode types.
