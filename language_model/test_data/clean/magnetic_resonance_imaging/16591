The intraparotid facial nerve is difficult to delineate using conventional MR sequence. Our aim was to assess the value of 3D DESSWE MR imaging in depicting the normal anatomy of the intraparotid facial nerve.

A 3D-DESSWE sequence was performed with optimum parameters in 18 healthy volunteers on a 1.5T MR imaging unit. The data obtained were reconstructed in relation to the course of the facial nerve by using the MPR and thin-section MIP programs. Images acquired were analyzed by 2 neuroradiologists. They made the initial evaluations independently but resolved inconsistencies by collaborative review and consensus agreement. The certainty of identifying the intraparotid facial nerve was scored and recorded on an arbitrary scale of 0-2. The lengths of the facial nerves were measured; CNRs of the facial nerves and parotid ducts were calculated. Statistical evaluation of the results was achieved by the 2-tailed Wilcoxon test, ANOVA, and a paired t test.

In all subjects, 3D DESSWE images provided a reliable definition of the normal facial nerve anatomy bilaterally. There were no significant differences between scores, lengths, and CNRs of bilateral facial nerves (P > .05). The intraparotid facial nerve, parotid ducts, and retromandibular vein showed high signal intensity while the surrounding soft tissue showed relatively low signal intensity. The signal intensity between the facial nerves and parotid ducts was significantly different (P < .01); but no differences could be obtained for the CNRs between the 2 structures (P > .05).

The 3D DESSWE sequence can display the intraparotid course of the normal facial nerve, including the relationship between the facial nerve and the parotid duct.
