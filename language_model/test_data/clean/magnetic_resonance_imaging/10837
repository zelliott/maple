Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is a rare disease of the breast. Clinically and radiologically it may mimic breast carcinoma. We report a case of a 34-year-old female patient with this diagnosis, concentrating on magnetic resonance image MRI findings and its clinical application. There have been other reports on MRI findings in this entity in the radiological literature, but in our case report, clinical, cytological, pathological, and radiological correlations are also provided.
