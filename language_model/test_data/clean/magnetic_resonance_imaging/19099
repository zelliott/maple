We present a case of right lung adenosquamous cell carcinoma that had obstructed the main pulmonary artery and superior pulmonary vein, causing multiple pulmonary infarctions in the right upper and middle lobes. Multiple peripheral pulmonary nodules showed clinical features that are characteristic of pulmonary infarction: rapid appearance and gradual reduction in size, pleural-based parenchymal density with a truncated apex and a round nodular shadow with a blurred margin and a centrally directed linear shadow. The nodules were more intense than the primary tumor in both T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We conclude that pulmonary infarction can look like a nodule when lung cancer invades both the pulmonary artery and vein and that such cases can be distinguished from pulmonary metastasis by MRI, computed tomography and a series of radiological examinations.
