Economic forces are changing Canadian medicine. There are four hospitals in Manitoba with CT services and eight were planning to add services based on public subscription, internal transfer of resources and expected growth. The Ministry of Health requested an in depth report and review. Analysis of clinical activity for 287 disease categories from 13,996,240 physician claims and 149,480 hospital discharges reveal that 33,552 CT examinations are reasonable for 1.1 million people. The cost of operating each scanner is one million dollars per year. A formal review process of the report by the 12 hospitals and 7 selected experts was conducted. An advisory committee of all interested parties recommended that no further resources be allocated without proven clinical need and that a strong management committee be reactivated. MRI growth for nervous disease is expected to replace much CT activity in the next five years.
