Although a number of applications of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging are receiving increasing attention, situations in which cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can provide clinically useful information that is not available via other imaging techniques are of particular interest. It is now appreciated that cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can provide consistently excellent assessments of ventricular function when other techniques are not optimum. This article addresses an additional recently developed capacity for direct, high-resolution imaging of infarcted myocardium.
