We report a 48-year-old woman with a left posterior temporal extra-axial mass that had the imaging characteristics of a meningioma on preoperative CT, MRI and angiography. However, a biopsy diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. This case illustrates that dural-based sarcoid masses can be very vascular and radiographically indistinguishable from meningiomas. Characteristic imaging features of extra- and intra-axial sarcoid lesions are discussed.
