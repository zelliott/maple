To provide an overview of the potential use of contrast-enhanced MRI as tool for further risk stratification in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

The presence of scar measured by contrast-enhanced MRI has been shown to predict poor prognosis in several models of cardiomyopathy, including ischemic and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Current strategy to identify HCM patients who are at increased risk for sudden cardiac death is still not ideal. Recent data suggest that the presence of scar measured by contrast-enhanced MRI is a predictor of arrhythmias and poor prognosis in patients with HCM.

MRI is a potential technique to help identify HCM patients who are at risk for sudden cardiac death.
