The anterior jaw bones are often considered relatively safe surgical sites. Nonetheless, the increasing rate of surgical interventions in that area, such as oral implant placement and bone grafting, has highlighted the potential risks and has raised the reported complications. A careful documentation of all anatomic variations in anterior jaw bone neurovascularization has thus become necessary. The present report attempts to revisit jaw bone neurovascularization, addressing typical anatomic appearances and variations. We summarize the results of various microanatomical studies carried out by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) of the human anterior jaw bones. These studies reveal that edentulous and dentate anterior jaws present significant variation in the occurrence of the mandibular incisive canal and genial spinal foramina, as well as the maxillary nasopalatine canal. All of these canal structures contain a neurovascular bundle, whose diameter may be large enough to cause clinically significant trauma. A careful presurgical radiographic analysis of the anterior jaw bones is therefore advised.
