Medial medullary infarction is characterized by ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy, contralateral hemiparesis sparing the face, and contralateral disturbance of deep sensation. Although it is possible to make a clinical diagnosis in typical patients, diagnosis is difficult if hypoglossal nerve palsy is absent. We describe a patient with medial medullary infarction without hypoglossal nerve palsy. The patient suffered from left hemiplegia and homolateral disturbance of deep sensation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the site of the lesion to be in the medial portion of the upper medulla oblongata. The result of somatosensory evoked potential testing was compatible with disturbance of the medullary medial lemniscus. In a review of the literature, we examined the relation between clinical features and lesion location in 16 patients with medial medullary infarction and compared these to the present patient. Motor paresis was present in every patient, while disturbance of deep sensation was recorded in nine of 13 patients and hypoglossal nerve palsy in six of 14 patients. In atypical patients with medial medullary infarction (such as the present patient), magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to detect the lesion and to make a clinical diagnosis.
