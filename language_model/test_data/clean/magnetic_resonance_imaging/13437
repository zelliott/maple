There was a significant correlation between two measures of cerebral atrophy (the ventricle to brain ratio and the relative cerebral volume) and T1 in 19 detoxified alcoholics. This provides further evidence that T1 is a marker of structural damage in alcoholics although the partial volume effect of CSF may contribute to this finding. This has implications for studies comparing alcoholics to normal controls and suggests that better ways of excluding CSF need to be found.
