Two brothers born to a healthy, consanguineous Spanish couple have a syndrome of MÃ¶bius sequence with involvement of cranial nerves V, VI, VII, IX, and XII, central nervous system malformations; characteristic face with creased earlobes, short philthrum, and a short, arched upper lip, skeletal anomalies with short sternum and delayed bone maturation, hypogenitalism, and profound mental retardation. We suggest that this is a new multiple congenital anomalies condition and mental retardation (MCA/MR) syndrome with autosomic recessive inheritance.
