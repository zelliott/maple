Retinoblastoma is a highly curable tumor unless extraocular extension or metastases have occurred. Intracranial retinoblastoma metastases usually result from either contiguous or hematogenous spread and are rapidly fatal. We report two cases of pathologically proven, hemorrhagic intracranial retinoblastoma metastases and correlate magnetic resonance images with pathologic findings. Magnetic resonance with its high sensitivity and specificity for blood extravasation can document the associated hemorrhagic component of the tumor and help in the differentiation of nonmetastatic second neoplasms in retinoblastoma patients.
