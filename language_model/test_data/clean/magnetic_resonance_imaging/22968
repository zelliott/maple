We describe a case of highly refractory synovial chondromatosis, which recurred despite four arthroscopic synovectomies, a chemical synovectomy, two open synovectomies and an arthrodesis. A review of the literature revealed one similar case. Both presented with marked joint stiffness suggesting a poor prognosis. Although arthrodesis may relieve short-term symptoms it does not prevent further recurrence of disease.
