Gangliogliomas are one of the uncommon tumours of central nervous system. Since these tumours have been associated with an indolent clinical course and benign biological behaviour, it is essential to make an accurate histopathological diagnosis of ganglioglioma. In this study the salient clinical and histopathological features in six patients with intracranial ganglioglioma are described.
