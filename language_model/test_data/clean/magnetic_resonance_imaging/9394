4.

• To investigate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in selecting patients for active surveillance (AS).

• We identified prostate cancers patients who had undergone a 21-core biopsy scheme and fulfilled the criteria as follows: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≤ 10 ng/mL, T1-T2a disease, a Gleason score ≤ 6, <3 positive cores and tumour length per core <3 mm. • We included 96 patients who underwent a radical prostatectomy (RP) and a prostate MRI before surgery. • The main end point of the study was the unfavourable disease features at RP, with or without the use of MRI as AS inclusion criterion.

• Mean age and mean PSA were 62.4 years and 6.1 ng/mL, respectively. Prostate cancer was staged pT3 in 17.7% of cases. • The rate of unfavourable disease (pT3-4 and/or Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3) was 24.0%. A T3 disease on MRI was noted in 28 men (29.2%). MRI was not a significant predictor of pT3 disease in RP specimens (P = 0.980), rate of unfavourable disease (P = 0.604), positive surgical margins (P = 0.750) or Gleason upgrading (P = 0.314). • In a logistic regression model, no preoperative parameter was an independent predictor of unfavourable disease in the RP specimen. • After a mean follow-up of 29 months, the recurrence-free survival (RFS) was statistically equivalent between men with T3 on MRI and those with T1-T2 disease (P = 0.853).

• The results of the present study emphasize that, when the selection of patients for AS is based on an extended 21-core biopsy scheme, and uses the most stringent inclusion criteria, MRI does not improve the prediction of high-risk and/or non organ-confined disease in a RP specimen.
