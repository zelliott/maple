Radiosurgery (RS) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) were performed in 23 and 22 patients respectively for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. RS and HSRT were performed with a dedicated linear accelerator (LINAC): an invasive frame (for RS) or a relocatable stereotactic frame fitted with a thermoplastic mask and bite blocks (HSRT) were used for positioning patients. The RS treatment delivered 40 Gy in a single fraction, or for HSRT, the equivalent radiobiological fractionated dose - a total of 72 Gy in six fractions. The target (the retrogasserian cisternal portion of the trigeminal nerve) was identified by fusion of CT scans with 1-mm-thick T2-weighted MRI, and the radiant dose was delivered by a 10-mm-diameter cylindrical collimator. The results were evaluated using the Barrow Neurological Institute pain scale during follow-up (mean 3.9 years). The 95% isodose was applied to the entire target volume. After RS (23 patients), Class 1 results were observed in 10 patients; Class II in nine, Class IIIa in two, Class IIIb in one, and Class V results in one patient. Facial numbness occurred in two (8.7%) patients, and the trigeminal neuralgia recurred in two patients (8.7%). Following HSRT (22 patients), Class I results were achieved in eight patients, Class II in eight, Class IIIa in four, and Class IIIb in two patients; recurrence occurred in six (27.5%), and there were no complications. Thus, both RS and HSRT provided effective and safe therapy for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Patients who underwent RS experienced better pain relief and a lower recurrence rate, whereas those who underwent HRST had no side effects, and in particular, no facial numbness.
