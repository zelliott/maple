If the role of multislice CT and MRI is not clearly defined in ischemic heart disease, these new cardiac imaging techniques are very promising due to recent technological advances. The detection of coronary artery plaque and stenosis, as well as coronary bypass graft and stenting patency, the evaluation of left ventricular remodeling after infarction, are available in routine with a 16-slices multislice CT. MRI is the technique of choice to appreciate the impact of a coronary artery lesion on myocardium: detection of ischemia by first-pass perfusion imaging at rest and under pharmacological stress, detection and extension of infarcted myocardium and assessment of myocardial viability. The potential indications will be discussed for each technique in the light of the main clinical questions asked by the cardiologist in daily practice.
