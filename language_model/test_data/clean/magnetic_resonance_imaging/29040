We aimed to show how in multi-disciplinary research data collected to meet the needs of one discipline can provide information of value to another.

Using the critical incident technique, 25 GPs were interviewed about recent scans requested for patients with knee and lumbar spine complaints. Transcripts of the interviews were scrutinized from both a medical and an economic perspective.

Five key economic issues where further research is needed were identified.

The total value of the information provided by multi-disciplinary research may exceed the sum of the information collected to meet the requirements of the individual disciplines.
