This report discusses a biopsy proven case of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, with additional prominent vascular inflammatory features, characterized by a rapidly progressive dementia and leukoencephalopathy, where the clinical and radiological abnormalities resolved rapidly with minimal therapeutic intervention. We propose the term cerebral amyloid inflammatory vasculopathy (CAIV) to describe this condition.
