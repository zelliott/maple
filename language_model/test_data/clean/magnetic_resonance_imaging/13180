Double-orifice mitral valve (DOMV) is a rare congenital malformation characterized by two separate valve orifices of varying sizes in association with the abnormalities of the subvalvular apparatus. It has been reported to be associated with a variety of other congenital malformations. We report a rare case of incomplete form of Shone's complex composed of a complete bridge-type DOMV and bicuspid aortic valve, well demonstrated by both transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
