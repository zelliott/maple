The authors report clinically relevant results from topographic brain electrical activity mapping of patients undergoing psychiatric evaluation. Topographic methods are discussed and compared with electroencephalographic (EEG) and evoked potential (EP) techniques. Suggestions are made for using topographic analysis of EEG and EP data in clinical psychiatric practice.
