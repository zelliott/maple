Cerebral aspergillosis is a rare condition usually encountered in severely immunodepressed patients. We review the case of an immunocompetent patient who developed a fulminant form of cerebral aspergillosis which led to death due to the rapid formation and rupture of multiple mycotic aneurysms in the cerebral arteries. We suggest the possible role of genetic factors in causing this unusual clinical history and we propose that cerebral aspergillosis should be taken into consideration early in the process of diagnosis in order to allow for timely treatment.
