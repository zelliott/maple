Mammography is the only imaging modality that has been validated by multiple randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses to reduce mortality from breast cancer. Although it is demonstrated to be effective in reducing mortality from breast cancer, mammography has its limitations, especially in young high-risk women with dense breasts. Other imaging modalities have been pursued as an adjunct screening modality in this population. Of these, the most widely accepted is contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. This article reviews current recommendations and limitations of using MR imaging of the breast to screen asymptomatic women at high risk for breast cancer.
