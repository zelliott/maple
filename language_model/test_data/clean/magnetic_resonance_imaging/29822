The aim of this study was to evaluate MR imaging findings of the associated findings in surrounding tissues of the extra-articular soft tissue ganglion cysts around the knee. We retrospectively reviewed MR images of 30 patients who had surgically confirmed extra-articular soft tissue ganglion cysts around the knee with focus on the associated findings in surrounding tissues, such as muscle, subcutaneous fat, bone, and nerve. The most common associated finding was the visualization of channel between ganglion cyst and the joint, which was demonstrated in 20 cases (continuous type in 12 cases and discontinuous type in 8 cases). Other associated findings were seen in 15 cases; pericystic edema ( n=9), bony remodelling ( n=3), and nerve involvement ( n=3). The bony remodelling involved the proximal metaphysis of tibia in all 3 cases. Two patients with nerve involvement had deep peroneal nerve in subacute phase and one involved common peroneal nerve in chronic phase. The MR imaging is a useful imaging modality to evaluate the associated findings in extra-articular soft tissue ganglion cysts around the knee. The evaluation of these associated findings is helpful for the differentiation of ganglion cysts from other cystic lesions around the knee.
