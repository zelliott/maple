To assess the efficacy of ultrasonography (USG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing a particular urologic disease, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD).

A patient with a case of ARPKD, as diagnosed by USG and MRI.

USG revealed features typical of ARPKD; the kidneys were enlarged and echogenic, with a loss of normal renal architecture. MRI revealed anatomical features similar to those demonstrated by USG. Furthermore, MRI showed clearer delineation and tissue specificity of the affected kidneys.

USG and MRI were useful in diagnosing ARPKD. MRI can serve as an adjunctive method for diagnosing certain fetal anomalies.
