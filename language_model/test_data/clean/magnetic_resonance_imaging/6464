This report describes invasion of overlying calvaria and soft tissues by a high-grade glioma without macroscopic evidence of dural involvement. The initial radiologic examinations demonstrated a heterogeneous mass in the right frontoparietal region with both extra- and intra-axial components. Inward displacement of the adjacent dura initially prompted consideration for extra-axial lesions such as metastatic lesions, lymphoma, or an aggressive meningioma. The pathologic findings demonstrated a glial cell origin.
