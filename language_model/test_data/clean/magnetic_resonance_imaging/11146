Discal calcification in childhood is rare. Calcifications are occasionally discovered during routine examinations. Generally, the calcification process is confined to the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc.

We describe the cases of two children, five and seven years old who presented with acute low back pain. The patients underwent a CT scan, which demonstrated a posterolateral calcified disc hernia.

Only a few cases with evidence of calcification of the herniated portion of the disc have been previously described. The clinical picture is composed of pain and functional limitation. The radiographic picture consists of the association of morphological and structural alterations of vertebral bodies adjacent to one or more disc calcifications usually centrally sited, sometimes associated with anterior or posterior herniations. The surgical decompression of the nerve root could be necessary.
