Because of concerns about direct visualization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), many functional neurosurgeons continue to rely on atlas-based coordinates to reach this target. T2-weighted MRI does allow direct visualisation of the STN. In order to compare the coordinates of the target point within the visualised STN with those obtained from standard brain atlases, the preoperative stereotactic T2-weighted MRI used to implant 55 deep brain stimulation electrodes in the visualised STN of 29 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease treated in two European centres were studied. The coordinates of the directly visualised STN were significantly different from those of the atlas target. Variability of the position of the STN may render direct visualisation a more accurate means of targeting this nucleus.
