The authors compared the two most common presurgical tests now used for the preoperative staging of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

One hundred consecutive radical retropubic prostatectomy patients were imaged at 1.5 Tesla before surgery with routine T1-weighted and T2-weighted transaxial images. The images were analyzed by two experienced radiologists for evidence of extracapsular disease. Radiologists rated each gland on a scale of 0 to 100 for the percentage likelihood of extracapsular disease based on its MRI appearance. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted, and areas were calculated for the two radiologists and the preoperative PSA values.

Comparison of the areas of the ROC curves generated from the two radiologists and those from the preoperative PSA values showed no statistical difference.

In this series, radiologic interpretation of body coil MRI studies in those patients chosen for a radical retropubic prostatectomy was no better in staging adenocarcinoma of the prostate than simply using the preoperative PSA values.
