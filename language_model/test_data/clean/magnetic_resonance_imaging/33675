Mycotic pseudoaneurysms of the ascending aorta are rare cardiovascular lesions that carry the risk of potentially disastrous complications such as aortic rupture or widespread sepsis. Regardless of its location in the arterial system, this lesion carries a high mortality rate. Early diagnosis of mycotic pseudoaneurysm is paramount for optimizing the chances of surgical therapy. While imaging strategies of this lesion have included aortography, echocardiography, and computed tomography, the information gained from each of these individual studies may be acquired in a single MR imaging session. MRI offers the fundamental advantages of noninvasiveness, nonionization, and multiplanar imaging capabilities. Additionally, MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast, a wide field of view, qualitative and quantitative flow analysis, and an independence of operator expertise or patient body habitus.
