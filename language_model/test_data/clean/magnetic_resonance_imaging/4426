Cerebellar tonsillectomy is a controversial treatment for Chiari type I malformation combined with syringomyelia. To demonstrate the validity of this procedure, we evaluated the postoperative clinical course, the histopathological finding in the resected cerebellar tonsils and the MR images of four patients. The patients were all women, ranging in age from 27 to 58 years old (mean: 43 years). The postoperative follows-up period lasted from 28 to 51 months (average: 38 mos), and the neurological symptoms and signs improved in all patients. Histopathological examination of the resected tonsils revealed a loss of Purkinje cells and granule cells. Vacuolated degeneration and chromatolysis were also seen, and modified Bielschowsky stain revealed axonal degeneration. These findings appeared to be irreversible. Postoperative T1-weighted MR images of the cervical and thoracic spine demonstrated a decrease in the size of the syrinx and the disappearance of evidence of tonsillar herniation in all patients. Postoperative phase-contrast MR images showed good CSF pulsation in the subarachnoid space at the craniocervical junction in all three patients examined. It was possible to avoid surgical complications by using careful microsurgical techniques. Based on these results, we concluded that cerebellar tonsillectomy is an adequate surgical strategies for treating Chiari type I malformation associated with syringomyelia.
