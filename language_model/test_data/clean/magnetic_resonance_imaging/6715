The Cox-Maze III remains the gold standard for the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. However, the "cut-and-sew" technique is time consuming and technically challenging. The pulmonary veins are the source of ectopy in the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. The safety and efficacy of bipolar radiofrequency to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins was evaluated in a prospective multi-center trial.

Beginning in January 2002, 30 patients at three medical centers underwent pulmonary vein isolation using bipolar radiofrequency and were followed for 6 months. Twenty-four of the patients also underwent a modified Cox-Maze III. Electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins was confirmed with intraoperative pacing. Pulmonary vein patency was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging or three-dimensional computed tomography in 15 patients at 1 month.

Mean age was 60.9 +/- 11.7 years. Nineteen patients had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. All pulmonary veins were isolated in every patient. The left pulmonary veins underwent 3.0 +/- 1.4 applications for a total of 26.4 +/- 10.5 seconds. The right pulmonary veins underwent 2.8 +/- 1.1 applications for a total of 26.3 +/- 12.6 seconds. There was no operative mortality. At 1 month, imaging revealed no evidence of pulmonary vein stenosis. At 6 months, 96% of patients were in normal sinus rhythm.

The use of bipolar radiofrequency for electrical isolation of pulmonary veins and to replace other Cox-Maze III incisions is safe and effective at controlling atrial fibrillation. This emerging technology may shorten and simplify the surgical management of atrial fibrillation.
