A 58-year-old female presented with symptoms mimicking infective endocarditis and was diagnosed with a right ventricular metastasis from a transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the left renal pelvis. The patient was treated with concurrent removal of the cardiac tumour and radical left nephrectomy followed by adjuvant gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the 14th report of cardiac metastases from TCC and the only case where one-stage surgical management of primary and cardiac metastases from TCC has been successfully completed.
