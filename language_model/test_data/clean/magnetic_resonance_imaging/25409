Split notochord syndrome is a spectrum of congenital spinal malformations that develops due to an adhesion between endoderm and ectoderm causing the "splitting" of notochord. Neurenteric cyst is one of the components of split notochord syndrome. We report CT and MRI findings of an unusual case with thoracal spinal cord herniation into a mediastinal neurenteric cyst.
