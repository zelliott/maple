The authors report the case of a 2-year-old baby girl with an intradural meningotheliomatous meningioma of the cauda equina which recurred three times. Despite four operative procedures and localized radiotherapy, the lesion kept on growing to reach the retroperitoneal space. Extensive laminectomy and associated radiotherapy were probably responsible for a spinal dislocation which had to be operated on. The child was left paraplegic with major bladder dysfunction after all procedures. This is the first reported case of well-documented "malignant" evolution of a spinal meningioma.
