A boy presented with hypertension, seizures, lethargy, headache, and occipital blindness. He improved with antihypertensive therapy. Other reported children with a similar distinctive clinical condition are compared with adults with a syndrome termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy. Because both gray and white matter are involved, we suggest that the name be changed to occipital-parietal encephalopathy syndrome.
