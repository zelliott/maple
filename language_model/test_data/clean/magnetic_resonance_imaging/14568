Pseudogout, also known as calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (CPPD) with giant cell reparative granuloma (GCRG) of the temporal bone is a rare disease, which is very easy to misdiagnose. When two diseases occur simultaneously, the pathological tissue of diseases is closely associated, which complicates clinical representation and causes enormous difficulty in diagnosis and treatment. We report a case of CPPD of the temporomandibular joint accompanied by surrounding GCRG of temporal bone in a 62-year-old male.
