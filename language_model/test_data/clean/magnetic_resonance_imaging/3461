Scleroderma, or systemic sclerosis (SS), is an autoimmune disease leading to ischemic fibrosis and widespread collagen deposition, invariably affecting the hands. Optimized medical management remains the mainstay of therapy for SS. Surgery can be considered in refractory or severely disabling cases. However, microvascular insufficiency and fibrosis can lead to wound complications and, ultimately, amputation. We present the case of a 61-year-old man with a known history of scleroderma who presented with pain, chronic infection, and ulcerations in the left hand. Initially, amputation seemed a reasonable intervention. After medical optimization with tadalafil, his ulcerations persisted. Instead of amputation, we applied a subatmospheric pressure wound therapy device to his hand. In 4 months, his wounds had healed, there was no evidence of infection, and no digits were amputated.
