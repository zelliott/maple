An asymptomatic 66-year-old female was admitted because of an abnormal shadow on chest X-ray. Computed tomography (CT) revealed that a well-marginated round mass with low density, about 3 cm in diameter, was located in the right anterior superior mediastinum. The border was partially enhanced at contrast material-enhanced CT. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [T 2-weighted] showed the lesion as a high intensity tumor. We performed thoracoscopic surgery and resected the easy-bleeding tumor completely. The tumor was dark red in color and contained old blood. The histopathological diagnosis was hemangioma. There was no recurrence for 3 years. Hemangiomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of well-marginated masses. Thoracoscopic surgery is the very useful methods to resect the mediastinal hemangioma.
