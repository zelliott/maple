Toluene toxicity primarily affects central nervous system white matter, causing a characteristic brain MRI pattern.

A toluene addicted man, after an abstinence period and a treatment with neuroleptics, presented with severe worsening of preexisting generalized tremor, opsoclonus, dysarthria, gait inability, jerky tendon reflexes and behaviour disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild leukoencephalopathy and hypointensities in deep gray matter nuclei. The DaT-scan revealed a decrease in presynaptic dopamine reuptake.

Clinical and neuroradiological findings and the possible sensitivity to neuroleptics indicate dopaminergic impairment. Our case suggests that chronic toluene abuse causes presynaptic dopaminergic depletion.
