Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder with high incidence of malignancy including leukemias, lymphomas, and solid tumors. Central nervous system tumors in ataxia telangiectasia include medulloblastomas and gliomas. We describe a 13-year-old girl with ataxia telangiectasia who developed craniopharyngioma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case of ataxia telangiectasia complicated by craniopharyngioma in the English literature.
