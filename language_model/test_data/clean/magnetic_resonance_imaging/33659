Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the need for cranioplasty in experimental neurobehavioral studies with non-human primates. Postoperatively temporal lobes showed substantial deformation of the neocortex due to pressure from the overlying muscle. A new method of cranioplasty using teflon to cover a cranial defect has been developed. Teflon is easily shaped and fitted into place. This method is safe, allows for the natural shape of the brain, provides protection, and is compatible with imaging techniques. Cranioplasty with teflon should be considered whenever craniotomy is necessary for accessing the brain.
