Hypoxic cells play a key role in the radioresistance of malignant glioma. Interferon-beta, ACNU as nimustine hydrochloride and radiotherapy (IAR) is a common therapy for malignant glioma in Japan. Since hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) increases oxygen pressure in glioma tissue, we applied a modified IAR therapy, radiotherapy after HBO combined with interferon-beta and ACNU (HBO/IAR therapy), for supratentorial malignant gliomas. Daily radiation therapy was completed within 15 min after HBO. We assessed HBO/IAR with respect to toxicity, response rates and the time of tumor progression (TTP). We also examined the incidence of responses by some prognostic factors before HBO/IAR, namely, age, Karnofsky performance scale (KPS), histological type, tumor size, tumor site and operation type. Of 39 patients who participated in this study, 35 underwent a complete schedule of HBO/IAR therapy in which toxicity was permissible. Thirty patients (76.9%) either maintained or increased KPS during HBO/IAR with a mean duration of 68 +/- 14 days. The response rates (CR + PR%) for glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma and overall were 50%, 30% and 43%, respectively. The incidence of therapeutic responses among all prognostic factors before HBO/IAR did not significantly differ. Median TTP for patients with glioblastoma, patients with anaplastic astrocytoma, and overall were 38, 56 and 43 weeks, respectively. The present study suggested that HBO/IAR therapy could be applied to especially patients with poor prognostic factors, because of its short treatment period, its permissible toxicity and identical response to patients with good prognostic factors.
