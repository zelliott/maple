In animal studies of tissue engineering of bone, histology remains the standard for assessing bone formation. As longitudinal studies with this method are feasible only at the cost of large numbers of animals, we looked for an alternative. Therefore, demineralized bone matrix (DBM) and inactivated demineralized bone matrix (iDBM) implants were subcutaneously implanted in a rat. At 1, 3, 5, and 7 weeks postimplantation soft X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were done to monitor bone formation in the implants. At 7 weeks, the animal was killed and the implants were retrieved for histology. Our results showed that in vivo MRI is well suited to assess bone formation larger than 0.5 mm in diameter and to monitor the complete three-dimensional shape of the newly formed bone noninvasively and longitudinally. The MRI results matched well with the histology results obtained at 7 weeks. In contrast, X-ray imaging appeared inappropriate to monitor the bone formation process in DBM.
