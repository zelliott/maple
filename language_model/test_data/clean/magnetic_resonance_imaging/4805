Tumors of the carotid body are uncommon. This primary neoplasm arises from the paraganglionar cells located at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. They are usually multicentric and bilateral. Most patients consult for a painful, pulsatile mass situated in the angle of the jaw. Diagnosis is based on contrast CT, MRI and angiography. The treatment of choice is selective embolization followed by surgery.
