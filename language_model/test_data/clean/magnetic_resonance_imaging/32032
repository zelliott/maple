A 77-year-old woman presenting with progressive visual loss in both eyes was found to have small cell lung cancer. Assay for collapsin response-mediating protein (CRMP) -5 was positive suggesting a paraneoplastic optic neuropathy (PON). During treatment of the small cell lung cancer, the patient died of pneumonia and autopsy disclosed neuropathologic abnormalities consistent with PON. This is only the second case of CRMP-5-confirmed PON to report neuropathologic findings.
