Diagnostic imaging services have been repeatedly targeted as a source of excess health care expenditure. In particular, MRI is considered a high-tech and high-cost imaging service that saw rapid increases in utilization in the early 2000s. However, the most recent trends in the utilization of MR are not known. The aim of this study was to quantify trends in MR utilization overall and by body system from 1998 to 2010 in the Medicare population.

Medicare Part B data sets were obtained for 1998 to 2010 for all MR examinations performed in the Medicare population. Using Current Procedural Terminology codes, the total volume and utilization rates of all MR examinations were tabulated for each year of the study period. MR volume was then categorized by body system.

The utilization rate of MR examinations in the Medicare population was 73 per 1,000 beneficiaries in 1998, increased to a peak of 189 in 2008, and decreased to 183 in 2010. The compound annual growth rate from 1998 to 2008 was 10%. The utilization rate in 2010 represents a decrease of 3.1% from the 2009 utilization rate. The most frequently imaged body section in every year was the head, which accounted for 2,404,250 examinations in 2010, 37.3% of all MR examinations in that year.

The overall MRI utilization rate sharply increased from 1998 until 2008 but then decreased in each of the next 2 years. A similar trend was noted for MR examinations performed in most body sections. These trends are likely to be the result of a number of possible causative factors.
