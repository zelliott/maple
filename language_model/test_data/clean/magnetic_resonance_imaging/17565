Diagnostics of intraarticular lesions is important in the treatment of traumatic anterior shoulder instability.

We studied 30 patients: 26 men and 4 women. For all patients preoperative examinations involved arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and 3D-CT.

The articular capsule adhered to the margin of the glenoid in only 3 cases. In the remaining 27 patients, the joint capsule was detached, showing medial translation. Hill-Sachs lesions were present in 24 cases. Bankart lesions were detected in all cases, and they extended over 2-5 h. Osseous Bankart lesions were detected in 13 cases. MR arthrography revealed the articular labrum in all cases, but AIGHL in only 16 cases. Bankart lesions were found in all cases. When the patients were divided according to the frequency of dislocation, there was a correlation between both distance of the detached joint capsule and visualization of AIGHL and the frequency of dislocation.

From this study, the frequency of dislocation was higher in the patients with severe detachment of the joint capsule, in whom AIGHL could not be visualized by MR arthrography.
