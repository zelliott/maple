Mycotic aortic aneurysms are rare. Improved diagnostic procedures, appropriate antibiotic treatment, and safe surgical techniques have reduced the high mortality associated with bacterial aortitis. However, definite evidence-based conclusions with regard to the surgical strategy cannot be drawn from the data available in the published literature. We report successful endovascular repair of a mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm. Endovascular treatment may offer a benefit, especially in critically ill patients.
