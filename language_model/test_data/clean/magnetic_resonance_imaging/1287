Dual energy CT and quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were used to evaluate marrow changes due to radiation. The bright signal intensity seen on MR was shown by the two quantitative techniques to be due to a threefold increase in the marrow fat content compared with nonradiated levels and to a normal control. Fat estimates by MR and dual energy CT were in excellent agreement. Single energy CT overestimates the amount of bone loss in the radiation field. Dual energy CT and quantitative MR can be used to correct this error.
