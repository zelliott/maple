Multiple cerebral cavernous malformations (mCCMs) are known as potentially epileptogenic lesions. Treatment might be multimodal. Management of patients with mCCMs and epilepsy is challenging.

To evaluate (1) algorhythmic therapeutic sequences in patients with epilepsy associated to mCCMs, (2) whether there are predictive parameters to anticipate the development of drug-resistant epilepsy, and (3) seizure after epilepsy surgery compared to conservatively-treated drug-resistant patients.

All inpatients and outpatients with epilepsy associated to mCCMs from 1990 to 2010 and follow-up >12 months available were retrospectively analyzed.

Twenty-three patients matched inclusion criteria. Epilepsy became drug-resistant in 18/23 (78%) patients. No predictors were found for development of drug-resistant epilepsy. Median follow-up for both groups was 7.8 years. Nine patients did not qualify for surgical therapy and were treated conservatively. One patient of this cohort (11%) was seizure-free (International League Against Epilepsy [ILAE] class 1). Surgical treatment was performed in 9 patients; 7/9 (78%) of these patients were seizure-free (ILAE class 1) after epilepsy surgery for at least 12 months compared with 1/9 patients in the non-operated group. In 7/9 cases (78%) the largest CCM was resected. In 8/9 (89%) not all CCMs were resected.

After initial diagnosis of epilepsy associated to mCCMs, a primary conservative approach is reasonable. Surgical treatment can be successful in a large fraction of cases with drug-resistant epilepsy where an epileptogenic lesion is identified. Cases where surgery is not undertaken are likely to remain intractable.
