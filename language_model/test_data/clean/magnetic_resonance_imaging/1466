To provide the sectional anatomic data for clinical imaging diagnosis of the eustachian tube.

9 cadaver eustachian tube were sectioned on transverse, coronal and sagittal planes using plastination, comparing with the MRI of the eustachian tube.

The coronal and transversal images clearly delineates the anatomical details of the eustachian tube and its fascia and muscles and their relationship, the fibrocartilaginous tube is posteromedial; its upper margin is curled outward to form the roof of the cartilaginous tube. Anteriorly and laterally, the eustachian tube is closed by the salpingopharyngeal fascia extending along the inferior surface of the eustachian tube to or its floor. The tensor veli palatini anterolateral and the levator veli palatini muscle posterolateral and inferior. The submucosal fascia is medial to the levator veli palatini muscle, the pharyngobasilar fascia is between the tensor and levator veli palatini muscles; the fascia of Weber Liel is lateral to the tensor veli palatini muscle.

The cartilaginous portion, muscle and fascia of the eustachian tube could be displayed clearly on MRI. The thin sections of the eustachian tube can be directly compared with the MR images, providing valuable information to image diagnosis of the nasopharyngeal diseases.
