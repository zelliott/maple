Q fever is characterized by its clinical polymorphism. Cardiac involvement in acute Q fever is rare. We report a case of pleuro-pericarditis that rapidly evolved to pericardial constriction during an acute episode of Coxiella burnetii infection. Constrictive pericarditis was confirmed by hemodynamic measurements, echocardiography, and magnetic resonance. Indirect immunofluorescence assay revealed positive serology for acute Q fever. The patient underwent a successful pericardiectomy and was given antibiotics. The histopathologic study of the excised pericardium showed C. burnetii in a large cluster of organisms. After a 6-month follow-up period, the individual was asymptomatic.
