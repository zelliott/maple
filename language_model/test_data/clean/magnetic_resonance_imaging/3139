Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly malignant brain neoplasm that is very rarely discovered in childhood but accounts for approximately 17% of intracranial tumors in the adult. Only approximately 25 children with glioblastoma multiforme in the cerebellum have been described in the literature. We report on a 4 1/2-year-old girl with this tumor in the cerebellar hemisphere and discuss the magnetic resonance imaging findings.
