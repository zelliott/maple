The aim of this study was to evaluate coronary artery stents with MR. Thirty-eight patients underwent MR imaging 48.1 +/- 6.6 days (range 38-60 days) after placement of 47 coronary stents of 11 different types, using navigator echo (NE) and cine gradient-echo (GE) techniques. For both sequences the low signal artifact was used to localize the stent, whereas the flow-related high signal before and distal to the stent was considered as a patency sign. Exercise electrocardiographic test (EET) had been performed 1-7 days before MR. No adverse event with possible relation to the MR examination was observed. All the stents were recognized as signal void with GE, and all but one with NE. Of the 2 patients with positive EET, the first one, with a stent on the left anterior descending coronary artery, presented low signal distal to the stent at both MR sequences, suggesting dysfunction [60% stenosis at conventional coronary angiography (CCA)]; the second one, with two sequential stents on the right coronary artery, presented lack of signal distal to the stents at both MR sequences, suggesting occlusion (97% stenosis at CCA). For the 44 remaining stents in 36 patients with negative EET, MR high signal before and distal to the stent suggested patency at both sequences. MR seems to be a safe and promising technique for non-invasive evaluation of coronary stents.
