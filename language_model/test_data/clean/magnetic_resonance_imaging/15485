The diagnosis of cerebral palsy is based on evidence of impairment of the motor system, but symptoms become evident only as a premature infant matures. The diagnosis is made typically at 18 to 24 months of age, corrected for gestational age at birth. An earlier and more accurate way to identify infants destined to develop cerebral palsy may help improve the prognosis for this vulnerable population. For now, no antenatal, perinatal or postnatal test can predict cerebral palsy with a degree of certainty high enough to help providers or parents plan for an infant's future or make the best use of early intervention resources.
