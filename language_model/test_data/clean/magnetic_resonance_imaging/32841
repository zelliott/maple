Intracranial hemangiopericytomas (HPCs) are rare tumors and their radiological             appearance resembles that of meningiomas, especially meningothelial meningiomas.             To increase the knowledge on the biochemical composition of this type of tumor             for better diagnosis and prognosis, we performed a molecular study using ex vivo             high resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) magnetic resonance spectroscopy             (MRS) perfomed on HPC and peritumoral edematous tissues. Moreover, to help in             the discrimination between HPC and meningothelial meningioma we compared the ex vivo             HR-MAS spectra of samples from one patient with HPC and 5 patients affected by             meningothelial meningioma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in vivo localized             single voxel 1H-MRS was also performed on the same patients prior to surgery and             the in vivo and ex vivo MRS spectra were compared. We observed the presence of             OH-butyrate, together with glucose in HPC and a low amount of N-acetylaspartate             in the edema, that may reflect neuronal alteration responsible for associated             epilepsy. Many differences between HPC and meningothelial meningioma were identified.             The relative ratios of myo-inositol, glucose and gluthatione with respect to glutamate             are higher in HPC compared to meningioma; whereas the relative ratios of creatine,             glutamine, alanine, glycine and choline-containing compounds with respect to glutamate             are lower in HPC compared to meningioma. These data will be useful to improve             the interpretation of in vivo MRS spectra resulting in a more accurate diagnosis             of these rare tumors.
