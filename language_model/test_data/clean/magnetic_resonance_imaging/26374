Osteosarcomatosis (also known as multifocal osteosarcoma or multiple sclerotic osteosarcoma) is a rare condition, characterized by multiple skeletal lesions at initial presentation. We describe a case of osteosarcomatosis involving craniofacial bones presenting with cranial nerve palsies. In addition, a brief review of the literature is given, with a discussion of this highly aggressive form of osteosarcoma.
