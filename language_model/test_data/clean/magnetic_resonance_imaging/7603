Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been shown to be associated with shrinkage of the corpus callosum mid-sagittal cross-sectional area (CCA).

To study temporal rates of corpus callosum atrophy not previously reported for early AD.

We used longitudinal MRI scans to study the rates of change of CCA and circularity (CIR), a measure of its shape, in normal controls (NC, n = 75), patients with very mild AD (AD-VM, n = 51), and mild AD (AD-M, n = 21).

There were significant reduction rates in CCA and CIR in all three groups. While CCA reduction rates were not statistically different between groups, the CIR declined faster in AD-VM (p < 0.03) and AD-M (p < 0.0001) relative to NC, and in AD-M relative to AD-VM (p < 0.0004).

CIR declines at an accelerated rate with AD severity. Its rate of change is more closely associated with AD progression than CCA or any of its sub-regions. CIR may be a useful group biomarker for objective assessment of treatments that aim to slow AD progression.
