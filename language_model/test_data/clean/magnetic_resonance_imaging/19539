Tumor related contralateral motor deficits complicate preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In plegic patients the localization of the sensorimotor cortex is often impossible. In this context we developed a clinical fMRI protocol dedicated to patients with motor deficits using the unaffected ipsilateral hand. Based on the hypothesis that selfpaced finger movements recruit more and larger neuronal populations with rising task complexity, different motor tasks were tested regarding ipsilateral localization in ten right handed volunteers. Complex finger opposition localized the ipsilateral premotor cortex (Brodman area 6) robustly and was introduced to preoperative fMRI in hemiparetic patients as functional landmark to identify the precentral gyrus on the tumors side. Additional contralateral automated tactile stimulation localized the primary somatosensory cortex and completed the protocol.
