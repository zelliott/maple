The present study illustrates a rare case of ependymoma of the spinal cord.

An encapsulated intradural extramedullary ependymoma of the cervicothoracic spinal cord in a 24-year old woman is reported.

Ependymoma is a glial tumor arising in the central nervous system. Intradural extramedullary ependymoma of the spinal cord is rare, and two cases were reported previously.

The woman presented with myelopathy below C6. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an intradural tumor from C4 to T3 and no other lesion in the central nervous system. At surgery, the extramedullary tumor apparently was not attracted to the spinal cord or dura mater. Gross total removal was easily achieved under the operating microscope.

Histologic examination revealed the encapsulated tumor as an anaplastic ependymoma. Almost complete neurologic recovery was obtained.

The encapsulated appearance, lack of an apparent attachment to the central nervous system, and absence of signs of the primary neoplastic process within the brain or spinal cord suggested that the tumor arose from ectopic ependymal cells.
