17 patients--treated with unidirectional carbon-fibre-ligaments augmentation for the anterior cruciate ligament--have been followed-up by MRI and CT. The question has been, whether both methods show comparable results. The interval between operation and follow-up has been 34 months in average (43 to 30). Significance was put on the probants bedding. MR-Imaging in two planes seems to be essential to show the artificial ligament's integrity in its extraarticular "over the top"-position. Satisfying corresponding results could be found in MRI and CT.
