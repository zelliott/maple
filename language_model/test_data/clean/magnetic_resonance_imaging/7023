We acquired simultaneous high-field (3 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-density (64- and 128-channel) EEG using a sparse sampling technique to measure auditory cortical activity generated by right ear stimulus presentation. Using dipole source localization, we showed that the anatomical location of the grand mean equivalent dipole of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) and the center of gravity of fMRI activity were in good agreement in the horizontal plane. However, the grand mean equivalent dipole was located significantly superior in the cortex compared to fMRI activity. Interhemispheric asymmetry was exhibited by fMRI, whereas neither the AEP dipole moments nor the mean global field power (MGFP) of the AEPs showed significant asymmetry. Increasing the number of recording electrodes from 64 to 128 improved the accuracy of the equivalent dipole source localization but decreased the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MR images. This suggests that 64 electrodes may be optimal for use in simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI.
