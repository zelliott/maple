Dorsal defect of the patella (DDP) is an uncommon but well-documented disease entity. We report a case of bilateral DDP with patellar hypoplasia and patello-femoral malalignment. Detailed imaging features including radiographic, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed arthrotomographic appearances, are described.
