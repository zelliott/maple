Techniques and Technology. The use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as a diagnostic technique is rapidly expanding. In parallel, the number of patients with cardiac devices is constantly growing and many of them may be referred for MR examinations. However, implantable cardiac devices are subject to multiple effects from MR, and numerous safety issues need to be considered prior to scanning. In this review, we will summarize our experience with MR imaging of patients with implantable cardiac devices, and outline our safety protocol.
