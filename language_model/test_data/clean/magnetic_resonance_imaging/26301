We present a 26-year-old male patient with Gaucher disease who presented with epigastric pain and a palpable mass in the left abdomen. Ultrasound, abdominal computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging showed massive splenomegaly with multiple splenic nodules up to 7 cm in diameter. Splenic nodules should be included in the differential diagnosis of splenic masses. Follow-up is necessary because of the increased incidence of hematologic malignancies in Gaucher disease.
