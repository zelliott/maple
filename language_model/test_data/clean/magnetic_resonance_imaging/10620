Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is becoming an important tool in the clinical management of patients with congenital heart disease. Because of the diverse problems patients may face after initial correction for tetralogy of Fallot and the large amount of CMR techniques that can be applied, creating a patient-orientated imaging protocol is a difficult issue. Although it is still not certain what the impact of some parameters, provided by CMR, should be on clinical decision making, new techniques are being developed and applied. In this report, we review the current clinical issues in patients with tetralogy of Fallot and review the current implication and limitations of CMR in this patient category.
