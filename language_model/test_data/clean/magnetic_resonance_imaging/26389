The vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM) is a rare cerebro-vascular disorder in neonates. It is characterized by an abnormal direct communication between one or several cerebral arteries and the vein of Galen. It may appear in the neonatal period or afterwards. Three cases of patients affected by VGAM with different clinical expression are presented. Two of them were treated successfully with endovascular embolization. It was not possible to provide the same treatment to the third patient for an intractable congestive heart failure already existing when VGAM was diagnosed.
