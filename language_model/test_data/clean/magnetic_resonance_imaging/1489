To investigate the use of a three-dimensional rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) pulse sequence for direct acquisition of phosphocreatine (PCr) images of the human myocardium.

A short elliptical birdcage radiofrequency (RF) body coil was constructed to produce a uniform flip angle throughout the chest cavity. In vivo images using a spectrally-selective RARE sequence with a spatial resolution of 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm x 2.5 cm (4 cm(3)) were acquired in nine minutes and 40 seconds.

Scans of phantoms demonstrated excellent spectral selectivity. The signal-to-noise ratio in the myocardium ranged from 12.6 in the anterior wall to 5.3 in the mid septum.

This study demonstrates that PCr data can be acquired using a three-dimensional RARE sequence with greater spatial and temporal resolution than spectroscopic techniques.
