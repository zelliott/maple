Sixty-seven patients, who were surgically treated for internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), were retrospectively examined. The patients were evaluated preoperatively by clinical and arthrographic examinations and these results were compared with findings at surgery. Partial or complete dislocation of the disc was detected by arthrographic examination in 65 joints. Actual disc displacement was demonstrated at surgery in 57 TMJs, giving arthrography a positive predictive value of 88% for detecting disc dislocation. Arthrographic diagnosis of disc perforation was unreliable, as both false positive and false negative observations were recorded. Arthrography was found to have a positive predictive value of only 53% for assessing disc perforation. Based upon its proven inaccuracy, invasiveness and discomfort to the patient, it is recommended to replace arthrography by magnetic resonance imaging.
