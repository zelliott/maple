Intramural pregnancy is extremely rare and difficult to diagnose. Because of the high rate of uterine rupture in most cases, hysterectomy is often necessary. The optimal medical management for this condition is unknown. We report 2 cases of intramural pregnancy diagnosed by pelvic MRI and treated with systemic methotrexate.
