POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) syndrome is a rare multisystemic disease associated with plasma cell dyscrasia and increased serum or plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, the latter likely responsible for several POEMS syndrome manifestations. Whereas peripheral neuropathy is the main neurological feature and a mandatory diagnostic criterium, central nervous system involvement is less common except for papilledema and stroke. We recently reported the frequent occurrence at brain MRI of cranial pachymeningeal involvement ina series of POEMS syndrome patients. Meningeal histopathology revealed hyperplasia of meningothelial cells, neovascularization, and obstructive vessel remodeling without inflammatory signs pointing to a role of VEGF in the meningeal manifestations. Here, we report the dramatic pachymeningeal improvement in patients undergoing lenalidomide therapy. These findings support the therapeutic role of lenalidomide and might shed further light on the pathophysiology of the disease
