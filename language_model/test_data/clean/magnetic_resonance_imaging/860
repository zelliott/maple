A 17-year-old woman with scimitar syndrome without an atrial septal defect was operated by intra-cardiac conduit repair. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed resolution images of anatomical findings of scimitar vein. Surgical procedures for the scimitar syndrome have varied according to the anatomic features presented in each case. The detection of precise anatomy of scimitar syndrome is important for determining the appropriate surgical procedure. Images of 3-dimensional (3-D) CT and MRI of scimitar syndrome were demonstrated.
