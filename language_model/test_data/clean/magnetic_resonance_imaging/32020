In testicular germ cell tumour (GCT), imaging plays a central role in assessment of tumour bulk, sites of metastases, monitoring response to therapy, surgical planning and accurate assessment of disease at relapse. The primary modality used for imaging patients with GCT is computed tomography (CT) but plain film radiography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) may all have roles to play. This article reviews the role of imaging of testicular germ cell tumours.
