Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be more sensitive than mammography for detecting breast cancer and may have an adjunctive role in assessing patients with early-stage disease for breast conservation treatment. This study was performed to analyze the impact of breast MRI on the clinical management of 83 patients being considered for breast conservation treatment. Eighty-three consecutive cases of patients undergoing breast MRI during standard workup and evaluation for breast conservation treatment from 1993 to 1996 were retrospectively reviewed. Records were reviewed for patient and tumor characteristics, mammographic findings, MRI findings, timing of MRI study, findings from MRI-guided surgery (when done), and whether the patient underwent breast conservation treatment. MRI definitely altered management in 15 patients (18%), may have affected management in 4 patients (5%), and did not change management in 64 patients (77%). Thirteen patients underwent additional surgery because of MRI findings; the positive predictive value for MRI-guided surgery was 38% (5 of 13). Ultimately, 82% of the patients received breast conservation treatment. No predictive factor was identified to characterize the patients most likely to have management affected by MRI findings. These findings suggest that breast MRI may be useful in the evaluation of patients with early-stage breast cancer for breast conservation treatment. A larger study population and outcome data will be required to confirm these findings and to define those patients most likely to benefit from breast MRI.
