To determine the reliability and the measuring agreement between two radiologists in the identification of relevant structures of prostate anatomy in patients with prostate carcinoma.

15 patients with prostate carcinoma proved by histology underwent MR Imaging on 1.5 Tesla MR-system (Siemens Erlangen). T1- and T2-weighted sequences were used in the depiction of important anatomic structures for diagnosing prostate cancer. 5 sequences of every patient were evaluated for 5 times by each reader. Reliability was proved by the intraclass correlation coefficient and the measuring agreement was proved by Cohen's cappa test.

Only the T2-weighted sequence was of sufficient sensitivity to reach a moderate reliability (r1 = 0.74) and a moderate measurement agreement between the two readers (kappa = 0.5).

For the evaluation of MR images in staging prostate carcinoma, besides the validity and the measuring agreement, the reliability of the radiologist is the important factor.
