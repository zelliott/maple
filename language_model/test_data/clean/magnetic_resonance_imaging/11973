The role of magnetic resonance imaging and plain radiographs in evaluating osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot was studied. Fifty patients were prospectively examined by magnetic resonance imaging and plain radiographs to determine the extent of infection. Thirty-seven patients had positive MRI for osteomyelitis and 19 were positive with conventional radiography. Thirteen patients had negative MRI healed with short course of antibiotics. Five patients with positive MRI received four weeks' course of intravenous antibiotics with two still having persistent infection in the six weeks follow-up. Thirty-two patients underwent surgery with favorable results. Sixty-two bone specimens were obtained for histologic evaluation of osteomyelitis. In cases with histologic proof of diagnosis, magnetic resonance sensitivity was 99%, specificity was 81%, and accuracy was 94%. Thus magnetic resonance imaging was shown to have a high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in detecting osteomyelitis.
