Spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) is an exceedingly uncommon and potentially neurologically devastating condition. Recognition of blood products in magnetic resonance imaging is a very important clue for the diagnosis of SSDH. It is generally agreed that prompt surgical evacuation should be performed before irreversible damage to the spinal cord occurs. However, conservative treatment still plays a role in the management of SSDH.

To describe the clinical presentation, characteristic MRI findings, and treatment of traumatic SSDH.

Magnetic resonance imaging findings of high signal intensity lesion in both T1 and T2 sequences suggest the possibility of subdural hematoma although it may be mistaken for tumorlike cystic lesion of the cord. Although there is a place for conservative treatment of subdural hematoma, we believe that rapid surgical drainage of the subdural hematoma will be associated with the best prognosis especially in the cervical, thoracic, and thoraco-lumbar junctions of the spinal cord.

Rapid surgical drainage of traumatic SSDH affecting the thoraco-lumbar junction of the cord will be associated in most of the cases with rapid neurologic recovery.
