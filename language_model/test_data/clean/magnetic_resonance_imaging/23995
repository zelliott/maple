A digital image analysis system was used in a retrospective analysis of MRI findings in 9 patients with acoustic neuroma. Maximum and minimum tumor diameters and surface area were measured and tumor volume was calculated. All studies included intravenous injection of gadolinium (Gd-DTPA or DOTA) and axial and coronal sections. Tumoral growth rate was analyzed using the increase in tumor size ( T) tumor area doubling time (ADT), and tumor volume doubling time (VDT). The purpose of this study was to document the growth rate of acoustic neuromas with periodic MRI. In an era in which preservation of hearing and the facial nerve is a goal of acoustic neuroma surgery, knowledge of tumor growth rate should improve patient care.
