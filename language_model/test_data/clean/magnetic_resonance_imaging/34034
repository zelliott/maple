Brain laterality in schizophrenia has been examined through the application of functional neuroimaging methods. These methods have included the 133Xenon technique for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF); positron emission tomography for assessing rates of glucose metabolism, CBF, and neuroreceptor functioning; single photon emission computerized tomography for studying CBF and neuroreceptors; and functional magnetic resonance imaging for measuring changes attributable to CBF. This article highlights the application of this technology in schizophrenia research, emphasizing more recent studies that have evaluated hemispheric differences. There is evidence for lateralized abnormalities in some studies that have examined this dimension. In general, the results implicate abnormalities in left hemispheric activity. Recent advances in basic and clinical neuroscience provide an opportunity for focused application of functional imaging in neurobiological studies of schizophrenia.
