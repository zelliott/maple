The aim of our prospective study was to assess the MR imaging characteristics of hepatic metastases of neuroendocrine tumors and to determine the optimal MR sequence for their detection.

Thirty-seven consecutive patients with liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors underwent 1.5-T MR imaging of the liver comprising T2-weighted fast spin-echo with respiratory monitoring, breath-hold T2-weighted single-shot fast spin-echo, and T1-weighted gradient-recalled echo sequences before and after the injection of gadoterate dimeglumine. Images were reviewed independently by three observers for the number, location, and pattern of signal and enhancement of metastases.

A total of 359 metastases were detected, 279 on T2-weighed fast spin-echo, 231 on T2-weighed single-shot fast spin-echo, 272 on unenhanced T1-weighted, 322 on hepatic arterial phase, and 228 on portal venous phase images. Hepatic arterial phase images revealed the greatest number of metastases in 70% of patients, including 35 metastases seen only on this sequence, and was significantly superior to the unenhanced T1-weighted and portal venous phase sequences (p < 0.01). The lesion-to-liver contrast was significantly greatest with T2-weighed fast spin-echo sequences. The enhancement patterns of metastases were predominantly hypervascular, hypovascular, peripheral with progressive fill-in, and delayed in, respectively, 27, four, four, and two patients. Most metastases with peripheral enhancement and progressive fill-in were heterogeneous on T2-weighted images and were without globular peripheral enhancement.

Hepatic metastases of neuroendocrine tumors had a typical hypervascular pattern in 73% of patients. Hepatic arterial phase and fast spin-echo T2-weighed sequences are the most sensitive.
