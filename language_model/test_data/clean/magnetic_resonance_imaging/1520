Twenty-five early-onset relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients (12 women and 13 men) with mild disability were compared with 25 matched controls in a dichotic listening (DL) test under nonforced and forced attentional-shift conditions. Patients showed left ear impairment and no left ear advantage in the forced-left condition. Four corpus callosum (CC) regions were measured in patients on a midsaggital magnetic resonance imaging scan. The right ear score was negatively correlated whereas the left ear score was positively correlated with CC regions (significant only for the nonforced condition). Moreover, in men, the correlations with DL scores were linked mainly to the splenium and posterior isthmus, and in women, they were stronger for anterior isthmus and posterior body. An inverse correlation between months of disease evolution and CC area was found only in women.
