The retroperitoneum is the compartmentalized space bounded anteriorly by the posterior parietal peritoneum and posteriorly by the transversalis fascia. It extends from the diaphragm superiorly to the pelvic brim inferiorly. This article discusses clinically relevant anatomy of the abdominal retroperitoneal spaces, their cross-sectional imaging evaluation with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and the imaging features of common retroperitoneal pathologic processes.
