Hyperpolarized gases belong to a new class of MR contrast agents that, when inhaled, provide high temporal and spatial resolution images of the lung airspaces. At this time, hyperpolarized gas MRI is only being performed at a limited number of institutions. However, the availability of hyperpolarized gas MRI could increase dramatically in coming years as regulatory hurdles within the U.S. are surmounted. The intent of this paper is to provide an introduction to hyperpolarized gas MRI for the thoracic radiologist. It includes a description of the basic principles of hyperpolarized gas MRI and a review of the results of preliminary clinical investigations with this method.
