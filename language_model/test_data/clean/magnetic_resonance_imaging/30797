The authors report the case of a 7-year-old child involved in a motor vehicle accident. She sustained an unusual flexion-distraction vertebral injury. This spinal injury was related to seatbelt use and was associated with intra-abdominal lesions. The spinal lesion consisted of a posterior ligamentous disruption with widening of the posterior intervertebral space at two adjacent lumbar levels. The purpose of this case report is to describe an atypical and perhaps often unrecognized spinal lesion and to explain our approach to diagnosis and treatment.
