The clinical value of sounds and vibrations produced by biological joints in motion has been studied extensively since 1902, aimed at developing a technology to aid the interpretation of recorded joint vibration signals. Such technology would have clear advantages to current medical imaging systems, e.g. MRI, in speed, cost, and non-invasiveness. However, it has yet to achieve routine clinical use. This review aims to provide a balanced analysis of past and present attempts to progress vibration arthrometry. The literature reveals significant barriers to successful implementation of vibration arthrometry. From a technical standpoint, accounting for the intense variability within recorded signals caused by shifting characteristics of contacting joint surfaces and forces during motion is the primary issue. Additionally, understandable scepticism in the clinical community as to the reliability of vibration arthrometry represents a significant barrier to adoption. In conclusion, until the variability issue is shown to be adequately dealt with, and clear transparent evidence of clinical usefulness to orthopedic medicine demonstrated, it will be difficult to move the field forward. Future work should lead toward proving value to clinicians, and be transparent about how the variability issue has been resolved.
