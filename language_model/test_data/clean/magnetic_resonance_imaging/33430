One characteristic feature of ependymomas of the fourth ventricle is a tendency to extend through the foramina, specifically the foramina of Luschka and Magendie, the foramen magnum and the aqueduct of Sylvius. The authors report a case of pilocytic astrocytoma of the cerebellum that mimicked such extension into the upper cervical canal. This finding was revealed by magnetic resonance imaging and confirmed at surgery.
