Large pelvic masses pose unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to varied aetiology, paucity of characteristic imaging features, lack of therapeutic algorithms and surgical difficulties in resection inside the narrow confines of the pelvis with close proximity of vital structures.

Records of 22 patients with large pelvic masses in the last six years were analysed. Their demographic and clinical features were noted, along with imaging features, preoperative biopsy, surgical procedure, intraoperative difficulties, complications, adjuvant therapy and outcome.

There were 14 men and 8 women with a median age of 45 years. Presenting symptoms were abdominal mass, pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, urinary retention and constipation. Imaging was mostly unable to determine the organ of origin of the tumour. Histopathology revealed pelvic fibromatosis (2), chondrosarcoma (1), liposarcoma (1), haemangioendothelioma (1), lymphangioma (2), fibroleiomyoma (1), leiomyosarcoma (3), schwannoma (4), malignant nerve sheath tumour (1), rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumour (1), retrovesical hydatid cysts (3), sacral chordoma (1) and Ewing's sarcoma (1). In 5 patients complete excision was not possible because of extension into vital structures. Fifteen patients were alive at 1-5 years of follow-up.

Urologists, being the 'gatekeepers of the pelvis', are usually involved in the management of large pelvic masses. Good outcome can be achieved with careful surgical planning.
