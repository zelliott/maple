Between 1995 and 2001 we treated 12 patients with benign symmetric lipomatosis in the head and neck. The group comprised 11 men and 1 woman aged 34-62 (M=47). The most frequent complaints were diminished range of motion of the head and obstruction when eating or speaking. Combined lipectomy and liposuction were performed in all patients, with liposuction being carried out in a second session.

The mean follow-up period was 3 years. The functional results were very satisfactory in all patients. Of the 12 patients, 9 were also satisfied with the aesthetic outcome.A recurrence occurred in three patients 1.5, 2, or 3 years after the operation. Severe complications were not observed.

According to our experience, combined lipectomy and liposuction represents a successful procedure in treating benign symmetric lipomatosis in the head and neck region.Nevertheless, advantages and drawbacks of the two techniques should be equally considered prior to surgery.
