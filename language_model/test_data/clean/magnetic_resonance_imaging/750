A patient presented at the age of 50 years with a right-sided, writing-specific dystonia which settled without treatment. Ten years later she developed focal seizures affecting the right leg and occasionally spreading to the right arm. A left parietal meningioma was removed and 2 years later she developed dystonic movements of her right hand. Gliotic changes were seen on magnetic resonance imaging in the superficial left parietal lobe. Mechanisms involved in the generation of dystonia associated with cortical injury are discussed.
