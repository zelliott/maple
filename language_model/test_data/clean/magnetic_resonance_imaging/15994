The clinical, radiological, neurophysiological and neuropsychological findings of three patients with giant subcortical heterotopia are reported. All patients experienced psychomotor and behaviour improvement after surgery. Two subjects are seizure-free after complete excision of the heterotopia; the third patient significantly improved following subtotal removal (Engel's class II). Patients affected by giant subcortical heterotopias can have a favourable prognosis after the surgical removal of the malformation, even following long-lasting epilepsy.
