We present three patients in whom the diagnosis of intranasal meningoencephalocele was made by magnetic resonance imaging. The initial clinical evaluation and computed tomographic examinations of these patients failed to distinguish between chronic inflammation and intranasal meningoencephalocele. Although both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are used to distinguish between normal, inflammatory, and neoplastic tissue in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, limitations do exist and these are the focus of our communication. A clear understanding of the efficacy of these radiographic modalities will enhance surgical planning and can preclude severe complications.
