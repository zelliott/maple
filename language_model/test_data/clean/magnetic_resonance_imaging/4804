Neurinomas or schwannomas of the jugular foramen are rare tumors whose differentiation from tumors of the jugular body may be difficult because they share common symptoms. Since schwannomas at this site are less aggressive than tumors of the jugular body and certain elements of their treatment differ, it is important to make a correct diagnosis promptly. A well-documented case of schwannoma of the jugular foramen is reported and its differential diagnosis is discussed in the light of the literature.
