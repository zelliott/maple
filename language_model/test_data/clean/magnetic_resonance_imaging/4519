A case of arthropathy and soft tissue masses due to amyloid deposition in a patient with myeloma is reported. The radiologic and magnetic resonance findings of musculoskeletal amyloidosis are described. The amyloid masses show heterogeneous signal intensity, with a signal lower than muscle and intermingled areas of marked hyperintensity on T2-weighted images.
