Although posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus has been observed in premature infants, few cases of its intrauterine occurrence in fetuses have been reported. We report a case of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in a fetus with severe tachycardia. This case indicates that its possible occurrence should be considered in a case of a preterm fetus with distress.
