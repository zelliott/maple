Neuronal migration anomalies are caused by insults occurring during the third to fifth gestational months when neuroblasts migrate from the germinal zone to the cortical plate. They lead to several cerebral malformations such as macrogyria, identified nowadays by MRI. We describe a case of bilateral parieto-rolandic macrogyria responsible for a bi-opercular syndrome resulting in a facio-linguo-masticatory diplegia associated with mental retardation and severe epilepsy.
