To determine whether corpus callosum atrophy predicts future clinical deterioration in multiple sclerosis.

In 39 multiple sclerosis patients the area of corpus callosum in the sagittal plane, T2 and T1 lesion volumes, brain parenchymal fraction and brain atrophy were determined at baseline and 1 year after treatment initiation. Non-parametric and multiple regression models were built to identify the most reliable predictors of disability and of its changes over 9 years.

Corpus callosum atrophy during the first year of treatment was the best predictor of disability (r = -0.56) and of its increase at 9 years (r = 0.65). Corpus callosum atrophy of at least 2% predicted increase in disability with 93% sensitivity and 73% specificity (odds ratio = 35).

Corpus callosum atrophy is a simple and accurate predictor of future disability accumulation and is feasible for routine clinical practice.
