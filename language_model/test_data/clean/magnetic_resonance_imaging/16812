To determine whether liver function correlating with indocyanine green (ICG) clearance could be estimated quantitatively from gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images.

This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Twenty-three consecutive patients who underwent an ICG clearance test and gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MR imaging with the same parameters as were used for a preoperative examination were chosen. The hepatocellular uptake index (HUI) from liver volume (V(L))and mean signal intensity of the liver on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat suppression (L(20)) and mean signal intensity of the spleen on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat suppression (S(20)) on 3D gradient-echo T1-weighted images with fat suppression obtained at 20 minutes after gadoxetate disodium (0.025 mmol per kilogram of body weight) administration was determined with the following equation: V(L)[(L(20)/S(20)) - 1]. The correlation of the plasma disappearance rate of ICG (ICG-PDR) and various factors derived from MR imaging, including HUI, iron and fat deposition in the liver and spleen, and spleen volume (V(S)), were evaluated with stepwise multiple regression analysis. The difference between the ratio of the remnant HUI to the HUI of the total liver (rHUI/HUI) and ratio of the liver remnant V(L) to the total V(L) (rV(L)/V(L)) was evaluated in four patients who had segmental heterogeneity of liver function.

HUI and V(S) were the factors significantly correlated with ICG-PDR (R = 0.87). The mean value and its 95% confidence interval were 0.18 and 0.01 to 0.34, respectively, for the following calculation: (rHUI/HUI) - (rV(L)/V(L)).

The liver function correlating with ICG-PDR can be estimated quantitatively from the signal intensities and the volumes of the liver and spleen on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MR images, which may improve the estimation of segmental liver function.
