Powerful new methods for imaging both brain anatomy and brain function are appearing at an increasing rate. The modern era of minimally invasive, highly informative, neurological diagnostic imaging methods began with the introduction of x-ray computed tomography in the 1970s. More recently, positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography have been used extensively in research on normal and pathological brain function, and they are finding specific medical applications. Nuclear magnetic resonance methods are in widespread use for neurological diagnosis only a decade after they became available. Rapid development of new techniques based on the same principles, and implementable on clinical instruments with relatively minor modifications, will expand the range of nuclear magnetic resonance measurement capabilities considerably in the near future. These technological innovations and others yet to come have major implications for the practice of neurology. The most important one is an increase in relative value among clinical diagnostic skills of history taking and mental status examination, which will remain largely beyond the reach of technology.
