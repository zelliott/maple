Neuroimages of tentorial hemorrhage associated with vacuum extraction have been rarely reported. The authors present the case of a 5-day-old newborn with this entity. CT showed retrocerebellar hemorrhage and MRI demonstrated tentorial hemorrhage extending inferiorly over the cerebellum and superiorly over the occipital regions. We believe that these imaging modalities are helpful in delineating the extent of the hemorrhage and assessing the prognosis.
