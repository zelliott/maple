A 62-year-old woman presented with shortness of breath and NYHA III. Severe heart failure was due to reduced systolic function. The woman reported of lung edema at two times. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed a congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CC-TGA). Echocardiographic findings revealed a high grade tricuspid regurgitation. For treatment of the tricuspid regurgitation, we used a percutaneous approach. The Evalve MitraClip(Â®) system has demonstrated feasibility and safety in the treatment of mitral regurgitation. Three months after successful tricuspid valve clipping, the patient is fine and NYHA score is reduced to grade I.
