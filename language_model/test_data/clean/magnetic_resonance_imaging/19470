Hypereosinophilic sclerosing cholangitis is a rare disease caused by eosinophilic infiltration of the gallbladder and biliary tract seen in the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. We report a 42-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of cholecystitis and obstructive cholangitis. Imaging with magnetic resonance cholangiography using a half-Fourier spinecho sequence, we were able to visualize rapidly and non-invasively a severely abnormal gallbladder, evidence of liver parenchymal inflammation, and biliary duct dilatation.
