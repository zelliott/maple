Glomus organs are arteriovenous anastomoses which control the thermoregulation of the extremities. Benign tumors of these glomus organs, termed "glomangiomas", are therefore most frequently located in the fingers and toes. Case reports of primary glomangiomas in the respiratory- and gastrointestinal tracts as well as in the genital organs have been published. On the other hand, glomus tumors of the liver have not yet been described. We report the case of a 61-year-old patient with a smooth subcapsular lesion within the liver detected by a routine ultrasound scan. Further diagnostic imaging did not match with one of the common liver tumors. The diagnosis of a glomangioma was finally made by liver biopsy and subsequent histology. A review of the literature revealed a potential transformation of glomangiomas. Since the patient reported on inappetence weight loss and the tumor showed growth tendency, the indication for surgical excision was made. Final histologic investigation revealed no signs of malignancy. The primary glomangioma of the liver is a new differential diagnosis of benign liver tumors. As there is a possibility of malignant degeneration, we propose the decision for surgical removal once there are clinical symptoms and a growth tendency of the lesion.
