We present surface anatomy scanning (SAS) image by weighted-summation technique using MRI images in herpes simplex encephalitis. Recently, SAS has been developed as a technique that visualizes brain surface structures. This patient was a 64-year-old male who suffered from aphasia and memory disturbance after herpes simplex encephalitis. He was transferred to our hospital for rehabilitation. Neuropsychological tests showed Wernicke's aphasia and memory impairment. SAS was performed for the purpose of analyzing these neuropsychological deficits, especially the Wernicke's aphasia. In SAS image, sulci were enhanced and gyri were easy to identify clearly. The affected structures disclosed low intensity areas in the entire left temporal lobe, including the superior temporal gyrus. It was clarified that the damage to the left superior temporal gyrus resulted in his Wernicke's aphasia. We think that SAS is very useful for cortical lesion analysis, not only in encephalitis but also in other disorders presenting higher brain dysfunctions.
