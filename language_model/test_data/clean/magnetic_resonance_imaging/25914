Postmortem MR images of two cases of posterior column degeneration were correlated with histopathological findings. The abnormal MR findings were volume loss and high signal intensity of the posterior columns associated with mild deformity of the dorsal surface of the spinal cord, corresponding to tract degeneration on histopathological examination. These results strongly suggest that further development of MR technique will permit in vivo detection of posterior column degeneration.
