Recent developments in imaging technologies offer great potential for the assessment of retinal ganglion cell disorders, with particular relevance to glaucoma. In particular, advances in this field have allowed unprecedented in vivo access to the retinal layers, using many different properties of light to differentiate cellular structures. This article is a summary of currently available and investigational advanced, high-resolution imaging technologies and their potential applications to glaucoma. It represents the topics of discussion at the annual Optic Nerve Rescue and Restoration Think Tank, sponsored by The Glaucoma Foundation, entitled "High Resolution Imaging of the Eye: Advanced Optics, Microtechnology and Nanotechnology" and held in New York, New York, September 28-29, 2007.
