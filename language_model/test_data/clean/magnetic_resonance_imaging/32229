Calcified amorphous tumor of the heart (cardiac CAT) is an unusual non-neoplastic cardiac mass that can mimic a more malignant lesion. We describe a case of cardiac CAT in a 60-year-old female who presented with syncope. Workup revealed a 2.1-cm mass in the right ventricular wall involving the chordae tendineae of the tricuspid valve, impacting right ventricular function. Magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, angiography, and histologic descriptions of the lesion are described.
