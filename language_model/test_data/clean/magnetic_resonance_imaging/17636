The paper describes a case of prenatally diagnosed congenital brain tumor of an extremely rare histological type--oligodendrocytoma. The intrauterine ultrasound scans were interpreted as intracranial hemorrhage. The initial physical examination of the newborn revealed symptoms of mild increase of intracranial pressure. The diagnosis of brain tumor was based on computed tomography of the head performed on the 4th day of life. The tumor was totally (as histological and radiological test indicated) removed on the 9th day of life. At the age of 2 months, relapse of tumor was diagnosed. Reoperation and subsequent chemiotheraphy were introduced. At present, the child is 9 months old and no neurological impairment is visible. The discussion presents data on congenital brain tumor epidemiology and differences in location, histology and outcome between neonates and older children. Moreover, recent surgical and medical management is described.
