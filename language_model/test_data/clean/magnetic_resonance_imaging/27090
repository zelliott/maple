Primary brain tumors (PBT), in particular gliomas, are among the most difficult neoplasms to treat, necessitating good quality imaging to guide clinicians at many junctures. Current imaging modalities, including [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT, MRI and MR spectroscopy (MRS), have various limitations, particularly with regard to differentiating tumor from radiation induced necrosis (RIN) and from normal cerebral metabolic uptake. [18F] fluorocholine (FCH) is an analog of choline with potentially optimal imaging characteristics, as pharmacokinetic studies with FCH conducted in patients showed minimal FCH uptake by normal brain parenchyma, whereas high-grade tumors are known to have increased choline uptake. We present two cases of our early experience with FCH PET/CT for patients with PBT and discuss the potential use and comparative limitations of this imaging modality.
