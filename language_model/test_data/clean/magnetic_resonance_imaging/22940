We are reporting a case of neurobrucellosis that was clinically and radiologically indistinguishable from a cerebral tumor. The histological diagnosis was granulomatous encephalitis. The diagnosis was established by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), detecting high levels of Ig G and Ig M Brucella antibodies in the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid. We suggest that patients with granulomatous encephalitis, without a clear etiological agent, should be studied for Brucella.
