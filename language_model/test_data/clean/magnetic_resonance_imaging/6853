We report a case of asymptomatic adrenal hematoma that enlarged during a 3-year follow-up. A 66-year-old woman exhibited a 4 cm right adrenal mass, incidentally discovered by computed tomography of abdomen, which progressively enlarged to 6 cm in diameter during the 3 years. The patient underwent right adrenalectomy with a diagnosis of a suspected non-functional adrenal tumor. Histopathological examination indicated adrenal hematoma without tumor cells. The patient had received aspirin medication for 4 years, and it is possible that the enlargement of the mass might have been due to aspirin medication.
