We report the case of Conn's adenoma in a 36-year-old woman, revealed by low extremities weakness. The patient had hypertension at 170/90 mmHg. Her initial potassium level was low i.e., 1.5 mmol/L. The diagnosis, confirmed by hormonal investigation, showed an elevation of plasma aldosterone and lower plasma renin activity. Abdominal MRI revealed a lesion in left adrenal gland, measuring 1.8 cm in diameter and taking contrast in periphery, compatible with an adrenal adenoma. The patient underwent a left laparoscopic adrenalectomy and microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis. The postoperative course was uneventful with normalization of serum potassium level and blood pressure.
