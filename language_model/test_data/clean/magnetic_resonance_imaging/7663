We propose a simple scheme of 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) with low-refocusing flip angles (RFAs) for obtaining sufficient T1-weighted contrast. The low RFA can easily lead spins into a pseudo-steady-state (PSS) condition, but a preparation scheme is required for smooth transition into static PSS. For obtaining T1 contrast, PSS preparation is the most important factor, and therefore we focused on the PSS preparation. To optimize the T1 contrast in the proposed sequence, we compared the following parameters: RFAs of 90° and 30°, and a PSS preparation scheme of "90° + α/2" and asymptotic preparation. Subsequently, to demonstrate the quality of the proposed sequence, we compared the image quality regarding conventional 3D TSE and 2D spin echo (SE). A combination of an RFA of 30° and the "90° + α/2" preparation scheme showed the highest T1 contrast. The optimized sequence provided higher contrast and sharper images compared to 3D TSE, and it showed contrast and a signal-to-noise ratio similar to those of 2D SE.
