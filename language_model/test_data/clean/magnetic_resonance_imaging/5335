To evaluate the efficacy of MR enterography (MRE) in patients with known or suspected Crohn's disease without the use of anti-peristaltic pharmacologic agents compared to colonoscopy and histology.

A retrospective review of 850 consecutive patients who underwent routine MRE to evaluate known or suspected Crohn's disease was performed. Of these, 310 patients also underwent colonoscopy with biopsy(s) within 90 days. The results of the MRE were compared to the colonoscopy and pathology reports to determine the presence or absence of disease in evaluable bowel segments. Individual imaging parameters (including wall thickening, enhancement, T2 signal, mesenteric vascular prominence and adenopathy) were also separately analyzed to determine their independent predictive value.

In 310 patients, the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRE (using endoscopy as a gold standard) were 85% and 80% respectively (kappa=0.65). The sensitivity of MRE for detection of pathologically severe disease was 87% in the terminal ileum (TI) and 88% in the colon. In the subset of 162 patients who underwent colonoscopy within 30 days of MRE, the overall sensitivity remained 85% but the specificity increased to 85% (kappa=0.69). Wall thickening and abnormal enhancement were sensitive indicators of Crohn's disease (75% and 78%), while abnormal T2 signal, mesenteric vascular prominence and adenopathy were specific (86%, 91% and 93%).

MRE compares favorably to colonoscopy for evaluation of known or suspected Crohn's disease noninvasively and without the exposure to ionizing radiation associated with CT enterography (CTE).
