To present an alternative endovascular therapy for a Type 4 sagittal sinus dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF).

A 74-year-old man presented with right facial paresthesias. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enlarged left parasagittal cortical vein adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus. Angiography demonstrated a Type 4 sagittal sinus DAVF.

The DAVF was cured using percutaneous transvenous coil embolization.

This case represents the first report in which a sagittal sinus DAVF was cured using a percutaneous transvenous endovascular approach.
