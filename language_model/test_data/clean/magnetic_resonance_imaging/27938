The first clinically diagnosed and successfully operated case of a symptomatic lipoma involving the cerebral cortex is reported. The patient presented with severe headaches and recurring focal seizures with secondary generalization. Computer tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging suggested a left frontoparietal lipoma. After undergoing a craniotomy and tumor excision, the patient has shown resolution of headaches and seizures at 1-year follow-up. Lipomas of the cerebral cortex should be excised if symptomatic and accessible.
