Preoperative planning in skull base surgery is usually based on numbers of different radiological data. To use this complex data digital post-processing is necessary. There is a significant difference between radiological and surgical post-processing. Planning the approach, resection of the tumour and reconstruction of the defect are supported by the software demonstrated in this study. Integration of the results in a closed workflow of Information-Guided Therapy will increase the potentials of surgical post-processing in the future (i. e. intraoperative navigation and visualization). Evidence based medicine will use digital data of surgical planning.
