A 12-year-old, neutered female, Siberian Husky dog presented with a hind limb weakness of one month duration. To facilitate making a diagnosis multiple imaging modalities were performed. These modalities included radiography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and selective angiography of the abdominal aorta. In this dog, the MRI/MRA studies provided the first documentation of the external iliac thrombi and the collateral circulation via the lumbar arteries. At necropsy, an aortoiliac thrombus caused by a mineralized arteriosclerotic plaque was noted.
