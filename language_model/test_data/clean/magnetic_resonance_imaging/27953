A malignant tumour was implanted in the livers of 205 rats in the context of an experimental MRT project. The implantation technique of the Novikoff hepatoma is described. Within 10 days of implantation a solitary one-centimetre intrahepatic tumour develops; it is a hypovascular tumour with an invasive periphery and central tumour necrosis. The tumour model is distinguished by a high success rate of 91.1% and is suitable for experimental MRT studies of liver tumours.
