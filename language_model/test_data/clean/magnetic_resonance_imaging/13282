Elastofibroma is a rare benign soft tissue lesion, typically located deep under the lower pole of the scapula. It is characterized by a fibrous and adipose tissue proliferation and most frequently affects older females. Its characteristic location and its specific aspect in imaging studies most often provides the diagnosis following an incidental discovery. Nevertheless, anatomic and pathologic confirmation is necessary to formally rule out a malignant tumor diagnosis. We report a 66-year-old woman original observation; this lady's occupation involved a number of strenuous manual activities; she consulted for chronic pain related to a left subscapular mass. MRI demonstrated, in fact, two symmetrical tumor masses under each scapula. The only symptomatic lesion was surgically excised.
