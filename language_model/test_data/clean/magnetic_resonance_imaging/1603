One hundred consecutive patients referred to an orthopaedic oncology practice for evaluation of suspected bone or soft tissue tumors were studied prospectively. There were 76 patients with bone lesions and 24 patients with soft tissue lesions. At the time of initial consultation, information regarding the referring diagnosis, number of prior physician office visits, and prereferral imaging studies obtained was collected. There were 50 patients with benign tumors, 17 patients with primary malignant tumors, 11 patients with metastatic tumors, and 22 patients with nonneoplastic conditions. The average number of physician visits before referral for the entire group was 4.8 visits and was highest for patients with malignant bone tumors (6.2 visits). Imaging studies obtained before referral included plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, bone scans, computed tomography scans, and ultrasound. None of the plain radiographs were thought to be unnecessary; however, 26 of 76 (34.2%) magnetic resonance imaging scans, 17 of 40 (42.5%) bone scans, and 13 of 36 (36.1%) computed tomography scans were excessive and did not contribute to the evaluation of the lesion. Although only 58% of the study group included patients with benign bone tumors and nonneoplastic bone lesions, they accounted for the majority (79%) of unnecessary imaging studies. Primary care physicians and general orthopaedic physicians were equally likely to order unnecessary imaging studies (48% and 52%, respectively).
