To evaluate efficacy and safety of a superparamagnetic iron oxide contrast agent (ferristene) as an endoluminal contrast medium for magnetic resonance (MR) enteroclysis in a phase III trial. Twenty-three patients with history of known or suspected small bowel Crohn's disease underwent MR imaging of the abdomen at 0.5 T unit. The imaging protocol included two phases: the first one without administration of any contrast agent and the second one, where the small bowel was filled by enteroclysis with 800 ml of the luminal iron oxide contrast medium and Gd-DTPA (0.1 mmol/Kg) was administered intravenously. Axial Spin-Echo (SE) T1-weighted (T1w), proton-density and T2w images, sagittal and coronal SE T1w and Short TI Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequences were subsequently obtained. Three investigators blindly evaluated images to determine small bowel distribution of ferristene, presence of artifacts, delineation of bowel lesion/wall and the diagnostic value of ferristene combined with gadolinium. Pre- and postcontrast signal intensity measurements of bowel lesion/wall, bowel lumen and background noise were also calculated. Three patients withdrew before the procedure, therefore 20 patients were effectively included in the study. No significant difference between the three investigators' evaluations of the improvement of the diagnostic information was found (percentage of improvement of 90% with 95% confidence limits of 68% and 99%). A statistically significant difference between the first and third investigators was found for grading of quality of delineation of bowel lesion/wall. Signal intensity measures showed a significant increase of the bowel lesion/wall and background noise/lesion for the SE T1w images. No serious adverse event was reported in our series. MR enteroclysis using ferristene as an endoluminal contrast agent appears to be a safe and efficient procedure for the study of the small bowel.
