Monitoring the sodium concentration in vivo using 23Na MRI can be an important tool for assessing the onset of tissue disorders. Practical clinical 23Na MRI methods furthermore often do not allow one to use sufficiently small voxel sizes such that only the tissue of interest is seen, but a large signal contamination can arise from sodium in synovial fluid. Here we demonstrate that applying an inversion recovery (IR) technique allows one to distinctly select either the cartilage-bound or the free sodium for visualization in an image. The results are validated both ex vivo and in vivo.
