Coelomic cysts are rare cysts of mesothelial origin. They are generally unilocular and can develop in various sites. We describe a case of a multicystic lesion discovered incidentally in the anterior mediastinum of a 41-year-old man. Immunohistochemistry confirmed multiple coelomic cysts of the mediastinum.
