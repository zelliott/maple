Cerebellar liponeurocytoma is a newly recognized, rare clinicopathological entity. It manifests with posterior fossa symptoms in adults and is characterized histopathologically by advanced neuronal and focal lipomatous differentiation with a low level of mitotic activity. The authors analyzed the computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in two patients with histopathologically proven cerebellar liponeurocytomas and review the literature. Cerebellar liponeurocytoma may be suspected on the basis of neuroimaging findings that demonstrate an intraaxial neoplasm with the propensity for exophytic growth into the adjacent subarachnoid spaces. On CT scans, the tumor commonly presents as a hypointense mass with intermingled areas exhibiting the attenuation values of fatty tissue. On T1-weighted MR images, the tumor is hypointense with scattered foci of hyperintense signal and displays moderate contrast enhancement. On T1-weighted MR images, the tumor is slightly hyperintense to cortex, and edema is usually absent. Areas of fat density as assessed on CT scans and of T1 hyperintensity seen on MR images help to distinguish this rare neoplasm from the more common adult medulloblastomas or ependymomas. The available follow-up data indicate a favorable clinical prognosis; therefore, knowledge and precise characterization of this tumor is important to avoid unnecessary adjuvant radio- or chemotherapy.
