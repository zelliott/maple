Applications of NMR imaging to examine the fluid distribution of steam foam flooding as a function of concentration and volume of surfactant solution, and residual oil saturation are described. The features examined include sweep efficiency, oil recovery, resistance factor, apparent viscosity, steam quality, and foam stability. The results illustrate that the injection procedure and residual oil saturation have a significant influence on steam foam flooding.
