We studied three patients with dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). Major symptoms were progressive dementia and parkinsonism, both of which progressed in step-wise fashion. Two of the three patients showed diffuse cerebral white matter lesions on brain CT and MRI. Progressive dementia and parkinsonism in our patients could be caused by diffuse cerebral parenchymal disturbance: impaired cerebral circulation due to severe venous hypertension. DAVF is important for the differential diagnosis in patients with progressive dementia and parkinsonism.
