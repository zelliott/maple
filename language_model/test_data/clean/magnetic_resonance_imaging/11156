Intracranial EEG in a 33-year-old man with epilepsy with a history of falls and injuries showed seizure onset in the right posterior parietal region. Electrical stimulation of the region reproduced sudden estrangement of the left lower extremity. EMG and video recordings showed no alteration of extremity tone during the seizure, but his gait halted before he fell. Ictal asomatognosia may be a cause of falls in patients with epilepsy.
