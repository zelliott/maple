Advances in cerebral vascular imaging suggest that patients with critical levels of carotid artery stenosis (> 70%) who have symptoms can be identified accurately and necessary information about the intracranial and extracranial circulation obtained before surgery without conventional angiography. We have used carotid duplex imaging in combination with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to evaluate 20 patients with symptomatic ipsilateral high-grade carotid stenosis.

All patients underwent CT and magnetic resonance imaging brain scans, as well as MRA and conventional arteriography of the cerebral circulation. Magnetic resonance angiograms were obtained with two-dimensional phase contrast and time-of-flight techniques. Phase contrast was used for intracranial vascular imaging and for determining qualitative flow velocities and the direction of blood flow in the circle of Willis. Two-dimensional time of flight was used to assess the carotid bifurcations.

Twenty patients with symptoms (six with strokes, 11 with transient ischemic attacks, and three with amaurosis fugax) had duplex evidence of high-grade carotid stenoses. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance brain scans were positive for cerebral infarction in six patients with clinical strokes. Comparison of MRA with conventional angiography was 91% accurate for high-grade stenoses and occlusions (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90% for stenosis; sensitivity/specificity was 100% for complete occlusion). Comparison of duplex imaging with conventional angiography demonstrated 86% accuracy for detection of severe stenosis or occlusion (sensitivity 94% and specificity 89% for stenosis; sensitivity and specificity were 100% for complete occlusion).

This study suggests that combined use of MRA and duplex imaging is accurate for detection and evaluation of high-grade carotid stenoses in patients with symptoms.
