The development of miniaturized imaging equipment and reporter probes has improved our ability to study animal models of disease, such as transgenic and knockout mice. These technologies can now be used to continuously monitor in vivo tumour development, the effects of therapeutics on individual populations of cells, or even specific molecules. If these techniques prove effective in mice, they might be translated into the clinic in the future, where they could be used to non-invasively detect and monitor treatment of human cancers.
