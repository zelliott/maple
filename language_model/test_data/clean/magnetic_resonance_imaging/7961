Imaging is a highly attractive option for improved risk stratification, as it allows direct detection and quantification of subclinical and clinical disease burden. Among available imaging techniques, MRI may be particularly suited for comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment given its non-ionizing nature and high soft-tissue contrast. In this editorial, the authors review the emerging evidence in different clinical scenarios, indicating the incremental role of MRI for determining risk for future cardiovascular events.
