Congenital pelvic arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is rare especially in males. We present a case of pelvic AVM in a 38-year-old male. He was admitted to our hospital with left flank abdominal pain and painless gross hematuria.

Pelvic computed tomography demonstrated a homogeneous contrast-enhanced mass, 6 cm in diameter. For diagnosis, non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and color Doppler ultrasonography were very useful in our case. Though the treatment is controversial, we decided to monitor his clinical course.
