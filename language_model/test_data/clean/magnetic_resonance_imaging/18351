Since primary malignant pericardial tumors are seldomly found in children, we reported a case with massive pericardial effusion. Pericardial tumor was diagnosed by cross-sectional echocardiogram. The extent of the tumor was well demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. The tumor was removed successfully and proved to be low grade fibrosarcoma. Modern technics can be very helpful in the diagnosis of pericardial tumor.
