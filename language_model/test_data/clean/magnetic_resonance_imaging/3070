To report the findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in two cases of apophyseal irregularity of the ischial tuberosity.

The authors describe the MRI findings for two males who presented with pain of sudden onset in the buttock. Both patients were examined by radiography, MRI and computed tomography, and one underwent bone scanning.

On T1-weighted images, signal intensity was decreased in both the apophysis and the body adjacent to it; however, the signal intensity on T2-weighted images was increased. These findings are consistent with avulsion fracture of the apophysis.

The MRI findings in these cases may support the previously suggested hypothesis that apophyseal irregularity with characteristic radiographic changes over time is caused by avulsion fracture of the apophyseal line. The relation between the characteristic radiographic features and the structural changes associated with fracture in this condition is discussed.
