It has been demonstrated that sagopilone (ZK-EPO) has antitumor activity in human orthotopic glioma models in vitro and in vivo. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ZK-EPO in patients with pretreated, recurrent malignant gliomas. Fifteen patients with recurrent malignant gliomas who had received prior surgery, radiotherapy, and >or=2 lines of alkylating chemotherapy were recruited. ZK-EPO (16 mg/m(2)) was administered iv for 3 h every 21 days. The primary end point was six months progression-free survival (PFS-6); secondary end points were safety, toxicity, response rate, and median time to progression (TTP). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations were performed every two cycles and toxicity was evaluated at each cycle using common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE 3.0). A median of four cycles was administered. The median TTP was 13 weeks. PFS-6 was achieved in five patients (33%), three with glioblastoma multiforme and two with anaplastic astrocytoma. The most common treatment-related adverse event was neuropathy, which occurred in 6/15 patients. ZK-EPO had an acceptable safety profile and clinically relevant activity in patients with pretreated, recurrent malignant gliomas.
