We present a case report of a 17-year-old young man who developed fatal dissection of the middle cerebral artery after what appeared to be trivial trauma. The dissection was not evident on cerebral arteriogram but was identified at autopsy. Arterial dissection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of supraclinoid occlusion of the internal carotid artery seen by cerebral angiography.
