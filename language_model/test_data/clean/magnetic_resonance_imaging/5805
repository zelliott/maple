The histological features and image findings on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for ovarian cystadenofibroma mimicking malignant ovarian tumor are reported.

A 62-year-old woman was diagnosed as an ovarian cancer on abdominal CT. However, it was diagnosed as a cystadenofibroma on magnetic resonance T2-weighted images that showed the solid components of the tumor with very low intensity. Although ovarian cystadenofibroma is a relatively rare benign tumor, its ultrasonographic feature of cystic lesions with solid components resembles that of malignant ovarian tumor.

MRI was considered to be useful modality for ovarian cystadenofibroma to be effectively diagnosed preoperatively.
