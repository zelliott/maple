The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) on corpus callosum (CC) morphometry in large and pathologically proven MTLE-HS patients.

We measured certain CC dimensions in 103 patients and 33 healthy controls using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. In particular, we compared the two groups in relation to the clinical (localization of the HS, duration of epilepsy, frequency of seizures and length of seizures) and demographical (age, gender, handedness) features. Students' t test, two-way ANOVA and Spearman test were used for statistical analysis.

There was no significant difference between CC morphometry with respect to age and handedness among patients. The differences between the genders, however, were significant favouring longer diameters in males. We found significant decrease in the dimensions of the genu, body, isthmus and splenium of the CC in the MTLE-HS group, but there was no reduction in the size of the rostrum.

This general reduction in the size of the CC except for the rostrum was thought to be the result of cortical atrophy secondary to the disease. Concerning the preserved rostral part of the CC, it was thought that the fibers of the frontal lobe pass through different pathways than the tracts in the rostrum.
