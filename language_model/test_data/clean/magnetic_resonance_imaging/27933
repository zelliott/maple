A new method for measurement of water self-diffusion compensating for zeroth and first order movements was used to study the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in 15 patients with chronic multiple sclerosis (MS) and in two patients with acute MS. Ten healthy volunteers served as controls. A significantly higher ADC was found within chronic plaques compared to the apparently normal white matter of the chronic patients. The ADC was higher in the acute plaques compared to the chronic plaques. The ADC in apparently normal white matter of the chronic patients were significantly higher than in white matter of healthy volunteers. We hypothesize that an increase of the ADC in plaques may be related to an increase in the extracellular space due to oedema and demyelination. The increased ADC in apparently normal white matter suggests that there may be a change in the composition of the white matter of chronic MS patients, perhaps related to oedema and expanded extracellular space.
