We evaluated upper limb function in multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects (11 clinically definite MS patients and seven clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) subjects), with a normal upper limb standard neurological examination. Subjects performed center-out reaching movements under visual control, with and without vision of the hand. Their movements were recorded through a digitizing tablet. Motor performance was also related to lesion load, estimated from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We found that in MS and CIS subjects, under the hand vision condition, movements were significantly less smooth, and had a less symmetric speed profile. However, the observed impairment did not correlate with MRI findings. This result may be interpreted as evidence of a compensatory strategy, elicited by subtle alterations in sensorimotor control.
