Sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation (SANT) is a benign lesion of the spleen which can be cured by splenectomy. In the literature about 45 cases have been reviewed. Although it is defined by the morphological details, data regarding surgical therapy are scarce. To the best of our knowledge, a laparoscopic approach has not been published before. We investigated in one case of SANT the feasibility of a laparoscopic approach. Histological investigations confirmed the diagnosis of a SANT which was resected in toto. This report shows that the laparoscopic splenectomy is a feasible, safe and effective method for treatment of SANT.
