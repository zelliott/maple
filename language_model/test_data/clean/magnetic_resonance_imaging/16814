To determine if complicated plaque can be found by using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-depicted intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), even among symptomatic patients with low-grade (≤50%) carotid stenosis.

The institutional ethics review board approved this retrospective study and waived requirements for written informed consent. Symptomatic patients with bilateral 0%-50% carotid stenosis referred for carotid MR imaging were considered. Risk factors (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, smoking, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease), medications (antihypertensive drugs, diabetes drugs, statins, and aspirin), and the brain side causing symptoms were recorded. MR-depicted IPH prevalence in the carotid arteries ipsilateral and contralateral to the symptomatic side was compared by using the Fisher exact test. Multivariable regression was used to compare the MR-depicted IPH prevalence, while adjusting for risk factors and medications.

A total of 217 patients (434 carotid arteries) were included. MR-depicted IPH was found in 13% (31 of 233) of carotid arteries ipsilateral and 7% (14 of 201) of arteries contralateral to symptoms (P < .05). Male sex (P < .05) and increasing age (P < .05) were associated with MR-depicted IPH after controlling for risk factors and medications.

Complicated carotid atheroma can be found among symptomatic patients with low-grade (≤50%) stenosis, and this is associated with male sex and increasing age. MR-depicted IPH may be useful to stratify risk for patients with low-grade carotid stenosis.
