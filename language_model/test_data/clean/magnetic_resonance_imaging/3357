Laparascopic mesh repair is a safe and effective method of surgically treating incisional hernia. However, such an approach may lead to specific complications of both laparoscopy and mesh placement. The mesh may migrate, become infected or erode into adjacent structures. We describe the case of a woman who underwent laparoscopic incisional hernia repair with subsequent erosion of the mesh into the bladder.
