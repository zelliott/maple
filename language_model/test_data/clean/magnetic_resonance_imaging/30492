Brucellosis is uncommon in humans and only rarely manifests as osteomyelitis. We report the case of a 57-year-old patient with chronic Brucella osteomyelitis of both humeri. The diagnosis was established upon evaluation of a spontaneous fracture of the right humerus. The organism was recovered in fluid draining to the skin from an abscess located in the bone and soft tissues.
