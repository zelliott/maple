Colloid cysts are uncommon in children. They occur more frequently in young adults.

This is a retrospective study on all pediatric patients (<or=18 years) with colloid cysts treated surgically in our institute between 1977 and 2005.

A total of 43 patients with colloid cyst were treated surgically. Seven pediatric patients (16% of the total number of patients) were identified. Patients' ages ranged from 6 to 18 years (mean of 14.1+/-4.67). They all presented clinically with symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Radiologically, the cyst size ranged from 10 to 25 mm (mean of 16.1+/-5.2). All patients had either diagnostic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or both. The colloid cysts appeared hyperdense on CT in five patients (83%) and isodense in one (six available studies). On MRI, all (five available studies) lesions were hyperintense on T2-weighted images. All seven patients had complete cyst resection. Either transcortical (five patients) or transcallosal approaches (two patients) was used in the surgical resection. There was no mortality. One patient developed a delayed cerebrospinal fluid leak related to hydrocephalus, and another patient developed a delayed postoperative seizure. The radiological findings supported the aggressive clinical scenario of these lesions in the pediatric group of patients.

In conclusion, colloid cysts can occur in children. They are associated with more aggressive clinical and radiological patterns. Early surgical intervention is highly recommended.
