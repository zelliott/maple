Flow has been assessed in the gastric antrum using a velocity-sensitive version of the high-speed magnetic resonance imaging technique, echo planar imaging (EPI). Eight healthy volunteers attended fasted on three separate days and consumed 800 mL of either a 5% glucose (0.2 kcal mL-1), 10% glucose (0.4 kcal mL-1) or an isotonic mixed nutrient meal, Fresubin (1 kcal mL-1, 27.2 g fat). Gastric volumes were obtained at 10-min intervals for 1 h. Flow measurements were performed on a single slice through the antropyloric region 5 and 35 min after meal ingestion. Gastric volumes at 45 min were inversely proportional to the calorie density of the meal with (mean +/- SEM) 89 +/- 10%* of the Fresubin, 64 +/- 5%* of the 10% glucose and 41 +/- 5% of the 5% glucose remaining (*P < 0.005 vs 5% glucose). Substantial forward and backward antral flow was observed after all three meals in the initial 5-min imaging period. AT 35 min flow activity was significantly greater after both the high-calorie meals relative to the 5% meal (total number of flow events: Fresubin = 6.6 +/- 1.7,[symbol: see text] 10% glucose = 9.9 +/- 2.2, [symbol: see text] 5% glucose = 2.5 +/- 0.9,[symbol: see text] P < 0.03,[symbol: see text] P < 0.007 vs 5% glucose, n = 8). Peak forward velocities for the initial phase of emptying tended to be greater for the rapidly emptying 5% meal (5.9 +/- 0.8 cm-1) compared with the Fresubin (3.3 +/- 0.6 cm-1, P < 0.069, n = 8) and the 10% glucose (2.9 +/- 1.0 cm-1, P < 0.068, n = 8) meals. In spite of delayed gastric emptying, high-calorie meals were associated with substantial to and fro movements which may be important for meal tritruration and fat emulsification.
