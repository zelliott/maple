A prospective study was undertaken to assess the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to stage cervical carcinoma. Compared to computed tomography (CT), MRI showed a high degree of accuracy in correctly demonstrating involvement of the vagina, parametria and sidewalls, bladder, and lymph nodes but tended to overestimate disease in all of the categories studied. Large-scale studies comparing the two modalities are necessary because the most accurate staging of cervical carcinoma is crucial for selecting the best treatment protocols.
