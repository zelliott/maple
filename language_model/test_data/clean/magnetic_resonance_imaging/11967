A new pulse sequence designed for magnetic resonance imaging of the entire thoracic cavity is described. This sequence, called 3DPAUSE, is a rapid three-dimensional Fourier transform (3DFT) sequences with periodic pauses for breathing and additional rf pulses after each pause to restore the magnetization to steady-state before data acquisition resumes. Cardiac motion artifacts are effectively removed by signal averaging. Respiratory motion artifacts are removed by breath hold. Image artifacts caused by an inadequate number of pauses or by inappropriate placement of the pauses within a scan are shown, and ways to avoid these artifacts are discussed. 3DPAUSE provides the ability to acquire three-dimensional arrays in the thoracic cavity with minimal artifacts from respiratory and cardiac motions in a clinically reasonable time.
