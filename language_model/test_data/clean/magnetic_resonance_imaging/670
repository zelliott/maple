Lateralization of scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional MRI (fMRI) activation was investigated using a verb generation task in 10 healthy right-handed adults. ERPs showed an early transient positivity in the left inferior temporal region (500-1250 ms) following auditory presentation of the stimulus noun. A sustained slow cortical negativity of later onset (1250-3000 ms) was then recorded, most pronounced over left inferior frontal regions. fMRI data were in agreement with both ERP effects, showing left lateralized activation in inferior and superior temporal as well as inferior frontal cortices. Lateralized ERP effects occurred during the verb generation task but not during passive word listening or during word- and nonword repetition. Thus, ERPs and fMRI provided convergent evidence regarding language lateralization, with ERPs revealing the temporal sequence of posterior to anterior cortical activation during semantic retrieval.
