The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical value of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

In a recent 3 years seven RCCs in six patients were treated by percutaneous RFA. RCC had been diagnosed based on the typical findings by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. A cool-tip RF system (Vallylab) was mainly used with a RF2000 generator. The maximum tumor size ranged from 8 to 40 mm in diameter. The follow-up period was 14-36 months after initial RFA treatment.

Complete disappearance of contrast enhancement during the early arterial phase was noted immediately after each session of percutaneous RFA. Two RCCs > or = 3 cm in diameter showed tumor recurrence and required re-RFA during the follow-up period. In one patient, retroperitoneal hematoma was observed as a noteworthy complication.

Despite our limited number of patients, we believe that percutaneous RFA is clinically feasible and can be an alternative treatment of choice for RCC.
