Cervical teratomas represent approximately 3% of all congenital teratomas, which occur in approximately 1 in 20,000-40,000 live births. In this report, we present a case of congenital posterior cervical teratoma diagnosed by a two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound in the early second trimester.

A 28-year-old woman, gravid 1, para 0, came to our prenatal clinic at 20 weeks of gestation for her first prenatal visit. Results of an ultrasound revealed a fetus with multiple cystic septal mass with internally calcified spots measuring approximately 3 cm over the left fetal neck. Because no other abnormality was noted at that time, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amniocentesis were scheduled on the following day. At the same time, results of a 4D ultrasound revealed the mass size to be same as that measured by the 2D ultrasound; however, the location was defined on the left posterior neck and MRI showed there was no invasion to the intracranial area. The parents opted to continue the pregnancy. In the following prenatal cares, no polyhydramnios was found and the fetal body weight was within the normal growth curve. The baby was delivered by cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation with Apgar scores of 8 (at 1 minute) and 9 (at 5 minutes). The baby was scheduled for surgical intervention 3 days after birth. Finally, results of a pathological analysis revealed the mass to be a benign cystic teratoma.

Prenatal diagnosis of cervical teratoma is very crucial, allowing early detection of masses that obstruct the airway. Therefore, a multidisciplinary examination and follow-up are recommended for early prenatal diagnosis.
