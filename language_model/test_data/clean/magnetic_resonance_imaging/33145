Conn's syndrome following renal transplantation is extremely rare. Here, we present two cases of persistent hypertension and hypokalemia, emerging after kidney transplantation, which proved resistant to medical treatment. In both patients, biochemical investigations elicited massively elevated plasma aldosterone levels and suppressed renin activity. Abdominal MRI demonstrated a 90- and 20-mm right adrenal tumour in cases 1 and 2, respectively. For both patients, curative treatment was achieved via laparoscopic right adrenalectomy.
