The knee is a frequently injured joint and, thus, a common focus of operative intervention. As operative techniques and imaging modalities evolve, radiologists must be aware of the expected postoperative appearance after knee surgeries that are performed commonly and also must be comfortable recognizing complications encountered commonly in the immediate and delayed postoperative period.
