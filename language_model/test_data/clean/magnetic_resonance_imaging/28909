Solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) is a rare spindle cell neoplasm that usually arises from serosal surfaces. Although it is now increasingly recognized in extra-serosal locations, only two previous cases of SFT arising in an extremity have been reported. We describe another such case and review the literature regarding extra-serosal SFT.
