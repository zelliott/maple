The purpose of this study was to clarify the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging for malignant tumors in the oral and maxillofacial region. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance images of 25 patients with malignant tumors of the oral and maxillofacial region were evaluated. Computed tomography scans were performed with intravenous contrast enhancement. A 0.2-Tesla (Hitachi Medical Corp., Tokyo, Japan) permanent magnetic resonance unit was used to obtain T1-, T2-, and proton-density-weighted images with spin-echo pulse sequences. Gadolinium-diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid was administered in 11 cases. Severe artifacts influencing image interpretation were observed in 10 (40%) cases on computed tomography but only in 5 (20%) cases on magnetic resonance imaging. There was no difference in the detectability of bone invasion between images from the two systems. Contrast enhancement with gadolinium-diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid provided additional useful information in only 3 of 11 cases compared with nonenhanced magnetic resonance images. Malignant tumors showed a higher signal intensity than that of muscle on T2-weighted images in all cases and on proton-density-weighted images in 23 (92%) cases. On T1-weighted images, an intermediate signal intensity similar to that of muscle was seen in 16 (64%) cases and a hyperintense signal in 9 (36%) cases. There was poor correlation between signal intensity and pathologic diagnosis of the tumors. These results suggest that in cases with severe artifacts that disturb the interpretation of the images on computed tomography, magnetic resonance examinations are preferable for defining the exact extent of the primary lesion.
