Authors study retrospectively 81 cases of isolated recent (less than three months) knee traumas. These include clinical aspects, NMR, arthroscopy. Clinical examinations have been graded: 1. possible lesion; 2. likely lesions; 3. confirmed lesions. Clinical examinations and NMR results are compared to arthroscopy considered as reference. Clinical examination of acute traumatic knee is essential. Nevertheless, its value for detecting precise lesions is poor, except for knee locking well correlated with meniscal tears. Results show that NMR provide better results than clinical examination. NMR is reliable for detecting tears of posterior cruciate ligament, tears of posterior horn of menisci (sensibility: 93%; specificity: 80%). Its results are less effective for appreciation of lesion of anterior cruciate ligament (sensibility: 88%; specificity: 78%) because of partial tears and functional but not morphologic damage. It is the only method able to evidence osteochondral injuries and soft-tissues associated lesions in traumatic knees. Emergency NMR scans show results no differences in results compared with routine examinations. However, one should keep in mind that negative NMR cannot exclude small cartilaginous lesions and partial tears of anterior cruciate ligament. According to these results and the known qualities of NMR (non invasive), we propose that this type of investigation should be more largely included in diagnostic attitude for acute injured knee. Emergency diagnostic arthroscopy could be efficiently replaced by NMR knee examination.
