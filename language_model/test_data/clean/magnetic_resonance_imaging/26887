Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sialolithography is a useful technique for evaluating acute and chronic sialadenitis. However, its major weakness is that stones are not imaged directly. We have developed an MRI technique that allows specific identification and localization of calculi within the submandibular salivary gland or duct. This test is noninvasive and does not require ionizing radiation or a sialogogue. By using 3-dimensional susceptibility-weighted imaging, one can probe MRI signal phase changes. Corrected positive filtered phase and magnitude images, acquired using susceptibility-weighted imaging, allowed identification and anatomical localization of calcified calculi in the submandibular gland with efficacy comparable to computed tomography.
