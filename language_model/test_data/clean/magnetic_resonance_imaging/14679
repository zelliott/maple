The ovaries can be affected by a vast variety of tumours, which may be benign or malignant, solid or cystic. Although ultrasonography is often the first examination performed in the evaluation of gynaecological conditions, magnetic resonance imaging is nowadays the most accurate imaging technique in the characterization of ovarian masses. Once the ovarian origin of a pelvic mass has been determined, the detection of any fibrous component within the lesion significantly reduces the spectrum of aetiologies that should be considered. Fibrotic tissue usually displays marked low-signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences at MRI, and enhancement is mostly moderate after intravenous administration of gadolinium chelates. This review aims to provide the main diagnoses to consider at MRI whenever an ovarian tumour, both purely solid or solid and cystic, contains a fibrous component, even if minimally abundant. The corresponding key imaging features are provided.
