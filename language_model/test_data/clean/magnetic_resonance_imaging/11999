MRI of the head is routinely performed with spin-echo sequences whereas gradient-echo sequences are still uncommon. Certain features of fast imaging sequences make them a promising tool for clinical investigations. The relative high signal-to-noise ratio/unit time demonstrates the usefulness of GE imaging as localising images. The extremely high contrast-flexibility is sometimes superior to SE imaging and may help to characterise structures and lesions. Flow dynamics are more clearly depicted than with SE sequences and lead to the dynamic evaluation of intracranial motion (CSF flow, blood flow). This information may be used in a special mode to achieve MR angiograms. Due to the very short repetition times, GE sequences are excellently suited to 3D application. This enables to reduce slice thickness to less than 1 mm with optional reconstructions in any virtual direction. In view of present developments in MR, GE imaging will be accepted in clinical diagnostic imaging in the near future.
