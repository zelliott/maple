Evaluate Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) sensibility in the diagnosis and follow-up of dissection of Internal Carotid and Vertebral Artery (ICA/VA). We revalued MR examination of 36 patients, 24 men, 12 women, aged 18-69 years. All patients underwent brain TC and MR (GE 1 Tesla); in 16 subjects 3D Time-of-Flight (TOF-3D) MRA was performed and in 20 subjects a Contrast-Enhanced MRA (CEMRA) of neck and head arteries. Thirty-one patients underwent a MRA follow-up. Dissection involved ICA in 30 and VA in 8. MR showed ischemic signs in 25 cases, wall hematoma in 19, and was normal in 11. MRA showed 25 vessels stenosis, 12 occlusions, and 9 aneurysm. Follow-up MRA showed 6 cases of complete resolution of stenosis, 17 partial resolution, 2 aneurysmal dissecanting, 6 luminal alteration unchanged, 1 aneurysma enlarged. MRA represented a non-invasive technique as investigation in suspected cervicocephalic arteries dissection.
