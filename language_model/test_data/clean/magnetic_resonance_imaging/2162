In cavernous angiomas of the brain, abnormally dilated blood vessels are tightly clustered together with no intervening neural parenchyma. Commonly recognised as a sporadic finding, these lesions may also be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. This disorder was recognised as a common entity with the advent of MRI. As lesions were often not detected on CT imaging, symptomatic patients presenting with seizures were mistakenly diagnosed with an idiopathic seizure disorder. Seizures are the commonest presenting symptom followed by haemorrhage and focal neurologic deficit. We present another cause of familial epilepsy that also emphasises the importance of MRI as the modality of choice in investigating seizures in children.
