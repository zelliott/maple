Managing small renal masses poses a common and controversial problem. Although radical nephrectomy is still the most common treatment, partial nephrectomy is the new gold standard, and thermal ablation or active surveillance are reasonable for some patients. Renal mass biopsy with molecular profiling will likely allow for more rational treatment in the near future.
