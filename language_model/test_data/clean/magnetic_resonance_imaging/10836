Severe parathyroid bone disease is a rare clinical presentation of primary hyperparathyroidism. Double parathyroid adenomas are even more rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. The authors present a case of double parathyroid adenomas in a 48-year-old man, who presented with painful left lower limb swelling, which was slowly growing in size in the last 20 years. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic bony lesion and coincidentally, a urinary bladder calculus. Biopsy of the mass revealed giant cell lesion. Laboratory investigations showed hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia with elevated parathyroid hormone level. A computerized tomography scan of the neck delineated an adenoma of the left superior parathyroid gland, which was surgically removed. The left inferior parathyroid was also enlarged and was removed. Histological diagnosis confirmed double parathyroid adenomas. The rarity and the interesting clinical presentation of such association are discussed.
