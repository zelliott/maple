Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical diagnostic procedure which requires a patient to be placed supine into the cylindrical bore of a powerful magnet for approximately one hour. The patient's arms are usually against the sides of the magnet bore with a 3" to 10" space between the patient's face and the top of the magnet bore. This enclosure induces panic and claustrophobic responses in 1% to 10% of the patients undergoing the MRI procedure. There have been many failed diagnostic studies due to patient intolerance, and there are reports of procedure-induced claustrophobia. We describe the hypnotic procedure utilized to reduce anxiety and panic for successful completion of MRI scans. Medical hypnosis has been an effective intervention in ten patients, permitting completion of their diagnostic procedure.
