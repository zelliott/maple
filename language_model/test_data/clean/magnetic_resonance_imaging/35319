We report computed tomographic and magnetic resonance findings of an ovarian malignant Brenner tumor with transition from benign to malignant components. The tumor was demonstrated as a cystic mass with solid mural components. The benign component contained dense calcifications on computed tomography and showed very low intensity on T2-weighted images, whereas the malignant component showed high intensity. The admixture of 2 components may well reflect the pathological feature and may be a diagnostic clue to malignant Brenner tumor.
