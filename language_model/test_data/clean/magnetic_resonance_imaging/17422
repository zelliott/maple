A powerful graphical pulse sequence programming tool has been designed for creating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications. It allows rapid development of pulse sequences in graphical mode (allowing for the visualization of sequences), and consists of three modules which include a graphical sequence editor, a parameter management module and a sequence compiler. Its key features are ease to use, flexibility and hardware independence. When graphic elements are combined with a certain text expressions, the graphical pulse sequence programming is as flexible as text-based programming tool. In addition, a hardware-independent design is implemented by using the strategy of two step compilations. To demonstrate the flexibility and the capability of this graphical sequence programming tool, a multi-slice fast spin echo experiment is performed on our home-made 0.3 T permanent magnet MRI system.
