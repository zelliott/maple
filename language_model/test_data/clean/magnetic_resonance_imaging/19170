Orbital myositis implies orbital inflammation confined to one or more of the extraocular muscles. The acute form responds well to high doses of oral corticosteroids tapered gradually, but it may recur or become chronic. We describe a 38 years old female who has been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis for six years. She developed diplopia as a result of a paralysis of the right and left rectus medialis muscle. MRI showed inflammatory process and thickness of the referred muscles. The patient had a total recovery with oral use of 80 mg methylprednisolone daily. Two months after the first episode she developed a bilateral ophthalmoplegy. The patient improved with oral use of steroids the second time, but a paresis of the left rectus lateralis muscle remained. From the 156 cases we reviewed only three have been related to rheumatic diseases and none has been previously related to rheumatoid arthritis.
