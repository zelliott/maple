To demonstrate the possible beneficial effects of methotrexate (MTX) therapy for patients with sarcoid-associated optic neuropathy (SAON).

Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.

Three patients diagnosed with SAON who received MTX. Two patients had tissue biopsies consistent with sarcoidosis, and 1 patient had clinically diagnosed sarcoidosis based on laboratory and radiographic studies. All 3 patients developed side effects with corticosteroid treatment of their optic neuropathy.

Patients were treated with weekly doses of oral MTX and monitored with neuro-ophthalmic, medical, and laboratory examinations.

Visual acuity, automated perimetry, and reduction of oral prednisone therapy.

After initiation of MTX, all 3 patients showed an improvement or stabilization of visual acuity. All patients had a decrease in their corticosteroid requirements, and all had improved or stabilized visual field deficits. One of the 3 patients developed leukopenia that necessitated a reduction of the methotrexate dose.

Methotrexate may be effective for SAON as an adjunct to corticosteroid therapy or as an alternative for corticosteroid-intolerant patients. Oral MTX reduced the corticosteroid requirements of 3 patients with SAON, and all 3 demonstrated stable or improved visual function.
