Adrenal myelolipoma is an uncommon benign tumor usually discovered by chance in patients with hypertension, obesity, atherosclerosis, cancer or endocrine disorders. The association with adrenal endocrine dysfunctions appears to be the most frequent. Myelolipoma has been found in patients affected by Cushing's syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, Addison's disease, virilization. We report herein a case of association, based on clinical and radiological signs, between myelolipoma and adrenal adenoma in a patient with Conn's disease. The myelolipoma was localized in the opposite adrenal gland to that of adenoma, at difference with the other cases described.
