Cardiac metastasis from pelvic malignancies is rare. We experienced a case of carcinoma of the uterine cervix with myocardial involvement in the right ventricle, and treated this patient with conventional methods until her death. The metastatic tumor was incidentally found in the right ventricle, eroding the myocardium. We used CT, MRI, and gallium scintigraphy to assess the lesion. This aggressive lesion proved fatal for our relatively young patient. We report this case for future reference.
