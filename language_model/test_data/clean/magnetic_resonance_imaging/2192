Laparoscopic rectal mobilization and hypogastric arterial isolation were combined with a posterior sacrococcygectomy for the resection of a large sacrococcygeal chordoma in two patients. The laparoscopic procedure as described was uneventful in both cases. There was no postoperative morbidity associated with the laparoscopic procedure. The combination of laparoscopic pelvic dissection and radical posterior sacrococcygectomy is safe, effective, oncologically sound, and should be considered for all patients with a large proximal sacrococcygeal chordoma.
