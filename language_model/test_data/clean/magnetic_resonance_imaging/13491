The authors provide the results of the use of magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) in examining 20 patients suffering from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMP). MRT was made using an apparatus with a field force of 0.23 synchronized with the ECG. The MR-sections were performed both in transverse and inclined planes oriented along the long axis of the left ventricle. MRT made it possible to identify and to assess with a high accuracy asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle myocardium including the cases with apical localization of hypertrophy. Analysis of the data showed a certain decrease of the left ventricle cavity in the systole, dilatation of the left atrium and pronounced hypertrophy of the myocardium (mainly of the interventricular septum). The asymmetry coefficient amounted to 2.1. Correlation of the MRT data and two-dimensional ultrasound cardiography readings demonstrated good comparability of the results obtained with the use of both methods. MRT can be applied in the diagnosis of HCMP in cases where it is difficult to carry out ultrasound cardiography as well as for diagnosis verification provided the results derived with the use of other research methods are inconclusive.
