Parosteal osteosarcoma of the skull is a distinct surface bone tumor, with a better prognosis than conventional osteosarcoma. The most common location is on the surface of the distal femur which accounts for 46-66% of the cases. The presentation in the skull is uncommon and there are few cases reported in the literature. We describe the case of a man who developed a parosteal osteosarcoma arising from the occipital bone with extension to the parietal bone. The patient was operated and had a complete tumor resection.
