The goal of the present set of studies was to characterize the in vitro binding properties and in vivo tissue kinetics for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAcChT) radiotracer, [18F](+)-4-fluorobenzyltrozamicol ([18F](+)-FBT). In vitro binding studies were conducted in order to determine the affinity of the (+)- and (-)-stereoisomers of FBT for the VAcChT as well as sigma (sigma 1 and sigma 2) receptors. (+)-FBT was found to have a high affinity (Ki = 0.22 nM) for the VAcChT and lower affinities for sigma 1 (21.6 nM) and sigma 2 (35.9 nM) receptors, whereas (-)-FBT had similar affinities for the VAcChT and sigma 1 receptors (approximately 20 nM) and a lower affinity for sigma 2 (110 nM) receptors. PET imaging studies were conducted in rhesus monkeys (n = 3) with [18F](+)-FBT. [18F](+)-FBT was found to have a high accumulation and slow rate of washout from the basal ganglia, which is consistent with the labeling of cholinergic interneurons in this brain region. [18F](+)-FBT also displayed reversible binding kinetics during the 3 h time course of PET and produced radiolabeled metabolites that did not cross the blood-brain barrier. The results from the current in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that [18F](+)-FBT is a promising ligand for studying cholinergic terminal density, with PET, via the VAcChT.
