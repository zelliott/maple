A patient with an olfactory neuroblastoma in the frontal skull base was treated with primary tumor excision and partial resection of the A2 segment of both anterior cerebral arteries (ACA's). Revascularization was carried out using a superficial temporal artery (STA) interposition graft between the proximal and distal stumps with A3 segment-to-A3 segment end-to-side anastomosis. This technique established flow to the peripheral territories of the ACA's through the interposed STA graft. The technical aspects and possible role of this procedure are presented.
