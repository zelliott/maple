We present a 63-year-old man with chronic pancreatitis and the rare complication of giant subcapsular splenic hematoma. The hematoma showed no size reduction for 6 weeks. Then, the hematoma was infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa after the recurrence of the pancreatitis, and it finally ruptured. This case suggested that in cases of giant subcapsular splenic hematoma with chronic pancreatitis reductive pressure treatment should be administered as early as possible.
