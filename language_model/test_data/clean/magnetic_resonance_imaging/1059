To assess the value of MRI for early diagnosis of osteomyelitis in children presenting with sepsis and acute onset of musculoskeletal pain.

MRI including fat suppressed T2W, and fat suppressed pre- and postcontrast T1W sequences was performed within 48 hours of admission in 26 children with clinical (fever and acute musculoskeletal pain) and biological (elevated WBC count and ESR in all cases, and elevated CRP in 12 patients) suspicion of acute osteomyelitis. None of the patients had sickle cell disease.

MRI was normal in 7 children (26%). Bone marrow signal abnormality was noted in 19 cases (74%) consistent with acute osteomyelitis in 18 cases and metastatic neuroblastoma in 1 case.

MRI is useful for evaluation of children presenting with sepsis and acute musculoskeletal pain, early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and to prevent unnecessary hospital admission and work-up.
