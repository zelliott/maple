Neurosarcoidosis is a rare (5 cases for one million) immune-mediated disease generally observed in young adults. Neurological symptoms are present in the half of patients, and symptoms remain limited to neurological system in 10p.cent. Histological criteria are mandatory to prove the diagnosis. The sensitivity and complications of biopsy are variable. The best sensitivity appears to be achieved with muscle biopsies which in addition have a lower risk of complications. Neurosarcoidosis is usually treated with corticosteroid therapy and immunosuppressive drugs (cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, aziathoprine, methotrexate), but frequently resists standard schedules. In addition the many contraindications, side effects and cumulated toxicities of immunosuppressive drugs compromises their use. Knowledge of the effectiveness of other treatments would therefore be useful. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been used for treatment of many immune-mediated neurological diseases, like polymyositis, multifocal motor neuropathy, myasthenia or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. MMF is efficient and well tolerated, but there is no case-report about neurosarcoidosis.

We report two observations of young patients (14 and 27 years) with a diagnosis of resistant neurosarcoidosis treated with MMF (2 g/j) and corticosteroids. A significant and rapid effectiveness was clinically and radiologically observed, with good clinical and hematologic tolerance.

The MMF seems to be an interesting rescue treatment for neurosarcoidosis. Further evaluation is needed.
