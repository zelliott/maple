Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is a new diagnostic technique which allows vascular structures to be studied atraumatically and without any contrast medium. Its basic principles are reported in the present paper, together with the results of a preliminary study of normal neck anatomy. Twenty healthy volunteers and 10 patients with no cerebral vascular diseases underwent this MRA study. Internal and common carotid arteries were always well visualized, while external carotid was demonstrated in 87% of cases. Among intracranial vessels, the middle cerebral artery was clearly depicted in 63% of cases, while the anterior cerebral artery was visible in 18% of the study population only.
