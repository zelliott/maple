The phenomenon of continuous spikes and waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS) is associated with a number of epileptic syndromes, which share a behavioral phenotype characterized by deterioration of cognitive, behavioral, or sensorimotor functions. Available evidence seems to suggest that spike-wave activity is a result of a complex interaction between cortical and subcortical inhibitory networks and can "per se" produce a transient loss of underlying cortical functions. Syndromes like Landau-Kleffner syndrome, CSWS, and phenomena such as negative myoclonus could share in common--at least at the neurophysiological level--some similarities. Differences in behavioral phenotypes could be explained in term of maturational and genetic differences, as well as by the functional specificity of the involved areas.
