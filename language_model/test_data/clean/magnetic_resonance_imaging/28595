To evaluate the role of radiological imaging of meningiomas in confirming the diagnosis and as a neuroanatomical aid to surgical planning, 115 patients with surgically excised meningiomas between 1990 and 1993 were studied. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (on a 0.5 T unit) and angiography were reviewed, and compared with histopathology (when available). Seventy-eight CT, 89 MRI and 85 angiographic studies were reviewed, and correlated with histopathology in 67 cases. In 48 cases, the surgical specimens could not be pathologically classified. The most common lesion sites were the cerebral convexities, falx and sphenoidal ridges. True demarcation of cleavage planes was seen on 73% of MRI and 10% of CT studies. Computed tomography showed hyperostosis in 27% and MRI in 7% of studies. Tumours enhanced strongly with contrast in 98% of CT scans. On MRI there were variable signal intensities on different sequences, and no correlation between signal intensities and histological subtype was found. Oedema was present in 59% of CT and 66% of MRI studies, and was most pronounced in lesions > 3 cm in diameter. Tumour calcification was seen in 62% of CT and 8% of MRI studies. Vascular abnormalities were seen on 65% of MRI, 21% of CT and 84% of angiogram studies. Angiographic tumour vascularity did not correlate with histologic subtype. All three imaging modalities have management roles: CT for bony changes and calcification, MRI for multiplanar and vessel anatomy imaging, and angiography for vessel delineation and embolization if required.
