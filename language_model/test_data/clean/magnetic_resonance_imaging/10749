The Neuroform stent is the first microcatheter-delivered stent designed specifically for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. The stent functions primarily to provide durable parent vessel protection during the embolization of broad-necked cerebral aneurysms. The present case report demonstrates in-stent stenosis occurring as a delayed complication of Neuroform stent-supported coil embolization of an unruptured cerebral aneurysm.
