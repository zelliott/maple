Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can aid in the detection and characterization of many pancreatic neoplasms. The MR imaging appearances of common pancreatic neoplasms such as ductal adenocarcinoma are well-known. However, MR imaging features of more unusual pancreatic neoplasms are not well understood. Such tumors include mucin-hyper-secreting carcinoma, serous microcystic neoplasm, mucinous macrocystic neoplasm, solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm, multiple cysts associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease, acinar cell carcinoma, pancreaticoblastoma, and endocrine neoplasms (eg, nonfunctioning islet cell tumors, insulinoma, and gastrinoma). In general, pancreatic neoplasms demonstrate high signal intensity on T2-weighted images; the signal intensity on T1-weighted images is more variable but is often intermediate or low. Gadolinium enhancement is often helpful in further characterizing pancreatic neoplasms. The gross and histologic features of pancreatic neoplasms are also not well-known. Correlation with the underlying pathologic features enhances understanding of the MR imaging characteristics of both common and unusual pancreatic neoplasms.
