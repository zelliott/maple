The combined T1, T2 and secular-T2 pixel frequency distributions of 24 adult human brains were studied in vivo using a technique based on the mixed-TSE pulse sequence, dual-space clustering segmentation and histogram gaussian decomposition. Pixel frequency histograms of whole brains and the four principal brain compartments were studied comparatively and as function of age. For white matter, the position of the T1 peak correlates with age (R2 =.7868) when data are fitted to a quadratic polynomial. For gray matter, a weaker age correlation is found (R2 =.3687). T2 and secular-T2 results are indicative of a weaker correlation with age. The technique and preliminary results presented herein may be useful for characterizing normal as well as abnormal aging of the brain, and also for comparison with the results obtained with alternative quantitative MRI methodologies.
