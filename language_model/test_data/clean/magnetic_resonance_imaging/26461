In women over the age of 50, a mature cystic teratoma is reportedly likely to change into a malignant form. A mature cystic teratoma that remained in a benign form in a very old woman is a rare event. We report a case of a benign cystic teratoma, which is the oldest in Japan.

An 85-year-old Japanese woman with a pelvic mass measuring 8.90x5.81 cm by ultrasonography was referred to our Department for detailed. Transvaginal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and serum concentrations of tumor markers led to a diagnosis of a mature cystic teratoma. Histological findings postoperatively confirmed the presence of a mature cystic teratoma.

This case report describes a mature cystic teratoma which is the second oldest case reported in the world. We reconfirmed that a mature cystic teratoma in elderly women is not frequent, but does occur.
