A case of ossified median nerve schwannoma in the left arm, first noticed about 40 years ago is examined. Although calcification of old schwannoma is sometimes seen, new bone formation in a schwannoma is extremely rare. Since there was a strong adhesion between the tumour and the median nerve in this case, the tumour could not be enucleated easily. The tumour was excised under a surgical microscopy without any neurological deficit.
