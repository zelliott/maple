Although psychiatric researchers have been quick to adopt magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in their investigations, its clinical application has been slow to develop and most psychiatrists remain unaware of its potential advantages and disadvantages compared with CT scanning. In this article the procedures are compared and the potential advantages of MRI highlighted with the help of neuropsychiatric case histories. Clinical situations are then discussed in which a psychiatrist should consider ordering a MRI scan subsequent to or instead of a CT scan.
