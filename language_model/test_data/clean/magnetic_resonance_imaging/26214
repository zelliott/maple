It is unclear whether brain MRI lesions are associated with depression in multiple sclerosis (MS). Neurological dysfunction in depressed (n= 19) and non-depressed (n = 29) MS patients was rated by expanded disability status scale (EDSS). EDSS was weakly predictive of the presence of (p = 0.03) and severity of (p = 0.01) depression. After correcting for EDSS, the presence of depression was predicted by superior frontal and superior parietal hypointense TI lesions (p<0.01); the severity of depression was predicted by superior frontal, superior parietal and temporal TI lesions, lateral and third ventricular enlargement, and frontal atrophy (p<0.01). Depression was not related to bright T2 lesions or enhancement. We conclude that atrophy and cortical-subcortical disconnection due to frontal and parietal white matter destructive lesions may contribute to depression in MS.
