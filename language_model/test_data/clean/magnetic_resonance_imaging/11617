The advent of modern computer technology has made it possible to examine not just the target point, but the entire trajectory in planning for stereotactic biopsies.

Two hundred consecutive biopsies were performed by one surgeon, utilizing a computer graphics workstation. The target point, entry point, and complete trajectory were carefully scrutinized and adjusted to minimize potential complications.

Pathologically abnormal tissue was obtained in 197 cases (98.5%). There was no mortality in this series. Symptomatic hemorrhages occurred in 4 cases (2%).

Computer graphics workstations facilitate safe and effective biopsies in virtually any brain area.
