A 53-year-old woman with Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SS) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) complicated by transverse myelitis (TM) and malignant lymphoma (ML) is reported. TM has been described only in seven cases of primary SS, including three with PBC and four without PBC. The features of SS associated with PBC and complicated by TM were less typical compared with those seen in SS without PBC complicated by TM. This case is the first report of a case with SS, PBC, TM and ML. SS in association with PBC is, in general, overlooked, but such cases must be investigated with great caution for extraglandular complications.
