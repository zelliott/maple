Magnetic resonance velocity mapping was used in 24 normal subjects to study two-dimensional velocity profiles in the proximal and mid-ascending aorta, and to quantify both forward and reverse flow. The aortic flow measurements were validated by comparison with left ventricular stroke volume in all subjects and by comparison with pulmonary flow measurements in 12. Agreement was good with standard errors of the estimate of 7.8 and 7.1 ml, and correlation coefficients of 0.93 and 0.95, respectively. Systolic velocity maps were similar in the proximal aorta and the mid-ascending aorta, with maximum early systolic flow along the left posterior wall. Toward the end of systole and throughout diastole, a channel of reverse flow developed in the same region in the mid-ascending aorta, but in the proximal aorta it split to enter the sinuses of Valsalva, predominantly the left and the right coronary sinuses. Mean percentage ratio of retrograde-to-antegrade flow was 6.3%, with the majority of retrograde flow occurring in early diastole. The findings suggest that the retrograde flow is related to coronary artery flow and it is possible that aortic disease, which is known to influence aortic flow patterns, may also influence coronary flow.
