The past year has seen great advances in the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the functional organization of the human visual cortex, to measure the neuronal correlates of visual perception, and to test computational theories of vision. Activity in particular visual brain areas, as measured with fMRI, has been found to correlate with psychophysical performance, with visual attention, and with subjective perceptual experience.
