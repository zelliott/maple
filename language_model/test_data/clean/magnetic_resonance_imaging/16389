Spatial working memory (SWM) dysfunction has been suggested as a trait marker of schizophrenia and implicates a diffuse network involving prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortices. However, structural abnormalities in both grey and white matter in relation to SWM deficits are largely unexplored. The current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study examined this relationship in a sample of young first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients using a whole-brain voxel-based method. SWM ability of 21 FES patients and 41 comparable controls was assessed by the CANTAB SWM task. Using an automated morphometric analysis of brain MRI scans, we assessed the relationship between SWM abilities and both grey matter volume and white matter density in both groups. Our findings demonstrated the different directionality of the association between SWM errors and grey matter volume in left frontal regions and white matter tracts connecting these regions with temporal and occipital areas between FES patients and controls. This suggests that the substrate underpinning the normal variability in SWM function in healthy individuals may be abnormal in FES, and that the normal neurodevelopmental processes that drive the development of SWM networks are disrupted in schizophrenia.
