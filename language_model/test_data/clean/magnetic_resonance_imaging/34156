To determine whether a 10-minute magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examination of the upper abdomen provides sufficiently comprehensive information to replace a longer MR protocol.

Images obtained with selected breathing-independent and breath hold MR sequences, with 2 minutes of total acquisition time and an estimated 10 minutes of total study time, in consecutive MR examinations of the upper abdomen in 72 patients (age range, 23-87 years) were retrospectively reviewed in a blinded fashion by two separate interpreters. Determination was made of major and minor findings, and the two separate retrospective interpretations and the prospective clinical interpretation were correlated by using kappa statistics. Surgical and clinical findings were also correlated with imaging findings.

In 61 patients, all major and minor findings were identical in the original clinical interpretation and the two retrospective readings. In 66 patients, the major findings were identical in these three readings. Close agreement was present between the two separate retrospective readings and the prospective clinical interpretation (kappa = 0.49-1.00).

The findings suggest that the diagnostic information provided by a shortened MR imaging protocol that includes breath-hold and breathing-independent sequences is in close agreement with lengthier MR protocols. The advantages of a shortened protocol include increased patient throughput and decreased study cost.
