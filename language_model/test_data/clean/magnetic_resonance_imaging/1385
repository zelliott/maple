Correct staging of bladder tumours is essential for planning the best therapeutic strategy and is therefore directly related to the prognosis. In this study of 15 patients with bladder cancer, a new method using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a newly developed double-surface coil was tested for bladder cancer staging and compared with other existing techniques. Ultrasonography produced 2 cases of overstaging and 2 of understaging. This was due to the inability of this method to evaluate muscular infiltration accurately. All superficial bladder tumours were staged correctly with ultrasound with the exception of 1 case that was overstaged because of superficial tumour calcification. Double-surface coil MRI correctly staged all infiltrating tumours. Two small superficial tumours were missed by MRI, while another superficial tumour was overstaged. It is suggested that double-surface coil MRI and intravesical ultrasonography are good complementary examinations in the pre-operative staging of bladder tumours. Larger studies are necessary to prove the reliability of this conclusion.
