Oxidative stress plays an important role in multiple sclerosis (MS). Isoprostanes are biomarkers for oxidative stress and have been related to neurological disease progression.

To study whether plasma isoprostane levels were related to disease progression in MS.

Plasma levels of 8,12-iso-iPF2alpha-VI were determined in 17 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 41 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and 5 primary progressive MS (PPMS) patients and related to MRI and clinical disease parameters.

Isoprostane levels were similar in CIS (60.9, interquartile range (IQR): 47.7-77.7 pg/ml) and RRMS patients (65.3, IQR: 51.9-82.8 pg/ml). The plasma levels were lower in PPMS patients (42.5, IQR: 37.1-49.9) pg/ml, p<0.05) compared to CIS and RRMS patients in this cohort, which was not confirmed in a second cohort. Baseline isoprostane levels were not related to clinical progression defined by conversion form CIS to RRMS or change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) or MS Functional Composite (MSFC) scores during six years of follow-up (CIS + RRMS), nor to change in volume of gadolinium enhancing lesions, T2 lesion load or T1 hypointense lesion load during 2.8 years of follow-up (CIS + RRMS).

These results do not support a strong role of 8,12-iso-iPF2alpha-VI in the prediction of disease progression in MS.
