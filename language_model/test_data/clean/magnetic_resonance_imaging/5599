An unusual case of a carcinoid tumour in a lumbar extradural teratoma presenting as tethered cord syndrome and spina bifida without carcinoid syndrome in a 51-year-old woman is reported. These entities existing simultaneously in the same region are extremely rare and this suggests they have a common origin.
