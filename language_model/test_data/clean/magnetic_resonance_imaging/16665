Sodium magnetic resonance imaging of knee cartilage is a possible diagnostic method for osteoarthritis, but low signal-to-noise ratio yields low spatial resolution images and long scan times. For a given scan time, a steady-state approach with reduced repetition time and increased averaging may improve signal-to-noise ratio and hence attainable resolution. However, repetition time reduction results in increased power deposition, which must be offset with increased radiofrequency pulse length and/or reduced flip angle to maintain an acceptable specific absorption rate. Simulations varying flip angle, repetition time, and radiofrequency pulse length were performed for constant power deposition corresponding to ∼6 W/kg over the human knee at 4.7 T. For 10% agar, simulation closely matched experiment. For healthy human knee cartilage, a 37% increase in signal-to-noise ratio was predicted for steady-state over "fully relaxed" parameters while a 29% ± 4% increase was determined experimentally (n=10). Partial volume of cartilage with synovial fluid, inaccurate relaxation parameters used in simulation, and/or quadrupolar splitting may be responsible for this disagreement. Excellent quality sodium images of the human knee were produced in 9 mins at 4.7 T using the signal-to-noise ratio enhancing steady-state technique.
