Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is widely used for whole body diagnosis. Spin echo and gradient echo are principle pulse sequences for MRI. Fast scan imaging is now available and can obtained excellent imaging quality with reduced scan time. Using a fast scan pulse sequence, dynamic study, functional and perfusion imaging can be performed in routine clinical practices. Biopsy and thermal therapy of brain and other parts of body are now being performed under MR monitoring and control.
