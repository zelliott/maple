We hypothesize that disruption of the fascicular attachments between the popliteus and lateral meniscus can result in gross instability of the meniscus producing locking of the knee. This study brings attention to the importance of the clinical examination, and the need for clinical correlation to magnetic resonance (MR) studies. We report on three patients referred with the history of mechanical locking episodes of their knee. Initial MR examinations were all read as normal before referral to our institution. On close review of these MR examinations, popliteomeniscal fascicular disruption could be seen in each case. Each of these patients had arthroscopic-repair of these meniscal detachments. At 1-year follow-up, all patients had resolution of mechanical symptoms. Each patient had confirmation of their repair with repeat arthroscopy or MR and arthrographic examinations. An anatomic specimen was used to identify the popliteus muscle and tendon, the lateral meniscus, the antero-inferior popliteomeniscal fascicle, and the postero-superior popliteomeniscal fascicle attachments. MR images of the same anatomic specimen show both superior and inferior fasciculus attachments to the capsule. MR examples of the intact and disrupted antero-inferior and postero-superior popliteomeniscal fasciculi have been correlated to anatomic specimens to help familiarize the orthopaedic surgeon with these important stabilizing structures.
