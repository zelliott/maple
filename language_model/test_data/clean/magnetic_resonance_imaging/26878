Toscana virus (TOSV) infection may often cause symptomatic meningitides and encephalitides. These usually subside in few days and their sequelae do not last for more than few weeks. We here report the case of a 49-year-old man who developed encephalitis after being bitten by phlebotomi in a region near southern Tuscany, where TOSV is endemic, and who developed postencephalitic seizures and subsequently, persistent personality alterations, characterized by sexually dissolute behavior and aggressiveness. One year after infection, the patient needs a combination of an SSRI antidepressant and a mood stabilizer/anticonvulsant to obtain less than optimal symptom improvement. This points to the need of establishing better preventive measures in Tuscany and nearby regions.
