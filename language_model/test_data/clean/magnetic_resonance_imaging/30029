The patient was a 26-year-old female with a 14-year history of right-sided patellofemoral pain and frequent episodes of patellar subluxation/dislocation. Because of her longstanding history of patellofemoral pain and failure to respond to conservative management, magnetic resonance imaging was ordered. Axial and sagittal images of the patellofemoral joint revealed a bone spur on the anterior-medial surface of the femoral trochlear groove. After further consultation with an orthopedic surgeon, an arthroscopic surgical procedure was scheduled to remove the bone spur. At the time of publication, the subject was 1 month postsurgery and symptom free.
