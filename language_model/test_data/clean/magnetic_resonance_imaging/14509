We present a case of a postmortem finding of bone marrow edema in postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (PMMR) indirectly induced by a bullet, which barely missed the bone of a 92-year-old man found kneeling in front of his bed of a tidy apartment. Additionally, a selective postmortem computed tomography angiography (PMCTA) of the left leg was performed, visualizing a laceration of the left femoral vein by the bullet with consecutive contrast media extravasation. A vast pulmonary fat embolism was diagnosed and together with the blood loss found to be the cause of death.
