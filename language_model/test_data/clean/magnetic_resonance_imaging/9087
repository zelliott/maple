The hemorrhagic simple hepatic cyst is extremely rare and can sometimes be confused with biliary cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. Here we present two cases of huge hemorrhagic simple hepatic cysts. Case 1 was a 43-year-old man with a cystic lesion measuring 13 cm x 12 cm in the right hepatic lobe. Ultrasound and computed tomography showed several mural nodules on the irregularly thickened wall and high-density straps inside the cyst. Case 2 was a 60-year-old woman with a huge cyst measuring 15 cm x 14 cm in the central liver. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging showed the cystic wall was unevenly thickened and there were some flame-like prominences on the wall. The iconographic representations of the two cases mimicked biliary cystadenoma. Cystectomy and left hepatectomy were performed for the two patients, respectively. Both patients recovered quickly after their operations and showed no recurrence.
