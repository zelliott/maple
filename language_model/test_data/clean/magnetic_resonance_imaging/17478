To normalize arterial pressure (AP), combined antihypertensive therapy, basing on intake of 2,5-5 mg cilazapril, inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (IACE), was administered to 22 patients, 12 men, 10 women, aged from 49 to 74 years, mean age 63 +/- 7 years, who survived stroke (18 patients) or transitory ischemic attack (3 patients). Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), i.e. perfusion regime, neuropsychological study and assessment of emotional state (Beck depression inventory and Spilberger anxiety scale) were conducted before and at the end of the treatment. During 6 months therapy, systolic blood pressure decreased from 154,7 +/- 12 to 128 +/- 23 mm HG and diastolic pressure from 90,3 +/- 9,6 to 79,4 +/- 23 mm Hg in all patients, without side-effects and development of stroke. There were neither new foci registered by MRT, no significant changes of cerebral blood flow. At the end of the treatment, cognitive functions were improved on the Mini Mental State Examination, on short-term memory test, Boston naming test and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test but no changes were found in emotional state of patients.
