Intracavitary radiotherapy is conceptually an attractive method of boosting dose to nasopharynx cancer whilst sparing sensitive normal tissues. A high dose rate (HDR) microselectron can be used to deliver a brachytherapy boost conveniently, safely, comfortably and effectively. Following external radiotherapy a single outpatient treatment has been given to patients using the remote afterloading system of sources placed in modified paediatric endotracheal tubes. This has been associated with good primary control and no evidence of serious morbidity in eight patients. The main limitation of this method is restriction of its utilization to small volume primary disease.
