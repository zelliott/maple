Twelve asymptomatic volunteers were examined using three different groups of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisition parameters (Group a: TE 30 ms, TR 480 ms; Group B: TE 20 ms, TR 315 ms; Group C: TE 30 ms, TR 1200 ms). Altering the parameters was aimed at improving the signal to noise (S:N) ratio. Group C parameters demonstrated the best clarity of the three groups. Closed jaw views gave better images than open views in all three groups.
