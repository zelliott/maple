The spleen-liver model, as a predictor for contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N) in liver metastases, was verified for seven sequences in 22 patients with 70 colorectal metastases. Optimization of conventional spin-echo, T1-magnetization-prepared gradient-echo and fat frequency-selective presaturation inversion-recovery fast spin echo can be done using the spleen-liver model. C/N of liver-spleen and liver-metastases, however, differed significantly on our T1 gradient-echo and T2-weighted fast spin-echo images, with and without fat-selective saturation.
