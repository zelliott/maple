Leiomyosarcoma of the paranasal sinuses is uncommon and has an aggressive clinical behavior. Only 28 cases have been described in the literature, and, of these, only 3 patients treated with surgery had a disease-free survival. In this report, we describe the clinical history of a 57-year-old woman with a leiomyosarcoma of the paranasal sinuses successfully treated with a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. We obtained a total response with ifosfamide, doxorubicin, dacarbazine, and epirubicin. This case report emphasizes the possibility of treating this aggressive tumor with chemotherapy in accordance with the same therapy used in the treatment of uterine leiomyosarcomas.
