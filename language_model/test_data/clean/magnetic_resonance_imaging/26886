Silicone oil is an important adjunct for intraocular tamponade in treating retinal detachment. We report a case in which image findings suggested migration and intracranial accumulation of intraocular silicone. We detected silicone oil in the lateral ventricle that showed hyperdensity on computed tomography, slight hyperintensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images, and slight hypointensity on T2-weighted images. Applied silicone-selective imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed the diagnosis of intraventricular silicone.
