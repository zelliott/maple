In this article, the authors are presenting their experience and the results with the surgical treatment of intraorbital intraconal tumors based on a review of 33 constitutive cases. Our data were evaluated in comparison to other major series, and possible factors that might influence surgical outcome and survival are discussed. Thirty-three patients diagnosed with intraorbital intraconal tumors between 1998 and 2009 were treated by transcranial approach. Of these patients, there were 14 males (42.4 %) and 19 females (57.8 %). The age ranged between 2 and 70 years (mean = 36 ± 16.6 years). The follow-up period ranged between 2 and 13 years (mean = 7.3 ± 3.2 years). The most common presenting symptoms were exophthalmus and decreased visual acuity, which was seen in 21 (63.6 %) and 19 patients (57.6 %), respectively. Total resection was achieved in 23 patients (69.7 %) while subtotal resection was done in ten patients (30.3 %). Cavernoma and optic nerve sheath meningioma were the most common histologic variants, which were found in 11 (33.3 %) and 10 (30.3 %) patients, respectively. In the long-term follow-up, 54.5 % of the patients showed total ophthalmologic improvement, 9.1 % showed partial improvement, 21.2 % demonstrated unchanged ophthalmologic status, and 15.2 % showed worse ophthalmologic outcome. Transcranial approach for the treatment of intraorbital intraconal tumors is an effective approach for the management of these pathologies. The effectiveness is clearly demonstrated by the clinical results and outcomes of these patients' groups.
