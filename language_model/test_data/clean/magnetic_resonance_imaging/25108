Two cases of superficial siderosis of the brain and spinal cord with cochleovestibular and cerebellar symptoms are diagnosed on brain and spinal MRI scans. Low signal intensity lines are noted on the surface of the brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord and within the interhemispheric and sylvian fissures. In one case, no brain or vascular malformation is identified; in the second case, two cavernous angiomas are noted on the MRI study. 3D CISS may visualize thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve.
