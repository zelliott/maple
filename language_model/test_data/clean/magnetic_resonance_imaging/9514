Intraluminal thrombus (ILT) is known to influence the natural history of abdominal aortic aneurysms, and its effect on the arterial wall may predict the risks of rupture. The main features of ILT believed to be associated with aneurysm growth and increased rupture risk are size; presence of fissures, dissections, or calcifications in the ILT; and inhomogeneity in its internal structure. Modern imaging allows for detailed depiction of the ILT. This review describes the techniques, findings, clinical implications, advantages, and disadvantages of imaging the ILT by ultrasound, contrast-enhanced computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.
