THORACIC PAINFUL SYNDROME: Penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcers represent a condition in which an atherosclerotic plaque ulcerates and disrupts the internal elastic lamina, allowing intramural hematoma formation into the aortic media. Recently individualized as an entity from all vascular thoracic painful syndromes, they affect preponderantly the elderly patients with a medical hypertensive and atherosclerotic history and with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. The descending thoracic aorta is most frequently involved.

Computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging tend to replace aortography in providing an accurate diagnosis of the ulceration and of its parietal extent. Moreover, they allow the discrimination with aortic dissection or with intramural hematoma without intimal rupture which outcome and treatment should differ.

In the absence of complication, progressive aneurysmal dilatation at the level of the ulcer is a rule. Pseudoaneurysms formation, embolization, and acute transmural aortic rupture can however occur and may justify, in selected cases, a preventive or curative surgical treatment. STENT-GRAFTING: Endovascular stent-grafting techniques may appear as a safe and effective less invasive choice in high-risk patients with suitable anatomical conditions.
