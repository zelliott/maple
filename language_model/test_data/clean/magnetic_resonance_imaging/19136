An 18-year-old female consulted a clinic complaining of pollakisuria and urinary incontinence. She was referred to our department for operation under the diagnosis of vesicovaginal fistula due to a vaginal foreign body confirmed by intravenous pyelography and cystoscopic examination. About 7 months earlier, she inserted a hair spray can into the vagina but could not remove its cap. The vaginal foreign body was transvaginally removed. After 2 months, transabdominal repair of the vesicovaginal fistula was performed. After operation, dysuria and urinary incontinence were not observed. Few cases of vesicovaginal fistula due to a foreign body in the vagina have been reported, and there have been only 6 reported cases in Japan including ours.
