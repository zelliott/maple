A 37-year-old male with a history of palpitations and ventricular tachycardia was diagnosed with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy on the basis of clinical assessment, electrocardiography and echocardiography. Over the following 3 years the patient progressed to end-stage heart failure and eventually underwent heart transplantation. Histological analysis of the explanted heart revealed the presence of numerous noncaseating granulomas.

Electrocardiography, echocardiography, 24 h Holter monitoring, cardiac MRI, coronary angiography, endomyocardial biopsy, exercise testing, electrophysiological study, laboratory examinations and histological examination of the explanted heart.

Cardiac sarcoidosis.

Immunosupressive and corticosteroid therapy. Routine endomyocardial biopsy is planned.
