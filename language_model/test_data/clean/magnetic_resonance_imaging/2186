A detailed quality assurance (QA) program is essential for high precision single dose irradiations. The accuracy of stereotactic radiosurgery is limited by the errors of each step in the chain for optimal treatment beginning with the diagnostic imaging and target localization leading to the dose planning and ending up with the treatment of the patient. Two main goals were followed on the way to finding a concept for a suitable and sufficient quality assurance routine. First, the chain of items in terms of a complete patient simulation should be followed and second, the stereotactic MR image data should be verified against a reference in our case stereotactic radiographic projection images. Target point verifications were performed using the so-called, unknown target method based on MRI, CT, and stereotactic projection images. A marked radiochromic film, embedded between inserts of the phantom is fixed parallel to either the xy or the xz plane of the stereotactic coordinate system. After imaging and planning, the phantom is adjusted and irradiated. At the end, the film, dyed by the radiation field around the premarked cross, is evaluated. The measured distance between the unit center point (shadow) and the localization of the marked film leads to the deviation to be minimized. This is referred to as the displacement vector. The results, evaluating 170 system tests within 5 years. show that the mean displacement vector of the complete system is 0.48 mm +/-0.23 mm (mean+/- sd). Factors having a significant influence on the overall accuracy are associated with MRI parameters. Test results based on axial images (xy plane; 0.42 mm +/- 0.24 mm) are significantly superior to coronal images (xz plane; x = 0.60 mm +/- 0.02 mm). Further on, the 3D-mpr sequence (0.40 mm +/- 0.19 mm) is significantly superior to the T1 weighted SE sequences (0.66 mm +/- 0.24 mm). Given the high mechanical accuracy of the Leksell gamma knife, the most sensitive technical factor having an influence on the overall precision of radiosurgery is the MRI study. However, using the appropriate imaging sequences and parameters the dislocation error inferred by MRI can be kept very low and restricted to the rare patient inherent distortion factors. With these precautions in mind, MRI is recommended as the imaging method of choice in radiosurgery.
