A surgically confirmed solitary primary liver carcinoid tumour is described. MR imaging demonstrated a low signal intensity mass on T1-weighted images, a low signal intensity mass with small area of higher intensity on fat saturation T1-weighted images, and heterogeneous high signal intensity mass on T2-weighted images. The fibrous capsule and septa were demonstrated as low signal intensity bands on both proton- and T2-weighted images.
