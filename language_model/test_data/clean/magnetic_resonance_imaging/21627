We present a fast MRI technique sensitized to microscopic susceptibility effects. The method combines elements of echo-shifted gradient-recalled MR imaging (TE > TR) with the acquisition of multiple k-space lines within a single TR-period. The sequence results in a much reduced imaging time as compared with conventional gradient-echo MRI methods. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated for susceptibility bolus tracking in the cat brain using an imaging time of 153 ms. The relative cerebral blood volume maps created with this method are comparable with those obtained with conventional methods.
