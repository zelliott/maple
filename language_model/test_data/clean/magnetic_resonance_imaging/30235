To introduce several navigation systems in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and to investigate the application of navigation systems for the improvement in reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

The related literature was reviewed extensively, and the main current computer assisted surgery systems (OthoPilot system, Bone Morphing system, Fluoroscopic-based system, etc) for utilization in the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were analyzed.

The computer-assisted systems can enhance the accurate placement of tunnels. According to the anatomical and isometric parameters, graft impingement on the intercondylar notch could be avoided, and individual ideal implantation using 3D visualization localisers was achieved.

It is possible that computer-assisted systems will enable surgeons to better acquire the accuracy and reliability of the various operative techniques, to meet the demand of surgeon's surgical optimisation and to improve the clinical results.
