Intramuscular myxoma (IMM) is an uncommon benign tumor that presents as a slow-growing, deep-seated mass confined to the skeletal muscle. Histologically, these lesions most resemble umbilical cord tissue. They are generally found in the proximal thigh, gluteal region, or shoulder girdle and are exceedingly rare neck masses in the pediatric population. These tumors most often present as painless, deep-seated intramuscular masses that may exhibit symptoms of compression of surrounding structures.(1) I report a case of a 22-month-old girl with an IMM in the posterior cervical triangle.
