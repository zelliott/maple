This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of adenosine-stress dual-energy myocardial computed tomography perfusion (DECTP) imaging using 128-slice dual-source computed tomography (CT) for the detection of myocardial perfusion defects in comparison with stress-perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

This prospective study included 50 patients (mean age, 66 [9] years; 64% men) with suspected coronary artery disease who underwent adenosine-stress DECTP using 128-slice dual-source CT as well as adenosine-stress cardiac MRI using a 1.5-T scanner. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy in detecting myocardial perfusion defects were calculatedand compared with those of cardiac MRI.

The estimates of diagnostic accuracy in detecting myocardial perfusion defects using DECTP were as follows: sensitivity, 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67%-87%); specificity, 94% (95% CI, 92%-95%); positive predictive value, 53% (95% CI, 44%-63%); and negative predictive value, 98% (95% CI, 97%-99%). The results of DECTP imaging were positively correlated with those of cardiac MRI (r = 0.602, P < 0.001). Mean effective radiation doses for stress DECTP imaging and rest coronary CTA were 6.5 (2.2) and 4.9 (1.7) mSv, respectively.

Adenosine-stress DECTP imaging enables detection of myocardial ischemia. However, further technical developments are necessary to reduce artifacts and improve the sensitivity of DECTP.
