To evaluate the clinical efficacy of gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we reviewed the results of clinical phase II and III trials in Japan. Gd-BOPTA was administered at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg to 139 patients who were suspected to have HCC. Dynamic phase images [breath-hold T1-weighted gradient echo (GRE)], spin-echo (SE) images obtained within 10 minutes of injection, and delayed breath-hold GRE images obtained 40-120 minutes after injection were evaluated. All post-contrast images were compared with T1- and T2-weighted pre-contrast images. The contrast efficacy for the dynamic study was classified as ( ) or (++) in 92.1% (128/139), in 43.1% (59/137) with SE within 10 minutes of injection, and in 43.2% (60/139) with breath-hold GRE at delayed phase. The increase in lesion-liver contrast-to-noise ratio was best at the arterial phase of dynamic breath-hold GRE. Liver signal-to-noise ratio showed a mean 52.3% increase in delayed phase. Additional information at delayed phase compared with images acquired within 10 minutes of injection (including the dynamic study) was classified as ( ) or (++) in 28.1% (39/139). With regard to safety, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 5.0% (7/141) of the patients who were suspected to have HCC, all of whom recovered within 12 hours without any sequelae. No clinically important changes were observed in the blood and urine laboratory tests. It was concluded that Gd-BOPTA was well tolerated and effective in both dynamic study and delayed static imaging for the diagnosis of HCC.
