CT and MR revealed a case of nasopharyngeal atresia, a malformation in which the soft palate is not formed, and the hard palate extends posteriorly to fuse with the anterior surface of the clivus, resulting in complete isolation of the nasal and oral cavities and the absence of a nasopharynx. We believe this rare anomaly results from abnormal persistence of the embryologic bucconasal plate and/or anomalous migration of the nasoseptal elements.
