The authors present herein 2 extramedullary orbital granulocytic sarcoma (GS) cases without bone marrow involvement in view of their rarity and also to reevaluate the treatment approach in this disease. Seven days of high-dose methyl prednisolone (HDMP) treatment (3 days 30 mg/kg/day and 4 days 20 mg/kg/day) was administered initially, and subsequently Acute Myeloid Leukaemia-Berlin Frankfurt MÃ¼nster (AML-BFM) 2004 treatment protocol was continued for 2 cases. Eye findings of the cases resolved considerably with HDMP treatment. They have still been under systemic chemotherapy without any complication for 1 year. Thus, early diagnosis and AML-targeted intensive chemotherapy improve the prognosis of GS even if there is no bone marrow involvement.
