The MR and pathologic findings of a case of sclerosing stromal tumor (SST) are presented. MR findings reflecting pathological features of SST include pseudolobulation, which consists of low-intensity nodules set against high-intensity stroma on T2-weighted images, and striking enhancement on postcontrast images.
