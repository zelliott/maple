This retrospective study was made to illustrate the rare occurrence of neurologic deficits resulting from intervertebral disc calcification (IDC) in a child. Most authors agree that juvenile IDC is usually a benign, self-limiting disease with excellent prognosis. The symptoms subside spontaneously in 95% of patients. Conservative treatment is therefore usually sufficient. Reviewing the English-speaking literature, only two further cases of operated juvenile IDC with myelopathy have been published. In the current report, we describe a case of permanent thoracic myelopathy resulting from juvenile IDC treated by urgent decompressive thoracic laminectomy. At the 3-year follow-up examination, the patient had not recovered fully. Persisting deficits in motor and sensory function were observed.
