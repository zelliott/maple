To analyze the association between arachnoid cysts and subdural hygromas.

We reviewed five cases of arachnoid cysts that ruptured, producing acute subdural hygromas. The surgical management and diagnostic methods used are assessed.

Five male patients ranging in age from 6 to 25 years sustained the rupture of arachnoid cysts, which produced acute subdural hygromas. Four of the patients had incurred blunt head trauma. All patients presented with symptoms referable to intracranial hypertension. The pathognomonic features of a middle fossa arachnoid cyst (MFAC) were noted on the computed tomographic scans and/or magnetic resonance images of each patient. The hygroma exerted mass effect on the ipsilateral hemisphere and was noted to be under significant pressure at the time of surgical intervention in each case. Two of the five cases are unique in the literature. In one, a coexisting quadrigeminal cyst ruptured, producing a subdural hygroma ipsilateral to the MFAC and dilating the basal cisterns. In the other, the MFAC ruptured into the basal cisterns as well as into the subdural space. The MFAC in each of the remaining three patients ruptured into the subdural space alone. All patients were treated with drainage of the subdural space. In the two patients in whom the basal cisterns were involved, both the hygromas and the MFACs failed to change significantly in size. The hygromas resolved completely and the MFACs decreased in size considerably in the three patients without cisternal involvement.

The rupture of an arachnoid cyst can produce a subdural hygroma and intracranial hypertension. The latter mandates emergent drainage of the subdural space. In patients in whom the basal cisterns are not dilated by cyst rupture, both the MFACs and hygromas resolve after subdural drainage.
