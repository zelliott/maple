Conventionally, recognition of bile duct injuries after laparoscopic cholecystectomy largely relies on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC). However, these invasive procedures are not without risk. Preliminary experience with use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to identify these injuries is reported.

The medical records of five patients who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy and had suspected major bile duct injuries were reviewed. All five patients underwent MRCP, followed by conventional cholangiography: either ERCP or PTC, or both. The findings of MRCP and conventional cholangiography were compared.

Four patients had proven bile duct injuries. The remaining patient had gallstones dislodged into the common bile duct (CBD) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which presented as transient jaundice mimicking a bile duct injury. The MRCP images were of higher diagnostic value than conventional cholangiographic images in four patients with frank bile duct injury. For these patients, ERCP showed only the cut-off sign of the CBD, and PTC was needed to visualize the upper biliary system. MRCP, however, demonstrated the entire biliary system proximal and distal to the amputated or stenotic sites simultaneously. In the remaining patient with dislodged gallstones, the two techniques yielded similar diagnostic information.

This preliminary study suggests that MRCP is an ideal diagnostic test whenever bile duct injury following laparoscopic cholecystectomy is suspected.
