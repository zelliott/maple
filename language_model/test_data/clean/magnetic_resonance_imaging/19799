Paraglenoid glenohumeral cysts can be observed in 2-4% of the general population, particularly in men during the third and fourth decade. On average, these cysts measure 10-20 mm in diameter and are located preferentially on the posterosuperior aspect of the glenoid. An articular origin (rim injury) is generally accepted. The pathogenesis is similar to that of meniscal cysts. Depending on the exact localization, there is generally little clinical expression. The most frequent complication involves compression of the suprascapular nerve leading to suffering of the supra and/or infraspinatus. Amyotrophy can occur without clinical expression. An attentive examination is necessary to identify the cyst. EMG is often falsely negative. MRI is currently gold standard diagnostic tool but will probably be improved with arthro-MRI. Ultrasonography and computed tomography can visualize with difficulty small cysts located very close to the bone. The best treatment is arthroscopy which enables complete cure (emptying the cyst and resection or suture of the rim). We present a review of the pertinent literature together with a retrospective series of six cases of paraglenoid glenohumeral ganglion cysts.
