Imaging of salivary gland tumours is a major challenge for radiologists due to the great variety of differential diagnoses. This article gives a short overview on the anatomy of the salivary glands, the epidemiology of salivary gland tumours as well as the clinical presentation and the different imaging modalities including new magnetic resonance techniques such as diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy applied in the work-up of salivary gland masses. The imaging features of different tumour types and their differential diagnoses are also discussed. Finally, staging classification and treatment options are presented.
