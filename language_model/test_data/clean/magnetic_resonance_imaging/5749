Endobronchial lipoma is a rare benign bronchial tumour. A search should be carried out on submillimetre MDCT scan slices in patients presenting segmental or lobar collapse or recurrent pulmonary infection in the same bronchial territories. The authors report MDCT and MR imaging in a patient with endobronchial lipoma discovered on an MDCT scan.
