Imperfections in the slice profile of the adiabatic inversion induced by relaxation effects are shown to cause signal variations in pulsed arterial tagging schemes on the order of magnitude of perfusion changes, and result in gross errors in perfusion quantitation. Significant improvement can be made with minor modifications to the inversion pulse which facilitate the acquisition of quantitative, multislice perfusion images, as demonstrated in both a phantom and a normal human volunteer.
