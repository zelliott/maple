Rapid presentation event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied to macaque monkeys performing a symmetrically rewarded go/no-go task, to investigate neural correlate of response inhibition. Sensorimotor activation related to the task performance was observed predominantly in the hemisphere contralateral to the response forelimb. Furthermore, no-go dominant activation possibly related to response inhibition, was observed in the ventral prefrontal cortex, in accordance with previous electrophysiological studies. These results show the feasibility of rapid presentation event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging in behaving monkeys.
