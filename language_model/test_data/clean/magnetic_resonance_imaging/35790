We assessed the ability of magnetic resonance, a recently introduced imaging technique, to demonstrate the maternal anatomy in obstetrics. The signal intensity of different maternal tissues using T1 and T2 weighted sequences was examined. The bony pelvis is depicted with sufficient clarity to provide an alternative to conventional X-ray pelvimetry. The placenta and cervix have a distinctive appearance facilitating the diagnosis of placenta praevia. The unique demonstration of cervical morphology will offer the potential for investigation into the ill-understood conditions of cervical dystocia and cervical incompetence.
