Two cases of Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm with unusual complications are presented. Left main stem compression from an expanding Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm usually carries a poor prognosis and aggressive surgical management has been proposed. We describe a case with stable myocardial ischemia over four months from left main stem compression. Surgical repair of Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is usually curative, but our second case demonstrates the pitfalls of inadequate surgical management.
