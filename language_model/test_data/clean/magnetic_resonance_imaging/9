Increased signal intensity (ISI) in the spinal cord on T2-weighted MR images has been reported in some previous researches, however no study focused on the position of the ISI in the spinal cord and its potential value. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between ISI position and the outcome of surgical treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) patients.

A retrospective study was conducted. Pre- and post-operative clinical status was evaluated by modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score. ISI was evaluated according to the T2-weighted sequences. The JOA score and the recovery ratios among patients with ISI in gray matter (group A), in both gray and white matter (group B), and ISI-negative group were compared.

Totally 64 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Preoperative JOA score of ISI positive and negative group had significant difference, but the recovery ratios had no significant difference (the recovery ratios of the two groups in week 1, week 26, and week 104 were (21.54 +/- 14.65)%, (50.56 +/- 14.76)%, (59.23 +/- 13.08)% and (20.25 +/- 14.32)%, (54.46 +/- 23.16)% and (61.26 +/- 29.4)%, respectively; P > 0.05). The recovery ratios of negative group and group A in week 104 were superior to group B (the recovery ratios of negative group, group A, and group B in week 104 were (61.26 +/- 29.49)%, (65.35 +/- 11.36)%, and (50.33 +/- 10.20)%, respectively; P < 0.05).

Patients with ISI in the gray matter alone on T2-weighted MR images did not have significantly different surgical outcomes compared with those without ISI. Patients with ISI in both gray and white matter had surgical outcomes that were worse than those without ISI.
