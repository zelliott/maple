Fibrous dysplasia is an uncommon benign bone disorder of unknown origin. It rarely affects the temporal bone. We report a case of fibrous dysplasia of the temporal bone with cholesteatoma in the external auditory canal, the first complaint of which was left otorrhea. Fibrous dysplasia invaded the external ear canal, stenosis of which causes a cholesteatoma. Mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty, and meatoplasty were performed. We discuss the characteristics of this condition, its differential diagnosis and its treatment.
