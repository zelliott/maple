To evaluate the prognostic value of tumor diameter/volume and pelvic node status assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with uterine cervical cancer treated with radiation therapy.

Forty-four patients with intact uterine cervical squamous carcinoma treated with a combination of external irradiation and high-dose-rate intracavitary therapy were analyzed. Actuarial disease-free survival (DFS), pelvic control rate (PC), and distant metastasis-free rate (DMF) were analyzed by tumor diameter, volume, and pelvic node status assessed by pretreatment MRI.

Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (RL) tumor diameter significantly affected DFS. The 2-year DFS was 74% for patients with < 40 mm in AP diameter tumor, and 24% for > or = 40 mm tumor (p = 0.02). Whereas PC was not influenced, DMF was significantly affected by AP tumor diameter. Tumor volume did not significantly affect any endpoints. Patients with enlarged pelvic nodes had significantly poorer outcome compared to those with none on PC, DMF, and DFS. The 2-year DFS was 78% for node-negative, and 10% for node-positive patients (p = 0.0001).

AP tumor diameter and pelvic lymph node status assessed by MRI were the significant prognostic factors in uterine cervical cancer treated with irradiation. Prognostic value of tumor volume should be reassessed prospectively with an appropriate imaging technique. AP tumor diameter predominantly affected the incidence of distant metastasis, and lymph node status affected both pelvic control and distant metastasis.
