Recurrent meningitis in children, although rare, results in an increased risk of acute complications and long-term morbidity. We did a retrospective case series to analyze the clinical presentation, predisposing factors, treatment and outcome of children with recurrent meningitis admitted at Shifa International hospital, Islamabad. All children presenting with recurrent meningitis from December 2006 to May 2011 were included in the study. There were a total of 8 children with a mean age of 6 +/- 2.97 years (2-10 years). Majority (87%) were males. There was an average of 4 +/- 4.92 (2-9) episodes of meningitis in each patient. Fever with vomiting was the most common (87%) presenting symptom, followed by seizures (62%) and headache (50%). The underlying etiology was confirmed on CSF analysis, computed tomography scan (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). About half of them had history of head trauma. All responded to antibiotics and six needed surgery. On follow up, 2 (25%) children had some neurological impairment.
