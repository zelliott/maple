Ten consecutive patients with surgically proven beta-islet cell tumors, strongly suspected clinically because of positive laboratory findings, were studied by MRI at 0.5 T. Results were correlated with CT and angiography. MRI detected all 10 insulinomas, with the location confirmed at surgery. Lesion size was < 1 cm in three cases, between 1 and 2 cm in five cases, and between 2 and 3 cm in two cases. A false-negative diagnosis was obtained with CT in 6 of 10 and with angiography in 3 of 10 cases. Our results suggest that if motion artifact can be controlled or reduced, MRI can be employed to localize insulinomas in patients with positive clinical and laboratory findings.
