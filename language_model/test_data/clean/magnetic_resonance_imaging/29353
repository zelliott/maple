We describe the use of liquid helium-cooled (4.2 K) gradiometer coils and a DC superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) preamplifier to improve the SNR of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 0.01 T. Gradiometer windings are used both to reduce lossy interactions with the MRI system's room temperature magnet and gradient coils and also to reject interference from more distant sources, which reduces the need for RF shielding. We have tested both axial and planar (figure-of-eight) gradiometer configurations. The figure-of-eight gradiometer has a more rapid fall-off in sensitivity with increasing distance from its windings than the axial gradiometer, but this is compensated for by reduced lossy interactions and improved interference rejection. We have used the system to image the human arm.
