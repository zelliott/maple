Meningiomas of the anterior cranial fossa frequently present with impaired visual function. Recognition of this entity in the differential diagnosis of painless, progressive, and asymmetric optic neuropathy is important since reversal of visual loss is possible given timely surgical excision of the tumour.

A 76-year-old man presented with no perception of light in his right eye and a reduced visual acuity of 20/60 in his left eye with a markedly constricted visual field. His visual deterioration had progressed over the previous three months and was not associated with headache. Ophthalmoscopy showed normal optic discs. MRI scanning showed a large frontal basal meningioma, which was subsequently resected.

The patient noticed an immediate improvement in his vision in his right eye. Visual acuity in his right eye improved to 20/50 at six weeks postoperatively and to 20/25 at five months, with corresponding improvement of the visual field.

Complete monocular blindness due to tumour compressing or distorting the anterior visual pathways does not preclude recovery following timely decompressive surgery, especially when the appearance of the optic disc is normal.
