Six patients admitted to the Department of Pediatric Neurology at Hacettepe University Children's Hospital between 1992 and 1997 with a clinical diagnosis of Rasmussen encephalitis received surgical treatment for their intractable epilepsy. MRI, SPECT and WADA tests were performed in patients with an epileptic focus demonstrated on routine or long-term video EEG monitoring. Viral studies using the PCR methodology were performed in cases with histopathological evidence of Rasmussen encephalitis. The ages of these patients ranged between 7 and 16 years, and the mean age at onset of seizures was 7.1+/-2.2 years. In four patients seizures presented as epilepsia partialis continua and were refractory to anticonvulsive drug therapy. In three cases intravenous immunoglobulin therapy yielded temporary and partial improvement in seizure control. The mean presurgical follow-up duration was 2.04+1.74 years, and early surgical intervention for epilepsy was performed in one case. The surgical approach selected for the treatment of epilepsy was resective surgery with electrocorticography. The mean postoperative follow-up duration was 32.3+17.2 months. Seizures were fully controlled in one patient, in whom surgery was performed 3 months after the seizures first started. Early surgical intervention may provide histopathological evidence for diagnosis as well as effective seizure control.
