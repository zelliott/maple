To prospectively evaluate whether the descriptors of lesion features and the diagnostic criteria that have been established for breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in female patients may be used for differential diagnosis with breast MR imaging in male patients as well.

The study design was approved by the institutional review board; all patients gave informed consent. The Institutional Review Board and informed consent information applied to the prospective and any retrospective component of the study. Seventeen consecutive male patients (mean age, 53 years +/- 14) were referred for imaging of a palpable breast mass. In addition to mammography and high-frequency breast ultrasonography, patients underwent dynamic breast MR imaging in a prone position with a dedicated double-breast surface coil. The standardized protocol consisted of a T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequence followed by a dynamic series. Findings were recorded by using the terminology and descriptors and by evaluating the diagnostic criteria (related to morphology and enhancement kinetics) that have been developed for breast MR imaging in female patients. Validation was achieved at biopsy (nine patients) or follow-up with clinical examination and conventional imaging (eight patients). Because of the small size of the patient cohort, statistical significance was not tested.

A total of 24 breast abnormalities were diagnosed. Three patients had invasive breast cancer (five tumors), 11 had gynecomastia (six unilateral, five bilateral), two had pseudogynecomastia, and one had a benign solid tumor (angiolipoma). All malignant tumors appeared as irregular masses with heterogeneous internal architecture or rim enhancement and showed rapid initial enhancement (mean value, 137% +/- 23) followed by a washout time course (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] category 5). Diffuse and nodular gynecomastia showed slow initial and persistent enhancement with normal-appearing parenchymal architecture (BI-RADS category 2; 15 of 16 breasts in 10 of 11 patients). In one patient with biopsy-proved bilateral gynecomastia, an area with segmental enhancement was classified as suspicious for ductal carcinoma in situ. Pseudogynecomastia did not enhance at all. The angiolipoma showed benign morphologic features and slow initial and persistent enhancement (BI-RADS category 2).

In the small study cohort, the MR imaging features of benign breast diseases and breast cancers in male patients seemed to be comparable to those seen in female patients.
