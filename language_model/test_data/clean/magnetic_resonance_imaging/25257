A case is presented of a 43-year-old man with bilateral lesions of the inferior colliculus (IC) due to central nervous system lymphoma. Our patient was found to have relatively normal pure-tone averages with severely reduced bilateral word recognition scores. This case illustrates that the presentation of a partial bilateral IC lesion may be of severely reduced word recognition accompanied by nearly normal pure-tone hearing.
