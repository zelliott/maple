Normal anatomy of the maxillofacial regions is clearly shown by both CT and MRI. The use of dental devices causes deterioration in CT and MRI of the tongue and oral floor. A high-resolution bone window display is highly useful in examining bony structures. Contrast CT is useful in diagnosis of tumorous, inflammatory, and vascular lesions. MRI shows the extensions of tumors more clearly than CT, and MRI enhanced with Gd-DTPA is very useful in determining tumor extensions into bony structures. Both CT and MRI should be used in diagnosis of maxillofacial lesions.
