MRI of ten hip joints in nine patients with total hip replacement and reconstruction of the acetabulum with autologous bone grafts, were reviewed. The viability of inserted bone grafts was clearly documented by MRI. Characteristic differences in signal intensity between autologous and homologous bone grafts are discussed. Despite extended metallic artifacts in the operated region, sufficient diagnostic information was available in most cases. No side effects were reported.
