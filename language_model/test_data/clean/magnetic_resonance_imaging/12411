Neuroimaging group analyses are used to compare the intersubject variability observed in brain organization with behavioural or genetic variables and to assess risks factors of brain diseases. The lack of stability and of sensitivity of current voxel-based analysis schemes may however lead to non-reproducible results. A new approach is introduced to overcome the limitations of standard methods, in which active voxels are detected according to a consensus on several random parcellations of the brain images, while a permutation test controls the false positive risk. Both on syntetic and real data, this approach shows higher sensitivity, better recovery and higher reproducibility than standard methods and succeeds in detecting a significant association in an imaging-genetic study between a genetic variant next to the COMT gene and a region in the left thalamus on a functional magnetic resonance imaging contrast.
