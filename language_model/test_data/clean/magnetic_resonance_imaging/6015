Demyelination is a neurologic disease, usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptomatology and radiologic studies. Rarely, both may be deceiving and masquerading a neoplastic lesion or vice versa.

In the present communication, we describe 2 cases with similar clinical profiles and radiologic pictures, but which turn out to be contrasting pathologic diagnoses.

We emphasize on histopathologic proof before initiating definitive therapy.
