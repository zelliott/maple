Capnocytophaga canimorsus has been recognized as an opportunistic pathogen causing systemic infections in immunocompromised individuals. It is part of the normal oral flora of the dog, and can be responsible for localized wound infections in humans in consequence of bites. This microorganism causes also septicemia, meningitis, endocarditis, ocular infections and rarely brain abscess. We describe the case of an immunocompetent 28-year-old male with temporal brain abscess from Capnocytophaga canimorsus secondary to dog's bite.
