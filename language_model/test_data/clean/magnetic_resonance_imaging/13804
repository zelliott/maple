Continual improvements in MR imaging, technology and MR imaging-compatible monitoring and fixation devices have allowed the incorporation of this relatively new imaging modality into standard algorithms for cervical spine trauma assessment. The ability of MR imaging to define the type of spinal cord injury, the cause and severity of spinal cord compression, and the stability of the spinal column is unmatched. The heavy reliance of the spinal surgeon on MR imaging for decisions regarding the type of therapy, the timing, the approach of surgical intervention, and for predicting patient outcome attests to the usefulness of this modality.
