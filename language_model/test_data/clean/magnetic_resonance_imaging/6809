The influence of radiofrequency (RF) spin-lock pulse on the laminar appearance of articular cartilage in MR images was investigated. Spin-lock MRI experiments were performed on bovine cartilage plugs on a 4.7 Tesla small-bore MRI scanner, and on human knee cartilage in vivo on a 1.5 Tesla clinical scanner. When the normal to the surface of cartilage was parallel to B0, a typical laminar appearance was exhibited in T2-weighted images of cartilage plugs, but was absent in T1rho-weighted images of the same plugs. At the "magic angle" orientation (when the normal to the surface of cartilage was 54.7 degrees with respect to B0), neither the T2 nor the T1rho images demonstrated laminae. At the same time, T1rho values were greater than T2 at both orientations throughout the cartilage. T1rho dispersion (i.e., the dependence of the relaxation rate on the spin-lock frequency omega1) was observed, which reached a steady-state value of close to 2 kHz in both parallel and magic-angle orientations. These results suggest that residual dipolar interaction from motionally-restricted water and relaxation processes, such as chemical exchange, contribute to T1rho dispersion in cartilage. Further, one can reduce the laminar appearance in human articular cartilage by applying spin-lock RF pulses, which may lead to a more accurate diagnosis of degenerative changes in cartilage.
