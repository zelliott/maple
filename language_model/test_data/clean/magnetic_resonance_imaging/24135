Our objective is to present the MR appearance of breast paraffinoma, a late complication of breast augmentation by liquid paraffin wax, and to correlate this appearance with the histopathologic findings that were available for three of the 11 breasts we studied.

Breast paraffinomas have a characteristic MR appearance that correlates well with histopathologic findings. With MR imaging, we were able to visualize the location and extent of the paraffinoma, best seen on the fat-suppression sequence, and to evaluate the surrounding fibroglandular breast tissue.
