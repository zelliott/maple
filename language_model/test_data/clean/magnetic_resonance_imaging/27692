Under 980â€…nm near-infrared (NIR) excitation, upconversion luminescent (UCL) emission of GdF(3):Yb,Er upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) synthesized by a simple and green hydrothermal process can be tuned from yellow to red by varying the concentration of dopant Li(+) ions. A possible mechanism for enhanced red upconverted radiation is proposed. A layer of silica was coated onto the surface of GdF(3):Yb,Er,Li UCNPs to improve their biocompatibility. The silica-coated GdF(3):Yb,Er,Li UCNPs show great advantages in cell labeling and in vivo optical imaging. Moreover, GdF(3) UCNPs also exhibited a positive contrast effect in T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These results suggest that the GdF(3) UCNPs could act as dual-modality biolabels for optical imaging and MRI.
