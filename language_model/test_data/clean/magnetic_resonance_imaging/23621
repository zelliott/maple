Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can cause serious infection among hospitalised patients. The emergence of community acquired strains of MRSA (CA-MRSA) increases the potential exposure of newborns. The high incidence of reported meningitis in neonates in large CA-MRSA outbreaks suggests increased virulence in the neonatal population. The authors describe a case of severe meningitis due to MRSA in a previously healthy neonate and include findings from amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and MRI.
