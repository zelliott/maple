A series of low-field magnetic resonance images of the normal canine middle and inner ear are presented to serve as a reference. A completely balanced steady-state gradient echo pulse sequence with a slice thickness of 0.9 mm can be used to acquire images of the relevant structures within and neighboring the inner ear. These were the cochlear duct, semicircular ducts, vestibule, facial and vestibulocochlear nerves, as well as the temporal sinus. Within the middle ear, no applied sequence was able to allow identification of the auditory ossicles or the tympanic membrane.
