Isolated sphenoid sinusitis is a rare disorder. There are some difficulties in its diagnosis and the first presentation of this disorder might be with complications. These complications are essentially due to the anatomical location of the sinus and its proximity to the intra-cranial and orbital contents, to which infection may easily spread. In this paper, we report a case of isolated sphenoid sinusitis in a 12-year-old girl who was presented with unilateral VIth nerve palsy. She was initially treated with parenteral antibiotherapy, the abducens nerve palsy recovered but as sphenoiditis persisted she underwent an endoscopic sphenoidotomy. We discuss the clinical features, the diagnostic tools, and the treatment options for this entity.
