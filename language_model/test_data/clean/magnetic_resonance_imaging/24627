We describe a case of a 16-year-old boy presented with rapidly progressive right foot drop without any predisposing illness or antecedent events. Nerve conduction study was non-contributory and needle electromyography localised proximal lesion which prompted spine neuroimaging. MRI of whole spine and brain revealed Chiari I malformation along with holocord syringomyelia. The patient underwent suboccipital craniectomy and C1 laminectomy with duroplasty decompressing the foramen magnum. He responded to surgical intervention without further complications.
