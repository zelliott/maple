Liver transplantation (Tx) has become an alternative treatment of malignant childhood liver tumors, and the importance of careful pretransplantation evaluation has been emphasized. Anti-alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) imaging has been suggested for evaluation of adult patients with AFP-positive tumors.

Antibody imaging utilizing Tc-99 m-labeled monoclonal anti-AFP Fab' fragments was used to demonstrate pathologic uptake in hepatoblastoma (HB).

Radical operation or liver Tx was not possible after four cycles of chemotherapy in a child with HB because of a single extrahepatic metastasis. Chemotherapy was continued, and reevaluation with anti-AFP imaging demonstrated a pathologic uptake only in the liver. Subsequently, a right liver lobe resection was performed. Along with a new rise in serum AFP, repeated anti-AFP imaging revealed active liver tumor but no metastases. A liver Tx was performed, and the child is well with a normal serum AFP level 18 months after the operation.

This is the first case of pediatric HB in which anti-AFP imaging has been successfully used for patient management.
