Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly used worldwide in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. With advances in multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) technology, such as the use of dynamic contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences, observational studies have evaluated the utility for mpMRI in the continuum of prostate cancer management, from improving the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer, to planning radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy and the early detection of local recurrence. Furthermore, the potential for advanced imaging to reduce the burden of routine serial prostate needle biopsies for men on active surveillance is a promising area of research. MRI technology continues to evolve, and the potential applications in the management of prostate cancer care will require well-designed multi-institutional prospective clinical trials and rigorous efforts to standardize reporting and improve dissemination of expertise across institutions.
