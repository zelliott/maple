A 3-year-old girl presented with a dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor in the right cingulate gyrus manifesting as epilepsy refractory to anticonvulsant medication. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic tumor in the right cingulate gyrus. The tumor was removed under intraoperative electrocorticography guidance. Abnormal spikes recorded adjacent to the tumor disappeared immediately after total removal. Histological examination showed a multinodular, multicystic structure, satisfying the criteria for the diagnosis of dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor. She has remained seizure-free for more than 4 years without complications. In this case, intraoperative electrocorticography was very useful to identify the possible focus and prevent unnecessary resection of the adjacent tissue. Total removal of the tumor resulted in a dramatic reduction of seizure activity.
