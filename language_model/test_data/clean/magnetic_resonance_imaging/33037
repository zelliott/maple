The co-existence of pituitary adenomas (PA) and carotid artery aneurysms has been described and may be particularly frequent in acromegaly. The co-occurrence of an intracranial aneurysm in the setting of a PA presents significant risk to the patient, particularly when the aneurysm is within or near the operative field. We describe a 48-year-old, right-handed female patient with a large skull base lesion who had a left cavernous carotid artery aneurysm detected on her preoperative imaging studies. This patient was managed using a staged approach. She first underwent endovascular stent-assisted coiling of the aneurysm followed, six months later, by resection of the tumor via an expanded endonasal endoscopic approach. Histopathological analysis revealed a pituitary macroadenoma with neuronal metaplasia. Angiographic embolization followed by an expanded endonasal endoscopic approach is a safe and effective treatment for such lesions. Vascular imaging studies and a low index for suspicion are required for preoperative identification of such complex situations.
