Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is highly successful for treating neuropathic pain but its effect is limited for central origin pain caused by cord injury. The authors describe a case in which pain was successfully controlled by SCS implantation in a patient with intractable chronic neuropathic pain after T5 meningioma removal. The authors tried lead insertion over the T5 level passing through postoperative adhesions to produce adequate stimulation to the patient's painful areas fully enough without any complications. This case showed good response to SCS even though it was a central type of neuropathic pain by spinal cord injury.
