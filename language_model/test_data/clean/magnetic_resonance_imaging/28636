We investigated the role of new MR Imaging techniques for the diagnosis, characterization and staging of hepatic hydatid disease. We examined 21 patients (30 hydatid cysts), 7 men and 14 women, ranging in age 26 to 74 years, with known hydatid disease. MR examinations were carried out on a 0.5T superconductive magnet (Philips Gyroscan T5, Philips Medical System) with the following imaging protocol: T1w (TR/TE/NEX: 300/10/4) SE, T2w (TR/TE/NEX: 3000/120/6) TSE and fat suppressed (SPIR technique) T2w (TR/TE/NEX: 3000/120/6) sequences. MR Angiography examinations were performed with 2D Time of Flight sequences (TR = 33 ms; TE = 6.9 ms; flip angle = 60 degrees; slice thickness = 4.0 mm with 2.0 mm overlapping; matrix = 256 x 256; number of slices = 45-50; acquisition time = 4 min 19 s), while MR cholangiography was performed with 3D, fat suppressed (SPIR) Turbo Spin-echo (TSE) sequences (TR = 3000 ms, TE = 700 ms, ETL = 12, acq. time = 5 min 48 s). MRI correctly detected all the hydatid cysts on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Characterization was correct in all the cysts larger than 3 cm, where typical signs consistent with hydatid disease were detected. MRA images always showed the inferior vena cava and the splenoportal system. The portal vessels were demonstrated only up to the first branches. In 3 cases an extrinsic compression of the inferior vena cava was diagnosed. MRC, performed in 7 cases, showed normal main bile duct caliber in 6 cases, while in another case, where a cyst ruptured inside the bile ducts, the communication between the cyst and the bile ducts was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, MR Imaging is a valuable tool in the study of liver hydatid disease. Moreover, the availability of such new MR techniques as MRC and MRA, greatly improves the diagnostic role of MR imaging, especially when studying complications and before surgery.
