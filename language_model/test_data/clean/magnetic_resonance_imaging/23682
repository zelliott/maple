A 64-year-old female presented with a solitary brainstem abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography demonstrated the development and resolution of the brainstem abscess with an unusual and fluctuating clinical course over several months. Serial neuroimaging examinations are required to detect a brainstem abscess in the early stage to establish the optimum treatment.
