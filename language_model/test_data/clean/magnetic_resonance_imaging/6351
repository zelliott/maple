Several examination methods are now available for diagnosis of intrathoracic goiter; diagnosis of suspicion is made by conventional plain radiography of the thorax, clinical findings being often normal or non-characteristic. If the iodine scintigram shows accumulation in the tumor, we can be practically sure of the diagnosis of an intrathoracic goiter. In case of a negative iodine scan we can obtain pointers to the nature of the tissue via CT or MR, especially if a connection between cervical thyroid tissue and intrathoracic mass can be demonstrated. Furthermore, these two methods (CT and MR) enable exact determination of the extension of the goiter and show the topographical relation to the neighbouring organs or their displacement.
