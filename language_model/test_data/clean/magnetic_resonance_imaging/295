We present the case of a 76-year-old female with suspected Friedreich ataxia, in whom leakage and thrombosis of a percutaneously implanted left atrial appendage occluder (PLAATO) was observed 2 years after implantation. Because of late developing leakages and thrombi, regular transesophageal echocardiographic examinations should be carried out in patients with occluded left atrial appendages. In view of these complications and the potential important hemodynamic role of the left atrial appendage, the benefit of its occlusion is questionable, and the indications of PLAATO should be strongly reconsidered.
