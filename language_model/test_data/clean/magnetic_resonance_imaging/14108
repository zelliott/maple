Curvilinear reformatting of 3D MR imaging data sets was used to visualize the position of subdural strip and grid electrodes relative to the underlying cerebral cortex in patients with epilepsy who were undergoing invasive electroencephalographic recordings. The contour of the cortical surface was delineated interactively, and topographical relationships among surface gyration, cortical lesions, and subdural electrodes were investigated by using serial convex planes parallel to the cortical surface. Electrode contacts could be marked and their positions projected to underlying areas at different depths. This method is apt for routine purposes and allows electrode positions to be displayed with respect to cortical and subcortical regions of interest.
