We report the case of an acute optic neuromyelitis with rhabdomyolysis in a 34-year-old immunocompetent transsexual patient following a recent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The combination of optic neuropathy and myelopathy is recognized as Devic's syndrome. Clinical presentation was unusual as the recent CMV infection induced rhabdomyolysis and was the suspected trigger of neuromyelitis.
