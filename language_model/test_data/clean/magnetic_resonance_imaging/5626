Reconstructing auricular defects is a challenging task for facial reconstructive surgeons. Although autologous reconstruction is the first choice for reconstruction, there may be circumstances of inconvenience such as previously attempted surgery, radiotherapy, systemic conditions, or patient's wish. Auricular restorations with facial prosthesis have produced promising results, but there are still problems to be tackled for improved results. Rapid prototyping in the production of an auricular prosthesis uses the mirror image of contralateral ear and produces excellent forms, eliminating the subjective perception of the prosthodontist. Rapid prototyping also lowers the production costs by reducing the need for several sessions in the process of producing the prostheses. Between 2004 and 2007, 10 patients applied to our department with the absence of an ear on a single side. All patients were male, with an average age of 23.1 years. The etiology for the loss of the ear was mostly tumors, followed by congenital deformities and trauma, respectively. In this study, we present our application of rapid prototyping technique and report our case series of 10 patients, two of which are presented in detail.
