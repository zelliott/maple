A 24-year-old woman was admitted to our department for further examination of hypercalcemia, a high level of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) and a right parathyroid tumor. She complained of bone pain throughout her body and was unable to walk due to systemic cystic osteofibrosis, including a brown tumor of the left lower extremities. Neck ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tumor 2 cm in diameter in the upper side of the right thyroid lobe. 99mTc sestamibi (99mTc-MIBI) imaging and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) were performed to diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism and examination of other parathyroid glands. However, neither imaging modality detected the parathyroid tumor. To confirm the diagnosis, we performed selective venous sampling around the parathyroid and the patient was diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism due to a right parathyroid tumor. Resection of the right parathyroid tumor was performed and the pathological diagnosis was parathyroid adenoma. To date, both 99mTc-MIBI and FDG-PET are useful to localize parathyroid tumors. In this case, however, neither modality detected the tumor. Although recent studies state that expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in parathyroid tumors plays an important role in the false-negative results of both 99mTc-MIBI scans and FDG-PET, immunohistological study detected no P-gp expression in the parathyroid tumor in the current case.
