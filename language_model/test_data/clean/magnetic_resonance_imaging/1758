Emotional facial palsy (EFP) commonly results from anterolateral thalamic or striatocapsular infarcts. Its occurrence in brainstem lesions is uncommon, with previously reported cases being restricted to superior cerebellar artery infarction (3 cases). We report an unusual case of EFP ipsilateral to an anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction, which opens new insights into the facial corticobulbar tract pathway.
