Pituitary apoplexy is a common clinical syndrome characterised by acute headache, ophthalmoplegia, diminished visual acuity and altered mental status caused by the sudden haemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland. The two cases reported highlight the variability in presentation which underscores the need for a high index of suspicion and the need for MRI in patients presenting with a thunderclap headache and 'normal' initial investigations.
