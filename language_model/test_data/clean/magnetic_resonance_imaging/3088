To present an interesting and unusual case of double patella syndrome in a patient with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. The pertinent clinical and radiographic findings and a brief review of the literature are discussed.

An 11-yr-old male patient suffered from occasional right hip pain and limited range of motion, as well as a nontender soft tissue mass in the right knee. Radiographic examination of the hips and knees demonstrated double-layered patellae and bilateral coxa magna deformity.

Although surgery was initially recommended, conservative chiropractic management was employed and resulted in complete resolution of the patient's presenting hip symptoms.

This case is the first reported of double patella seen on MRI and demonstrates the value of this technology in the noninvasive preoperative assessment of double patella syndrome. The patient's clinical and radiographic features led to the correct diagnosis.
