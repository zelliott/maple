Recently, diffusion tensor imaging is attracting the biomedical researchers for its application in depiction of fiber tracts based on diffusion anisotropy. In this paper, we briefly describe the basic theory of diffusion tensor MR imaging, the determination process of diffusion tensor, and the basic concepts of diffusion tensor visualization techniques. Several results of clinical application in our institute are also introduced. Finally, the limitations, advantages and disadvantages of the techniques are discussed for further application of diffusion tensor visualization.
