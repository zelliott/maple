In neurooncology transplanting, tumors can be used for many purposes e.g. to solve questions concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of such tumors or their management. Experimentally induced and transplanted tumors of the nervous system become reproducible in their morphology and growth parameters after about 12 subsequent intracerebral passages. During the period from the first to the 12th intracerebral generations, a simplification of the histology and a reduction of the induction times take place. Nowadays the growth behavior of such tumors can be followed by imaging methods such as MRI if specially adapted to small animals. Our results are based on the investigation of over 2350 experimentally induced tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system that were diagnosed according to the rules of human and rodent brain tumor classification and various subgroups of this sample, analyzed by electron microscopy, postmortal angiography and MRI.
