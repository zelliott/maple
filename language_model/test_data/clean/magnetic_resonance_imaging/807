To evaluate efficacy of MR imaging (MRI) in diagnosis of local prostatic cancer (LPC) and validity of MRI performance in patients with high levels of prostate-specific antigens (PSA), we made a retrospective analysis of a combined examination of 210 patients including MRI (100%). Of them, 68 (32.4%) had prostatic cancer (LPC pT1-pT2 in 27 patients, 39.7%), 87 (41.4%) had benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 35 (16.7%)--chronic prostatitis (CP). 17 (8.1%) patients were free of prostatic diseases. MRI accuracy in diagnosis of LPC was 60%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 54%, in positive and negative prognostic values 50 and 73%, respectively. Some features of LPC were seen in MRI of BPH, CP and control patients. MRI symptoms characteristic for one of the above diseases only were not determined. We believe that MRI is indicated in suspected prostatic cancer located in the central zone and anterior lateral regions of the peripheral zone (unpalpable prostatic cancer). Prostatic MRI with assessment of the lower spine and pelvic bones is justified in men over 50 years if PSA is above 10 ng/ml. Early and accurate diagnosis of LPC by MRI is impossible without evaluation of clinical and PSA data.
