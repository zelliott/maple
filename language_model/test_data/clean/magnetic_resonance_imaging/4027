Fluctuant and progressive hearing impairment in a patient with a wide vestibular aqueduct has been called the 'large vestibular aqueduct syndrome'. Recently reports of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies describe enlargement of the endolymphatic sac and duct in patients shown to have large vestibular aqueducts by computed tomography (CT). A patient with progressive deafness was shown to have borderline or slightly enlarged vestibular aqueducts by re-formatted sagittal CT. However, MRI in axial and sagittal planes gave a more satisfactory demonstration of both aqueduct and endolymphatic sac enlargement.
