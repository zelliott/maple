Eighty-one pediatric patients with a variety of spinal disorders, including suspected dysrhaphism, scoliosis, neoplasia, and neurofibromatosis, underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The results were retrospectively compared with those of myelography followed by computed tomography (CT) and surgery. In patients with dysrhaphism, most abnormalities, including hydromyelia, inclusion tumors, and sites of cord tether, were demonstrated with MR imaging. Diastematomyelia and small hydromyelic cavities were indistinguishable on routine coronal and sagittal T1-weighted images; axial images with T2 weighting were optimal for this differentiation. MR imaging did not enable direct visualization of a thickened filum or evaluation of tethering with a thin, dorsally positioned neural placode. Congenital or severe scoliosis required lengthy studies with multiple planes of imaging or myelography and CT. Milder curvatures were readily evaluated with MR imaging, and neoplastic lesions, with the exception of intrathecal tumor seeding, were adequately defined.
