A 35-year-old woman had an intradural tumor in the posterior fossa adjacent to the posterior wall of the left pyramidal bone, which was totally removed and histologically diagnosed as a pleomorphic adenoma. Follow-up examination for 2 years showed no recurrence of the tumor. There was no primary lesion in any other gland of the body, and therefore there is no alternative but to conclude a "migration" of some gland cells. The pathogenesis of this tumor remains unclassified.
