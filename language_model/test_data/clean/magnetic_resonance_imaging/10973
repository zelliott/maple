This work reports on the development of a pulse sequence to simultaneously acquire proton density, T(1), and T(2) weighted images in a single magnetization prepared fast spin echo acquisition. The technique is based upon the application of a magnetization preparation consisting of a global inversion followed by slice-selective 180 degrees and 90 degrees pulses to prepare the signal of specific slices. Slices are acquired in an interleaved manner with time delays appropriate for the desired image contrasts. Data acquisition is repeated for all combinations of slice interleaving covering the region of interest until images from all slice locations have been acquired with all desired image contrasts. The multiple image contrasts obtained with this technique should be useful in applications where discrimination between different types of tissue components is desired, such as in the analysis of plaque in cervical carotid artery disease.
