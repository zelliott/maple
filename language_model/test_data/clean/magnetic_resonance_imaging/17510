Between 01/02 and 01/03 four cases of ruptures of the pectoralis major muscle were treated in our hospital by suture. The data were retrospectively analysed, all patients underwent a follow up examination. We compared our results with the literature found by internet search.

Between 01/02 and 01/03 four male patients with a rupture of the pectoralis major muscle (PM) were treated surgically by suture. Three of them had an acute rupture (75%), in one case the injury was older (25%). In three cases patients underwent MRI examination. All patients were examined for a follow up by the Constant score and the score of McEntire.

The median age of the patients was 36.5 (min: 27; max: 51) years; in three cases the left side was injured, in one case the right. All cases of the acute injury happened during weight bearing. The older rupture (1.5 years ago) was caused by a motorcycle accident. The follow up examination was performed after 8.5 (min: 7; max: 13) months. According to the score of McEntire the functional and clinical result was in all cases good to very good. The median value of the Constant score on the injured side was 90 (min: 63; max: 96) compared to 99 (min: 95; max: 100) on the other side.

The rupture of the pectoralis major muscle is a rare entity and appears in young male patients. The most common reason for this injury is weight bearing or physical exercises, often in combination with anabolic steroids. Clinical and functional results after suture are good; patients normally reach the former level of activity and are able to practice their sports in the same way like they did before the trauma. According to our experiences, we recommend the surgical therapy.
