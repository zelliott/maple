To assess the impact of various marketing techniques on the referral pattern for uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) at an academic interventional radiology practice over a 1-year period.

All referrals to the interventional radiology clinic for UFE from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2009, were retrospectively reviewed. A standard intake sheet was completed by the interventional clinic secretary at the time of initial patient contact that included the source of the referral (radio, television, newspaper, mailing, Internet, physician, friend, other). All patients who proceeded to consultation were seen in the interventional radiology clinic by attending interventional radiologists in a university-based academic center. The referral pattern was analyzed with respect to the number of patients who contacted the clinic, the number of actual clinic visits, the number of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations performed before and after the procedure, the total number of embolization cases performed, and the subsequent downstream revenue.

During the 1-year period, 344 patients contacted the interventional radiology clinic regarding UFE resulting in 171 consultations and 100 pelvic MR imaging examinations performed before the procedure. Sixty-two patients proceeded to UFE, and 32 patients underwent follow-up pelvic MR imaging. These results show a significant increase from eight cases the previous year and are presumably attributable almost entirely to the directed marketing campaign. The marketing initiative consisted primarily of print and radio advertisements, with the latter being the most effective. The total advertising cost for the year was approximately $24,706, of which $20,520 was for radio advertisements. The radio advertisements generated 69% (237 of 344) of the referrals and 69% (43 of 62) of the UFE procedures. Using Medicare reimbursement rates, the radio advertisements generated $281,994 in UFE technical fees and $50,329 in MR imaging technical fees.

Direct patient marketing techniques can promote significant growth for a fibroid embolization practice. In our market, radio advertisements proved to be the most cost-effective strategy.
