To evaluate the mid-term effects of implant of dynamic neutralization system (Dynesys) on disc tissue in patients with lumbar discopathy, through the quantification of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) concentration, both in treated and adjacent levels, by analysis of delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI contrast (dGEMRIC) images.

Ten patients with low back pain underwent the dGEMRIC diagnostic protocol before, 6-months and after 2 years from surgery. Each patient was also evaluated with visual analog (VAS), Oswestry, and Prolo scales both at presurgery and during follow-up. From dGEMRIC images, a ΔT1 parametric map was obtained for each disc, as quantitative indicator of its GAG concentration, and divided in 13 sectors, which were classified at presurgery as normal or abnormal, based on a 70-ms threshold. Evolution of ΔT1 was studied during the follow-up.

Nine of ten patients completed the follow-up. VAS, Oswestry, and Prolo grades showed an improvement. This was accompanied by a reduction of ΔT1 in abnormal segments while normal segments showed a pattern of initial worsening at 6 months, followed by an improvement after 2 years.

Our study confirmed the improvement in clinical evaluation, and for the first time related this to the changes in discs GAG concentration.
