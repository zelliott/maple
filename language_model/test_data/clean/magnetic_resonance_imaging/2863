Increased use of magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography in stereotactic planning highlight some technical problems in imaging. Visualization of markers during imaging are vital in stereotactic planning. In magnetic resonance imaging-guided stereotaxy, specially designed plates are used that contain water-based copper sulfate solutions as a marker. Replacement of copper sulfate solution is usually required after some time due to precipitation and leaking. The refilling procedure is quite cumbersome and can cause technical problems in imaging. In this study, we describe copper sulfate solution mixed with a water-soluble gel as a simple but useful alternative to water-based copper sulfate resolution to ease the refilling procedure and to overcome the air bubbles.
