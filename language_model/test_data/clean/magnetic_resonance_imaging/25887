We have compared the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with computed tomography (CT) in assessing the extent and the localization of osteosarcomas. Twenty patients were examined by both systems, and the results related to the clinical and histological findings. While both investigations are valuable, MRI may be more useful for defining the local extent of an osteosarcoma.
