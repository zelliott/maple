To investigate the efficacy of gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) enhanced MR imaging for the detection of liver lesions in patients with primary malignant hepatic neoplasms.

Thirty-one patients with histologically proven primary malignancy of the liver were evaluated before and after administration of Gd-BOPTA at dose 0.05 or 0.10 mmol/kg. T1-weighted spin echo (T1W-SE) and gradient echo (T1W-GRE) images were evaluated for lesion number, location, size and confidence by three off-site independent reviewers and the findings were compared to reference standard imaging (intraoperative ultrasound, computed tomography during arterial portography or lipiodol computed tomography). Results were analyzed for significance using a two-sided McNemar's test.

More lesions were identified on Gd-BOPTA enhanced images than on unenhanced images and there was no significant difference in lesion detection between either concentration. The largest benefit was in detection of lesions under 1 cm in size (7 to 21, 9 to 15, 16 to 18 for reviewers A, B, C respectively). In 68% of the patients with more than one lesion, Gd-BOPTA increased the number of lesions detected.

Liver MR imaging after Gd-BOPTA increases the detection of liver lesions in patients with primary malignant hepatic neoplasm.
