Parallel imaging is one of the most promising developments in recent years for the acceleration of MR acquisitions. One area of practical importance where different parallel imaging methods perform differently is the manner in which they deal with aliasing in the full-FOV reconstructed image. It has been reported that sensitivity encoding (SENSE) reconstruction fails whenever the reconstructed FOV is smaller than the object being imaged. On the other hand, generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) has been used successfully to reconstruct images with aliasing in the reconstructed FOV, as in conventional imaging. The disparate behavior of these methods can be easily demonstrated by a few simple illustrative examples. Additional in vivo examples using GRAPPA and modified SENSE (mSENSE) make this distinction clear. These experiments demonstrate that SENSE fails to reconstruct correct images when coil sensitivity maps are used that do not automatically account for the object size and therefore the aliasing in the reconstructed images. However, with the use of aliased high-resolution coil sensitivity maps, accurate SENSE reconstructions can be generated. On the other hand, GRAPPA produces images with an aliasing appearance that is exactly as would be expected from normal nonaccelerated acquisitions. An understanding of these effects could potentially lead to fewer operator-dependent errors, as well as a better understanding of the differences between the underlying reconstruction processes.
