Sliding indirect inguinal hernias containing the ipsilateral uterine adnexa are not uncommon in female infants. We report a case of a 12-year-old girl presenting with a benign tumor (serous cystadenofibroma) in a retroperitoneally located ovary. The patient had a history of hernia repair in the neonatal period. Displacement of the ovary and fallopian tube in the retroperitoneal space is a rarely reported complication of pediatric inguinal hernia surgery. Uncorrected, this can result in hormonal dysfunction, decreased fertility, and difficult and unclear situations during abdominal surgery in adulthood. A laparoscopic approach for hernia repair may prevent this complication.
