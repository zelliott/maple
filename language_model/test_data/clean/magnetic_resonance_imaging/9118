The aim was to investigate the relationship between the appearance of double contours on the mandibular condyle and changes in articular disc position after splint therapy.

Panoramic radiographs and magnetic resonance images of 82 joints in 41 patients taken before and after treatment were studied. The number of cases showing a double contour after treatment was compared between the 2 groups with and without disc displacement before treatment, and between the 2 groups with and without reduction in the displacement group; a comparison was also made among age groups and among 3 groups showing improvement, aggravation, or no change in displacement after treatment.

All joints showing a double contour after treatment showed articular disc displacement before treatment. No double contours were observed after treatment on joints without articular disc displacement before treatment. All joints showing a double contour showed improvement in disc displacement.

The results indicate that a double contour on the mandibular condyle is the result of repositioning of, or positional improvement in, a displaced articular disc.
