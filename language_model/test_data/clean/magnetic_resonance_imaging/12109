The MRI findings at 1.5 Tesla of central pontine myelinolysis in 2 alcoholic patients are reported. The lesion was confined to the pons in both cases, with strong hyperintensity on T2-weighted and hypointensity on T1-weighted images. In both cases MRI revealed typical symmetrical sparing of the ventrolateral tracts in the pons.
