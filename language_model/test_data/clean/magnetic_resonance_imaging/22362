Brain slices provide a useful nervous tissue model to investigate the relationships between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast mechanisms and tissue microstructure; yet, these acutely isolated tissues remain viable for only 10-12 h. To study slower biological processes, this work describes the first MRI microscopy characterization of organotypic rat hippocampal slice cultures that can be maintained for several weeks. Diffusion-weighted images of slice cultures acquired with a 14.1-T magnet demonstrated the laminar anatomy of the hippocampus with relatively high signal-to-noise ratios. Diffusion data analyzed using a two-compartment model with exchange indicated that cultured slices had a comparable microstructure to acute brain slices and to in vivo brain. Immunohistochemistry indicated that slice cultures tolerated the conditions required for MRI study well. MRI of cultured tissue slices is highly amenable to correlative microscopy techniques and offers great promise for future MRI investigations of pathological tissue reorganization, molecular imaging and stem cell therapies.
