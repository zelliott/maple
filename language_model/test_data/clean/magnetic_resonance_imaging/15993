The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and assess the correlation between the volume of the ischemic lesion and neurobehavioral status during the subacute stage of ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke was induced in 6 healthy laboratory beagles through permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO). T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), measurement of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratio, and neurobehavioral evaluation were performed 3 times serially by using a 1.5-T MR system: before and 3 and 10 d after MCAO. Ischemic lesions demonstrated T2 hyperintensity, FLAIR hyperintensity, and DWI hyperintensity. The ADC ratio was decreased initially but then was increased at 10 d after MCAO. Ischemic lesion volumes on T2-weighted and FLAIR imaging were not significantly different from those on DWI. The lesion volume and neurobehavioral score showed strong correlation. Our results suggest that conventional MRI may be a reliable diagnostic tool during the subacute stage of canine ischemic stroke.
