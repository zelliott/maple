The authors report a case of epidermoid tumor attached to the dura of the frontal convexity and extending into the cerebral parenchyma, with unusual computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) findings. The tumor appeared as a mixed density intracerebral mass containing dense calcifications on the precontrast CT scan, and the capsule was intensely enhanced on the postcontrast scan. It appeared as a mixed intensity lesion on both the T1- and T2-weighted MR images.
