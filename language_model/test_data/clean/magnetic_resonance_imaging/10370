The experimental validation of a model-based, thermal therapy control system which automatically and simultaneously achieves the specified efficacy and safety objectives of the treatment is reported. MR-thermometry measurements are used in real-time to control the power of a stationary, focused ultrasound transducer in order to achieve the desired treatment outcome in minimum time without violating the imposed safety constraints. Treatment efficacy is quantified in terms of the thermal dose delivered to the target. Normal tissue safety is ensured by automatically maintaining normal tissue temperature below the imposed limit in the user-specified locations. To reflect hardware limitations, constraints on the maximum applied power are also imposed. At the pretreatment stage, MR imaging and thermometry are used to localize the treatment target and identify thermal and actuation models. The results of phantom and canine experiments demonstrate that spatially-distributed, real-time MR temperature measurements enhance one's ability to robustly achieve the desired treatment outcome in minimum time without violating safety constraints. Post-treatment evaluation of the outcome using T2-weighted images of canine muscle showed good spatial correlation between the sonicated area and thermally damaged tissue.
