Several cases of motor neuron disease (MND) after electric injury have been reported in the last number of years, but the relationship between electric injury and MND remains controversial. Herein we report the case of a 60-year-old man who developed a MND following an electrical trauma. In the case presented here, the onset of disease at the site of lightning strike and the short interval of time between the electrical injury and the clinical onset of MND raise the possibility of considering electrical shock as a trigger factor for MND.
