A peripheral ameloblastoma (PA) is a rare variant of ameloblastoma that generally occurs in the extraosseous region; an extragingival PA is extremely rare. There have been 5 cases reported of a PA occurring in the buccal mucosa and 1 in the oral floor. We present the sixth known case of extragingival PA in the buccal mucosa, which occurred in an 88-year-old woman.
