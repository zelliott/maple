Hydatid disease is caused by the parasite Echinococcus granulosus. The liver and the lungs are common sites. When a cystic lesion is seen on CT scan, diagnosis is made based on the patient having lived in an endemic area. Serologic tests are used for differential diagnosis. Medical treatment is centered on albendazole. Surgery is recommended either by open or endoscopic technique depending on the characteristics of the cysts and the patient. Complications of surgery are rare except for prolonged air leaks. Mortality occurs when the cyst is located in the central nervous system or occludes major vessels.
