We report on 2 patients treated with pergolide, 1 of whom developed pleural fibrosis and the other retroperitoneal fibrosis. In both cases, an extensive diagnostic evaluation and surgical intervention were required to reach a diagnosis. Based on our experience with these patients and a review of cases of pergolide-induced fibrosis in the English-language literature, we propose guidelines for the diagnosis and management of this rare complication.
