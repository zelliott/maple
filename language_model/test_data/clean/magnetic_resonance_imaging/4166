Acoustic rhinometry (AR) evaluates the geometry of the nasal cavity with acoustic reflections and provides information about nasal cross-sectional areas (CSA) and nasal volume within a given distance. The accuracy of the information obtained by AR was compared with that of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the nasal cavity. Five healthy subjects were evaluated with AR and the MRI before and after the application of a long-acting nasal decongestant spray, to eliminate possible interference of the nasal cycle with both measurement techniques. The MRI images of 2 mm coronal sections of the nasal cavity were traced by three independent observers and the CSAs were calculated by computer-aided imaging digitization, to be compared with the calculated CSAs obtained with the AR at the corresponding distance from the nasal tip. Digitized data from the MRI images were also used to calculate the nasal volume within the first 6 cm from the nasal tip and compared with the AR volume measurements. The interobserver variation of digitized MRI data predecongestant and postdecongestant was not significant. The correlations of CSA and volume measurements between the AR and MRI were high (0.969) after the application of the decongestant. The correlation between the AR and MRI measurements before the decongestant was low (0.345). This may have been the result of interference of the nasal cycle during the long MRI measurements (1 hour) or other unknown factors. We conclude that AR measurements of nasal CSAs and volumes provide accurate information when compared with the MRI of the decongested nasal airway.
