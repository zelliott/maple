Gliomatosis cerebri (GC) is a rare tumor of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by widespread diffuse infiltration of the brain and spinal cord by neoplastic glial cells. We report the case of a 17-year-old boy with a bioptically diagnosed fibrillary astrocytoma. The administration of thalidomide, which was suggested to be beneficial in the treatment of human cancers, had no substantial clinical effect on our patient. Autopsy studies revealed a diffuse infiltration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the right hemisphere, brainstem, and the leptomeninges covering the whole spinal cord by an astrocytic tumor, which showed features both of low-grade astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme. No mutations in the p53 and PTEN tumor suppressor genes were found; immunoreactivities for p53, PTEN, and EGFR could not be detected.
