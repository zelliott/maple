In order to produce high quality MR images of the wrist and hand, it is of major importance to consider the technical aspects of the examination. In this article the basics of patient positioning, MR sequences, acquisition plane, and application of contrast media are discussed. Additional issues such as MR arthrography, MR angiography, and magnetic field strength are addressed as well as anatomical variants, which may result in painful conditions. These include in particular the variability in length of the ulna with possible consecutive impaction or impingement syndromes.
