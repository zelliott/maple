Dorsal sural neuropathy occurs infrequently as a result of compression of the nerve due to various etiologies.We describe a 52-year-old diabetic woman with dorsal sural neuropathy. The diagnosis was based on clinical, electrophysiological, ultrasonographic, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. This case report demonstrates the usefulness of electrophysiological and imaging studies, including ultrasonography, in the diagnosis of dorsal sural neuropathy.
