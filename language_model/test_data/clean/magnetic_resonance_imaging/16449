We report the case of a 71-year-old woman with a chondrosarcoma originating in the first metatarsal of the left foot. We performed a wide resection and reconstructed the first and second metatarsals with a free vascularised double-barrelled fibular graft. Her limb was successfully salvaged with functional and aesthetic results. Two years after surgery, the patient is able to walk without any ortho-prosthetic devices and has returned to farm work. The details of the technique applied in this case have been described in this article.
