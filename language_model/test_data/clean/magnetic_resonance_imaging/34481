We studied the relationship between corpus callosum area and both inter-hemispheric facilitation and interference in schizophrenics and controls. Mid-sagittal sections through the corpus callosum were measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging on 42 patients and 43 normal controls, along with symptom profiles. In a sub-sample, a modified version of the Stroop Test was also performed (27 patients and 29 controls) to assess inter-hemispheric facilitation and interference of colour naming. In the larger sample (total subjects, n = 85), there were no significant differences between patients and controls in CC area but a trend towards smaller values in patients in all but the posterior segment. In the sub-sample, bilateral facilitation was greater, and interference, less in schizophrenics compared with controls. There was a positive correlation between facilitation and posterior CC area, parallelled by a negative correlation between interference and posterior CC area, in both patients and controls, which only reached statistical significance when both groups were combined. These findings suggest that the link, between CC size and neuropsychological processes involving inter-hemispheric transfer of information, is common to both schizophrenics and normal controls. There were significant negative correlations between anterior CC area and psychomotor poverty (avolition, anhedonia and affective flattening), and a suggestion that the negative correlation between age and CC size in controls was not present in patients.
