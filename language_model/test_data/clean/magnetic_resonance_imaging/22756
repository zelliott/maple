Patients with recurrent gliomas (n = 14) were treated with bevacizumab and carboplatin, cpt-11, or etoposide. Follow-up MRI scans were obtained 2 to 6 weeks after initiation of treatment. Contrast-enhancing tumor shrank in 7 patients, with reductions evident in as little as 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Treatment seemed more effective for heterogeneously enhancing tumor compared with solidly enhancing tumor.
