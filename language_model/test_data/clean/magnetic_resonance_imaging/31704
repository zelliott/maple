Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the primary motor cortex (M1) may induce functional modulation of motor performance and sensory perception. To address the underlying neurophysiological modulation following 10 Hz rTMS applied over M1, we examined cortical activation using 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as well as the associated motor and sensory behavioral changes. The motor performance measure involved a sequential finger motor task that was also used as an activation task during fMRI. For sensory assessment, current perception threshold was measured before and after rTMS outside the MR scanner, and noxious mechanical stimulation was used as an activation task during fMRI. We found that significant activation in the bilateral basal ganglia, left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral pre-SMA, right medial temporal lobe, right inferior parietal lobe, and right cerebellar hemisphere correlated with enhanced motor performance in subjects that received real rTMS compared with sham-stimulated controls. Conversely, significant deactivation in the right superior and middle frontal gyri, bilateral postcentral and bilateral cingulate gyri, left SMA, right insula, right basal ganglia, and right cerebellar hemisphere were associated with an increase in the sensory threshold. Our findings reveal that rTMS induced rapid changes in the sensorimotor networks associated with sensory perception and motor performance and demonstrate the complexity of such intervention.
