The authors report on an Italian family with eight affected members who show autosomal dominant migraine with prolonged visual, sensory, motor, and aphasic aura. These symptoms are associated with white matter abnormalities on brain MRI. All living affected members carry a Notch3 mutation (Arg153Cys) previously reported in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). White matter abnormalities occur in a variable percentage of the general migraine population; CADASIL should be suspected in migraineurs with prolonged atypical aura and white matter abnormalities.
