We present, to our knowledge, the first published cases of optic neuritis associated with adalimumab, a medication in the class of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists. Approved in recent years by the FDA, adalimumab (Humira, Abbott Laboratories; Abbott Park, IL) is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks the physiologic effects of TNF. Other TNF antagonists have had associations with optic neuritis and demyelinating events.
