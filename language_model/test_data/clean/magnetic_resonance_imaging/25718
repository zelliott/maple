We report two cases of pleomorphic astrocytoma, a rare primary brain tumor with an unusually good prognosis. These lesions typically are peripherally located, partially cystic, temporal lobe masses. Dural attachment is frequent, calcifications are not. Angiography usually shows a hypovascular mass, although blood supply from the external carotid artery may be seen.
