Our aim was to evaluate the surgical impact of preoperative MRI in young patients. We reviewed a single-institution database of 283 consecutive patients below 40 years of age and who were treated for breast cancer. Thirty-seven (13 %) patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. The remaining 246 patients included 124 (50 %) who preoperatively underwent conventional imaging (CI), i.e., mammography/ultrasonography (CI-group), and 122 (50 %) who underwent CI and dynamic MRI (CI + MRI-group). Pathology of surgical specimens served as a reference standard. Mann-Whitney, χ (2), and McNemar statistics were used. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age, tumor pathologic subtype, stage, receptor, or nodal status. The mastectomy rate was 111/246 (45 %) overall but was significantly different between groups (46/124, 37 %, for the CI group and 65/122, 53 %, for the CI + MRI group; p = 0.011). Of 122 CI + MRI patients, 46 (38 %) would have undergone mastectomy due to CI alone, while MRI determined 19 additional mastectomies, increasing the mastectomy rate from 38 % to 53 % (p < 0.001). The number of patients with multifocal, multicentric, synchronous, or bilateral cancers was significantly different between groups (10/124, 8 %, for the CI group and 33/122, 27 %, for the CI + MRI group; p < 0.001). In the CI + MRI group, multifocal, multicentric, or synchronous bilateral cancers were detected with mammography in 5/33 (15 %) patients, with ultrasonography in 15/33 (45 %) patients, and with MRI in 32/33 (97 %) patients (p < 0.005). Two mastectomies were due to false positives at both conventional tests in the CI group (2/124, 1.6 %) and two mastectomies were due to MRI false positives in the CI + MRI group (2/122, 1.6 %). In conclusion, breast cancer in young patients was treated with mastectomy in 37-38 % of cases on the basis of CI only and in these patients MRI was more sensitive than CI for multifocal, multicentric, or synchronous bilateral cancers, resulting in an additional mastectomy rate of 15 %. A low probability of inappropriate imaging-based decision-making for mastectomy exists for both CI alone and for CI + MRI, making presurgical needle biopsy mandatory for findings that suggest a need for mastectomy.
