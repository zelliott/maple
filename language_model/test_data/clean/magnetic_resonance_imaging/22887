Bipolar disorder is a common psychiatric condition with significant associated morbidity and mortality. Despite its significance, the neurophysiology and neuropathology of this illness is incompletely understood. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques have helped to begin clarifying these areas. Specifically, bipolar disorder appears to arise from abnormalities within discrete brain networks (eg, the anterior limbic network). The expression of the symptoms of bipolar disorder does not appear to result from single, localized brain lesions, but rather are emergent properties of dysfunction of these brain networks. As neuroimaging techniques continue to improve, the underlying neural basis of bipolar disorder will be clarified.
