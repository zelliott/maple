Two infants, 18 months and 4 months of age, who were born with bilateral VI and VII nerve palsy (Moebius syndrome) experienced central respiratory failure requiring persistent ventilation. The computed tomography scan showed small brainstem tegmental calcifications. These findings suggest intrauterine brainstem necrosis including the respiratory center and poor prognosis for independent respiration.
