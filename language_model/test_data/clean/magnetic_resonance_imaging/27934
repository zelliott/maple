Brain damage from carbon monoxide intoxication has not been extensively studied with magnetic resonance imaging. We report the clinical outcome and brain magnetic resonance imaging in three individuals simultaneously exposed to toxic levels of carbon monoxide four years previously. Lesions are seen in multiple locations and do not correlate well with the clinical condition.
