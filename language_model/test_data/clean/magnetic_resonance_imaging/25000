Two dogs presented with severe, peracute-onset, neurological signs. Neuroanatomical localization was cerebellovestibular. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and revealed focal, wedge-shaped lesions in the cerebellum. Diagnosis of cerebellar infarctions was made based on peracute-onset, clinical signs, MRI, and outcome as well as ancillary diagnostic information. Both dogs recovered completely. Cerebellar infarction should be included in the differential of any dog with peracute-onset, central cerebellovestibular signs regardless of severity of clinical signs. Outcome was excellent in these dogs.
