Reported cases of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) with neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) are rare.

In this paper we report the first case of intracranial AVF in an NF1 infant who developed heart failure. Endovascular treatment using coils successfully obliterated the AVF. The mechanism underlying the AVF in this case was believed to be a congenital mesenchymal abnormality of the intracranial vessels.

The mechanism underlying the development of heart failure in this case is also discussed.
