Clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas range from those causing significant hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction and visual field compromise to those being completely asymptomatic, detected either at autopsy or as incidental findings on imaging scans performed for other reasons (often referred to as pituitary incidentalomas). Growth of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas without treatment occurs in about 10% of microadenomas and 24% of macroadenomas. In the absence of hypersecretion, hypopituitarism, or visual-field defects, periodic screening by magnetic resonance imaging may detect enlargement. Potential indications for surgery are growth of a pituitary incidentaloma, the development of visual-field defects, or the development of hypopituitarism.
