3D-constructive interference in steady state (3D-CISS) sequence has been used to assess the CSF pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate the additive value of 3D-CISS compared with conventional sequences in the diagnosis of obstructive membranes in hydrocephalus.

A total of 134 patients with hydrocephalus underwent MR imaging examination with a 3T unit consisting of turbo spin-echo, 3D-CISS, and cine phase-contrast (cine PC) sequences. 3D-CISS was used to assess obstructive membranes in CSF pathways compared with other sequences. Cine PC, follow-up imaging, and surgical findings were used to confirm obstructive membranes.

Comparing the number of noncommunicating cases by using the conventional and 3D-CISS images, we found 26 new cases (19.4%) of 134 cases that were previously misdiagnosed as communicating hydrocephalus by conventional images. 3D-CISS sequence identified obstructive membranes invisible in other sequences, which facilitated selection of neuroendoscopy in the treatment of 31 patients (23.1%) in total who would have been otherwise treated with shunt insertion. These patients included 26 newly diagnosed noncommunicating cases after demonstration of intraventricular and/or fourth ventricular outlet membranes and 5 cases of communicating hydrocephalus with obstructing cisternal membranes. There were obstructions of the foramina of Luschka in 22 of 26 newly found noncommunicating cases.

Conventional sequences are insensitive to obstructive membranes in CSF pathways, especially in the fourth ventricular exit foramina and the basal cisterns. 3D-CISS sequence, revealing these obstructive membranes, can alter patient treatment and prognosis.
