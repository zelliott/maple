To investigate the fine vascular structures in the spinal and paraspinal region, the authors performed three-dimensional GRASS scanning after the administration of contrast material. The scan sequence was sagittal volume scan, TR/TE 100/16, with a flip angle of 45 degrees. First-order gradient moment nulling was employed. Four normal volunteers and 31 patients were studied. Using this technique, longitudinal anterior epidural veins and vertebral arteries were clearly identified. Paraspinal fine vessels of slow to moderate flow, including dilated anterior spinal artery, radiculo-medullary vein, and perimedullary coronal venous plexus, were demonstrated in pathological cases. In addition, with processing of the volume data set, phlebographic projection images of the ladder-shaped anterior epidural venous system could be generated. This method provided more detailed information on epidural and intradural vessels than conventional MR imaging.
