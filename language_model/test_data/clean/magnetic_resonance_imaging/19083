Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder in which granulomatous deposits occur at multiple sites within the body, but which often involves the hypothalamo-pituitary axis (HPA). Although diabetes insipidus (DI) is a well recognized complication, the frequency of anterior pituitary and other nonendocrine hypothalamic (NEH) involvement has not been well defined, particularly in adult patients with the disease. We have evaluated the frequency and progression of LCH-related anterior pituitary and other NEH dysfunction and their responses to treatment in 12 adult patients with histologically proven LCH and DI. They were followed up for a median of 11.5 yr (range, 3-28 yr) after the diagnosis of DI was made. Study evaluations comprised clinical (including formal psychometric assessment where appropriate), basal and dynamic pituitary function tests, and radiology with computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Eleven patients received systemic treatment, and 5 patients received external beam radiotherapy confined to the HPA. The median age at diagnosis of DI was 34 yr (range, 2-47 yr); DI was the presenting symptom in four patients, whereas the remaining eight each developed DI 1-20 yr (median, 2 yr) after the diagnosis of LCH. Eight patients developed one or more anterior pituitary hormonal deficiencies at a median of 4.5 yr (range, 2-22 yr) after the diagnosis of DI: GH deficiency developed in eight patients (median, 2 yr; range, 2-22 yr), FSH-LH deficiency in 7 patients (median, 7 yr; range, 2-22 yr), and TSH and ACTH deficiency in five patients (median, 10 yr; range, 3-16 and 3-19 yr), respectively; five patients developed panhypopituitarism. In addition, seven patients with anterior pituitary dysfunction also developed symptoms of other NEH dysfunctions at a median of 10 yr (range, 1-23 yr): five morbid obesity (body mass index, >35), five short term memory deficits, four sleeping disorders, two disorders of thermoregulation, and one adipsia. All patients developed disease outside of the hypothalamus during the course of the study, and no fluctuation of disease activity in the HPA region was noted. Radiological examination of the HPA was abnormal in each of the eight patients with anterior pituitary involvement and in the seven patients with NEH dysfunction (one or more abnormalities): seven had thickening of the infundibulum, and one had hypothalamic and thalamic signal changes. All patients who had a magnetic resonance imaging scan had absence of the bright spot of the posterior pituitary on the T1-weighted sequences, and in four patients with DI and normal anterior pituitary function this was the only abnormality. The five patients who received radiotherapy to the HPA achieved a partial or complete radiological response, and there was no evidence of tumor progression in this region. No form of therapy, including chemotherapy, improved any established hormonal deficiencies or symptoms of NEH. In summary, in our adult patients with hypothalamic LCH and DI, anterior pituitary hormonal deficiencies developed in 8 of 12 patients; these occurred over the course of 20 yr. They were frequently accompanied by structural changes of the HPA, although these were often subtle in nature. In addition, symptoms of NEH dysfunction developed in up to 90% of such patients and complicated management. Radiotherapy may be useful in achieving local control of tumor, but established anterior, posterior pituitary, and other NEH dysfunctions do not improve in response to current treatment protocols. Patients with LCH and DI, particularly those with multisystem disease and a structural lesion on radiology, should undergo regular and prolonged endocrine assessment to establish anterior pituitary deficiency and provide appropriate hormonal replacement.
