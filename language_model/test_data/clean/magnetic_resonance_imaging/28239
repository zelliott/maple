Neurofibromatosis is an uncommon cause of tetraplegia. Spinal cord compression in association with brachial plexus involvement is rare. A case of neurofibromatosis with malignant transformation illustrates the neurologic features associated with this condition. Malignant transformation of a neurofibroma should always be considered in patients with recurrent lesions or progressive neurologic dysfunction.
