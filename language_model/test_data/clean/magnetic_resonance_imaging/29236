We report an intramedullary angiolipoma with spinal cord compression studied by MRI, angiography and CT. Angiolipomas of the spine are rare benign tumours containing vascular and mature adipose elements. They are epidural in more than 90 % of the cases; only three cases of intramedullary angiolipoma are described. The clinical picture is nonspecific, but MRI and CT suggest the diagnosis.
