This study assessed the role of endoscope-controlled microneurosurgery (ECM) in the treatment of intracranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cysts.

Twelve patients affected by symptomatic arachnoid cysts (11 in the sylvian fissure and 1 in the cerebellopontine angle) underwent ECM, in which the endoscope is used to view the operating field while microsurgical instruments can be passed alongside the endoscope for surgical maneuvers. All the cysts were superficially located and could be reached directly through a burr hole on their surface, so that the endoscope was inserted into the cyst without passing through the brain parenchyma. We used a rigid endoscope, performing a wide fenestration of the cyst in the basal cisterns (cystocisternostomy). The excellent endoscopic vision facilitated the surgical procedure with safe maneuvers through a minimally invasive approach. In 11 patients, we observed the resolution of symptoms. A radiological reduction in the cyst was observed in 7 cases. No mortality or major complications were observed.

Endoscope-controlled microsurgery is a valid minimally invasive procedure for treating superficially located intracranial arachnoid cysts.
