Bursitis of the iliopsoas is a clinical entity rarely encountered, and may be underdiagnosed. Reports in the literature have usually considered the condition to result from an increase in bursal volume. Bursitis of the iliopsoas is most commonly observed in conjunction with pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis of the hip, and is rarely reported as an isolated condition. We describe 4 cases of bursitis of the iliopsoas in which bursal swelling was absent and hip pain was the only clinical indicator. Diagnostic and therapeutic criteria based on clinical and radiological criteria are suggested.
