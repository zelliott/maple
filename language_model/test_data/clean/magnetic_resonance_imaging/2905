Trabecular lines through the proximal tibia in line with the direction of the anterior cruciate ligament are visible in around two-thirds of standard knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. We describe their appearances and postulate that these lines may develop in response to stresses transmitted via the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).
