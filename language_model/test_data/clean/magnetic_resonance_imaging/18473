Three cases (case 1, female, aged 30; case 2, male, aged 32; case 3, male, aged 34) of benign brainstem encephalopathy with truncal ataxia were reported. Two patients had prodromal symptoms Neurological examination revealed truncal ataxia in all cases. As additional neurological signs, anisocoria, mydriasis, nystagmus, ptosis, transient opsoclonus, and facial palsy were seen. There was neither drowsiness nor myoclonus in the three cases. On laboratory examinations, cold agglutination test revealed significant elevation in two cases. The examination of cerebrospinal fluid showed a moderate rise of proteins in one case, but did not revealed pleocytosis in any of the cases. Magnetic resonance imaging of one patient revealed an area of high intensity in the left pontine tegmentum by T2-weighed imaging. The prognosis for all these cases was good, and the reappearance of neurological signs was not present until now. Our cases were different from brainstem encephalitis (Bickerstaff's encephalitis) because of an absence of disturbed consciousness and no pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid. Our cases were also different from "myoclonus-opsoclonus syndrome" because of an absence of myoclonus. We discussed a possibility of a new clinical syndrome which we call "benign brainstem encephalopathy with truncal ataxia".
