Paraventricular fluid cysts have recently been treated by endoscopic fenestration performed from the cysts to the ventricular system. However, correct orientation and safe navigation of the endoscope may be difficult in patients with abnormal anatomy. Endoscopic fenestration from the ventricular system to a cyst was performed through penetration of the septum pellucidum via the anterior horn of the contralateral lateral ventricle. The advantage of this approach is correct orientation and introduction of the endoscope to the periventricular lesion because the usual landmarks can be identified in the normal contralateral lateral ventricle.
