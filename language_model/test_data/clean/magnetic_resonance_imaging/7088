Intracranial fibrous xanthoma is extremely rare; only 11 cases have been reported so far. The authors report a case of multicentric intracranial fibrous xanthoma. Precontrast computed tomographic (CT) scans revealed a left frontal subdural mass, which had previously been diagnosed as a chronic subdural hematoma at another hospital. However, operation disclosed no hematoma but a granulomatous tumor. The biopsied specimen was histologically diagnosed as fibrous xanthoma. Postoperative postcontrast CT scans showed intense homogeneous enhancement at the clival and the left frontal regions, both of which appeared as iso- to low-intensity areas on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and as low-intensity areas on T2-weighted MR images. She gradually recovered by conservative treatment but suddenly died of cerebral infarction. Autopsy revealed fibrous xanthomas in the left frontal and the clival regions. This is the first report of the use of MR imaging for intracranial fibrous xanthoma, and its features differ from those of common intracranial parenchymal tumors, MR imaging can be helpful in the diagnosis of this tumor.
