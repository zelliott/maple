Volumetric evaluation of the myocardial viability post-infarction in rats using 3D in vivo MR imaging at 7 T using injection of an extracellular paramagnetic contrast agent and intravascular superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the same imaging session.

Five hours after induction of permanent myocardial infarction in rats (n=6), 3D in vivo T1- and T2-weighted MR Imaging was performed prior to and after Gd-DOTA injection (0.2 mmol/kg) and prior to and after nanoparticle injection (5 mg Fe/kg) to assess infarct size and myocardial viability.

3D MR Imaging using a successive contrast agent injection showed a difference of infarct size after Gd-DOTA injection on T1-weighted images compared to the one measured on T2-weighted images after Gd-DOTA and nanoparticle injection.

The use of 3D T1- and T2-weighted MR Imaging using a double contrast agents protocol made possible the accurate characterization of myocardial infarction volume and allowed the detection of myocardial viability post-infarction in rats.
