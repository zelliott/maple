High-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus constitutes a therapeutic advance for severely disabled patients with Parkinson disease.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of continuous bilateral high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in patients with Parkinson disease.

A prospective study of patients with Parkinson disease treated at a university hospital.

Electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the subthalamic nucleus of 23 consecutive patients with Parkinson disease who responded well to levodopa but had severe motor complications. There were 16 men and 7 women (mean +/- SEM age, 53 +/- 2 years) who had a mean +/- SEM disease duration of 14.7 +/- 1.0 years. Targets were determined by 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging, combined with intraoperative electrophysiologic recordings and stimulation.

Six months after surgery, motor disability, levodopa-induced motor fluctuations, dyskinesias, and the daily dose of levodopa equivalent decreased significantly by 67%, 78%, 77%, and 61%, respectively, compared with the preoperative state. No significant morbidity was observed, except transient depression in 4 patients.

The beneficial effects of subthalamic stimulation depend on (1) the criteria used for patient selection, (2) the precision with which the subthalamic nucleus is targeted (dependent on the 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and the intraoperative electrophysiologic and clinical assessments), and (3) the long-term postoperative adjustment of stimulation variables.
