Prediction of renal functional outcome following revascularization procedures in atheromatous renovascular disease (ARVD) has remained a challenge. In considering the etiology of renal impairment, researchers have shifted their focus now from the influence of degree of renal artery stenosis (RAS) to the importance of intrinsic parenchymal damage caused by hypertension, atheroemboli, downstream cytokine and/or cholesterol crystal release, as well as indicators of tissue viability. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques and MR-based indices are able to provide a detailed assessment of the morphologic and functional aspects of the ARVD kidney. These indices look beyond "lumenology" and enable a better understanding of the parenchyma's physiology which may provide insight into predictors of outcome. This review summarizes the multipurpose benefits of MR in the assessment of ARVD.
