A case with multiple small joint swelling and skin dystrophic changes in the right hand was initially treated as seronegative non-specific arthritis. Later, a triple phase bone scan indicated reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) and the primary lesion was shown on MRI scan to be a cervical cord mass with associated sub-acute haematoma. The case underscores the need to consider RSD in the differential diagnosis of such conditions and the importance of a detailed neurological examination in RSD with no local causative factor.
