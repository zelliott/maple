Varicella zoster infection (chickenpox) is a common and usually benign self limiting disease of childhood in non-vaccinated populations. Although varicella usually goes along with mild to moderate illness in immunocompetent patients, serious complications can arise. Varicella is highly infectious, with attack rates in susceptible individuals ranging from 61% to 100%.

This case describes a rare but life threatening complication of varicella zoster infection in a child.

High morbidity in non-vaccinated populations that led to rare cases of severe complications became a significant health burden all over the world. This aspect must be considered in the discussion about the importance and benefit of a population wide varicella vaccination programme as it was added to the childhood immunization schedule in Germany in 2004. The case described here might have been avoided by vaccination.
