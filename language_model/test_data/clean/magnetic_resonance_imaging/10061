Basilar clivus is a common site of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RNPC). Biopsy of the basilar clivus is seldom done because of its deep location and complex anatomic structure, therefore, early differential diagnosis of radiofibrosis (RF) and RNPC at the basilar clivus is very difficult. This study was designed to investigate the characteristics of radiofibrosis and RNPC at the basilar clivus on dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) for differential diagnosis.

A total of 38 NPC patients, treated in Cancer Center and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University with follow-up of 1-5 years, were divided into 2 groups: 22 in RF group and 16 in RNPC (RNPC at the basilar clivus) group. After conventional plain MRI scan of nasopharynx, DMRI and conventional contrast enhanced T(1)-weighted imaging (T1WI) were performed. Maximal contrast enhancement ratio (MCER), time to MCER (Tmax), and contrast enhancement ratio at the 40th second of DMRI (CER(40s)) of basilar clivus, condylar process, and nasal concha were measured.

The MCER and CER(40s) of RF at the basilar clivus were lower, and the Tmax was longer than those of RNPC at the basilar clivus. When CER40s > or =150%, CER40s of basilar clivus > or = CER(40s) of nasal concha, and the combination of these 2 indexes were respectively set as the DMRI diagnostic criteria of RNPC at the basilar clivus, the diagnostic sensitivity of the second criterion was the highest (81.3%), and the diagnostic specificity of the third criterion was also the highest (86.4%).

DMRI is helpful for differential diagnosis of radiofibrosis and RNPC at the basilar clivus. RNPC at the basilar clivus is highly suggested when it meet the criteria of both CER(40s) > or =150% and CER(40s) of basilar clivus > or = CER(40s) of nasal concha. When the 2 criteria are conflictive, the latter is more accurate, MCER and Tmax of the basilar clivus should be took into consideration.
