A flexible, personal computer (PC) based, screen-graphics oriented pulse sequence editor called PULSE has been developed for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). PULSE is used to set such NMR spectroscopic parameters as the delay and duration of rf transmit and receive gates, rf phase, sampling times, and such imaging parameters as rf pulse shape and gradient waveforms. The output of PULSE is a set of programs that can be loaded into a hardware pulse programmer. With PULSE, any desired NMR or MRI pulse sequence can be programmed quickly and easily.
