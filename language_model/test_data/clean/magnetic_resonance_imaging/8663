Benign extraskeletal chondromas are uncommon lesions with a predilection for the hands and the feet and can exhibit worrisome radiographic and histologic features mimicking chondrosarcomas. The authors present herein the case of a 74-year-old man with a painful mass at the dorsomedial aspect of the left foot. At 34 months after surgery the patient is disease-free with no evidence of recurrence.
