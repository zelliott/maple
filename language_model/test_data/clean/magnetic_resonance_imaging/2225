An assessment of the detectability of white matter lesions and of concordance between observers with different levels of MRI reading experience was performed with comparative evaluation of spin-echo MRI images and of corresponding "multispectral" maps in 16 patients with definite multiple sclerosis (MS). Multispectral maps were obtained by means of a recently described post-processing technique based on the simultaneous display of MRI parameters and a standardized colour scale with red, green and blue coding for relaxation rates R1 and R2 and proton density, respectively. Spin-echo images on films and multispectral maps displayed on a personal computer were randomly rated at 2-month intervals. Interobserver concordance (k-test) was assessed among three readers with different levels of MRI experience (an experienced neuroradiologist, a radiology resident and a neurologist). For multispectral maps we found increased interobserver concordance with the experienced neuroradiologist (multispectral vs conventional images; k = 0.77 vs 0.66 for the radiology resident and 0.66 vs 0.56 for the neurologist), an increased number of detected lesions and decreased reading time. Multispectral maps permit easy detection of MS lesions and may improve interobserver concordance compared with conventional spinecho studies.
