A 3-year-old, intact, male Beagle dog developed clinical signs of pleurothotonus and altered head position to the right, neck pain, nystagmus, hyperreflexia of the left forelimb, and hyperextension of both forelimbs. Magnetic resonance imaging enabled a tentative diagnosis of thalamic neoplasia with incidental hydromyelia at the level of the second cervical vertebra. The animal was euthanatized due to the poor prognosis, and a necropsy was performed. A large, well-demarcated, nonencapsulated, and focally infiltrative mass was present in the approximate location of, and effacing, the pineal gland. The mass was composed of densely packed polyhedral neoplastic cells that exhibited epithelial characteristics, such as intercellular junctions, and contained carbohydrate granules and occasionally melanin granules. Immunohistology confirmed that neoplastic cells expressed neuron-specific enolase and, in a small proportion, cytokeratin. These combined findings led to the diagnosis of a papillary tumor of the pineal region, a tumor not previously described in dogs.
