Syringo-subarachnoid shunt (S-S shunt) is one of the established surgical procedures for syringomyelia. However, this procedure requires a laminectomy which may lead to spinal column complications. We present a modified form of S-S shunt using a partial hemilaminectomy; a S-S shunt is placed via the dorsal root entry zone into the anterior subarachnoid space which is considered to be an ideal site for the drainage of the syrinx fluid. This technique will decrease the incidence of neuronal and spinal complications after surgery and avoid subarachnoid adhesions around the shunt tube. Between 1992 and 1997, a total of 24 patients with syringomyelia have been treated with this surgical procedure without any complications. Collapse of the syrinx was achieved in all cases. The authors believe that the procedure is an effective surgical treatment for syringomyelia and can be applied safely to adolescent and child cases.
