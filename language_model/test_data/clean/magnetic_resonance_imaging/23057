Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (ioMRI) during neurosurgical procedures was first implemented in 1995. In the following decade ioMRI and image guided surgery has evolved from an experimental stage into a safe and routinely clinically applied technique. The development of ioMRI has led to a variety of differently designed systems which can be basically classified in one- or two-room concepts and low- and high-field installations. Nowadays ioMRI allows neurosurgeons not only to increase the extent of tumor resection and to preserve eloquent areas or white matter tracts but it also provides physiological and biological data of the brain and tumor tissue. This article tries to give a comprehensive review of the milestones in the development of ioMRI and neuronavigation over the last 15 years and describes the personal experience in intraoperative low and high-field MRI.
