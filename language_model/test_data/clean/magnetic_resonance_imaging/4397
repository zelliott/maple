A 13-month-old boy, who had been diagnosed in utero as having bilateral hydroceles, was found to have bilateral abdominoscrotal hydroceles. To date, there has been only one previous case of bilateral abdominoscrotal hydroceles in an infant. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to make the diagnosis: bilateral dumbell shaped fluid filled masses were seen in a coronal image. The patient had the abdominoscrotal hydroceles excised through bilateral groin incisions. The postoperative course was uneventful, without complication. The etiology and diagnosis of abdominoscrotal hydroceles are discussed.
