Scaphoid injury and subsequent non-union is a well documented and researched subject. This article gives an overview of the epidemiology and results of the patients we have treated for scaphoid non-union at a University Hospital. 283 scaphoid non-unions in 268 patients (83% men) were operated upon, 230 as a primary and 47 as a secondary. The median age at time of surgery was 27 years. One-third of the non-unions were located in the proximal part of the scaphoid and the remaining two-thirds in the middle part. Of the 146 patients (55%) who contacted a doctor at the time of injury, 53 fractures where diagnosed (20%). Fourteen (5%) were operated primarily while 39 (15%) (seven dislocated) were immobilized in plaster casts. Thirty-two (12%) were under the age of 16 at the time of injury. The average time from the injury to the initial non-union surgery was 1.5 years with 2.8 years to the second procedure. The risk of osteoarthritis increased time from injury to surgery (both primary and secondary procedures). The greatest potential for the reduction of scaphoid non-union is an increased awareness amongst younger men. There is also potential for improved accuracy in the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures (better clinical tests, the use of radiographs, CTs and MRIs) in order to identify the fracture and evaluate dislocation at the initial injury. Early diagnosis and treatment of fractures and non-unions will reduce the development of degenerative wrist changes.
