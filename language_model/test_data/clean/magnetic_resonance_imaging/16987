Chondromyxoid fibromas account for <1% of primary bone neoplasms. We report one such case occurring in the distal fibula of a 27-year-old woman. The patient underwent curettage, followed by phenolisation, insertion of a Steinmann pin, and cementation. This treatment reduced morbidity, restored stability, and enabled rapid functional recovery. There was no recurrence after 2 years.
