A novel application of neurophysiological monitoring enabled us safely to anesthetize and position a child with severe lumbosacral spine flexion for diagnostic MRI and CT scan. We conducted a propofol-based anesthetic to optimize somatosensory (SSEP) and transcranial electric motor (tceMEP) evoked potential amplitudes, thereby facilitating dynamic neurological monitoring while fully extending the patient supine. In cases outside the operating room involving extraordinary changes in patient position, anesthesia providers may consider utilizing neurophysiological monitoring.
