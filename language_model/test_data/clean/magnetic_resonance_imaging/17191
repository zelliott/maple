Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a core component of clinical management and scientific research in multiple sclerosis (MS), providing essential information about tissue structure and function. MRI is now the most important laboratory diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring technology. A number of conventional MRI techniques, which include T2-weighted, T1-weighted, and gadolinium-enhanced imaging, are used to identify overt lesions and quantify tissue atrophy. MRI is highly sensitive in detecting brain and spinal cord involvement in MS and can visualize multifocal lesions, occult disease, and macroscopic atrophy. Advanced MRI techniques, such as magnetization transfer imaging, spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging, and functional MRI, have added to our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. The precise role of these newer imaging approaches continues to be defined. In this supplement to the Journal of Neuroimaging, the authors review the role of conventional and advanced MRI techniques in detecting tissue changes in MS, diagnosing and monitoring patients, and charting the progression of disease in new and established patients.
