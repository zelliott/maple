Cavernous angiomas are responsible for intracranial hemorrhages, but bleeding is infrequently confined to the subarachnoid space.

We describe an elderly, yet healthy man who sought medical attention for subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Vascular imaging failed to reveal a cerebral aneurysm, however magnetic resonance imaging done late in the course showed a cavernous angioma, on the surface of the left upper cerebellar peduncle, that had bled.

The so-called "angiography-negative" subarachnoid hemorrhage could have its source in small cavernous angiomas lying on the surface of basal skull brain structures.
