To evaluate the correlations between F-18 FDG uptake imaged with PET/CT and pathological findings in soft tissue lesions.

Fifty-four soft tissue lesions in 47 patients were evaluated. The correlations between the degree of FDG uptake, pathological type and grade, and MRI signal intensity and/or enhancement pattern were evaluated. Tumor FDG uptake was quantified by the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax).

Thirty-one lesions were malignant and twenty-three lesions were benign. The difference between SUVmax in the malignant and benign groups was statistically significant (p<0.001). Malignant myxoid lesions and well differentiated liposarcoma showed low FDG uptake. Benign neurogenic lesions showed low FDG uptake while malignant neurogenic tumors showed high FDG uptake, and the difference between SUVmax in the benign and malignant lesions was statistically significant (p<0.001). In a neurofibromatosis type-1 patient who had multiple neurogenic tumors, FDG-PET/CT could distinguish malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors from other benign lesions with similar MRI findings.

FDG-PET/CT is useful for differentiating malignant from benign soft tissue lesions, but malignant soft tissue lesions may show various patterns on FDG-PET, and MRI may be helpful for a differential diagnosis.
