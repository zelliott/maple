Schwannomas are peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Schwannomas arising in the sciatic nerve are considered a rare condition. Their symptomatology usually mimics sciatic pain due to a herniated disc, which can delay the diagnosis. We report the case of a patient with chronic sciatica in whom Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination of the right thigh revealed a tumor of the sciatic nerve. Excision of the tumor was easily performed without neural lesioning. Histopathological examination revealed the tumor to be a schwannoma. No neurologic deficit was noted postoperatively which confirms the good prognosis of this tumor.
