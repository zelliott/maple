We present a case of thrombophlebitis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with Crohn's disease after intestinal perforation and prolonged indwelling of a catheter in the IVC. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal thickening and enhancement of the IVC wall. In addition, IVC thrombus formation was shown. The abnormal enhancement extended from the wall in the pericaval tissue and into the retroperitoneum, and regressed as the Crohn's disease subsided.
