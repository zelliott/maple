The authors report a case of ossificans myositis, in which MRI showed inflammatory changes of the adjacent bone. T1 weighted fat saturation sequence with gadolinium injection showed enhancement of medullary and cortical bone. This potentially mistaking pattern must be known, to avoid misdiagnosing with malignant osseous tumor, specially before achievement of the characteristic pattern of zonal maturation and its calcified rim.
