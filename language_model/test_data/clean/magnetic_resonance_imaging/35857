A rat tumor model was used to evaluate the ability of ferrite-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to demonstrate hepatic metastases smaller than 1 cm. Twenty-eight rat livers were inoculated with 5 X 10(5) mammary carcinoma cells and imaged with a 0.6-T MR system. Non-enhanced and ferrite-enhanced images were analyzed and correlated with autopsy findings for each rat. Lesion detection rates correlated closely with cancer-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratios. Ferrite-enhanced MR imaging demonstrated significantly more lesions than non-enhanced imaging (P less than .05) and decreased the threshold size for lesion detectability (less than 2 mm). Ferrite also enabled more accurate measurements of the lesions (r = .96).
