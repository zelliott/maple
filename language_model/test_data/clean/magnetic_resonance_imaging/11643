We report a case of rare birth injury leading to physeal fracture after a routine cesarean delivery. Because plain radiographics are often normal, therefore these physeal fractures usually present a diagnostic challenge in the newborn. In this case, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging were helpful in making an early accurate diagnosis. The infant received prompt treatment and the physeal fracture healed uneventfully. Physeal fractures should be included in the birth injuries following routine cesarean delivery.
