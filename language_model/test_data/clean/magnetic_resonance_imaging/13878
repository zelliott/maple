A computational neuroscience framework is proposed to better understand the role and the neuronal correlate of spatial attention modulation in visual perception. The model consists of several interconnected modules that can be related to the different areas of the dorsal and ventral paths of the visual cortex. Competitive neural interactions are implemented at both microscopic and interareal levels, according to the biased competition hypothesis. This hypothesis has been experimentally confirmed in studies in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques and also in single-cell recording studies in monkeys. Within this neuro-dynamical approach, numerical simulations are carried out that describe both the fMRI and the electrophysiological data. The proposed model draws together data of different spatial and temporal resolution, as are the above-mentioned imaging and single-cell results.
