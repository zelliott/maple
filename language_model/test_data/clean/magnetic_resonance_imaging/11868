It is unusual for a medulloblastoma to occur in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). Four of the total 63 cases of medulloblastoma managed in our department between 1988 to 1998, presented with a mass in the cerebellopontine angle. There were two children amongst these four patients, aged eight and nine years. The other two patients were young adults. Three patients had primary CPA medulloblastoma, while the fourth case had a recurrence in this region, following the excision of the primary vermian tumour. All the four cases were managed by gross total microsurgical excision and craniospinal irradiation. One of the two children, developed subfrontal recurrence after 1 year and 8 months of initial treatment, while the other child developed a large recurrence at primary site, within three months of post-operative irradiation. However, the adult patient developed CPA recurrence and subsequent cervical intramedullary metastasis within two and a half years of diagnosis. These three cases succumbed to their disease, between three months to thirty months of their initial management. However the fourth patient, a 20 years female with desmoplastic variant, was well at two and a half years of follow up.
