Hemangiomas of bone are rare tumors in the facial region. In our own case, magnetic resonance imaging showed unique linear high-signal-intensity internal components in T1-weighted images. The histological study demonstrated that adipose tissue occurring in the stroma of the tumor caused the high signal intensity in T1-weighted images. We employed a vascularized calvarial bone flap to reconstruct the malar eminence after resection of the tumor.
