Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne multisystem disorder that may present as self-limiting early or persistent chronic diseases of the skin, nervous system, joints, heart, and other organs. Cardiac involvement has mainly been reported as acute atrioventricular conduction disturbances or transient ventricular dysfunction.

We treated a patient with clinical signs of acute myopericarditis and serologic evidence of Lyme borreliosis confirmed by silver staining of endomyocardial biopsy specimens and indium 111-monoclonal antimyosin antibody scan, which we believe has not been reported previously. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging revealed epicardial and myocardial areas of increased intensity.

Indium 111-monoclonal antimyosin antibody scanning and magnetic resonance imaging might play an additional important role in assessing and confirming the diagnosis of Lyme carditis in the presence of clinical symptoms and positive serologic findings.
