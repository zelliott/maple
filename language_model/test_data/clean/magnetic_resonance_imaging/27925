Sixty-two patients with anterior shoulder dislocations were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After a primary dislocation, 30 patients showed 23 (77%) tears of the glenoid labrum, 13 (45%) anterior-inferior separation of the capsula, 24 (83%) Hill-Sachs lesions, 6 fractures of the greater tuberosity and 4 glenoid rim fractures. Thirty-two patients with recurrent shoulder dislocation had 14 (44%) tears and 15 (47%) defects of the glenoid labrum, 16 (50%) anterior-inferior separation of the capsula, 28 (88%) Hill-Sachs lesions and 3 glenoid rim fractures. MRI permits complete non-invasive documentation of glenohumeral instability if joint effusion is present. In the absence of joint effusion, diagnostic accuracy can be improved by application of a contrast medium.
