The case of a patient with profound retrograde and minor anterograde amnesia is described and used to discuss the kind of brain damage which will most likely result in persistent retrograde amnesia as the principal symptom. The patient was an industrial manager who had fallen off a horse four years prior to the present neuropsychological and neuroradiological investigation. MRI examination revealed an injury to both temporal poles and to the latero-ventral portion of the right prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal and temporal cortical damage on the right side deeply invaded the white matter while the temporal cortical damage on the left side was much smaller; here, however, portions of the temporo-parietal transition zone were affected as well. The patient was of average intelligence. His attention, short-term memory, and learning ability were average or somewhat below average. His old memories were severely affected in the personal-episodic domain, and much less so in that of semantic remote memory. We conclude from this case that the necessary anatomical substrate for the retrieval of old episodic memories lies within the anterior temporal regions (including deeper situated fiber projections) and possibly involves an interaction with the prefrontal cortex, and that this damage is dissociable from the medial temporal-lobe damage leading to anterograde amnesia.
