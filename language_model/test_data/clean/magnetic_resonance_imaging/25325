Intracerebral amyloidoma is the least common form of amyloid deposition in the brain. CT and MR imaging features in a case of pathologically proved cerebral amyloidoma are presented, and the available literature is reviewed. Typical imaging features of this entity include solitary or multiple supratentorial white matter masses that are hyperattenuated on nonenhanced CT. They have little or no mass effect on surrounding structures, extend medially up to the lateral ventricle wall, and have fine, irregular, enhancing margins.
