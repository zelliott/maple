Hallervorden-Spatz disease (HSD) is a rare disorder characterized by progressive motor dysfunction and dementia. Dystonia is the most prominent and disabling symptom, responding only to a modest extent to pharmacological therapy. At the moment, only a few cases have been reported to improve dystonia and even fewer to resolve status dystonicus for a longer period in children. The authors present the case of a 10-year-old boy who had progressive generalized dystonia, resulting in spontaneous femur fracture and life-threatening swallowing and respiratory disability. As a rescue solution, staged bilateral pallidothalamotomy was performed. Postoperatively, Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale and Dystonia Disability Rating Scale improved (from 116 and 30 points to 41 and 18 points, respectively) and painful dystonia was resolved, which was still continuous 4 years later (47 and 20 points). Stereotactic staged bilateral pallidothalamotomy should be considered as a potential treatment in the management of life-threatening generalized dystonia related to HSD.
