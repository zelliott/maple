Perisylvian regions important for auditory processing include Heschl's gyrus (HG), the planum temporale (PT), the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), and the posterior ascending ramus (PAR). Sex-linked differences in language functions and anatomy have been suggested. To examine sex-linked differences, the authors used MRI to measure HG, PT, pSTG, and PAR volumes. Sex differences were found in right HG and right pSTG volumes but not in the left volumes of these structures. For the PT, there were sex differences in asymmetry; women exhibited leftward asymmetry of the PT, whereas men did not exhibit PT asymmetry. These findings suggest that there are sex-linked differences in the anatomy of primary and association auditory cortices.
