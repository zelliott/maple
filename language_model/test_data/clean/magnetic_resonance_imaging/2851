MR imaging was used to determine the presence or absence of cavernous malformations in three generations of family members. The presenting child (proband) had sustained a symptomatic hemorrhage. Multiple malformations were identified in his father, in an older sibling, and in an asymptomatic grandfather. The father's brother had died from cavernous malformation-related intracerebral hemorrhage. Increasing numbers of malformations were found with increasing patient age, suggesting that MR-apparent lesions may grow in number as a result of repetitive small hemorrhages over time.
