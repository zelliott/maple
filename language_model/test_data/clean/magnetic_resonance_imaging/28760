Femoral arteries are the preferred site of peripheral cannulation for arterial inflow in type A aortic dissection operations. The presence of aortoiliac aneurysms, severe peripheral occlusive disease, atherosclerosis of the femoral vessels, and distal extension of the aortic dissection may preclude their utilization. Axillary artery cannulation may represent a valid alternative in these circumstances.

Between January 15, 1989, and August 20, 1998, in our institution, 22 of 152 operations (14.4%) for acute type A aortic dissection were performed with the use of the axillary artery for the arterial inflow. Axillary artery cannulation was undertaken in the presence of femoral arteries bilaterally compromised by dissection in 12 patients (54.5%), abdominal aorta and peripheral aneurysm in 5 patients (22.7%), severe atherosclerosis of both femoral arteries in 3 patients (13. 6%), and aortoiliac occlusive disease in 2 patients (9.1%). In all patients, distal anastomosis was performed with an open technique after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Retrograde cerebral perfusion was used in 9 patients (40.9%).

Axillary artery cannulation was successful in all patients. The left axillary artery was cannulated in 20 patients (90.9%), and the right axillary artery was cannulated in 2 patients (9.1%). Axillary artery cannulation followed an attempt of femoral artery cannulation in 15 patients (68. 2%). All patients survived the operation, and no patient had a cerebrovascular accident. No axillary artery thrombosis, no brachial plexus injury, and no intraoperative malperfusion were recorded in this series. Two patients (9.1%) died in the hospital of complications not related to axillary artery cannulation.

In patients with type A aortic dissection in whom femoral arteries are acutely or chronically diseased, axillary artery cannulation represents a safe and effective means of providing arterial inflow during cardiopulmonary bypass.
