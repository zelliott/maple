In this report, we present and discuss the signal intensity of brain metastases from colon cancer on both T1- and T2-weighted images. In five of 6 cases, metastases were seen as markedly hypointense areas on T2-weighted images. This finding should alert one to the possibility of a primary cancer of the colon. Some haemorrhagic metastases from other malignancies also showed marked hypointensity. They usually exhibited hyperintensity on T1-weighted images. A case of colon metastasis was also haemorrhagic, and in this case a hyperintense area was observed on T1-weighted images. The marked hypointense area corresponded to peripheral necrosis and probably some viable tumour. Aetiologically, such hypointensity was not induced by severe fibrosis, calcification or excessive iron deposition.
