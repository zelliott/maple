Peliosis is a rare condition of multiple blood-filled cysts within the parenchyma of a solid organ. Splenic peliosis is an extremely rare entity, although there is often a risk of spontaneous rupture. We present a case where our otherwise fairly healthy patient presented us with a diagnosis dilemma and was then found to have splenic peliosis histologically post-splenectomy. We discuss the current available literature and emphasise the importance of awareness of such a condition.
