Thirty-four cases of infantile subdural effusion (ISE) were reviewed in relation to surgical treatment and its prognosis during an average of 4 years of extended follow-up. The surgical indications were determined mainly by the size of the ISE on computed tomography (CT) scan and by metrizamide CT cisternography (MCTC). Consequently, 18 cases were categorized as type A according to MCTC, including 11 cases (61.1%) of ISE CT grade 1. All type A cases were closely observed. This nontreatment regimen yielded excellent results in 15 cases (83.3%). For 10 cases categorized as type B according to MCTC, including 5 cases (50%) of ISE CT grade 3, surgical treatment was indicated and excellent results were obtained in 8 cases (80%). For 6 cases categorized as type C according to MCTC and as ISE CT grade 3, surgery yielded excellent results in 4 cases (66.7%). Antiepileptic drugs have been given to three (27.3%) of the 11 patients who had convulsive attacks. In conclusion, the surgical indications for ISE were based mainly on MCTC in addition to the clinical course, and it is emphasized that, in the early stages, surgery on ISE cases categorized as MCTC types B and C is necessary.
