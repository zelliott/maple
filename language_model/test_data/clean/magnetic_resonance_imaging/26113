A case of delayed paraplegia caused by a gradual and progressive collapse of a vertebra after healing of pyogenic spondylitis is reported. A 73-year-old man was treated for a hematogenously seeded pyogenic spondylitis of the first lumbar vertebra. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a high signal intensity of the involved vertebra and adjacent discs and a paravertebral abscess without disc space narrowing. Eight months after healing of the infection, the patient had muscle weakness and paresthesia of the lower extremities, which gradually increased. The plane radiographs revealed a kyphotic deformity of 36 degrees with a collapse of the first lumbar vertebra.
