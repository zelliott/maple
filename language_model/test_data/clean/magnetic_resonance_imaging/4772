Congenital mesoblastic nephroma was originally believed to be a universally benign neoplasm. More recently, aggressive congenital mesoblastic nephromas have been described with local recurrence and/or metastases. We report two patients with documented congenital mesoblastic nephroma which later metastasized to the brain.
