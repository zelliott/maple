The diagnosis of most volumetric processes of the brain presents no difficulty today; however, there are a number of brain diseases whose clinical manifestations are similar to those of tumors. Despite the development of neurovisualization techniques (application of currently available computer and magnetic resonance tomographs and special programs, such as MR imaging and CT spectroscopy, diffusion and perfusion, etc.), some of these processes are difficult to differentiate from neoplasms noninvasively. It is evident that treatment policy should be quite different in these or those cases. Neuronal nodular heterotopy (ectopy) may be considered as one of such pseudotumorous processes. This case illustrates the rare abnormality that has the clinical and X-ray picture similar to that of neoplasms of the brain. Current noninvasive method do not always allow one to significantly verify the nature of brain tissue changes, which shows it necessary to use CT-stereotactic biopsy in some cases.
