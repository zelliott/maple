A man with complaint of soreness in the right medial ankle underwent three-phase bone scintigraphy; the results of the study suggested chronic active osteomyelitis or cellulitis, he was on antibiotics and was not experiencing any improvement. MR imaging confirmed Achilles tendon rupture. This case illustrates that a positive three-phase study is non-specific disease entity.
