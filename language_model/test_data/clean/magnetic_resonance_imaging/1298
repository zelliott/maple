Magnetic resonance (MR) images of a patient with primary malignant lymphoma of the thyroid gland and Hashimoto thyroiditis are presented. On T1-weighted images the intensity of the thyroid lymphoma was similar to that of Hashimoto thyroiditis. On T2-weighted images the thyroid lymphoma was seen as a homogeneous area of high intensity compared with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Magnetic resonance was equal to CT in diagnosing and staging of primary thyroid lymphoma. Direct coronal images of MR were useful in planning the radiation port.
