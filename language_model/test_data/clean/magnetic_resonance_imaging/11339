To evaluate first-pass renal perfusion with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles by MRI, 40 normal rats (20 Dark Agouti (DA) rats and 20 Brown Norway (BN) rats) and 16 transplanted rats (12 allografts and four isografts) were studied on day 4 post-transplantation with different USPIO doses (3.0-18.1 mg Fe/kg/body weight). All animals underwent 128 consecutive snapshot fast low-angle shot (FLASH) coronal dynamic studies in 43 s. In the normal rats, a larger maximum signal decrease (MSD) in the cortex and the outer medulla is observed with an increasing dose of USPIO particles (P < 0.01). No significant differences were observed between the right and left kidneys at all doses studied. Higher MSD, time of occurrence of MSD (tMSD), and wash-in slope appear with higher doses of USPIO particles. The dynamic curves for DA rats show similar shapes when compared to those for BN rats. In the transplanted rats, allograft kidneys show lower MSD, longer tMSD, and lower wash-in slope compared to those in the normal kidneys. Isograft kidneys show perfusion patterns similar to those of normal kidneys in the cortex and the outer medulla. Histopathology indicates acute vascular rejection in all allografts and normal kidney architecture in all isografts. The results clearly show good agreement between the renal graft perfusion measurements and histopathological changes associated with rejection. This work also introduces a new signal analysis methodology for the automatic detection of transplanted organ rejection. This method compares the dynamics of the intrarenal signal intensities for native and transplanted kidneys. A quantitative measurement to detect significant differences between these signals was developed, and showed that this technique exhibits good performance in identifying renal rejection.
