The authors report a case of unilateral xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, associated with chronic lithiasis studied by standard clinical magnetic resonance imaging protocol and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) and tractography were reconstructed on both healthy and pathologic kidney. ADC and FA values are in agreement with the literature. Tractography reconstruction of tubular renal architecture was confirmed by histology. This result suggests the potential ability of DTI to detect structural alterations in the architecture of the kidney, as noninvasive tool, preceding the onset of clinical-laboratory alterations.
