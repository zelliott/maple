A 59-year-old man had a 2-month history of nonfluctuating encephalopathy. He initially presented acutely with fevers, headaches, and word-finding difficulties. The sedimentation rate was elevated with a bland CSF and normal MRI head. Body CT showed diffuse pulmonary interstitial thickening with patchy opacification. Following treatment for pneumonia, there was resolution of fevers. No infectious etiology was identified. Within days of discharge, he developed bilateral uveitis, which was successfully treated with corticosteroid eyedrops and oral acyclovir. One month later, he developed confusion and unsteadiness. Repeat MRI was reportedly normal; body CT showed resolution of lung changes but diffuse lymphadenopathy persisted. A lymph node biopsy, reviewed at our institution, showed nonspecific reactive changes and fibrosis. Due to progressive encephalopathy and worsening headaches 2 months after symptom onset, the patient presented to our institution. On examination, he scored 30/38 on the Kokmen short test of mental status,(1) losing points for attention and immediate and delayed recall. Funduscopy revealed bilateral disc edema. He had mild appendicular ataxia and impaired tandem walk. The remainder of the examination was normal.
