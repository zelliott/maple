This retrospective analysis of the clinical records of 42 patients was used to study the clinical significance of a classification system for posterior petrous meningiomas. According to clinical manifestations and radiological images, posterior petrous meningiomas were classified into three types: type I (cerebella type; 12 patients), tumours involved and compressed the cerebellum; type II (cranial nerve type; 16 patients), tumours involved the cranial nerves; and type III (combined type; 14 patients), tumours involved more than one structure such as the cerebellum, cranial nerves and the brain stem. All patients underwent microneurosurgery and the total resection rate was 90%. It was more difficult totally to resect type II and III tumours than type I tumours and the post-operative functional outcomes were worse. Microneurosurgical techniques and skills are critical to increase the total resection rate of posterior petrous meningiomas in order to decrease the mortality and disability rates.
