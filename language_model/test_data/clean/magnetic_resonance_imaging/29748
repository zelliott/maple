Unilateral hydrocephalus caused by occlusion of the foramen of Monro is rare. We report two cases in neonates caused by prenatal hemorrhage, their radiographic findings, and surgical treatment. With posthemorrhagic progressive unilateral hydrocephalus, early intervention with fenestration of septum pellucidum should be considered.
