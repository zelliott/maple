Meningiomas are recognized as the most common late complication following radiotherapy. However, cytogenetic studies in childhood atypical radiation-induced meningioma are sporadic, mainly because this condition generally occurs after a long latent period. In the present study we show the results of conventional and molecular cytogenetics in a 14-year-old boy with a secondary atypical meningioma. Apart from numerical changes, we found complex aberrations with the participation of chromosomes 1, 6 and 12. The invariable presence of loss of 1p was demonstrated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with probes directed to telomeric regions and by comparative genome hybridization (CGH). Previous cytogenetic studies on adult spontaneous and radiation-associated meningiomas showed loss of chromosome 22 as the most frequent change, followed by loss of the short arm of chromosome 1. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of highly complex chromosome aberrations in the pediatric setting of meningioma.
