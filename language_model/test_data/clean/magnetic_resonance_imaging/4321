A 55-year-old woman with a 12-year history of a painful nodule in the subcutaneous fat layer of the plantar arch was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging, followed by excisional biopsy. Pathology revealed a glomus tumor, which is extremely rare in the plantar surface of the foot. The magnetic resonance imaging studies are presented. The literature on glomus tumors in the foot is reviewed. This entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of solitary plantar nodules when marked sensitivity to temperature or pressure is exhibited.
