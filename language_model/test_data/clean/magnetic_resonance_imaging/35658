This case report describes a 20-year-old elite-level Australian Rules football player who suffered three unilateral hamstring injuries within a 2 month period. The first two episodes were managed conservatively. Magnetic resonance imaging following the third episode revealed full thickness disruption of the proximal musculotendinous junction of the biceps femoris long head and semitendinosus muscles and the common proximal (conjoint) tendon. The injury was subsequently surgically repaired. At 16 months following surgery, the player had successfully completed a full competitive season of elite-level Australian Rules football symptom free. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the repaired tendon to be uniformly hypointense in keeping with reparative granulation tissue formation and restoration of normal muscle morphology. These findings are consistent with an intact repair. The case demonstrates that complete functional and radiological resolution is possible following surgical repair of significant hamstring musculotendinous junction tears.
