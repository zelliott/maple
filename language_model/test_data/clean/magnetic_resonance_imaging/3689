Although the lateral segment (LS) from the split-liver of a deceased donor or a live donor can increase the organ pool of pediatric patients awaiting liver transplantation, the shortage of organ donation in Asia countries is still serious and results in high death rates of pediatric patients. The medial segment (MS) of the liver is sacrificed during the standard technique of splitting a whole liver into an LS and an extended right liver because the cutting sites of portal vein, hepatic artery and bile duct are all in the bifurcation of the liver hilum to have adequate length of vascular and biliary pedicles for easier grafting. However, the surgical techniques of vascular and biliary reconstructions for liver transplantation, particularly from the experiences of living donor liver transplantation, have been much improved in the last decade. Therefore it may be possible for an additional MS of the liver to be an isolated graft for a small recipient on the premise that grafts of right lobe (RL) and LS are minimally injured. In light of detailed reviews of anatomies of hepatic arteries, hepatic veins, portal veins and bile ducts, the dissection and reconstruction of vessels and bile ducts for the MS can possibly be performed if the extra-hepatic length of the artery to the MS is long enough. As the artery for the MS, middle hepatic artery (MHA), usually derives from a branch of the left hepatic artery and often in the liver parenchyma, the length is usually too short to be reconstructed. If the MHA for the MS is isolated and its extra-hepatic length is more than 1cm, triple liver grafts from a deceased whole liver, consisting of the RL, MS and LS may be possible. The anatomies of the hepatic artery in abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for live liver donors in our institution were retrospectively analyzed. The results showed that three types of hepatic arterial anatomies could be considered for possible recovery of triple segments: type I is an accessory left gastric artery to feed the lateral segment; type II is an isolated MHA; type III is an early bifurcation of the left hepatic artery and MHA.
