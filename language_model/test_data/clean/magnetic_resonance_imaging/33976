Dirofilariasis is a helminthic zoonosis occurring in many parts of the world. We report the findings in a 61-year-old woman who had painless right exophthalmos caused by orbital dirofilariasis. A vivid worm was embedded inside an inflammatory nodule in the right orbit. On T1-weighted MR images, the parasite was visible as a discrete, low-intensity, tubular signal in the center of the nodule surrounded by contrast-enhancing inflammatory tissue.
