To evaluate optic disc morphologic features in children with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL).

Seventeen children with PVL (patient group) were compared with 17 sex- and age-matched, full-term healthy control children (control group). Clinical ophthalmological examination and digital image analysis of fundus photographs were performed in all children. In children with PVL, cerebral imaging was performed.

Children with PVL had larger optic disc cupping (P<.02) than did control children. A large proportion of the children with PVL had strabismus, nystagmus, and restricted visual fields.

Our study indicates that optic nerve hypoplasia in children with PVL is often associated with a normal-sized optic disc with a large cup. This unusual form of optic nerve hypoplasia most likely results from transsynaptic degeneration of optic axons caused by the primary bilateral lesion in the optic radiation.
