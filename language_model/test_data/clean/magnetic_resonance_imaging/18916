The computer-assisted surgery system is a complex system. All of the errors can be attributed to the loss of correspondence between the world coordinate system in the operation room and the virtual world coordinate system obtained from the multi-model medical images. The system's accuracy is composed of the accuracy of the localizer and that of registration. In order to improve the system accuracy, we analyse most of the possible error sources. The accuracy of the localizer affects deeply the registration between the intra-operation and pre-operation data. The localizer is the most basic and important part for a computer-assisted surgery system. We give a comprehensive possible error source at the end of the paper.
