The contribution of vascular pathology to the rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear.

To ascertain the relative roles of cerebral white matter disease and medial temporal atrophy (MTA) in predicting progression from MCI to AD.

MCI patients with baseline MRI and â‰¥18 months of longitudinal follow-up were evaluated. DSM-IV-TR criteria were used to diagnose conversion to dementia. MTA and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) were quantified using the Scheltens scale and modified Fazekas scale.

Of a total of 171 MCI patients, 79 patients with baseline MRI and longitudinal follow-up were studied. Twenty-three MCI patients who progressed to dementia (MCI-P) were identified corresponding to a 19.4% annual risk of conversion. In MCI-P patients, the mean Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment decline was 1.3 and 2.9 points, respectively. MTA, periventricular WMH and deep subcortical WMH were significantly greater in the MCI-P cohort. WMH was found to predict MCI-P with an odds ratio of 7.69 (p = 0.03).

MTA and deep subcortical WMH independently predict conversion from MCI to AD. Optimization of vascular risk factors among patients with MCI can potentially reduce the conversion from MCI to AD.
