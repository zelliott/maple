Femoral fractures following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are rare. These injuries often are related to increased stresses at the femoral tunnel. Hamstring tendon autograft is often used for ACL reconstruction, and transfemoral fixation is one of many graft fixation techniques with few reported complications. This article reports an atraumatic transverse supracondylar femoral fracture occurring through the transfemoral fixation tract following hamstring ACL reconstruction in a 38-year-old woman.
