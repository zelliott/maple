Insufficiency fracture of the sacrum has been recognized as a major cause of lower back pain, especially in elderly osteoporotic patients with or without underlying malignancy and/or prior pelvic radiotherapy. Its diagnosis cannot be readily made from its nonspecific clinical features. Consequently some cases may be mistaken for bone metastases, causing patients to receive inappropriate diagnostic measures and management. Recognition of the spectrum of imaging features is the basis of correct diagnosis and treatment.

The imaging studies of 14 cases (12 women and 2 men; age range, 60-84 years; mean age, 70 years) of sacral insufficiency fracture were reviewed retrospectively. These included 14 radiographs, six bone scintigraphs, eight computerized tomography (CT) scans and 12 magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies. Six patients had a history of malignancy. Diagnosis was made by characteristic imaging findings, and clinical and radiographic follow-up for one to 3.5 years.

Five cases of sacral insufficiency fracture were suspected based on radiographic findings of fracture lines (2 cases) and focal sclerosis (3 cases). Seven cases were diagnosed by CT findings of linear fractures (7 cases) and focal sclerosis (2 cases). Nine MR examinations demonstrated characteristic vertical bands of marrow edema. A hypointense fracture line was identified in eight cases. The remaining two MR imaging studies disclosed nonspecific focal marrow edema. An early case, which appeared normal on CT scan, showed marrow edema on MR imaging. The positive and diagnostic rates were both 36% for plain radiographs, 88% for CT scans, and 100% and 83%, respectively, for MR images.

Plain radiographs are often unrewarding. Although MR imaging is the most sensitive tool, fracture lines are best demonstrated and diagnosed using CT. Due to the better diagnostic rate, popularity and cost effectiveness, CT is recommended as the definitive modality for confirming diagnosis of insufficiency fracture of the sacrum.
