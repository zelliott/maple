Inverted papilloma (PI) is a benign neoplasm of nose and paranasal sinuses. IP's pathophysiology is characterized by its capacity to be locally destructive, its ability to grow rapidly and its tendency to recur. IP's association with carcinoma is about 13 percent of cases. The surgical treatment of IP has evolved over the years, with a progression toward more radical en bloc extirpation. The paper reports an inverted papilloma case of nasal cavities, with destruction of frontal sinus roof and intracranial extension aside frontal lobe displacement.
