A 4-year-old neutered female terrier-cross was evaluated for an acute onset of paraplegia. Utilizing magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, the cause of the neurologic deficits was determined to be a lumbar intervertebral disc extrusion. The MR study additionally demonstrated parenchymal hyperintensity on T2-weighted images and similarly located diffuse hypointensity on gradient echo images, cranial and caudal to the compressive extradural lesion. Hemorrhagic myelomalacia was suspected based on these MR characteristics, which was subsequently confirmed surgically and histopathologically.
