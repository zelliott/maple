Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulae are extremely rare in spinal dysraphism. A fistulous malformation within a lipomyelomeningocele has not been reported previously. A 50-year-old man presented with progressive paraparesis and bladder dysfunction. MRI revealed a large lumbar lipomyelomeningocele. A vascular malformation was indicated by abnormal signal in the thoracolumbar spinal cord and dilated perimedullary veins. Phase-contrast MRA demonstrated only the slow-flow veins of the fistula and an intradural ascending vein. Contrast-enhanced ultra-fast MRA gave excellent delineation of all parts of the fistula within the dysraphic lesion.
