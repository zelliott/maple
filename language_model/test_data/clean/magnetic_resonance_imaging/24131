To describe exacerbation during pregnancy of cerebellar hemangioblastoma in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.

Case-report. A 21-year-old woman with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome was found on routine ocular examination to have severe papilledema 1 week after giving birth.

Immediate magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a large cerebellar cyst from hemangioblastoma causing cerebellar tonsillar herniation. Immediate neurosurgical intervention was life saving.

Worsening of intracranial hemangioblastoma during pregnancy in cases of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome should be realized and periodic neurologic and ophthalmologic observation is warranted.
