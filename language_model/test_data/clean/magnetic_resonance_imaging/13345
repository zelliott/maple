Stress fractures can represent a diagnostic problem especially in their differentiation from bone tumours. 6 patients with 7 lesions were examined. MRI visualised the stress fractures and established the diagnosis of stress fracture vs. tumour in 6 cases. In the seventh, biopsy having been performed, a tumour was ruled out. MRI is more sensitive than radiography in the detection of stress fractures, showing the characteristic changes earlier. MRI, being a very sensitive method in the diagnosis of stress fractures and a reliable one in their differentiation from bone tumours, can be applied in cases of unusual clinical course and difficult radiological diagnosis prior to biopsy.
