The frequency of SEA is increasing. There are several well-established predisposing factors.

Our case presents certain unusual features that include an association with CD, persistent sterile cultures, and multiple recurrences of lesions at adjacent levels.

A review of the literature showed only 13 case reports of SEA in patients with CD with an additional patient mentioned in one series. Recurrence of SEA at the same location was reported only twice. The diagnostic workup and treatment modalities pertinent to this case are discussed.
