The authors report the case of a 3-year-old boy who suffered from quadriparesis and respiratory distress after failing to execute a somersault properly. Neuroimaging revealed spinal cord contusion with marked spinal canal stenosis at the level of the atlas. No subtle instability, occult fracture, or other congenital abnormalities were confirmed. Spinal cord contusion with marked canal stenosis is rare, and only several adult cases have been reported. Severe stenosis at the level of the atlas may predispose individuals to severe spinal cord contusion, as occurred in our patient after sustaining trivial trauma.
