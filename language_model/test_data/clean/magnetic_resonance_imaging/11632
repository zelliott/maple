We report a case of acute-onset unilateral tinnitus in a 25-year-old woman. Analysis of imaging studies indicated that the tinnitus was likely caused by an acute hemorrhage of a small cavernous angioma that was located adjacent to the contralateral primary auditory cortex. This case provides substantial support for the concept that central tinnitus might indeed represent a pathologic activation of neural networks of nonspecific auditory perception.
