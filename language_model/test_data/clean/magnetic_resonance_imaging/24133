Chondrosarcoma of the nasal septum is a rare, malignant neoplasm. A case is presented that illustrates the evaluation and treatment of this malignancy, reviews the relevant literature, discusses surgical approaches, and assesses adjuvant, nonsurgical therapy.

A craniofacial approach using an extended, bifrontal craniotomy and lateral rhinotomy with medial maxillectomy resulted in gross total resection at surgery. Because permanent sections of bone margins after decalcification were positive, conformal external beam radiation was used.

The patient made a complete recovery, returned to work, and is disease-free 26 months after treatment.

Surgical therapy using an anterior craniofacial resection is the preferred approach. External beam radiation therapy is potentially indicated for the following: positive or close surgical margins on permanent histopathology, extensive tumor with known residual at operation, or local recurrence not amenable to resection. Because of late local recurrence, lifelong follow-up is required.
