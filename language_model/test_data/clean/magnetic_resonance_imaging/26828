Unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) was used to treat three siblings with juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy (jMLD). The efficacy of this therapy was measured over a 5-year period with serial neurological examinations, neuroimaging, nerve conduction studies (NCS), and neuropsychological evaluations (NPE). Outcomes were a function of disease stage at time of UCBT with alteration of disease course occurring in the first 2 years after UCBT and then subsequent halting of progression and stabilization of symptoms and disease.
