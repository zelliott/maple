The visual pathway extends from the globes anteriorly to the occipital cortex posteriorly. A wide variety of disease processes may produce visual dysfunction. Because the optic nerve is a fiber tract of the brain covered by meninges, it can be affected by many of the same pathologic processes that occur in the brain and meninges. Physical examination and diagnostic tests of visual function performed by the clinician can frequently identify the anatomic location of the causative lesion in the patient with vision loss. This enables the radiologist to optimize the imaging evaluation of the patient. This article reviews the normal anatomy of the optic nerve and visual pathways, presents computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques for evaluation of these structures, and discusses the pathologic processes intrinsic to the optic nerve and visual pathways.
