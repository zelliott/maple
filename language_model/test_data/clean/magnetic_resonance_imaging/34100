The purpose of this study was to evaluate interactive MR-guided joint puncture with intra-articular application of contrast agent. MR-guided arthrography of the shoulder joint was successfully performed in three patients using an interactive guidance system implemented in an open-configuration MR system. Visualization of the needle pathway and contrast inflow was comparable to that with conventional X-ray fluoroscopy. The position of the intra-articular needle tip was accurately confirmed and subsequent MR arthrography was diagnostic in all cases.
