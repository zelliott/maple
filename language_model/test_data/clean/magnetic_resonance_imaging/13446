A 35-year-old female patient suffering from epilepsy was examined during status epilepticus with simple partial and complex partial seizures by means of EEG, CT, MRI and ictal SPECT. All these examinations showed focal abnormalities with identical location due to oedema and hypervascularisation; these were, however, absent during examinations carried out before and after status epilepticus.
