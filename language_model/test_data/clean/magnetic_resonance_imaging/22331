Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is the most common fungal pulmonary infection in immunocompromised patients. In this disease, it is hard to diagnose, it's therapy process is variable and mortality is high. Prognosis is even worse in the cases which have cerebral aspergillosis. The patient was following up as a diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia and treating with corticosteroids and azothiopurine. Patient attended our clinic with headache and lose of vision. IPA and cerebral aspergillosis was the diagnosis as his examinations. Amphotericin B lipid complex treatment were given because of pulmonary and cerebral aspergillosis. Voriconazole was the second therapy because of the no response. Voriconazole is more effective in cerebral aspergillosis and treated this patient successfully.
