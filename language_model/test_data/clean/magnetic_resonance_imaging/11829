Atherosclerosis and its thrombotic complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. Despite advances in our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms and new treatment modalities, the absence of an adequate noninvasive method for early detection limits the prevention or treatment of patients with various degrees and localizations of atherothrombotic disease. High-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) has recently emerged as one of the most promising techniques for the noninvasive study of atherothrombotic disease. Most importantly, MR can be used to characterize plaque composition and monitor progression. Thus, MR opens new strategies, ranging from the screening of high-risk patients for early detection and treatment as well as the monitoring of target areas for pharmacological intervention.
