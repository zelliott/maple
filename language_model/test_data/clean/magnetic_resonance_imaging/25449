We describe a case of disseminated infection with a multiple-resistant strain of Nocardia farcinica, probably resulting from direct inoculation during a road traffic accident. Initial presentation was with pulmonary symptoms, with subsequent development of cutaneous, renal, soft tissue and cerebral involvement. Precise microbiological diagnosis was delayed. Once sensitivity test results were available, the patient was stabilised on linezolid and minocycline. Premature withdrawal of therapy at one month resulted in recrudescence of infection, requiring re-institution of treatment. Linezolid was discontinued after a total of 4 months, because of evidence of myelosuppression and visual impairment, which subsequently improved. Monotherapy with minocycline was continued for a total of 12 months. The patient now remains well.
