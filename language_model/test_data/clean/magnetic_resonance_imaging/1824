To report our experience with 3 cases of vertebral sarcoidosis (VS) and review the available literature.

We retrospectively analyzed 3 patients with VS, with special emphasis on radiologic imaging. The literature was reviewed using the MEDLINE database.

In 2 cases, VS was the first manifestation of sarcoidosis. Severe pain was present in all patients. Chest radiographs showed normal results. Therapy with corticosteroids and calcitonin relieved the pain. In 2 patients, the pathologic vertebral magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities normalized with treatment.

Although bone lesions in sarcoidosis may occur throughout the entire skeleton, axial involvement is rare. VS may be the initial presentation of the disease, and pain frequently is present. This condition is usually responsive to glucocorticoids. Magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in monitoring the response to treatment.
