Magnetic resonance imaging is the technique of choice for soft tissue evaluation. Muscle injuries occurring during physical activities are very frequent and are very well appreciated by MR imaging. Associated with 31P spectroscopy, MR imaging allows better understanding of physiopathologic phenomena and inflammatory lesions. An early and correct diagnosis is possible using MR imaging in cases of soft tissue pseudotumors, such as myositis ossificans. The quadriceps and Achilles tendons, which are superficial and thick, can be well evaluated using ultrasonography. Nevertheless, MR imaging is superior for deeply situated tendons and ligaments of the knee and ankle.
