The study of human brain electrophysiology has extended beyond traditional frequency ranges identified by the classical EEG rhythms, encompassing both higher and lower frequencies. Changes in high-gamma-band (>70 Hz) power have been identified as markers of local cortical activity. Fluctuations at infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) frequencies have been associated with functionally significant cortical networks elucidated using fMRI studies. In this study, we examined infra-slow changes in band-limited power across a range of frequencies (1-120 Hz) in the default mode network (DMN). Measuring the coherence in band-limited power fluctuations between spatially separated electrodes makes it possible to detect small, spatially extended, and temporally coherent fluctuating components in the presence of much larger incoherent fluctuations. We show that the default network is characterized by significant high-gamma-band (65-110 Hz) coherence at infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) frequencies. This coherence occurs over a narrow frequency range, centered at 0.015 Hz, commensurate with the frequency of BOLD signal fluctuations seen by fMRI, suggesting that quasi-periodic, infra-slow changes in local cortical activity form the neurophysiological basis for this network.
