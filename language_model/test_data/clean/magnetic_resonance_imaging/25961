Quantifying mitral regurgitation is difficult because of the complexity of the flow, geometry and motion of the mitral valve. In this paper a MRI compatible phantom was built incorporating a left ventricle and mitral valve motion. Valve motion was obtained using a pneumatic piston. The mitral valve was made regurgitant and the regurgitant volume quantified using a modified control volume method. The modification to the method was the addition of mitral motion correction. This was attained by moving the control volume in unison with the mitral valve and by correcting for this motion in the integration of velocity. This correction was found to be simple, in that it represented the volume swept out by the moving control surface. The measured regurgitant volume was compared to a second MR measurement using a single slice technique, made possible by the tubular construction of the phantom's left atrium. Regression analysis between these two methods produced a regression line of y = 0 + 1.02 x; R = 0.97; standard error of the estimate = 3.47 ml.
