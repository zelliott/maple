Utilizing the conceptual combination of brain protective skull base surgery and minimalism, a conventional frontal craniotomy for tumors in the subfrontal and parasellar regions is modified to an orbital roof craniotomy. Through a 4 to 5 centimeter (cm) long eyebrow incision an orbital roof craniotomy (measuring 2 cm by 3 cm), including the supraorbital arch, is made as a single piece bone flap. The orbital roof is opened up to the supraorbital fissure and to the optic canal by additional removal of the bone in the orbital roof. This will expose the globe and the orbitofrontal dura mater. When the dural incision is made at the orbital portion of the dura mater, the orbital contents are retracted by tack-up sutures. The tumor is removed utilizing the orbital space rather than the intracranial space. Brain retractors are not necessary and are not used to execute the tumor resection. This technique has been used in three patients with craniopharyngiomas, seven patients with meningiomas, and one patient with a subfrontal teratoma. Gross total resection was achieved in three patients with craniopharyngiomas and in five patients with subfrontal or parasellar meningiomas. Subtotal resection of the tumor was achieved in two patients with recurrent meningiomas and in the patient with a subfrontal teratoma. The surgeon's operating space through this exposure was sufficiently ample to achieve the goals of the operation. The direct eyebrow incision provides an additional vital working space with a width of more than 1 cm at the skull base by eliminating the scalp flap which a coronal incision employs. The surgical technique is described with a report of 11 cases.
