This study reports the results of MRI analysis of the spinal cord in 83 patients with myelomeningocele. 63 patients had a "tethered cord" or a "suspected tethered cord". In 14 cases we found a "hydro-/syringomyelia". In only 2 cases there were no pathological findings. The influence especially of the "tethered cord" and the "hydro-/syringomyelia" on the development of deformities of the locomotor apparatus is discussed. Concerning this problem the experience reported in the literature is not sufficient enough to make final statements. However, in cases of deterioration of the neurological status in patients with myelomeningocele the influence of intraspinal anomalies should be considered giving rise to further diagnostic examinations.
