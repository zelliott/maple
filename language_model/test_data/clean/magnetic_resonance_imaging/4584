CT, MR and angiographic findings of 6 patients with 9 skull metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were reviewed. In 3 of 6 patients, local pain or neurologic deficit was the initial main manifestation of the disease, although all had been treated for chronic liver disease. In the remaining 3 patients, skull metastases were detected following treatment of HCC. The metastatic lesions appeared as expansile osteolytic masses on CT and as hypervascular masses on angiography. All lesions were demonstrated on MR imaging. Compared with the brain parenchyma, the lesions were iso- or hypointense on T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR images. The lesions were moderately to markedly enhanced by Gd-DTPA. Flow voids were shown in the tumors in 5 lesions. HCC should be included in the differential diagnosis of an osteolytic hypervascular lesion of the skull, especially in Oriental patients. The relatively hypointense tumor on T2-weighted MR images associated with flow void, different from primary skull tumors or directly invasive tumors, may support the diagnosis of HCC metastasis.
