Tailgut cysts, embryological remnants of the hindgut, are rare retrorectal tumours. They have been described in adults but are rare in children, especially neonates. We report a case of a neonate, who presented with anal stenosis and an incidental ultrasonographic finding of a presacral mass. Excision and histological examination of the mass confirmed the appearance of a tailgut cyst. There were no postoperative complications and no evidence of recurrence of the presacral mass over one year after excision. The clinical, pathological, and radiological findings of the tailgut cyst are described with a review of the literature.
