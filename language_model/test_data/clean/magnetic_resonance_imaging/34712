MR imaging showed severe atrophy and large areas without myelination in the brain of a girl with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency. Proton MR spectroscopy revealed mild signal reduction of N-acetylaspartate. After treatment with betaine, a second MR imaging study revealed a decrease in the size of the hypomyelinated zones that was paralleled by improved clinical status and laboratory findings.
