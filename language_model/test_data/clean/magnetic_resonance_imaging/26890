Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a progressive and potentially fatal fibrosing skin disorder found mainly in patients with renal insufficiency. NSF is characterized by thickened and hyperpigmented skin lesions with or without systemic involvement. In essentially all patients, this disease entity has been associated with the administration of gadolinium contrast agents for imaging purposes. Microscopic recognition of this entity remains challenging, as the diagnosis is based on various clinical and histopathologic features that overlap with other fibrosing disorders. No single feature is absolutely specific for NSF. We report a finding of osseous sclerotic bodies with elastin trapping appearing on histopathology in the clinical setting of NSF with hemodialysis-dependent renal failure. Our report of an additional attribute indicative of NSF may aid in making the diagnosis.
