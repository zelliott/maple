We reported a 24-year-old Thai woman who developed primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) associated with acquired immunodeficency syndrome. It was difficult to distinguish PCNSL from toxoplamic encephalitis in this case by clinical symptoms, findings of CT and MRI, and therapeutic responses for toxoplasmosis. It is important to make a definite diagnosis of PCNSL by brain biopsy to treat appropriately, because this disorder could be fatal if it is not treated by corticosteroid, radiation, or other proper methods.
