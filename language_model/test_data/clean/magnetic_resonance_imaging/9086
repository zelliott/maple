We report a case of two pseudolymphomas of the liver in a 63-year-old Japanese woman with primary biliary cirrhosis. One of the lesions was found incidentally during a medical examination, presenting as a 10 mm hypodense nodule that revealed hyperdensity in the early phase and hypodensity in the late phase in computed tomography (CT) after injection of contrast medium. Retrospectively, the 10 mm nodule had first been discovered as a 4 mm nodule during CT 4 years previously. Superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced MRI revealed another 4 mm hyperintense nodule in segment 6 in addition to the 10 mm hyperintense nodule in segment 7. CT during arterial portography revealed two hypointense nodules. Findings with other imaging modalities such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and hepatic angiography were consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma. A right posterior segmentectomy was performed, and the lesions were microscopically diagnosed as pseudolymphoma. To the best of our knowledge, only 31 other cases of this disease have ever been reported, with a highly asymmetrical male:female ratio of 1:9.7. Although we could find only one case of transformation of hepatic pseudolymphoma into lymphoma in the liver, the exact nature of development from benign pseudolymphoma to malignant lymphoma is still not fully understood and cases of hepatic lymphoma need to be followed carefully.
