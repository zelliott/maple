To assess of the value of conservative and operative treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee, a multicenter study was performed. In 12 European countries, 798 cases of osteochondritis of the knee have been collected from 44 hospitals. Results were based on 452 patients with 509 affected knees with minimum follow-up was 1 year (mean follow-up, 3 years and 11 months) and sufficient data for evaluation: 61% were male patients; 39% female patients; 318 affected knees were found in juvenile patients; 191 affected knees were in adult or premature patients. The localization was the medial femoral condyle on the lateral side in 51% (typical site) of patients. Various other sites were involved. Of the 509 affected knees, 154 were treated conservatively, 355 were treated surgically (many with multiple operations). For evaluation, the initial situation (at the time of the diagnosis) was favorable in 198 patients (no effusion, diameter of the lesion < 20 mm and no gross dissection on imaging) and unfavorable (one of the parameters did not meet these prerequisites) in 311 patients. The results were better in young patients than in adult patients. However, in the adolescent group, 22% of patients had abnormal knee at follow-up. The classical localization has a better prognosis than an unusual one. Patients with a favorable situation at diagnosis have significantly better results after conservative treatment than those who have undergone operation. When there are signs of dissection, the results are better after operative than after conservative treatment.
