To present computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC) at initial presentation (IP) and recurrent disease (RD).

We studied 15 consecutive female patients (age range, 47-83 years; mean, 66.2 years) with pathologically proven PPC who underwent CT and/or MRI between July 2000 and December 2005. Preoperative radiological evaluation and postoperative follow-up was done with CT and/or magnetic resonance studies. All CT and MRI studies were evaluated retrospectively, independently, and blindly by 2 radiologists for the imaging findings of PPC.

The imaging findings were as follows: ascites, 2 of 2 at IP, 9 of 10 at RD; peritoneal thickening and enhancement, 1 of 2 at IP, 9 of 10 at RD; peritoneal nodules or bulky mass lesions, 1 of 2 at IP, 8 of 10 at RD; lymph node involvement, 1 of 2 at IP, 3 of 10 at RD; and distant metastases, 1 of 10 at RD.

Ascites, peritoneal thickening and enhancement, and peritoneal nodules or bulky mass lesions were the most frequent findings of PPC. Recurrent disease revealed similar findings compared with the IP.
