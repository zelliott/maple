To accurately quantify liver function using gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MR imaging.

A total of 105 patients with suspicion of a hepatic tumor (Child–Pugh scores: 5 in 56, 6 in 26, 7 in 20, and 8 in 3) who underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging and an indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICG-R15) evaluation were retrospectively analyzed. The hepatobiliary images were taken at 20 min after Gd-EOB-DTPA injection. The quantitative liver–spleen contrast ratio (Q-LSC) was measured by calculating the signal intensity of the spleen and 12 intrahepatic points consisting of each central zone (near the porta hepatis) and peripheral zone (near the subcapsular zone) in the two main liver lobes.

Each averaged Q-LSC of six points in the central zone or right lobe was significantly higher than that in the peripheral zone or left lobe regardless of hepatic function. The mean Q-LSC of the 12 points was significantly correlated with the ICG-R15 and significantly decreased with elevation of the Child–Pugh score.

The hepatic enhancement by Gd-EOB-DTPA is influenced by zonal and lobar differences. This method with consideration of regional differences is valid for estimation of liver function by Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging.
