In a 19-year-old patient with status epilepticus arising in the right parietal neocortex, unenhanced ictal MRI showed abnormalities mainly in the right cerebral cortex, contralateral cerebellum, and ipsilateral thalamus. The thalamus is considered a key site of functional abnormality in this patient.
