Compartment syndromes of the scapula and pelvic girdle have received scant attention in the literature. In 1938, Comolli first described a clinical sign which he considered specific to fracture of the scapula. We report data on two patients, one presenting with prolonged pressure on the posterior surface of the scapula and the other with symptoms associated with scapular fracture. In one of these patients we were able to measure pressures around the scapula, perform neurophysiological assessment of nerve function and produce magnetic resonance images of the area. In the other case, surgical exploration revealed an established ischaemic contracture of the infraspinatus muscle within its compartment. These findings suggest that the muscles around the scapula are vulnerable to the development of compartment syndrome.
