We present a rare case of mesenteric lipoblastoma in a 16-month-old girl. The US, CT and MRI features of this unusual tumour are described and correlated with the pathology findings. MRI more clearly suggested the presence of fat components in the tumour. In addition, multiplanar MR images demonstrated the anatomical extent better, which was essential for successful complete tumour excision.
