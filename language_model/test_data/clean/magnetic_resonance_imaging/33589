To determine whether contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can detect ethanol hepatotoxicity in rats.

Rats were treated with a single high dose of ethanol (acute) intraperitoneally or with a 36% ethanol diet (chronic) for up to 5.5 months. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after intravenous administration of manganese dipyridoxal diphosphate (Mn-DPDP).

Enhancement (acute group) was significantly lower in ethanol treated animals on T1-weighted scans (P < .02). Precontrast, a significant difference in intensity was seen on T2-weighted scans (P < .01). Electron microscopy revealed severe hepatocyte damage. In the chronic groups, there was no significant difference in intensity precontrast. Postcontrast, enhancement (ethanol group) was significantly lower on T1-weighted scans only at 2 weeks (P < .05). Electron microscopy demonstrated progressive ethanol hepatotoxicity.

Magnetic resonance imaging can distinguish between normal and certain types of ethanol damaged livers on T1-weighted scans. Enhancement, however, does not correlate with progressive microscopic liver damage.
