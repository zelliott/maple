To evaluate the computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features of dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT).

Six CT studies (four with contrast material enhancement) and 10 MR imaging studies (seven with gadolinium enhancement) obtained in 10 patients with a history of seizures and pathologically proved DNT were retrospectively reviewed.

All tumors were intracortical or subcortical. CT showed a low-attenuation mass in all cases except one of mixed isoattenuation and low attenuation. The DNT had decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images and well-demarcated increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images without peritumoral edema. Prominent MR imaging features were a gyriform configuration on T1- or T2-weighted images in 10 patients (100%), well-demarcated lobular tumor margins on T2-weighted images in eight (80%), and a high rate of bone remodeling of the adjacent calvaria on MR (60% [n = 6]) and CT (67% [n = 4]) images.

Diagnosis of DNT with imaging modalities alone may be difficult, but these radiologic features may aid in differentiating DNT from other gliomas.
