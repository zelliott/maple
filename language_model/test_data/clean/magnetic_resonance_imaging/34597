Currently, hyperoxia is being investigated as a method for producing contrast in magnetic resonance images of the brain, solid tumors, and the eye. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms involved in this type of contrast are still not completely understood. For example, under what conditions would dissolved plasma oxygen contribute to the hyperoxia-induced contrast? Using the eye as a model system, we varied the level of dissolved plasma oxygen and observed different patterns of contrast in the vitreous. The observed contrast changes were consistent with tissue oxygen buffering by hemoglobin at an arterial PO2 of 200 mm Hg and dissolved oxygen offloading at arterial PO2's > 350 mm Hg. These data demonstrate that dissolved plasma oxygen does not become an important contrast mechanism until the arterial oxygen tension exceeds approximately 350 mm Hg. The implication of this result to studies in other organs is discussed.
