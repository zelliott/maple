We studied 12 children who had minimally displaced lateral humeral condyle fractures. Bony gaps at the fracture site were <2 mm on the anteroposterior view of plain radiographs. To determine the stability of the fractures, we used a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the distal humerus and elbow joint. In the results, two types of fractures were classified by the extent of the fracture line in MRI. Type I showed that the line coursed from the lateral metaphysis to the growth plate but not through it. In type II, the line crossed the growth plate to enter the joint space. We concluded that the MRI study distinguished the potentially unstable fracture (type II) from the minimally displaced fracture and recommend the use of a percutaneous pin fixation for the expected unstable fracture.
