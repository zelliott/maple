A method is presented that converts dynamic T(1)-weighted spoiled gradient-recalled echo (SGRE) image intensities into estimates of T(1) without the errors associated with imperfections in the slice profile and transmitter coil magnetic field (B(1)). The method involves T(1) measurements performed before and after a series of dynamic SGRE images. These measurements serve to calibrate and correct the SGRE signal strength equation used to estimate T(1). Simulations and phantom experiments were performed to test the method for slice-selective (two-dimensional) and slab-selective (three-dimensional) imaging, as well as for imaging performed with optimized and un-optimized B(1). For nearly all test conditions, T(1) was estimated accurately (within 10%) over a range of T(1) values expected in vivo ( approximately 1200 --> 300 msec). This method should be useful for quantifying dynamic SGRE imaging for many different applications including breast MR imaging. Magn Reson Med 42:746-753, 1999.
