The extreme range of motion at the shoulder, high velocities and stresses, and repetitive nature of the throwing motion place the throwing athlete at risk for a wide range of pathologic entities. The treating orthopedist must fully understand the biomechanics of the throwing cycle and how it contributes to the potential injuries in the throwing shoulder during each phase of the throwing motion. The goal of orthopedic care and rehabilitation is to allow the throwing athlete to return symptom free to the preinjury level of competition.
