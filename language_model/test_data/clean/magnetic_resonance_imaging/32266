Two parallel fMRI experiments were conducted with the aim to clarify the lateralisation issue of the cerebral network underlying autobiographical memory retrieval independently of the stimulus material and the refreshment of the memory trace. The verbal experiment required a pre-scanning interview, while the nonverbal version tested the subjects directly during the fMRI session. Both experiments were constructed using the same experimental design to eliminate methodological variables in order to render comparisons possible. We found a predominantly left-lateralised cerebral network independently of material and regardless of whether or not memory traces were reactivated prior to the scanning session. We discuss the results in the context of neuroimaging studies of autobiographical memory (AbM).
