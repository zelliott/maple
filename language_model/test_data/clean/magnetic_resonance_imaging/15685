Merkel cell carcinomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors of the skin with highly malignant behavior. These tumors arise from Merkel cells, which are slowly adapting type 1 mechanoreceptors that occur in hair follicles and the basal layer of the epidermis. Merkel cell carcinomas are typically located in the dermis and frequently extend into the subcutaneous fat and lymphatics. This case report describes the magnetic resonance imaging and pathologic findings, surgical treatment, and postoperative results with review of the literature for Merkel cell carcinoma involving the foot of a 72-year-old man with a 2-month history of a painless, enlarging mass that interfered with his ability to wear a shoe.
