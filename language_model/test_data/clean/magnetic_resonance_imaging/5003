Diagnostic imaging of pediatric urologic disorders is continuously changing as technologic advances are made. Although the backbone of pediatric urologic imaging has been ultrasound, voiding cystourethrography, and radionuclide scintigraphy, newer and advanced modalities are becoming increasingly important. This article discusses the techniques and clinical applications of three such imaging modalities as they pertain to pediatric urologic disorders: (1) MR urography; (2) advanced ultrasound (harmonic imaging, three-dimensional, and voiding urosonography); and (3) CT angiography.
