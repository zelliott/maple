This study was undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) in the differential diagnosis of ring-enhancing cerebral lesions, including abscesses, high-grade gliomas and metastases.

Nine cerebral abscesses (five pyogenic, four from Toxoplasma gondii), ten glioblastomas and five cerebral metastases in 19 patients were studied with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) including calculation of mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the lesion core, and PWI. At PWI, the mean of the maximum regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) was calculated in the gadolinium-enhancing peripheral solid areas and compared with that of the contralateral normal-appearing white matter [ratio=rCBV (lesion)/rCBV (contralateral normal-appearing white matter)].

DWI achieved the differential diagnosis in all cases except for the four Toxoplasma abscesses. At PWI, the mean ratio of the rCBV of the capsular portion was 0.72+/-0.08 (range 0.60-0.82) in the pyogenic abscesses, 0.84+/-0.07 (range 0.75-0.91) in the Toxoplasma abscesses, 4.45+/-1.5 (range 2.9-8.0) in the high-grade gliomas and 3.58+/-0.68 (range 3.28-4.27) in the metastases.

PWI seems to be useful in the differential diagnosis of ring-enhancing cerebral lesions. High rCBV values in the peripheral areas appear to indicate the possibility of a necrotic tumour, whereas low values tend to indicate an abscess.
