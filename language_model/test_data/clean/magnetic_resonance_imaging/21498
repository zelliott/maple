Cerebral metastases of malignant melanoma usually have a characteristic appearance on CT and MRI. They present as multiple small lesions at the junction of grey and white matter. On CT the lesions are slightly hyperdense with moderate contrast enhancement. On MRI, typical T1 and T2 shortening is seen. In our case these findings were due to abundant presence of melanin without associated hemorrhage.
