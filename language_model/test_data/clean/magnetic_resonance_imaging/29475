The purpose of this study is to determine if there is an association between eye size and the volume of the orbit in adult subjects. Thirty-three subjects with varying degrees of ametropia (+1.00 to -12.75 D) underwent magnetic resonance scan of the orbit. Results show that the larger myopic eye was not associated with a larger orbit.
