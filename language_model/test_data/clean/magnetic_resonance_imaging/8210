Diseases of the thoracic aorta cause significant morbidity and mortality and can result in potentially catastrophic consequences. Conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) has been the gold standard for imaging for many years; however, this is associated with adverse effects and provides only limited information about vessel morphology. DSA is used primarily as a first-line investigation in the setting of trauma. Several other techniques also have been used in recent years, including CT and MRI. This article focuses primarily on the latter.
