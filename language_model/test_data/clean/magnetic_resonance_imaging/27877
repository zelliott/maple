Central nervous system vasculitis in Crohn's disease. A 36-years old man was referred to the hospital because of severe headache, vertigo and right sided combined motor-sensory hemiparesis. There was a history of Crohn's disease with an acute exacerbation only two months ago. Magnetic resonance imaging detected a vascular lesion of the left brainstem and serologic investigations revealed circulating immunocomplexes and p-antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (p-ANCA). Further investigations care no evidence of arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. These findings therefore suggest that cerebral vasculitis secondary to Crohn's disease was the underlying cause of this focal neurologic deficit.
