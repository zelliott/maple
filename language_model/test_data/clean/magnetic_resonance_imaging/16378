Understanding the oxygen consumption of the left ventricular myocardium provides important insight into the relationship between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. In other territories, cardiac magnetic resonance has been utilized to measure myocardial oxygen consumption with a blood level oxygen dependent (BOLD) technique. The BOLD technology requires repetitive sampling of stationary tissues and is frequently implemented in areas such as the brain. A limitation to utilizing BOLD cardiac magnetic resonance techniques in the heart has been cardiac motion. In this study, we document a methodology for acquiring BOLD images in the heart and demonstrate the utility of the technique for identifying associations between myocardial oxygen consumption and blood flow.
