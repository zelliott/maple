Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has several theoretical advantages in the evaluation of spermatic cord torsion and testicular ischemia. The technique uses no ionizing radiation, has both excellent spatial and temporal resolution and, when used with an intravenous bolus of a paramagnetic contrast agent, provides a semiquantitative assessment of tissue perfusion and vascular injury. In clinical instances of testicular torsion, accurate estimates of tissue perfusion are desirable since testicular salvage is inversely related to the duration of torsion and the degree of tissue ischemia. Perfusion imaging of the rat testis was used as a model to demonstrate the potential use of MRI in the experimental and clinical analysis of disorders that affect blood flow to the testis.
