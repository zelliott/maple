Brainstem metastases portend a dismal prognosis. Surgical resection is not part of routine management and radiation therapy has offered little clinical benefit. Radiosurgery provides a safe and effective treatment for many patients with brain metastasis, but its role in the brainstem has not been evaluated. In this study the authors examine the role of radiosurgery in the treatment of brainstem metastases.

The authors reviewed the outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery in 26 patients with 27 brainstem metastases. Tumor locations included the pons (21 tumors) and midbrain (six tumors): 14 patients had additional tumors in other locations. Twenty patients presented with brainstem signs. The median dose to the tumor margin was 16 Gy (range 12-20 Gy). Twenty-four patients received fractionated whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and 12 underwent additional chemotherapy or immunotherapy. The median follow-up time in these patients was 9.5 months (range 1-43 months). After radiosurgery, the local control rate in brainstem tumors was 95%. In one patient in whom the tumor initially decreased in size, tumor enlargement was seen 7 months later. The median survival time was 11 months after diagnosis and 9 months after radiosurgery. Thirteen patients improved, 10 were stable, and three deteriorated. Eventually, 22 patients died, 18 of progression of their extracranial disease, three of new tumor growth (including one hemorrhage into a new brain metastasis), and one of extracranial disease plus new brain tumor growth.

Although they have slightly lower than the expected survival rates of patients with nonbrainstem tumors, patients with brainstem metastases may achieve effective palliation after stereotactic radiosurgery and WBRT.
