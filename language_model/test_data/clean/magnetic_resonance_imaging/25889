Epipharyngeal teratomas are rare congenital lesions that often cause respiratory distress, stridor at birth. The management of such anomalies should include establishment of secure upper airways, radiographic exclusion of midline CNS malformations and early surgical excision to prevent malignant transformation, asphyxia or permanent facial distortion. The diagnosis of congenital stridor, dyspnea and rhinitis should be performed very carefully.
