We retrospectively reviewed 15 gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging examinations of the cervical spine in eight patients who had spinal cord injury. Enhancement was demonstrated at the periphery of the intramedullary lesion in three patients at 1 to 14 weeks after injury. The enhancement might reflect vascularized granulation in a reparative phase. Spinal cord injury should be considered in the differential diagnosis of enhanced intramedullary spinal cord lesions.
