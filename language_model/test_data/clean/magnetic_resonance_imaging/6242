Two gradient-recalled lipid suppression sequences are proposed. A two-excitation sequence cycles the TE interval between excitations to alter the lipid phase which is followed by complex subtraction. A four-excitation variant which improves the extent of lipid suppression by partially compensating for errors resulting from spin-spin relaxation and B0 inhomogeneities is outlined.
