We reported a 15-year-old boy with hypertensive encephalopathy secondary to nephrotic syndrome (minimal change). Based on his clinical symptoms such as anasarca and oliguria, and laboratory data, he was diagnosed as having nephrotic syndrome, and treated with corticosteroid. On the 6th days of admission, he experienced multifocal seizures with hypertension. Cranial T2-weighted MR imaging revealed multiple small cortical and subcortical high intensity lesions in the parieto-occipital lobes, and bilateral round shaped lesions in the cerebellar white matter. He was successfully treated with antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs. One year later, a follow up MR imaging revealed almost complete resolution of the brain lesions. MR imaging is a useful modality to demonstrate the lesions characteristic of hypertensive encephalopathy, which are distributed in the areas of posterior circulation.
