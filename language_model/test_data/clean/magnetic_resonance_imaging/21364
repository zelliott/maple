We report the case of an incidentally discovered aneurysm of a previous saphenous vein bypass graft performed 32 years earlier for a renal artery aneurysm. The patient is a 52-year-old man who initially suffered from symptoms of hypertension and left-sided back pain. Saphenous vein bypass grafting was performed with aneurysm resection. Thirty-two years after surgery, the patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan for back pain, hip pain, and anemia, discovering a 1.8-cm focal aneurysm at the site of the previous bypass. The patient underwent a repeat aortorenal bypass with an 8-mm flanged Dacron graft with excision of the existing aneurysmal saphenous vein graft.
