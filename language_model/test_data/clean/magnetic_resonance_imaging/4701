Commercially available software is now available for reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) tomographic slices. We have used these 3-D images for 8 years to enhance anatomic diagnosis and functional evaluation pre- and postoperatively in children with congenital cardiac and great vessel diseases. The advantages of 3-D imaging are reduced examination time, improved display of complex intracardiac relationships, better understanding of relationships between great vessels and adjacent major airways, and facilitated demonstration of cardiovascular anatomy for those unfamiliar with tomographic images.
