Dyke Davidoff Masson syndrome (DDMS) refers to atrophy or hypoplasia of one cerebral hemisphere following a prior fetal or childhood insult. It has characteristics of clinical and radiological changes. These changes include hemiparesis, seizures, facial-asymmetry, and mental retardation. We present a 25-year-old man with crossed cerebrocerebellar atrophy and DDMS. His seizures were well controlled using a combination of antiepileptic drugs.
