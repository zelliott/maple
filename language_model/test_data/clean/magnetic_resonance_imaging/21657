We studied optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), optokinetic afternystagmus (OKAN) and visual-vestibular interaction in five patients with markedly elevated vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain due to cerebellar atrophy. All had impaired smooth pursuit, decreased initial slow phase velocity of OKN, and impaired ability to suppress the VOR with real or imagined targets. OKN slow phase velocity gradually built up over 25-45 s, reaching normal values for low stimulus velocities (< or = 30 deg/s). Initial velocity of OKAN was increased, but the rate of decay of OKAN was normal. These findings can be explained by models that include separate velocity storage and variable gain elements shared by the vestibular and optokinetic systems.
