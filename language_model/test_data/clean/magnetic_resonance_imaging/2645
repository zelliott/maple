We report two patients with giant cell arteritis and unusual neuro-ophthalmic findings. One patient developed a horizontal one and a half syndrome associated with upright posture. The responsible lesion was dorsal pontine infarction. The other patient had bright light-induced amaurosis fugax in the absence of extracranial carotid occlusive disease. Both patients continued to have symptoms despite the use of high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. The manifestations of both patients occurred early in the course of giant cell arteritis and were flow related.
