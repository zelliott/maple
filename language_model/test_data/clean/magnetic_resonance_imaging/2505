We report two cases of salmonella osteomyelitis isolated to the pelvis in white adolescents aged 12 and 16 years. No underlying medical condition predisposed these children to salmonella osteomyelitis, and the clinical course was prolonged before definitive diagnosis. The key to diagnosis and the localization of the site of the pathologic condition was made from radionuclide studies performed 2-3 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Clinicians should be aware of isolated salmonella osteomyelitis of the pelvis in normal children, especially when imaging studies are normal at initial presentation. Technetium-labeled bone scans may be normal < or = 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Definitive diagnostic testing should include a gallium scan and computed tomography scan when technetium bone scans are negative. Treatment with antibiotics alone is successful.
