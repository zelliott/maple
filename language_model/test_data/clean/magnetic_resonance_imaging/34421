Using pulsed field gradient methods combined with magnetic resonance imaging, we calculated the apparent water diffusion coefficient D in different atherosclerotic components to probe the microstructure of normal and diseased arteries by characterizing molecular motion. D was equal to 0.26 +/- 0.13 x 10(-5) cm2.s-1 in plaque lipid core, 1.45 +/- 0.41 x 10(-5) cm2.s-1 in collagenous cap, and 1.54 +/- 0.30 x 10(-5) cm2.s-1 in normal media. Water diffuses isotropically in the atheromatous core of the plaque, suggesting the absence or destruction of confining structures. The comparable diffusion coefficients in collagenous cap and normal media are consistent with similar biophysical barriers in both components. In thrombi, D varies with the aging processes (fresh thrombus, 0.72 +/- 0.11 x 10(-5) cm2.s-1; 1-week-old thrombus, 0.36 +/- 0.08 x 10(-5) cm2.s-1; old occluding thrombus, 1.33 +/- 0.33 x 10(-5) cm2.s-1), consistent with the cross-linking of the fibrin strands occurring in the early phase and the later thrombus organization. Defining an indirect index of arterial lipid infiltration, remodeling, and aging, diffusion imaging provides a new nuclear magnetic resonance characterization of atherothrombosis.
