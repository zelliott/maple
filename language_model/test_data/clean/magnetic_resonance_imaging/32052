Primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the central nervous system is rare in pediatric AIDS patients. We report a seven-year-old HIV-infected boy, in stage C3 of the disease, who developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the central nervous system with a leptomeningeal location. The patient started with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness and then became blind. The diagnosis was based on brain biopsy, immunophenotypic studies of B cells, and Epstein-Barr virus serology of the cerebrospinal fluid. The boy was treated with intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy. Fifteen months after diagnosis he had clinically improved, but he then relapsed with a thalamic tumor. He was treated with radiotherapy and he died four months later. In the present article, we discuss diagnostic difficulties, evolution, treatment, and the association of this neoplasm with the Epstein-Barr virus.
