A biocompatible, multimodal, and theranostic functional iron oxide nanoparticle is synthesized using a novel water-based method and exerts excellent properties for targeted cancer therapy, and optical and magnetic resonance imaging. For the first time, a facile, modified solvent diffusion method is used for the co-encapsulation of both an anticancer drug and near-infrared dyes. The resulting folate-derivatized theranostics nanoparticles could allow for targeted optical/magnetic resonance imaging and targeted killing of folate-expressing cancer cells.
