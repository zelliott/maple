The neurenteric cyst is an uncommon congenital lesion. In most reported cases, it has been operated on via a posterior approach using a laminectomy, despite the fact that the cyst is usually located ventral to the spinal cord. Reports have shown that early postoperative results have been good with the posterior approach, but very few studies of the long-term postoperative recurrence of neurenteric cysts have been conducted. Here, we report on a case of recurrent neurenteric cyst that was operated on using an anterior approach.A 42-year-old woman presented with a cervical neurenteric cyst that had recurred eight years after its partial removal via a posterior approach. The patient complained of pain on the lateral side of her upper arms, and an magnetic resonance imaging showed that the recurrent cyst was located ventral to the spinal cord and compressed the cord dorsally at the C4-6 level. The patient was operated on via an anterior approach using a vertebrotomy at the lower half of C5 and the upper half of C6. The cyst was attached to the spinal cord firmly and was subtotally removed, with the thickest portion adhering to the cord not being removed. The caudal end of the cyst was observed with the assistance of a rigid endoscope.A neurenteric cyst may recur after partial removal, and the patient's condition may deteriorate during postoperative follow-up. The anterior surgical approach provides good visualization and facilitates safe removal of the lesion.
