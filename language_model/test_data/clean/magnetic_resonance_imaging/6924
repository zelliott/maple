Abstract The treatment options for primary irresectable rectal cancers are discussed. Assessment of tumour stage is the first step for an appropriate choice of treatment. Following a diagnosis of rectal cancer, a vast array of diagnostic procedures is available to determine its stage, and thereby its best treatment options. From the many (new) diagnostic options the merits and drawbacks are discussed. If a diagnosis of irresectability is made, further treatment options should include radiotherapy in most cases, some aspects of timing and application, i.e. intra-operative treatment are discussed. Chemotherapy options are manifold, the results are discussed and some new options are explored.
