A 26-year-old right-handed female presented with alien hand syndrome (AHS) secondary to corpus callosum (CC) hematoma. The patient had abnormal feelings in the left upper limb and exhibited intermanual conflict. Imaging studies demonstrated acute hemorrhage in the genu and body of the CC secondary to cerebral venous malformation. Callosal hemorrhage is usually caused by head trauma or a ruptured arteriovenous that extends beyond the CC. We report what may be the first case of AHS caused by callosal hemorrhage due to venous malformation.
