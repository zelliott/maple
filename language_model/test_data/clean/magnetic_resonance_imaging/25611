The authors examined the magnetic resonance (MR) appearance of inverted papillomas to determine if this histologically benign lesion could be distinguished from malignancies of the sinonasal cavity. MR images in 10 patients with histologically proved inverted papilloma were retrospectively reviewed. The signal intensity of inverted papillomas on short repetition time (TR) images was iso- to slightly hypertintense to muscle in all 10 patients. Inverted papillomas had intermediate signal intensity on the long TR/echo time (TE) images. The tumors were iso- or slightly hypointense to fat on long TR/short TE images. In the seven patients who received gadopentetate dimeglumine, all inverted papillomas showed solid inhomogeneous enhancement. A review of eight sinonasal malignancies showed no distinctive signal intensity or enhancement characteristics to help differentiate inverted papillomas from various malignant tumors. The authors conclude that there is no signature MR appearance for the benign inverted papilloma. The main utility of MR imaging is in defining the extent of the lesion.
