Caudal duplication syndrome includes anomalies of the genitourinary system, gastrointestinal tract, and the distal neural tube. Caudal regression syndrome presents with lumbosacral hypogenesis, anomalies of the lower gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary system, and limb anomalies. Both happen as a result of insult to the caudal cell mass. We present a child having features consistent with both entities.
