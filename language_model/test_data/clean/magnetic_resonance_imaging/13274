The delineation of early infarction in large gyrencephalic brain cannot be accomplished with triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) due to its limitations in the early phase, nor can it be identified with microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) immunohistochemistry, due to the fragility of large thin sections. We hypothesize that MAP2 immunostaining of thick brain sections can accurately identify early ischemia in the entire monkey brain. Using ischemic brains of one rat and three monkeys, a thick-section MAP2 immunostaining protocol was developed to outline the infarct region over the entire non-human primate brain. Comparison of adjacent thick and thin sections in a rat brain indicated complete correspondence between ischemic regions (100.4mm(3)+/-1.2%, n=7, p=0.44). Thick sections in monkey brain possessed the increased structural stability necessary for the extensive MAP2 immunostaining procedure permitting quantification of the ischemic region as a percent of total monkey brain, giving infarct volumes of 11.4, 16.3, and 19.0% of total brain. Stacked 2D images of the intact thick brain tissue sections provided a 3D representation for comparison to MRI images. The infarct volume of 16.1cm(3) from the MAP2 sections registered with MRI images agreed well with the volume calculated directly from the stained sections of 16.6 cm(3). Thick brain tissue section MAP2 immunostaining provides a new method for determining infarct volume over the entire brain at early time points in a non-human primate model of ischemic stroke.
