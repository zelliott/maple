Orbital malignancy can mimic thyroid associated orbitopathy (TAO) due to overlap of clinical and radiographic findings, which include proptosis, extraocular muscle (EOM) enlargement on imaging, and EOM restriction with diplopia. We report a case of primary orbital liposarcoma masquerading as TAO which required exenteration.
