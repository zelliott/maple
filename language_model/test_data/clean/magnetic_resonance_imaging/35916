A rare case of solitary neurofibroma of the vagus nerve in the aortopulmonary window masquerading as a developmental cyst is reported. Its computed tomographic characteristics and magnetic resonance imaging are described and correlated with pathologic findings. Although the features of such imaging modalities are quite characteristic for a neurofibroma, its differentiation from "atypical" developmental cysts may be difficult.
