To test a new non-invasive imaging method, magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRCP), we compared MRCP with intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC). In 55 patients with 11 common bile duct stones MRCP identified all 11 stones and incorrectly found stones in seven additional patients. Predictive value of positive test was 61%, predictive value of negative test was 100%. As a consequence of MRCP, ERC or IOC can be avoided in 67% of the patients.
