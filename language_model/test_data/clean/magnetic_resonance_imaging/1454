In this review of the pathophysiology of acute intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, information from several disciplines is assembled to describe the bleeding process, hemostasis and coagulation, fibrinolysis, erythrocyte lysis, phagocytosis, and changes in the state of hemoglobin. The impact of these pathophysiologic processes upon MR imaging, CT, and angiography is noted.
