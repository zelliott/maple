Glomus jugulare tumors always invade the jugular bulb and sigmoid sinus, making it difficult to resect these tumors totally without sacrificing the involved sinus. Although the sinus can be sacrificed safely in most patients, a few patients will have serious consequences. Reconstruction of the jugular bulb using a saphenous vein graft may enable tumor resection in these patients without complications. The authors describe two cases of saphenous vein grafting used to bypass the sigmoid sinus. The first case is that of a 61-year-old man with a glomus jugulare tumor that invaded the dominant sigmoid sinus, which was poorly collateralized. Temporary occlusion of the sinus during surgery caused a 15-mm Hg increase in intrasinus pressure, without brain swelling or changes in evoked potentials. A saphenous vein graft was used to bypass the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb and to allow for total tumor removal. The patient had a good outcome. The second case is that of a 41-year-old man with a left glomus jugulare tumor and another smaller tumor on the opposite, dominant sinus. The left glomus jugulare tumor was resected via a two-stage procedure. A saphenous vein graft was used to reconstruct the left sigmoid sinus because of the presence of contralateral disease, with the potential for bilateral sigmoid sinus occlusion. An evaluation of the venous collateral circulation during jugular foramen surgery and the prevention of complications are also discussed.
