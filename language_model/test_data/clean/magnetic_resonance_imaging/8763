Schwannoma of the biliary tree is extremely uncommon, with only a few cases having been reported so far. They commonly present with obstructive jaundice. Although involvement of the extrahepatic duct is common, occurrence in the intrahepatic ducts has not been reported. We report a case of combined intrahepatic and extrahepatic schwannoma in a 46-year-old man presenting with obstructive jaundice.
