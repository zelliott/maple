The most common temporomandibular joint disturbance is the internal derangement. Its prevalence has been shown to be as high as 28%. The purpose of this study was on one hand to compare the diagnostic efficiency of an electronic axiographic system with magnetic resonance imaging, and, on the other hand to evaluate the results of MRI-assisted treatment monitoring of occlusal splint therapy. The results of this survey clearly show that in evaluation of temporomandibular joint disorders, electronic axiography and magnetic resonance imaging should be used in conjunction with one another to increase the accuracy of positive and differentiated diagnoses. The medical concept of disc recapture involving the use of occlusal splints seems to be merely a clinical term which is not necessarily hinged on anatomical intraarticular changes.
