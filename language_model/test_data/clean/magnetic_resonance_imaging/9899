: To compare a commercial contrast agent (CA) Dotarem and a necrosis-avid CA (NACA) for their ability to evaluate the therapeutic necrosis with a vascular disrupting agent (VDA) on magnetic resonance imaging in rodent liver tumors to determine which could better correlate with the histopathologic outcome.

: After the VDA treatment, 16 rats with 32 liver rhabdomyosarcomas were randomized into Dotarem and NACA groups (n = 8 per group) for both interindividual and intraindividual comparisons. T2-weighted imaging, T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging were performed at baseline, after VDA treatment and CA injections. The enhancing efficacy of CAs at immediate and delayed enhancement on CE-T1WI in viable tumor and necrosis was compared. Tumor necrosis ratios calculated from NACA and Dotarem were compared and correlated with gold-standard histopathology.

: On the immediate CE-T1WI, viable tumor was enhanced by either CA. On the delayed CE-T1WI at 30 minutes, both CAs failed to demarcate viable tumor from necrosis. At 24 hours post-NACA, the necrosis was clearly distinguished from viable tumor and thus derived necrosis ratio matched that from histopathology (P = 0.99); necrosis ratio from Dotarem was significantly lower than that from NACA and histopathology (P < 0.05, both), with a higher correlation of NACA than that of Dotarem with histopathology (r = 0.99 vs. r = 0.82).

: NACA better evaluated VDA-induced tumor necrosis than nonspecific CA on T1WI in tumor models of rat liver. NACA showed a closer correlation with histopathology than nonspecific CA for the delineation of true necrosis. Delayed enhancement on T1WI with nonspecific CA is not suitable for the assessment of VDA-induced tumor necrosis.
