Craniocerebral and spinal penetrating trauma, which may be either missile (most typically gun-related) or non-missile (most typically knife-related), is becoming an increasingly common presentation to the urban general and specialized radiology service in the UK. These injuries carry significant morbidity and mortality with a number of criteria for prognosis identifiable on cross-sectional imaging. Potential complications can also be pre-empted by awareness of certain neuroradiological features. Not all of these injuries are criminal in origin, however, a significant proportion will be, requiring, on occasion, provision of both ante-mortem and post-mortem radiological opinion to the criminal investigative procedure. This review aims to highlight certain imaging features of penetrating craniocerebral and spinal trauma including important prognostic, therapeutic, and forensic considerations.
