A reduction in cartilage volume is characteristic of osteoarthritis and hence there exists a need for an accurate and reproducible method to measure in vivo cartilage volume. Quantification of cartilage volume from magnetic resonance (MR) images requires a segmentation technique such as the user-driven "Live Wire" strategy that can reliably delineate object volumes in a time-efficient manner. In the present work, the accuracy and reproducibility of the Live Wire method for the quantification of cartilage volume in MR images is evaluated.

The accuracy of the Live Wire method was assessed by comparing the MR-based volume measurement of a patellar cartilage-shaped phantom versus data calculated via water displacement. The inter- and intra-operator reproducibility of the technique was evaluated from Live Wire segmentation of the patellar cartilage volume from fat-suppressed 3-dimensional spoiled-gradient-echo images of five healthy human volunteers performed by three operators. To provide data for analysis of inter-scan reproducibility, the human scans were repeated five times with the aid of a leg-restraining jig to minimize repositioning error.

The volume of the patellar cartilage-shaped phantom measured via Live Wire segmentation of MR images was within 97.8% of its true volume. The average inter- and intra-operator coefficients of variation of three operators were 3.0% and 0.4%, respectively. The average inter-scan coefficient of variation of five repeated scans of each volunteer was 2.7%.

The data suggest that the Live Wire strategy is an accurate, reproducible, and efficient technique to measure cartilage volume in vivo in a feasible amount of operator time.
