The purpose of this study was to show the usefulness of MR imaging with a transrectal coil (TRC) in the management of various urethral abnormalities. This report also reveals the appearance of various postsurgical changes relating to the therapy of urethral abnormality.

The high-resolution images obtained with TRC MR imaging were useful in evaluating urethral abnormalities. The imaging guided therapy in most cases. In two patients, TRC MR imaging more accurately depicted abnormality than did voiding cystourethrography and transvaginal sonography. In one case, TRC MR imaging was the only imaging technique that revealed the abnormality of periurethral scarring.
