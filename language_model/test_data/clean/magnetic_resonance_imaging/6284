Description of a method to reconstruct planar images from MRT 3D data sets. These images can be of varying orientation. Reconstruction requires a computer and the control panel of a normal magnetic resonance tomography equipment. Calculation of reconstruction is done in a few minutes. Patients can be examined parallel to this without difficulty. The method yields in a much shorter time than before images with a definitely higher resolution than by the conventional technique.
