A 5-month-old boy who had been operated for esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula was presented with recurrent life-threatening apneic spells, expiratory stridor and difficulty in feeding. Diagnosis of tracheomalacia was confirmed by bronchoscopy and pericardial flap aortopexy was performed. Pericardial flap aortopexy is a relatively simple procedure with minimal risk to the aorta. Minimal dissection is required and there are no sutures placed in the aortic wall, thus avoiding the risk of tears.
