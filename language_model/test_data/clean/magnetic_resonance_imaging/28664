A case of spinal intradural neuroepithelial cyst is presented. The patient, who had thoracolumbar hypertrichosis, underwent magnetic resonance imaging which demonstrated a cystic lesion within spinal canal. The cystic lesion was removed surgically. Histological study proved it to be a neuroepithelial cyst. Spinal intradural neuroepithelial cyst associated with other congenital malformations is a rare condition.
