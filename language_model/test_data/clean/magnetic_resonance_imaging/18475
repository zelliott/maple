A 38-year-old man developing slowly progressive left facial paresis was admitted to our hospital. The clinical diagnosis of "adhesive arachnoiditis was made. The first operation was performed in December 1987, and his symptom disappeared postoperatively. Three years later, left facial paresis recurred together with trunkal ataxia. A computed tomography and magnetic resonance image revealed two tumors located at the left cerebellopontine angle region and in the left middle cerebral fossa. These two tumors were thought to arise in the different cranial nerve. Under the clinical diagnosis of acoustic neurinoma associated with facial nerve neurinoma, the two step-operation was designed for total removal of the tumor in December 1990 and January 1991. Intraoperative finding confirmed that these two tumors had the different origin. Pathologic diagnosis was compatible with neurinoma. This patient had no family history of "Neurofibromatosis".
