A 38-years-old HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfected woman presented to us for dyslipidemia. Clinical, familial and laboratory data were consistent with the diagnosis of familial heterozygous hypercholesterolaemia. History, clinical examination and laboratory findings also supported suspected acromegaly. A pituitary MRI showed a sellar macroadenoma that was removed by transphenoidal surgery without complications. MRI carried out 6&emsp14;months after surgery showed almost complete removal of the adenoma. This case report describes an uncommon association of diseases, very different for aetiology--genetic for FH, infectious for HIV and HCV, caused by excessive hormone secretion for acromegaly--clinical features and therapy, but all sharing a significant impact on cardiovascular risk as a common feature.
