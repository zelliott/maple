We report a case of primary hepatic peripheral T-cell lymphoma in a patient with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis. This patient presented with a solitary hepatic lesion with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging features that did not resemble hepatocellular carcinoma. Subsequent biopsy of the lesion revealed that it was a peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The patient was successfully treated with multi-agent chemotherapy followed by radiofrequency ablation. Although hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequently encountered primary hepatic tumour in patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis, primary hepatic lymphoma should also be borne in mind. Nevertheless, primary hepatic lymphoma is a rare entity, and has no proven association with chronic hepatitis B infection.
