Hypoxia occurs in various diseases, including cancer, ischemia, and acute and chronic vascular diseases. Here we describe the design and synthesis of the first hypoxia-sensitive MRI contrast agents, SAGds. SAGds showed a pH-dependent r(1) relaxivity change associated with intramolecular chelation of the nitrogen atom of the sulfonamide moiety to the Gd(3+) center. There was a correlation between the pK(a) of the r(1) relaxivity change and the sum of the Hammett Ïƒ constants of substituents on the aromatic ring. Among the synthesized compounds, 4NO(2)2MeOSAGd was selectively reduced to the amine by rat liver microsomes under hypoxic conditions, resulting in a 1.8-fold increment of the r(1) relaxivity owing to the change in pK(a) of the arylsulfonamide moiety. This enhancement of the r(1) relaxivity could be clearly detected in T(1)-weighted MR images. Thus, 4NO(2)2MeOSAGd is a 'smart' MRI contrast agent for the detection of hypoxia under physiological conditions.
