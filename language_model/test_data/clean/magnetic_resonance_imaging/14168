A case of intracranial granuloma caused by Aspergillus fumigatus involving the anterior cranial fossa is reported. The patient was nonimmuno-compromised and was asymptomatic until he had an accident. The magnetic resonance appearance simulated a meningioma, showed isointense mass with brain parenchyma on both T1- and T2-weighted images with pial vascular rim. The final diagnosis was established after surgery and histopathological examination.
