The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in 39 patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-one sarcomas were in the lower extremity, five each in the upper extremity and trunk, two each in the neck and heart, and one each in the maxillary sinus, sella turcica, tongue, and spermatic cord. The examinations were performed with spin-echo sequences on a 1.5 Tesla Signa Scanner (GE, Milwaukee WI). Twenty-two tumors exhibited intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and 23 were of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. There was no significant differences in signal intensity of 12 preoperative and 13 recurrent neoplasms. Twelve of 13 patients were correctly diagnosed as having postoperative changes. The MR sensitivity and specificity for detecting a neoplasm were 96% and 83% respectively, but the signal changes were nonspecific for MFH. When compared to CT in 14 patients, MR better defined the extent of the MFH, its relationship to surrounding tissues and vessels, and best differentiated residual or recurrent disease from postoperative changes when examined at least 3 months after surgery.
