The MR findings of a case with paraganglioma of the cauda equina are presented. T2-weighted images showed the tumor to have a hyposignal rim and serpiginous flow voids, suggesting vessels capping the tumor. Contrast-enhanced MR images highlighted the tumor and tumor vessels more clearly. Knowledge of MR findings in this unusual disorder may aid in diagnosis.
