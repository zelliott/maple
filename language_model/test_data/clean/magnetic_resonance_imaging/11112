A 49-year-old white male presented with a pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage and diffuse brain edema. Neuroimaging showed brain edema causing the unusual findings of a pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage and bilateral occipital lobe infarcts following herniation and compression of the posterior cerebral arteries. An enlarged corpus callosum was noted which led to a brain biopsy and a diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri.
