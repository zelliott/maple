Craniocervical Pott's disease remains exceptional, and may cause spinal instability and severe cervicomedullary complications. We report eight cases of tuberculous spondylodiscitis at the craniocervical junction revealed by signs of spinal cord compression, torticollis and dysphagia. The value of CT and MR imaging is discussed.
