The characteristic of delayed enhancement MRI is high spatial resolution, which makes it possible to evaluate the degree of damage to the myocardium from the inner to the outer membrane of patients with ischemic heart disease. Therefore, this MRI technique is unique in its ability to detect myocardial condition and is necessary to obtain high-quality images. We experienced artifacts induced by TFE factor increase with delayed enhancement of IR-T1TFE. The purpose of this study was to determine the cause of such artifacts. IR-T1TFE changed signal intensity with phase direction as the TFE factor increased. Streak artifacts occurred because signal intensity caused changes with phase direction. Increases in TFE factor prolonged data collection time, such that marked artifacts were created because of changes in signal intensity. Ghost artifacts occurred because signal intensity changed between shots. When the TFE factor was increased, the difference in signal intensity was diminished between shots. The interval of acquired noise decreased in the raw data. Therefore, the interval of ghost artifacts became wider on images.
