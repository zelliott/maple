A case of brain stem cavernous angioma associated with peduncular hallucination is reported. A 68-year-old man was admitted with complaints of left sensory disturbance. On the evening of the first hospital day, he developed vividly formed hallucinations. The hallucinations were accompanied by sleep disturbance and agitation. At approximately 2:00 am, he began to feel as though he could see his daughter watching television in a room. At one point he saw vivid pictures. MRI revealed a round mass with a mixed signal intensity core surrounded by a low signal intensity rim in the right brain stem. On the 10th hospital day, there were no hallucinations. On October 12th suboccipital craniectomy was performed and cavernous angioma and the surrounding hematoma was partially removed. Soon after that the patient was discharged with improvement of both ocular movement and left-sided sensory disturbance.
