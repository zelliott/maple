We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) image analysis technique to localize lesions in post-stroke patients with attention deficits. SPM can be used to combine image data from multiple participants and correlate these images with other data sets. Magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions were obtained from 115 post-stroke patients, who were systemically assessed for attention deficits using a standardized test (the Clinical Assessment for Attention; CAT) that probes various domains of attention. We created an SPM that displayed an association between lesion location and attention deficit severity. The overlay plots were localized to the right hemisphere during a visual cancellation test, and were localized to the left hemisphere during other attention tests. Cortical lesion varied across specific test domain, whereas lesions from the thalamus to the basal ganglia on the dominant side were associated with performance across all attention tests/domains. Our findings are suggestive of a large-scale multimodal attentional network associated with the thalamus/basal ganglia.
