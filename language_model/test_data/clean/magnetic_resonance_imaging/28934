Rhinoscleroma is a chronic, specific, inflammatory granulomatous condition of the nose and other structures of the upper respiratory tract. It is caused by the bacterium Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. We report a case in a 29-year-old black male emigrant who consulted for a 2-year history of hoarseness, cough, and nasal discharge. The diagnosis was scleroma with nasal, laryngeal, tracheal, and bronchial involvement and ulcerating and necrotizing lesions that caused respiratory obstruction. Bacterial over-infection responded to treatment with third-generation cephalosporins and clindamycin. The sclerotic lesions responded well to treatment with ciprofloxacin. We review the clinical findings at different stages, diagnostic options, and several treatments.
