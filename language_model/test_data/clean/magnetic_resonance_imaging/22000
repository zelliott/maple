To assess the utility of surveillance neuroimaging in detecting recurrent disease in patients treated for medulloblastoma.

Records and scans of 59 consecutive patients treated for medulloblastoma between 1984 and 1993 in one institution were retrospectively reviewed.

Nineteen of 59 patients had recurrence of tumor, of which 17 were available for this study. Eleven of the 17 recurrent patients were asymptomatic at the time of detection. The median time to recurrence was 13 months (range, 3 to 90).

Surveillance scanning detected a majority of recurrences before onset of symptoms. Although the outcome of those with recurrent disease remains poor, early detection with minimum disease provides the best setting in which to test newer therapies. Patients and their parents also were more likely to elect pursuing further treatment when relapse was detected asymptomatically.
