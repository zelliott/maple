"Whiplash injuries" are frequent sequelae of motor vehicle accidents. While conventional imaging methods such as X-ray, including special and functional lateral projections, continue to be the first-choice evaluation methods, they frequently do not reveal injuries to the soft tissues. Cross-sectional methods such as CT and MRT may therefore be indicated for further workup in given clinical situations. In this paper the role of the entire spectrum of imaging methods is reviewed. Emphasis is placed on so-called functional CT, which allows detection of rotational instabilities of the upper cervical spine. These are difficult to evaluate clinically or by standard imaging studies, yet they may be a frequent cause of chronic whiplash syndrome. Furthermore, some results of morphologic studies of the alar ligaments by MRT are presented. Although experience to date is limited, it is likely that MRT of the occipitocervical junction region due to its potential to reveal exquisite anatomical detail, will gain in importance in the future.
