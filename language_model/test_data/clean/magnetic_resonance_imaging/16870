To explore the value of serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of cerebral abscess caused by Candida albicans in premature infants.

The clinical data of 8 premature infants with central nervous system invasive fungal infection (IFI) were retrospectively studied. The infants underwent serial cerebral MRI scans (T1WI, T2WI and DWI).

Candida albicans was found as pathogen in all of the 8 infants. Seven infants presented with cerebral abscess and 4 infants had concurrent meningitis. Widespread involvements were found on MRI, particular in white matter area of subcortex, centrum semiovale and periventricle. The MR imaging findings in 4 infants within 11 days after IFI showed diffusive and multiple miliary nodes and hyperintense signals on DWI, but obvious changes were not found on T1WI and T2WI. The most striking hyperintense signals on T1WI and hypointense signals on T2WI appeared between 2 and 4 weeks after IFI, and some nodes of rim-like hyperintensity and marked contrast enhancement were also noted on T1WI. Smaller and smaller changes of the miliary foci were seen on T1WI and T2WI 4 weeks later. Delayed myelination and thinner corpus callous were shown in 2 patients at three months.

MRI-DWI and serial MRIs are helpful in the early diagnosis of candida cerebral abscess and the evaluation of treatment outcome in premature infants.
