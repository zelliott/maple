To report a case of severe bilateral proptosis resulting from orbital hemorrhage in a newborn and to discuss the differential diagnoses and management.

Case report of a 13-day-old male infant with bilateral proptosis since birth. The proptosis was monitored with clinical examinations and computed tomography as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and it was managed with antibiotic ointment and patching. The MRI scans demonstrated bilateral subperiosteal orbital hemorrhage.

Proptosis decreased, and there was successful, complete recovery without untoward sequelae in 14 days; follow-up indicated no late complications at age 1 year.

Spontaneous orbital hemorrhage, unilateral or bilateral, is uncommon in an otherwise healthy newborn without apparent history of birth trauma. Magnetic resonance imaging scans are helpful in making the diagnosis of subperiosteal hemorrhage, and conservative management is advised.
