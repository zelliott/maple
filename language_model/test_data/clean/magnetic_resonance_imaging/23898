A radio frequency (RF) and gradient spoiled fast low angle shot technique was used to acquire images from the human brain at 8 Tesla. The resulting FLASH images, obtained with a 17 degrees nutation, a 70 ms repetition time, and a 17 ms echo time, displayed an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 220:1 (slice thickness 2.2 mm, field-of-view 24 cm, matrix 256 x 128). These images were compared with images obtained at 1.5 Tesla using identical parameters yielding a signal-to-noise of less than 10:1. As such, the 8 Tesla images display a remarkable improvement in SNR with increasing field strength. The images also show little evidence of susceptibility distortion, chemical shift, or RF penetration limitations.
