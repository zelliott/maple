Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors is a group of rare tumors composed of histologically and immunohistochemically distinctive perivascular epithelioid cells. There are no specific imaging sighs. In most cases, the final diagnosis is possible only after the immunihistochemical study. These tumors are extremely rare. We present imaging findings of two cases of perivascular epithelioid cell tumors of the liver.
