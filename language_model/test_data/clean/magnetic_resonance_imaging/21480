Two cases of multiple sclerosis associated with intractable hiccups (IH) and sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) are reported. Lesions were detected in the tegmentum of the medulla oblongata by magnetic resonance imaging. In one case, high dose methylprednisolone was remarkably effective for the IH. For the SAS, amitriptyline was effective in one case. The IH and SAS are thought to be important symptoms when a lesion occurs in the tegmentum of the medulla oblongata, including the paramedian and lateral reticular formations. If IH appears in conjunction with a lesion in the tegmentum of the medulla oblongata, one must be vigilant for the development of SAS.
