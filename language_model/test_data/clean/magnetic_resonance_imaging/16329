The monitoring of chelation therapy is a very important part of the management of transfusion-dependent patients. Classical methods of monitoring iron loading are either unreliable or unable to detect important myocardial siderosis which can predispose to the development of cardiac complications such as heart failure. The development of the T2* technique using cardiovascular magnetic resonance has allowed clinicians to have a reliable method for measuring cardiac iron to guide chelation therapy. T2* can identify early those patients who are at risk of developing cardiac complications, enabling personalised, tailored therapy to avoid potential problems.
