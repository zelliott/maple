[11C]flumazenil (FMZ), a ligand that selectively binds to the central benzodiazepine receptor in the neuronal membrane, is useful for evaluating neuronal viability in a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Using this ligand, we investigated whether there was a correlation between neuronal integrity in various brain structures and dementia in patients with leukoaraiosis.

Twelve patients with extensive leukoaraiosis on magnetic resonance imaging were divided into groups of patients with or without dementia. Based on a 2-compartment, 2-parameter model that included metabolite-corrected arterial input and PET-measured cerebral radioactivity, the distribution volume of FMZ (FMZ-V(d)) was calculated in various regions of interest by nonlinear curve fitting. Additionally, tracer kinetic analysis was applied for voxel-by-voxel quantification of FMZ-V(d), and data analysis was performed by statistical parametric mapping.

The presence of dementia was associated with a reduced FMZ-V(d) in widespread areas of the cerebral cortex, including the bilateral frontopolar and frontal/insular areas, the left temporo-occipital border areas, and the left marginal cortical areas.

Differences in neuronal integrity in the cerebral cortex might determine whether patients with leukoaraiosis become symptomatic or not.
