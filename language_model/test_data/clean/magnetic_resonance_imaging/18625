The majority of intracranial chondromas arise from cartilage rests in the synchondrosis at the base of the skull. Chondromas are most commonly found in the sellar and parasellar regions, usually located extradurally. In rare instances, these tumours originate from the dura mater of the convexity. We report a rare case of a chondroma arising from the convexity dura mater. The origin of this tumour is analysed and the literature reviewed.
