In children with stridor, a detailed evaluation of the airway is often required to assess precisely its anatomical and functional status. Various methods of assessment have been developed and airway management may include, as well as rigid and flexible endoscopy, the use of imaging techniques such as plain X-rays, a barium oesophagogram, ultrasound, a CT scan, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) and an angiogram, as well as respiratory function tests including acoustic rhinometry and flow volume loops or even pH monitoring. This article aims to highlight the valuable information these alternative techniques can provide.
