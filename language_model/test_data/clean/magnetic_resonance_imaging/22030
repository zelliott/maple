Lumbar disk herniation is rare in pregnancy. We report on three pregnant women with this disorder seen over 2 years.

Three women were seen with progressive back pain, paresthesias, and urinary retention. In all three cases, magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis. All failed conservative treatment and required surgery. All did well postoperatively, with improvement of symptoms and delivery at or near term.

Lumbar disk herniation should be considered in pregnant women presenting with considerable back or leg pain. Magnetic resonance imaging is a useful diagnostic tool. Most patients can be treated conservatively, but those with incapacitating pain, progressive neurologic deficits, or bowel or bladder dysfunction may require surgical treatment.
