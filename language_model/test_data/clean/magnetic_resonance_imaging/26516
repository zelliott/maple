We report a case of salivary gland neoplasm and associated hepatoblastoma. The sialoblastoma was diagnosed by prenatal sonography; however, the hepatoblastoma was imaged post-operatively. Prior knowledge could have prevented a subsequent operation, including the additional risks of repeat anesthesia. We suggest that if a sialoblastoma is in the differential diagnosis, then additional imaging may be indicated because of the possibility of associated lesions.
