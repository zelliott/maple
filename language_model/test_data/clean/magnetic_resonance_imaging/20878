NeuRobot, a micromanipulator system with a rigid neuroendoscope and three micromanipulators, was developed for less invasive and telecontrolled neurosurgery. This system can be used to perform sophisticated surgical procedures through a small, 10-mm-diameter, window. The present study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of using NeuRobot in neuroendoscopy. Four different intraventricular neurosurgical procedures were simulated in three fixed cadaver heads using NeuRobot: (1) fenestration of the floor of the third ventricle; (2) fenestration of the septum pellucidum; (3) biopsy of the thalamus; and (4) biopsy of the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle. Each procedure required less than 2 min, and all procedures were performed accurately. After these surgical simulations, a third ventriculostomy was carried out safely and adequately in a patient with obstructive hydrocephalus due to a midbrain venous angioma. Our results confirmed that NeuRobot is applicable to lesions in which conventional endoscopic neurosurgery is indicated. Furthermore, NeuRobot can perform more complex surgical procedures than a conventional neuroendoscope because of its maneuverability and stability. NeuRobot will become a useful neurosurgical tool for dealing with lesions that are difficult to treat by conventional neuroendoscopic surgery.
