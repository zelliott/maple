MR angiography allows the imaging of vessels comparable with the vessels imaged with digital angiography. MR-angiograms were also generated by image subtraction. Basis are the different magnetic properties of moved and stationary spins. Contrast media are not required. In recent years the various techniques of image subtraction with the aim of good imaged vessels were developed. The most important are described in this paper.
