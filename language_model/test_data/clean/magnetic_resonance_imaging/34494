Although rare, orbital osteomyelitis secondary to sinusitis can be devastating. Early, aggressive ophthalmologic surgical intervention, as well as otorhinolaryngologic co-management, is necessary to obtain the best outcomes. We present two cases of orbital osteomyelitis. One patient remained infected with Pseudomonas meningitis even after extensive sinus and orbital surgery, rapidly declined, and is now deceased. The other patient, after multiple sinus procedures and a medial orbitotomy, was placed on hyperbaric oxygen and is still undergoing treatment.
