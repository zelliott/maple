Cerebral white matter lesions are often observed on MRI scans of elderly nondemented and demented persons. Their pathogenesis is not fully understood but cerebral hypoperfusion may be involved. Atrial fibrillation is a common finding in elderly subjects and may lead to a reduced cardiac output with cerebral hypoperfusion. The authors investigated the association between atrial fibrillation and the presence of white matter lesions.

From 1995 through 1996, the authors randomly sampled 1077 subjects from two ongoing prospective population-based studies. From each participant, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded; atrial fibrillation and left ventricular hypertrophy were diagnosed with a computer program. For one of the two groups (553 subjects), earlier ECGs were available (mean follow-up 4.7 years). All subjects underwent 1.5-T MRI scanning; white matter lesions were separately rated for the periventricular and subcortical regions.

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 1.9% among subjects younger than 75 years and 5.5% in subjects older than 75 years. The total number of subjects with atrial fibrillation was 28. Subjects with atrial fibrillation had severe periventricular white matter lesions more than twice as often as subjects who did not (RR 2.2; 95% CI 1.0 to 5.2) but had no increased risk of subcortical white matter lesions (RR 1.1; 95% CI 0.4 to 2.6). For seven subjects with atrial fibrillation both at baseline and at follow up, these relative risks were 6.3 (95% CI 1.1 to 37.1) and 0.7 (95% CI 0.1 to 3.7).

Atrial fibrillation is associated with periventricular white matter lesions, but not with subcortical white matter lesions.
