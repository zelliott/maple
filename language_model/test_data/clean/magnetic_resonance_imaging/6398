Advances in imaging have had a considerable effect on the workup of many ear, nose and throat problems. The traditional plain films and tomography gave a limited amount of information compared to the more recent advances of ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance. The rapid advances in imaging further complicate the decision-making process with respect to the most appropriate imaging modality for each clinical situation. A brief description of the more frequently used examination is followed by an approach to imaging in various clinical problems.
