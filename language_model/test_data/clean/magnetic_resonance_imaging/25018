Unilateral stimulation of human peripheral nerves activates the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) contralaterally and the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) bilaterally. We aimed at characterizing phase locking between SI and SII in response to electric stimuli applied once every 3 s to the right median nerve at the wrist; phase locking between brain regions has been proposed to either reflect joined processing or information exchange. Ongoing neuromagnetic activity of healthy volunteers was recorded with 204 planar gradiometers covering the whole scalp. After selecting a sensor maximally sensitive to activity in the left (contralateral) SI, phase locking between this sensor and the other 203 sensors was examined from single trial data. Statistically significant phase locking was found at approximately 20 Hz, 80-90 ms after the stimuli between the left SI and the right SII in 9 of 10 subjects. Sensors with high phase-locking values over the left SI and right SII were separated by sensors with no phase-locked activity over the scalp midline, indicating that the phase locking was not caused by the sensors seeing activity from the same sources. The observed SI-SII phase locking would not be reflected in the evoked responses because a considerable part of it was not time-locked to the stimuli. Thus, our finding reveals a unique interaction in the sensorimotor system.
