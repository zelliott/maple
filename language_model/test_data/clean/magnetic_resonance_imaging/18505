The authors report the case of a 14-month-old baby boy with an epidermoid cyst located entirely within the pons and medulla, without an exophytic component. The lesion was examined by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The child was operated upon three times after two recurrences of the lesion. A suboccipital, subtonsillar approach was used for the first and second procedures and a transtemporal approach for the last one. Excision was thought to be complete the first time, since a solid tumor was found and removed in a large cyst. The cyst wall was not identified. No tumor was found during the second procedure despite recurrence of the cyst, which was drained without an attempt to remove the cyst wall. Finally the cyst recurred with a large tumor in the cyst wall which was again totally removed. Consistent with the high mortality of brain stem epidermoid cysts in the literature, the child eventually died. The therapeutic problems, surgical options, and consequences are discussed.
