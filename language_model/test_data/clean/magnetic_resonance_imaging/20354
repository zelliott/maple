Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) is an uncommon intracranial tumor and prognosis is poor. In this study, we assessed the factors affecting the prognosis of AO patients. Seventy AO patients were recruited from 2001 to 2006 in Shanghai Huashan Hospital of Fudan University; all were treated surgically. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis were used to analyze the prognostic effects of 14 different factors, which were selected from clinical, radiological, pathological, and treatment variables. The results showed that chemotherapy, age, primary or secondary tumors, preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores, the presence of epilepsy at initial presentation, radiological contrast infusion, and neurological parameters all correlated with the prognosis of the patients. Furthermore, Cox multivariate analysis also showed that the age (P < 0.048), primary or secondary tumors (P < 0.010), and chemotherapy (P < 0.010) were significantly correlated with the prognosis of the patients. Age and chemotherapy correlated with the prognosis of AO. The patients younger than 50 years old and who received regular chemotherapy were likely to achieve a good outcome. Moreover, individualized treatment after molecular biological typing of AO may improve the prognosis of AO.
