Retrospectively ECG-gated MDCT shows a high correlation and acceptable agreement of left-ventricular functional parameters compared to MR imaging. Thus, in addition to the non-invasive evaluation of coronary arteries, further important additional information of left-ventricular functional parameters with clinical and prognostic relevance can be achieved by one single MDCT examination. For assessment of myocardial viability, low-dose CT late enhancement scanning is feasible, and preliminary results look promising. CT late enhancement adds valuable diagnostic information on the haemodynamical significance of coronary stenoses or prior to interventional procedures.
