Fishtail deformity is a very rare complication of undisplaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children. We report the case of a 10-year old girl presenting with pain in the right elbow eight years after a non-displaced supracondylar fracture of the humerus. Radiographs also demonstrated necrosis of the lateral part of the trochlea and of the head of the radius. With this long-term clinical and radiographic follow-up after a non-displaced supracondylar fracture of the humerus, we would like to point out the possibility of the development of this very rare deformity.
