Three breast tissue expanders were evaluated for compatibility with MR imaging (1.5 Tesla). The metallic components of the breast tissue expanders were shown to be nonferromagnetic, heating < or = .2 degrees C and the artifacts varied. These results indicate that MR procedures may be performed safely in patients with these implants; however, artifacts may obscure implant leaks or breast lesions if located near and metal portion of the breast tissue expanders.
