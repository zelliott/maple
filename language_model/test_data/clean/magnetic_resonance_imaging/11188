Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare syndrome. It is due most often to a spinal meningeal leak. Symptoms due to SIH are often difficult to treat and epidural blood-patch (BP) has been proposed. The aim was to evaluate the effects and the problems associated with lumbar blood-patch to treat SIH.

Case series.

The diagnosis of SIH was made in six consecutive patients on clinical signs and radiological findings (CT-scan and MRI). A lumbar BP (L1-L2 level) was performed as soon as possible after diagnosis. A maximum of three procedures was allowed in case of failure of the initial BP.

BP was effective and well tolerated for five patients (3 immediately after BP, 2 others patients needed 2 and 3 BP). In one patient, an incomplete response was observed and was related to a large CFS leak diagnosed by CT-myelogram.

When the diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is confirmed, a repeated blood patch lumbar procedure can be efficient to treat these patients.
