The aim of this investigation was to determine the frequency and character of the brain parenchyma lesions using CT scan and MR in patients with closed head injury, and afterwards to establish the connection of those changes with clinical parameters (neurological deficit and the degree of consciousness disorder), evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of neuroradiological procedures. The investigation comprised 40 patients with closed head injury. Grade of neurological deficit (Canadian Neurological Scale) and the degree of consciousness disorder (Glasgow Coma Scale) were determined in all patients by the same neurologist. The results revealed significantly higher specificity and sensitivity of brain examination using MR in patients with closed head injury, particularly in the detection of small ischemic and contusion lesions. Likewise, the correlation of positive findings using MR was more significant concerning the grade of neurological deficit and the degree of consciousness disorder compared to the brain examination using CT scan.
