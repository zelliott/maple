The most common source of shoulder pain is soft-tissue dysfunction. Although fractures of the humerus, scapula, and clavicle are common throughout life, most problems encountered between the ages of 15 and 60 are related to the ligaments, tendons, and muscles of the shoulder girdle. This article deals mainly with tendinitis and tendinosis as primary entities, and to a lesser extent with tendon problems attributable to a primarily bony or ligamentous dysfunction.
