A 19 year-old man with a history of dysphagia and chest pain was diagnosed as having a cyst of the esophagus by endoscopic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. The patient's bronchogenic cyst was treated by video-assisted thoracoscopic excision with mini-thoracotomy. This procedure is applicable for patients who require repair of the esophageal wall after excision of a lesion and reduces post-operative complications.
