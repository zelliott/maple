Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is extremely rare in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and in children only isolated cases have been reported, mainly as secondary CNS involvement. A case of fatal primary ALCL of the brain in a 13-year-old white boy is reported. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed decreased absorption in T1- and T2-weighted image showed a hyperintense signal in the right parietal lobe and 2 masses in the right frontal lobe. A frontal lobe biopsy showed a pleomorphic neoplasm diffusely infiltrating the brain parenchyma and composed of large cells with bizarre, often polylobated or horseshoe-shaped nuclei. Immunohistochemical stains showed diffuse strong positivity for CD30, anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein (ALK-1), p80, leucocyte common antigen, CD45RO (UCHL1), and focal staining for epithelial membrane antigen. Immunostainings for cytokeratins, monocyte-macrophage, and B-cell markers were negative. Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein was not detected. To the best of our knowledge, there is only 1 case of primary ALCL of the brain in childhood previously reported in the literature. Before the biopsy, both cases were clinically misdiagnosed as mycobacterial CNS infection. Therefore, primary ALCL should also be included in the differential diagnosis when a mycobacterial CNS infection is suspected in pediatric patients; a careful cytological evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid or cerebral biopsy are essential for an accurate diagnosis.
