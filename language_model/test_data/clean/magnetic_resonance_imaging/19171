We tested the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the follow-up of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy after septal artery embolization. MRI provides a noninvasive visualization of transplanar turbulent flow in order to quantify left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

We followed 10 patients who were treated with septal artery embolization for 12 months. We used gradient echo sequences to document continuous improvement of the outflow tract area and T1- and T2-weighted spin echo sequences to visualize myocardial infarction. A continuous, but not linear, improvement of the outflow tract area occurred after septal artery embolization during the 12-month follow-up period. The improvement of the outflow tract area correlated well with the amelioration of symptoms (r(2)=0.86).

We conclude that MRI reliably detects the degree of obstruction in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. This modality may be especially useful for follow-up after septal artery embolization.
