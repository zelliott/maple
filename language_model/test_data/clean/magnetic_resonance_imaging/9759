Over the past few decades, spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MR imaging) has largely replaced computed tomography (CT) and CT myelography in the assessment of intraspinal pathology at institutions where MR imaging is available. Given its high contrast resolution, MR imaging allows the differentiation of the several adjacent structures comprising the spine. This article illustrates normal spinal anatomy as defined by MR imaging, describes commonly used spinal MR imaging protocols, and discusses associated common artifacts.
