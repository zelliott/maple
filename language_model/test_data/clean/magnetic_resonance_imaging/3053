Documentation via MRI of the healing of ruptured lateral collateral ankle ligaments after functional therapy.

35 patients with ankle sprain were examined by MRI and stress radiographs, 13 were operated afterwards, 22 patients underwent a functional conservative therapy and were examined by MRI and stress radiographs and second time after three months.

MRI reports were correct in 12 of 13 operated cases. After conservative therapy we did not find any disrupted ankle ligament. MRI showed intact ligaments thickened by scar.

MRI is able to show injuries of the lateral collateral ankle ligaments and demonstrates the healing by scar after conservative therapy.
