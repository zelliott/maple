In MRI study of meningioma, it was lack of large group of patients to evaluate MRI qualitative diagnosis, and no consensus had been achieved concerning problems such as peritumoral edema in meningioma. This study was to summarize main clues for diagnosing meningioma through analyzing MRI performance of 126 patients with meningioma.

Among 126 patients with meningioma, 32 were syncytial, 35 were fibroblastic, 24 were psammomatous, 9 were angioblastic, 18 were transitional, 3 were papillary, and 5 were malignant. All patients were scanned with T1, T2-weighted imaging (T1WI, T2WI), and contrast-enhanced T1WI.

Convexity of brain was more likely to be involved, among 126 cases of meningioma, 45 (35.7%) tumors located at convexity of brain. The size of tumor ranged from 1.4 to 9.9 cm. Eighty-one percent of tumors were round or oval in shape. Isointensity or slight hyperintensity of T2WI signals detected in 70.6% patients. The rates of tail sign, and pseudo-capsule were 62.7%, and 49.2%. Extruding sign of brain parenchyma was observed in 83.8% (57/68)of patients with tumor size of > 4 cm. Significantly even and increasing sign in contrast-enhanced T1WI were observed in 104 patients (82.5%). Peritumoral edema occurred in 57 patients (45.1%), and related to tumor size. Other rare signs included cystic changes, bleeding, calcification, osteal changes, and introtumoral vessel symptoms. The correct rate of diagnosis was 95.2%.

MRI performances of meningioma are various. Judgment of extra-brain tumor, typical T2WI signals, tail sign, and significantly even and increasing sign are key factors for diagnosing meningioma.
