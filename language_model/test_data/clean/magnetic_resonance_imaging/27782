We report an unusual case of simultaneous hemorrhage in intracranial aneurysms and in renal cyst in a case of polycystic kidney disease. A 27-year-old gentleman presented with progressive headache and intermittent vomiting of one month duration. Initial computerized tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging/angiography revealed a large mass lesion in the right temporal fossa. Over the previous 15 days, he developed progressive weakness in his left upper and lower limbs, and the headache worsened in severity. A repeat of CT scan showed an evidence of aneurysmal bleed and a large temporal lobe hematoma. The patient underwent urgent evacuation of the intracerebral of hematoma and excision of the redundant aneurysmal sac. The patient made excellent recovery in the post-operative period; however, for him, the pain abdomen was persisting. Detailed work-up with contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan revealed bilateral multiple cysts in the kidneys with evidence of intracystic hemorrhage on the left side. An extensive search of the literature revealed that this kind of presentation has not been reported previously.
