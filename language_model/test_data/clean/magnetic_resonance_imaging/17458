The pituitary gland, sella turcica and the parasellar region can be involved by a wide variety of lesions, including benign and malignant neoplasms as well as a wide variety of non neoplastic tumor-like lesions. Clinical and radiological aspects could help in the differential diagnosis of these lesions. Nevertheless, in many cases only the histopathological analysis could establish the definitive diagnosis. In this paper, we review the nonpituitary tumors of the sellar region emphasizing the associated hormonal disturbances.
