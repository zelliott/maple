Case report of a solitary osteochondroma of the cervical spine causing myelopathy in a 66-year-old woman.

To review the relevant literature and describe a highly unusual clinical manifestation of solitary osteochondroma.

Osteochondromas are common benign bony lesions that seldom occur in the axial skeleton. These lesions are more commonly reported with neural compression in cases of hereditary multiple exostoses (Bessel-Hagel syndrome, diaphyseal aclasis).

Chart review, review of relevant radiographic examinations and histopathologic specimens, clinical follow-up with examination, and literature review.

Manifestation with new neurologic deficit in a 66-year-old patient was singular.

Osteochondromas are unusual in the axial skeleton, and are rarely signaled by neural compression. Occurrence is generally in young adults in the second and third decades. Initial manifestation with a new neurologic deficit in a 66-year-old patient was highly unusual.
