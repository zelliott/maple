The ability to detect and differentiate intracranial infection has markedly improved, first with the introduction of computed tomography and, more recently, with magnetic resonance. Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is the procedure of choice in the evaluation of nearly all intracranial infections. The sensitivity of MR to foci of increased water content, seen in most parenchymal infections, the lack of bone artifact, and the multiplanar capability of MR have led to this preeminence. Computed tomography remains useful primarily in those infections associated with intracranial calcification, such as TORCH syndrome. This article summarizes the most recent CT and MR findings of infection involving the meninges and brain parenchyma.
