We report a case of an intracranial epithelioid schwannoma. Epithelioid schwannoma is a low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor that occurs most commonly in the limbs and inguinal region. Association with cranial nerves has been reported to be rare and in almost all cases has only involved extracranial distal branches.
