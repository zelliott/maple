Paraurethral leiomyoma is a rare, benign, hormone-dependent neoplasm of mesenchymal origin affecting women. The clinical evidence varies, but it tends to be asymptomatic or associated with the sensation of a foreign body; urinary symptoms are rarely described. The distinction among urethral, paraurethral, and anterior vaginal wall leiomyoma can be very difficult owing to their anatomic proximity. Excision of the mass is the recommended treatment, and the diagnosis is confirmed by the pathologic finding to rule out the presence of a sarcoma. A case of paraurethral leiomyoma associated with dysuria, dyspareunia, and obstructive voiding symptoms is reported.
