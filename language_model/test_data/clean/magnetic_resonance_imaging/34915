A new animal model was developed in rabbits (renal metastasis using the VX-2 tumor line), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed before and after intravenous gadoteridol injection to assess lesion conspicuity and characterization.

Six New Zealand White rabbits with renal metastases were studied on a 1.5-tesla Siemens Vision MR unit. Iodinated contrast was given intravenously to the rabbits, before implantation, to visualize the kidneys under fluoroscopy. Using a 5/8-inch 25-gauge needle, 0.1 mL of minced, screened VX-2 tumor was injected percutaneously into each kidney at the corticomedullary junction. Animals were studied on day 7 after implantation. Baseline fast low-angle shot (FLASH) T1-weighted and fast spin echo T2-weighted breathhold scans were first obtained. Then, an additional precontrast turbo-FLASH T1-weighted scan was acquired. After these scans, 0.1 mmol/kg gadoteridol (gadolinium HP-D03A; ProHance) was injected intravenously at a rate of 1.5 mL/second. Dynamic breathhold turbo-FLASH T1 images were then obtained at 0, 6, 12, 19, 25, and 31 seconds after injection and at 1, 2, and 10 minutes after injection. The T1 multislice FLASH two-dimensional scan was repeated at 10 minutes after contrast. Imaging results were analyzed by region of interest measurement and correlated with tissue pathology.

On dynamic T1-weighted turbo-FLASH scans, lesion conspicuity, specifically (SI(kidney)-SI(tumor)/noise), increased from 7 +/- 7 signal intensity precontrast to a maximum of 14 +/- 8 at 1 minute after contrast. This increase was statistically significant (P = 0.002). An initial rapid increase in tumor conspicuity occurred within the first 30 seconds after contrast, with the curve flattening thereafter. Lesion conspicuity on the precontrast T2-weighted scans was 9 +/- 10, not statistically different from results with either of the precontrast T1-weighted scan techniques. Using T1-weighted FLASH technique, lesion conspicuity increased from 10 +/- 5 precontrast to 31 +/- 12 postcontrast. As with turbo-FLASH, the improvement in tumor conspicuity after contrast on FLASH scans was statistically significant (P = 0.02). The difference between postcontrast FLASH scans and precontrast T2-weighted scans also was statistically significant, with postcontrast scans superior for lesion conspicuity (P = 0.01). Each tumor was confirmed on pathologic exam.

This research establishes a model of metastasis to the kidney for use in imaging studies. The conspicuity of a small renal metastasis is shown to be improved on early dynamic imaging, as well as at 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadoteridol. Observation of dynamic signal intensity changes provides additional information regarding lesion characterization, supplementing that from precontrast scans.
