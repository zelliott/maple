The present study assesses the detectability of perfusion defect and the influence of breathhold on pulmonary magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging using contrast-enhanced thick-slice two-dimensional (2D) fast gradient-echo sequence compared with three-dimensional (3D) fast spoiled gradient-recalled sequence. Dynamic studies were performed in 16 patients. MR perfusion images were interpreted by two independent observers using perfusion scintigraphy as the reference standard. The patients were divided into two groups according to the duration of holding the breath measured during MR imaging. The sensitivity and specificity of 2D MR perfusion imaging in detecting perfusion defects were 93% and 94%, respectively, while those of 3D MR perfusion imaging were 89% and 85%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of 2D MR perfusion imaging was significantly higher than that of 3D MR perfusion imaging (P < 0.05) among those who could not hold their breath. Therefore, 2D MR perfusion imaging offers promise for evaluating pulmonary perfusion even among patients who cannot hold their breath.
