The purpose of this study was to investigate the sensorimotor cortex response to plantar vibrotactile stimulation using a newly developed MRI compatible vibration device. Ten healthy subjects (20-45 years) were investigated. Vibrotactile stimulation of the sole of the foot with a frequency of 50 Hz and a displacement of 1 mm was performed during fMRI (echo-planar imaging sequence at 1.5 T) using an MRI compatible moving magnet actuator that is able to produce vibration frequencies between 0 and 100 Hz and displacement amplitudes between 0 and 4 mm. The fMRI measurement during vibrotactile stimulation of the right foot revealed brain activation contralaterally within the primary sensorimotor cortex, bilaterally within the secondary somatosensory cortex, bilaterally within the superior temporal, inferior parietal, and posterior insular region, bilaterally within the anterior and posterior cingular gyrus, bilaterally within the thalamus and caudate nucleus, contralaterally within the lentiform nucleus, and bilaterally within the anterior and posterior cerebellar lobe. The advantages of the new MRI compatible vibration device include effective transmission of the stimulus and controlled vibration amplitudes, frequencies, and intensities. The results indicate that plantar vibration can be a suitable paradigm to observe activation within the sensorimotor network in fMRI. Furthermore, the method may be used to determine the optimal responsiveness of the individual sensorimotor network.
