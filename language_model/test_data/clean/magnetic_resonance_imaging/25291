We describe two adult cases of neurologic complications occurring after influenza vaccination. The first case was a 62-year-old man who experienced convulsions 5 days after vaccination, and the second case was a 70-year-old man who exhibited paraplegia 7 days after vaccination. Diagnoses of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and transverse myelitis with acute motor axonal neuropathy were made, respectively, and steroid pulse therapy and intravenous gamma globulin therapy alleviated the patients' symptoms. Although the efficacy and cost benefit of influenza vaccination have been widely accepted, such neurologic complications might occur in the elderly or even in adults.
