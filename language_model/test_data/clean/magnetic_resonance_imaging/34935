This study linked 2 experimental paradigms for the analytic study of reading that heretofore have been used separately. Measures on a lexical decision task designed to isolate phonological effects in the identification of printed words were examined in young adults. The results were related to previously obtained measures of brain activation patterns for these participants derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The fMRI measures were taken as the participants performed tasks that were designed to isolate orthographic, phonological, and lexical-semantic processes in reading. Individual differences in the magnitude of phonological effects in word recognition, as indicated by spelling-to-sound regularity effects on lexical decision latencies and by sensitivity to stimulus length effects, were strongly related to differences in the degree of hemispheric lateralization in 2 cortical regions.
