The incidence of head and neck odontogenic infections considerably diminished in the last decades due to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Herein we describe a case of acute diffuse facial cellulitis following tooth extraction in a patient with no apparent risk factor. During the acute process, injury was caused to the hypoglossal, vagal, glossopharyngeal and recurrent nerves of both sides. For this reason the patient currently has a nasogastric line for enteral feedings and a tracheotomy tube, which significantly affects his quality of life.
