About 1 in 5 patients with renal cell carcinoma have intravascular tumoral extension at presentation. Level of tumoral extension within inferior vena cava determines surgical approach, with higher extension requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Tumoral invasion of inferior vena caval wall is associated with poor prognosis. We evaluated accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in assessing level of intravascular extension of renal cell carcinoma and predicting vessel wall invasion.

MRIs and surgical database were reviewed from January 1999 to December 2008. Sixty-four patients with suspected intravascular extension of renal cell carcinoma underwent MRI. Forty-one underwent curative or palliative surgery at our institution and were included in final analysis. MRI scans were reviewed to determine intravascular extension and tumoral adherence to the vessel wall, as assessed by circumferential flow around the intravascular tumor and its mobility during different phases of cardiac cycle. MRI findings were correlated with surgical findings to assess accuracy.

There was 87.8% agreement (P < .001; κ = 0.82) between MRI and surgical findings regarding level of intravascular extension of tumor. MRI was highly sensitive and specific (93%) in assessing supradiaphragmatic extension (negative predictive value, 96%). Depending on sign used, sensitivities and negative predictive values in assessing tumoral adherence to vessel wall ranged from 86% to 95% and 81% to 91%, respectively.

MRI is highly accurate in staging intravascular and intracardiac extension, aiding in accurate preoperative surgical planning. MRI may help determine prognosis of renal cell carcinoma by accurately assessing tumoral adherence to the vessel wall.
