The quantitation of in vivo 1H MR spectroscopy and dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging is described for patients with histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Results are presented which suggest that combined use of these techniques may be helpful in improving the characterization of prostate pathologies and ultimately increase the staging accuracy of magnetic resonance.
