Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been recommended for staging and surgical planning in cats with injection site sarcomas (ISS). The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe low-field MRI characteristics of confirmed injection site sarcomas in a group of cats. Low-field MR images, thoracic radiographs, histopathology findings, and medical records of cats that fulfilled histological criteria of injection site sarcoma were retrieved and reviewed retrospectively. Presence or absence of tumor mineralization and pulmonary metastases were recorded from thoracic radiographs. Characteristics recorded from low-field MRI studies included tumor number, volume (ellipsoid method), intensity relative to surrounding musculature, homogeneity, regions of signal void (mineralization) or cavitation, degree and pattern of contrast enhancement, tumor margination, presence of a peripheral T2W hyperintense zone, and bone contact. A total of 19 cats met inclusion criteria. Cats with multiple tumors were more likely to have had previous excisional biopsy, and were less likely to undergo definitive surgery. All tumors were hyperintense relative to surrounding musculature on T1W and T2W images. Larger tumors were more likely to exhibit mineralization (P < 0.05). Tumor volume could not predict tumor-free margins at definitive surgery. The majority of tumors showed moderate to marked heterogeneous contrast enhancement. Infiltrative margins and the presence of a peripheral T2W hyperintense zone were more prevalent following excisional biopsy, while cavitation was more prevalent following incisional biopsy. Findings indicated that low-field MRI characteristics of injection site sarcoma may vary widely and may be affected by prior incisional or excisional biopsy.
