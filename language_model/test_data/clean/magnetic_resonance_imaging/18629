Central nervous system tuberculoma presenting as a solitary mass in an extrinsic location is rare. Due to the increase in incidence of tuberculosis in the western world, there is a corresponding increase in CNS tuberculosis. Cerebellopontine angle tumours are most commonly acoustic schwannomas or meningiomas. Radiosurgery as a primary modality of treatment for many CNS masses without prior pathological diagnosis is increasing in popularity. This report shows that a mass in the CP angle can closely mimic a tumour radiologically and inappropriate radiation treatment was avoided after surgery. Histopathological examination proved it to be a tuberculoma. Awareness of this rare presentation of a solitary tuberculoma in the CP angle is emphasised.
