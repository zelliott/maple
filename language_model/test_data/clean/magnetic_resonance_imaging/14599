A 74-year-old woman presented with persistent dysphagia, dysphonia, and throat gurgling. Prior intraoperative biopsies were negative, and outside imaging revealed supraglottic swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a well-defined T1 and T2 hypointense, avidly enhancing hypopharyngeal mass. Deep intraoperative rebiopsies revealed a tumor with CD34+ tissue, diagnostic of a solitary fibrous tumor. A broad range of nonsquamous cell tumors should be considered when a submucosal laryngeal mass is encountered. MRI may be particularly helpful in guiding appropriate biopsy.
