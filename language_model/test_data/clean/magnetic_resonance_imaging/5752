There is no previous report on the intraspinal ganglion cyst of the posterior longitudinal ligament in a teenager.

To report a case of radiculopathy caused by a ganglion cyst of the posterior longitudinal ligament in a teenager.

Case report.

A 17-year-old male with a 4-month history of left L5 radicular pain was found to have an intraspinal cystic lesion causing radicular compression. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic lesion located in the ventral side of the dura. The patient suffered from severe leg pain. As a result, a surgical operation was therefore performed.

The cyst containing jelly-like components and a hemorrhage was punctured and then extirpated. It originated from the posterior longitudinal ligament. A histological study revealed the cyst to be without any synovial layers.

This is the first report to describe a ganglion cyst originating from the posterior longitudinal ligament in a teenager. This possible etiology should be kept in mind for any other individuals displaying symptoms of spinal nerve root compression as well as disc herniation.
