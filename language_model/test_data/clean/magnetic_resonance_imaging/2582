As shown previously for two-dimensional geometries, anisotropy effects should not be ignored in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and structural information is important for the reconstruction of anisotropic conductivities. Here, we will describe the static reconstruction of an anisotropic conductivity distribution for the more realistic three-dimensional (3-D) case. Boundaries between different conductivity regions are anatomically constrained using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The values of the conductivities are then determined using gradient-type algorithms in a nonlinear-indirect approach. At each iteration, the forward problem is solved by the finite element method. The approach is used to reconstruct the 3-D conductivity profile of a canine torso. Both computational performance and simulated reconstruction results are presented together with a detailed study on the sensitivity of the prediction error with respect to different parameters. In particular, the use of an intracavity catheter to better extract interior conductivities is demonstrated.
