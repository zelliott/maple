We report a fetus with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) first diagnosed by ultrasound in routine prenatal examination and further evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fetal MRI was undertaken with a 1.5-T magnet using a body-phased array coil and an ultrafast imaging technique, half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE). Radiological examination shortly after birth and postmortem examination confirmed the prenatal diagnosis. In this case, fetal MRI provided excellent spatial and tissue resolution with multiplanar display. It revealed additional diagnostic information and improved imaging conspicuity. MRI complemented sonography for further differentiating clinical and sonographic findings.
