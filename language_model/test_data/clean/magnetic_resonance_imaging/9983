We report a case of resected lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas with special reference to the imaging-pathologic correlation. Visualization of a multilocular cystic nature with internal heterogeneous hyperechogenicity on ultrasound, hyperdensity on precontrast computed tomography, and granular hypointensity on T2-weighted image due to abundant internal keratin substances were considered to be keys to the differential diagnosis from other cystic lesions of the pancreas.
