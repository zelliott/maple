We report a patient with unusual MRI abnormalities that had the physical characteristics of ferromagnetic artifact. We believe that the MRI artifacts were due to microscopic embolic metal fragments, most likely from a mechanical heart valve prosthesis. Potential sources of metal emboli should be considered in patients with MRI abnormalities compatible with ferromagnetic artifact.
