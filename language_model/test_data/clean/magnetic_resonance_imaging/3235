Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) is a frequent cause for human infection, and central nervous system disease associated with M. pneumoniae infection is being reported with increasing frequency. We described herein a 60-year-old woman who developed meningitis associated with bilateral optic papillitis following M. pneumoniae infection and discussed the possible mechanisms. To our knowledge, there have been only a few reports that described the meningitis complicated by bilateral optic papillitis in association with M. pneumoniae infection. Our case highlighted the protean neurological manifestations of M. pneumoniae infection.
