A case of post-traumatic cervico-thoracic syringomyelia was complicated, 3 years after the injury, by a bulbar extension manifested by a downbeat vertical nystagmus which became a source of disabling oscillopsia. The syringobulbia was visualized at MRI. The usefulness of syringostomy in such a case is discussed.
