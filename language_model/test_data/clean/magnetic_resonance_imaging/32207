Intracraneal manifestations of Hodgkin's Disease (HD) are extremely rare, with an estimated incidence rate of approximately 0.5%. They can be classified as: 1) treatment-related leucoencephalopathy, 2) central nervous system infections, 3) paraneoplasic syndromes and 4) intracraneal lymphomas, which could be sub-classified into intraparenchymal or intradural masses. We describe a case of a 40 year-old male with mixed cellularity type HD who developed neurological manifestations as relapsed disease. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested leptomeningeal metastases and atypical cells were found in cerebrospinal fluid. The patient died from progressive disease refractory to third line chemotherapy. There are less than 50 similar cases reported in the literature. We review the clinical features and differential diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases in Hodgkin's disease.
