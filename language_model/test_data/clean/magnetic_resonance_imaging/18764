This article reviews the contribution of diagnostic imaging to the intrathoracic staging of non-small cell lung cancer. The principle features of the current staging system are discussed along with the relative roles of the various imaging modalities in the evaluation of the primary tumour and metastatic disease. The emerging role of positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) as a clinically useful, potentially cost effective, complementary imaging technique is also reviewed.
