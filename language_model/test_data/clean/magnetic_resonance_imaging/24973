The synchronized activation of ionic channels generates long-range electrical signals that can be detected on the surface using EEG and MEG. We propose that the spatial and temporal properties of these signals during rhythmic activity are associated with the probabilistic attributes of the ionic channels. Specifically: (1) The EEG-signals present a phase relationship with the open probability of the channels that drives the rhythm, (2) The oscillatory preferences of the signals--the 'EEG spectral profile'--are determined by the location probability (concentration) of the channels. In order to test and apply the hypothesis, it is suggested to correlate open and location probabilities with changes in the structure and dynamic of water molecules, water protons and pH using novel MRI-techniques.
