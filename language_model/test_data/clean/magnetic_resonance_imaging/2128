Documentation of MRI and neurophysiological changes following accidental electrical injury.

Tertiary care referral teaching hospital at Lucknow, India.

A 30-year-old lady developed amnesia and spastic paraparesis with loss of pin prick sensation below the second thoracic spinal segment following electrocution. Her spinal MRI was normal and cranial MRI revealed T2 hyperintensity in the right putamen. Peroneal, sural and electromyography were normal. Tibial central sensory conduction time was normal but central motor conduction time to lower limbs and right upper limb was prolonged.

Neurophysiological study and MRI may help in understanding the pathophysiological basis of neurological sequelae following electrical injury.
