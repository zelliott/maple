The value of magnetic resonance tomography in the diagnosis of carcinoma of the cervix was studied in a prospective series of 20 patients. The results were compared with those of computed tomography and with the clinical findings. The diagnosis depended on the postoperative histology. Gynaecological examination proved superior to imaging methods in determining the extent of local tumour spread. Tumour involvement of the regional lymphatic system was better demonstrated by MRT than by CT. Exact staging proved inadequate with both these methods and the new imaging methods have not produced any changes in operative planning or technique.
