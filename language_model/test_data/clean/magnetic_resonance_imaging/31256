Vasculitis includes a heterogeneous group of multisystemic disorders characterized pathologically by inflammation of blood vessels. The diagnosis of vasculitis is difficult and more often than not, it is made indirectly after eliminating other causes of the stroke. Vasculitis is an infrequent disorder and a rare cause of the stroke. This is a case report of a 41-year-old man who had the first-ever stroke with vasculitis diagnosed histologically in a cutaneous-muscular biopsy from the place not changed by the disease. After corticosteroid therapy the hemiparesis disappeared. The patient has continued the treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.
