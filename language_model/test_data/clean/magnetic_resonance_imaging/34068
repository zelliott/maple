Spontaneous perirenal haemorrhage is a rare abdominal emergency most commonly caused by solid renal tumours. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of different diagnostic methods and treatment modalities.

A total of 9 patients (5 women and 4 men) with spontaneous subcapsular or perirenal haemorrhage caused by renal tumours were treated at two Finnish central hospitals over a period of 20 years.

All the patients presented with flank pain, often severe and associated with a palpable mass and a reduced haemoglobin concentration. Ultrasonography was abnormal in all cases where it was used, but was able to show the tumour and haemorrhage correctly in only one case (13%). Computed tomography had a sensitivity of 71%. Seven patients underwent extrafascial nephrectomy (5 renal cell cancers, 1 malignant oncocytoma and 1 angiomyolipoma) and two with known tuberous sclerosis and bilateral renal angiomyolipomas were treated by superselective embolization. As these few cases were all individual and were collected over a long period of time, general statements about diagnosis and treatment must be approached critically. It may be concluded, however, that spontaneous perirenal haemorrhage is often a surgical emergency necessitating great efforts in terms of diagnosis and treatment. Computed tomography should be performed on all patients nowadays. If the bleeding is caused by a malignant tumour, extrafascial nephrectomy is the treatment of choice. For those with benign tumours selective embolization should be used.
