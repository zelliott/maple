Perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a benign subtype of SAH without known vascular pathology. We report a case of current subarachnoid bleeding in the vicinity of the basilar artery. The patient was on anticoagulation medication and had sustained a head injury 2 days earlier. The bleeding was documented by contrast agent extravasation in MRI. Because of the isointensity of hyperacute blood to CSF in conventional T2 sequences, FLAIR images are mandatory for diagnosis in the hyperacute state.
