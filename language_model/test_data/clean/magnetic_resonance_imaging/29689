The death of 1 twin of monochorionic pairs is associated with a significant risk of brain hypoxic-ischemic damage in the survivor. Ultrasound may diagnose cerebral anomalies only a few weeks after the event. We report 3 cases of single survivors of monochorionic-twin pregnancies in which prenatal magnetic resonance imaging detected brain changes earlier and with better definition of the brain abnormalities than ultrasound.
