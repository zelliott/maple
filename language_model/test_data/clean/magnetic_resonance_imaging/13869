The authors present the case of a 64-year-old woman who experienced a left hemiparesis. An initial diagnosis of subdural hematoma was made based on results of computerized tomography scanning. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging indicated an extraaxial meningioma. Histological findings confirmed an extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). The authors outline the natural history of central nervous system lymphomas and of MALT lymphomas in other tissues. They review seven previously reported cases and emphasize the importance of recognizing these tumors as a distinct clinicopathological entity.
