Immature or mixed mature/immature teratomas of the pineal region were removed radically in three children. After a period of 26 and 25 months, two patients with immature teratomas are alive and well, whereas in the third patient a mixed teratoma locally recurred and caused a fatal rise of intracranial pressure 11 months after the operation. Regular examinations of tumor markers and neuroradiological investigations are mandatory after radical surgery and adjuvant radio- and chemotherapy.
