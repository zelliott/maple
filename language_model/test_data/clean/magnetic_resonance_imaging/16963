It has long been thought that word problems are more difficult to solve than number/equation problems. However, recent findings have begun to bring this broadly believed idea into question. The current study examined the processing differences between these two types of problems. The behavioral results presented here failed to show an overwhelming advantage for number problems. In fact, there were more errors for the number problems than the word problems. The neuroimaging results reported demonstrate that there is significant overlap in the processing of what, on the surface, appears to be completely different problems that elicit different problem-solving strategies. Word and number problems rely on a general network responsible for problem-solving that includes the superior posterior parietal cortex, the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus which is hypothesized to be involved in problem representation and calculation as well as the regions that have been linked to executive aspects of working memory such as the pre-SMA and basal ganglia. While overlap was observed, significant differences were also found primarily in language processing regions such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas for the word problems and the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus for the number problems.
