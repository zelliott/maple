As tissue oxygen tension (pO2) is an important variable in cancer therapy, it would be of major clinical benefit to be able to measure pO2 noninvasively. Current methods for determining pO2 in clinical settings are limited to superficial tumors. The authors measured the apparent diffusion constant (ADC) in an implanted murine fibrosarcoma (RIF-1) using magnetic resonance imaging and correlated the ADC with tissue pO2 measured by electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry. The ADC correlates significantly with tissue pO2 in this tumor (r = 0.89; n = 14) and so may provide a noninvasive index of pO2 in tumors.
