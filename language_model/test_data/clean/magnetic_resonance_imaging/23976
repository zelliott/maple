In cases of primary malignant extradural tumors of the spine, the main goal of the surgery is en bloc resection and reconstruction of the spine. After placing the patient in the lateral position, an en bloc resection of a chondrosarcoma that arose from the right seventh rib head and invaded the adjacent vertebra was performed using a simultaneous anterior-posterior approach followed by spinal reconstruction. The technical details are reported. Paraspinal malignant tumors of the thoracic spine can be safely removed en bloc and the spine reconstructed using this approach.
