The thymic cysts are rare tumors of the neck and anterior mediastinum. The management of these patients in our institution is reported. Minimally invasive procedures are discussed.

Six patients operated in our institution within ten years, with a follow-up of 7.1 +/-3.7 years are studied retrospectively.

There were four women and two men with an average of 39.8 +/-16.5 years. The tumor was found on chest radiograph in four asymptomatic patients, one took medical advice for laryngeal discomfort and another for dysphagia and dyspnea. The tumor was localized in the anterior mediastinum in three cases, in the cervicomediastinal site in two cases and in the cervical site in one case. CT scan was practiced in three patients with a mediastinal tumor and MR imaging in one of them. In patients with cervical or cervicomediastinal tumor, a cervical echography was practiced. All patients were operated on: three by cervicotomy, one by sternotomy, one by partial upper mini-sternotomy and one by right lateral video-assisted mini-thoracotomy. Histology confirmed benign epithelial thymic cyst.

There is no specific marker of thymic cysts. Only the surgical management, leads to precise the diagnosis and to treat these tumors. No mortality, no complications or recurrences are reported. The minimally invasive surgery takes an interesting place for thoracic location, to explore and treat these benign mediastinal lesions.
