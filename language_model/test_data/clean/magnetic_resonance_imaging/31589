To implement a high-resolution first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging protocol (HRPI) at 3 T, and to evaluate the feasibility, image quality and accuracy of this approach prospectively in patients with suspected CAD. We hypothesized that utilizing the gain in SNR at 3 T to increase spatial resolution would reduce partial volume effects and subendocardial dark rim artifacts in comparison to 1.5 T. HRPI studies were performed on 60 patients using a segmented k-space gradient echo sequence (in plane resolution 1.97 x 1.94 mm(2)). Semiquantitative assessment of dark rim artifacts was performed for the stress studies on a slice-by-slice basis. Qualitative visual analysis was compared to quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) results; hemodynamically significant CAD was defined as stenosis >or=70% at QCA. Dark rim artifacts appeared in 108 of 180 slices (average extent 1.3 +/- 1.2 mm representing 11.8 +/- 10.8% of the transmural myocardial thickness). Sensitivity, specifity, and test accuracy for the detection of significant CAD were 89%,79%, and 85%. HRPI studies at 3 T are feasible in a clinical setting, providing good image quality and high accuracy for detection of significant CAD. The presence of dark rim artifacts does not appear to represent a diagnostic problem when using a HRPI approach.
