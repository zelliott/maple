Two cases of hemiballism-hemichorea have been reported in woman patients with hyperglycemia; this was a feature of striatal hyperintensity on the T1-weighted MRI. In the first case, strict management of diabetes and treatment with pimozide effectively suppressed the movement disorder. The Z-score Imaging System revealed hyperperfusion in the bilateral dentate nuclei, left striatum, and bilateral motor cortices. In the second case, painful hemiballism-hemichorea limb, followed by the upper limb. The severity of HB-HC corresponded to the expansion of the striatal lesion. The mechanism of HB-HC by using statistical cerebral blood flow evaluation has also been discussed.
