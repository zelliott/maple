Extra-pulmonary complications of Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) infection in patients with cystic fibrosis are unusual. To the best of the authors' knowledge no case of pyomyositis secondary to Bcc infection has been reported previously.

We report a case of pyomyositis of the forearm caused by Bcc infection in a patient with CF. We also briefly discuss the management of pyomyositis.

Pyomyositis is a potential extra-pulmonary complication of Bcc infection in patients with CF. A high index of clinical suspicion is required to make a prompt diagnosis. Final diagnosis may need MRI. An early diagnosis, aggressive medical therapy, multidisciplinary care and timely surgical intervention are all essential for proper management of this condition.
