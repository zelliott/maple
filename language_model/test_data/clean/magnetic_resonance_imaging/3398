The purpose was to analyze the association between posterior tibial slope (PTS) and mucoid degeneration of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

From October 1999 to May 2010, 84 arthroscopies were performed in 82 patients (18 men and 64 women) with mucoid degeneration of the ACL. The mean patient age was 53 years (range, 25 to 75 years). In addition to this patient group (group I), the study included a control group without mucoid degeneration of the ACL that was randomly matched for age, sex, body mass index, left or right side, and associated lesions (group II). For each group, the diagnosis was made by use of magnetic resonance imaging and arthroscopy, and a plain lateral radiograph was used to measure the PTS.

The mean PTS was 13.5° ± 2.6° (range, 8.2° to 19.5°) in group I and 9.4° ± 2.5° (range, 4.8° to 15.5°) in group II. The mean PTS in group I was significantly greater than that in group II (P < .001). For group I, the mean PTS of the involved knee was significantly greater than that of the uninvolved contralateral knee (P = .044). There were no differences according to age, sex, left or right side, body weight, and body mass index (P > .05).

Mucoid degeneration of the ACL was found to be associated with an increased PTS. The patients with mucoid degeneration of the ACL had a greater mean PTS than matched control patients (13.5° v. 9.4°, P < .001).

Level III, diagnostic study of nonconsecutive patients without consistently applied gold standard.
