Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT) is an uncommon intracranial tumor which is usually encountered in patients with medically intractable complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin. Melanotic differentiation in a DNT has not been reported previously. Herewith we report a case of DNT with unique melanotic differentiation in a 23-year-old female who presented with medically intractable epilepsy. She underwent craniotomy and tumor decompression with a good outcome. We present the histopathological features of DNT with melanotic differentiation and discuss its prognostic significance.
