The authors describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomographic, ultrasonographic and angiographic appearance of a giant nonfunctioning retroperitoneal paraganglioma. To their knowledge, the MRI appearance of a nonfunctioning paraganglioma has not been previously described. The MRI characteristics of the nonfunctioning tumour were similar to those of a functioning paraganglioma and included hyperintensity in T2-weighted images and intense enhancement after intravenous administration of contrast agent.
