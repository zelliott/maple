The total number of MR units available in Japan relative to the population is the highest in the world. The total number of MR units installed in 1996 was 2,663, equivalent to 24 per million population. The average charge per procedure in Japan is only one fifth of that in the United States (USA), approximately US$200 and US$950, respectively, suggesting that economic considerations in Japan may not take the highest priority. Despite the low costs, the utilisation (the number of patients examined each year or per week) of MR units in Japan is only about half that in the USA. As such, an increase in the number of MR units per se does not result in excessive health care costs.
