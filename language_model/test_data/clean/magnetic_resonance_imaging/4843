Transsphenoidal surgery has an important role in the management of pituitary tumors and remains the primary treatment for most adenomas, with the exception of prolactinomas. This update will review the recent neurosurgical literature; modifications to the traditional microscopic approach, including the potential utility of endoscopy and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging, are discussed. The value of experienced surgical judgment and expertise remains clear, over and above the possible advantages of current technology. Preliminary data on the relative cost-effectiveness of surgery vs. medical treatment suggest that surgical approaches compare favorably. It will be important to incorporate future technological advances in surgical technique with new medical therapies in a combined multidisciplinary approach for improved treatment algorithms.
