A case of encephalomyelitis with polymerase chain reaction detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the CSF, and concurrent serologic changes consistent with acute systemic EBV infection is presented and discussed. We document involvement of the brain, spinal cord, and nerve roots, summarize some unusual imaging findings, and note the evolution of CSF oligoclonal bands.
