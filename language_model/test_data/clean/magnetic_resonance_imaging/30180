We report progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia in a 71-year-old man with Sj√∂gren syndrome (SjS). The patient was admitted to our hospital because of progressive dementia and gait disturbance. T2-weighted MR images showed high-intensity lesions in his left frontal white matter thalamus, cerebellum and brainstem. A pathological diagnosis of PML was made by brain biopsy. SjS is frequently accompanied with immunological complications; however, there are few reports on PML in patients with SjS. Recently, isolated CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia is reported to be one of the based immunological conditions associated with the development of PML. In the present case, CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia was also observed on admission, which is also associated with SjS.
