The term "juxta facet cyst" was coined in 1974 by Kao et al. and combines synovial cysts arising from the synovial outpouchings through areas of weakened or destroyed capsular tissue and ganglion cysts developing from mucinous degeneration of periarticular connective tissue. We have operated on 16 patients with juxta facet cysts during the last 3 years. One cyst was located in the thoracic spine, causing a transverse syndrome; 15 cysts were located in the lumbar spine, causing nerve root compression. Diagnosis was established preoperatively by MR in 10 and CT in 3 cases, respectively. The definite classification of the cystic processes was made by histopathologic examination. Surgical treatment consisted of resection of the cyst. Postoperatively, all but 2 patients were free of complaints and no recurrence was observed in the mean follow-up period of 15.5 months. Juxta facet cysts are an uncommon finding, but must be considered in the differential diagnosis of epidural compressive syndromes of the spine.
