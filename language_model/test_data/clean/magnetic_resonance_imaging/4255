We describe an unusual cortical avulsion fracture off the medial tibial plateau of the knee associated with tears of the posterior cruciate ligament and the medical meniscus. This constellation of findings is the reverse of that seen with the Segond injury complex. We postulate that the plain film diagnosis of this fracture, like the Segond fracture, is a clue to the likely presence of associated ligamental and meniscal tears, and to the mechanism of injury.
