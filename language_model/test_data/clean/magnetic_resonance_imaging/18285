Of the 62 patients with intramedullary spinal cord ependymoma treated surgically at our Neurosurgery Division between January 1951 and December 1990 45 had a follow-up of at least 3 years and the longest 30 years. The 28 conus-cauda equina-filum ependymomas operated during the same period are not considered in this study. An analysis of our cases and of the larger published series shows that favourable prognostic factors, apart of course from total tumour removal, which is now usually possible, are a site below the high cervical segments and a mild pre-operative symptom pattern. Patient age at diagnosis, tumour size and "low dose" (< 40 Gy) radiotherapy seem to have no influence on the prognosis. Aggressive surgical removal is the treatment of choice and also for long-term recurrence.
