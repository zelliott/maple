This functional neuroimaging (fMRI) study examined the neural networks (spatial patterns of covarying neural activity) associated with the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) in younger adults. The response signal method was used to systematically increase probe duration (125, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 ms) in a nonverbal delayed-item recognition task. A covariance-based multivariate approach identified three networks that varied with probe duration--indicating that the SAT is driven by three distributed neural networks.
