We present a case of Fryns' syndrome diagnosed prenatally using three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A cleft of the soft palate was diagnosed using 3D thick-slice ultrasonography. Other sonographic findings included a right diaphragmatic hernia, enlarged echogenic kidneys and severe polyhydramnios. The detection of the cleft palate was instrumental in suggesting the diagnosis of Fryns' syndrome in a fetus which also had a diaphragmatic hernia. These findings were also demonstrated with prenatal MRI. The technique of imaging the soft palate en face using a thick-slice technique is presented.
