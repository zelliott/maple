Cor triatriatum is a rare congenital malformation in the heart. A recently published report has indicated that real time transthoracic 3-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) may replace transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the diagnosis of this entity.

A patient with cor triatriatum was examined with 3DE. The results were compared to established echocardiographic methods, inclusive TEE, and to magnetic resonance imaging (MR).

Due to excellent resolution, TEE is still unrivalled in the assessment of some congenital heart diseases such as cor triatriatum. Real time 3DE may have the potential to replace TEE in the future, but refinement of the method is necessary.
