We report a case of a spinal-epidural haematoma occurring in a patient after a combined spinal-epidural anaesthetic. She had been taking clopidogrel and had received perioperative dalteparin for thromboprophylaxis. Despite adhering to standard guidelines concerning administration of low molecular weight heparin perioperatively and stopping the clopidogrel 7 days before the anaesthetic, the patient developed an epidural haematoma.
