The combination of diamagnetic barium sulfate and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) in one suspension produces a macroscopic cancellation of positive and negative magnetic susceptibility components that can potentially eliminate susceptibility artifacts even with gradient echo pulse sequences. The relaxation properties that make the SPIO suspension a useful negative contrast agent are retained.
