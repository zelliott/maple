We aimed to investigate the rate of kernicterus, and physical and laboratory examination findings in hyperbilirubinemic infants with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency.

This study was carried out in the Dicle University Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between June 2005 and June 2006. Out of 56 male neonates who needed an exchange transfusion due to hyperbilirubinemia, 10 with G-6-PD deficiency were included in the study. Maternal age, gestational age, route of delivery, birth weight, age at the time of admission, and treatment and outcome were recorded. Laboratory investigations included determination of direct and indirect serum bilirubin concentrations, blood group typing, direct Coomb test, complete blood count, blood smear, thyroid-stimulating hormone, T4, C-reactive protein, urine analysis, and G-6-PD level.

Out of 56 male neonates requiring exchange transfusion, 10 had G-6-PD deficiency (18%). In G-6-PD deficient neonates, other factors known to cause hyperbilirubinemia were excluded. The mean gestational age and the mean maternal age was 38.2+/-1.0 weeks and 31.3+/-5.9 years, respectively. The mean bilirubin level was 42.1+/-13.7 mg/dL. Four patients required a second exchange transfusions, and only 1 transfusion was sufficient for the remaining patients. Five patients (55%) developed kernicterus.

Early detection of G-6-PD deficiency in the affected newborns may be important for reducing the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia, kernicterus, and the need for exchange transfusion.
