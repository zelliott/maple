Four patients with sarcoidosis presented as hypothalamic-hypophyseal syndrome including diabetes insipidus (DI) were followed up for more than 8 years from the onset of clinical manifestation. The mean age was 26 years, male : female ratio was 3 : 1 and the mean disease duration of 10 years. All patients had hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia. Pituitary enlargement with thickening of the pituitary stalk were detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium enhancement and attenuation in the intensity of the posterior lobe of the pituitary was detected without enhancement. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in the initial improvement of symptoms and gradual decrease in the tumor size but failed to cure polyuria due to DI. The use of desmopressin was necessary for a long period. None of these patients died from DI or central neurosarcoidosis.
