Comparison between two semiquantitative methods and a quantitative evaluation of myocardial blood flow (MBF) for assessment of myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) in patients with CAD.

9 patients with coronary stenoses > 50 % were examined with an ECG-gated Saturation Recovery Turbo FLASH sequence by using Gd-DTPA as contrast agent (CA). The entive measurements were performed both during rest and hyperemia induced by adenosine. The up-slopes of the signal-time S(t) curves in the myocardium and left ventricular (LV) cavity were evaluated by a linear fit. MPR was calculated from the original up-slopes of the myocardial S(t) curves and from the up-slopes, which were normalized to the up-slopes of the LV S(t) curves, respectively. For quantification of MBF values, the mathematical model MMID 4 was used and MPR was evaluated from the MBF values.

With all tested methods, MPR was reduced in myocardial regions subtended by arteries with stenoses >/= 70 % compared with remote regions. With MMID 4 and the normalized up-slope method, differences between severe ischemic and remote regions were statistically significant.

The up-slope method with normalization and quantification with MMID 4 are more sensitive methods to differentiate between remote and ischemic myocardium than the up-slope method without normalization.
