Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a rapidly developing procedure suitable for rectal cancer staging. Initial results are extremely encouraging in T staging while at present this is not so in N staging. MRI is useful in the differentiation between stage T2 and T3 because images can be obtained in multiple planes, tissue contrast is high and thus scans are always perpendicular to the tumor base. However there is a trend to overstaging of rectal cancer frequently due to the concomitant perirectal inflammatory reaction. In a near future, the extensive use of surface coils will certainly increase spatial resolution with consequently improved accuracy.
