Falls are common among the elderly population. Examinations for the cause of falls are usually mundane, but may be challenging, leading to surprising diagnoses. We report on a previously healthy elderly man who presented with repeated falls and rapidly progressive limitations in mobility, in addition to a stutter. Neuroimaging was particularly helpful for making the diagnosis in this patient.
