Both ischemic stroke and peripheral arterial thromboembolism have been described as extraintestinal complications of inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we present the first case with direct cooccurrence of ischemic stroke and peripheral thromboembolism in a 39-year-old patient with Crohn's disease. A pathophysiological model explaining this cooccurrence as well as the significance of prothrombotic risk factors ("hypercoaguable state") in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease and stroke are discussed.
