To determine whether the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of the globus pallidus (GP) in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) correlates with age, disease stage, and fatigue, using T(1) and T(2) mapping to determine whether the mechanism of change is consistent with manganese deposition in the GP as suggested by previous reports.

In all, 30 early-stage PBC patients, four end-stage PBC patients, and 14 female controls were recruited to age-matched groups. MTR, T(1) and T(2) measurements were performed. A bilateral region of interest (ROI)-based analysis was used to calculate GP MTR, T(1), and T(2) values. These were correlated with age, disease status, and fatigue.

MTR measurements showed a significant, negative correlation with age for controls and early-stage PBC patients, a positive correlation with T(2), and no correlation with T(1). Only GP T(2) is significantly lower in early-stage PBC patients than controls, while end-stage patients demonstrated a simultaneous reduction in T(1) and MTR, consistent with GP manganese deposition.

MTR measurements correlate with age in both early-stage patient and control groups, but are not associated with manganese deposition or fatigue severity: only the end-stage disease group shows changes in MTR, T(1), T(2) that are consistent with manganese deposition.
