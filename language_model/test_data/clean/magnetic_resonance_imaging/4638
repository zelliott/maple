We report an unusual observation of Yersinia enterolitica (YE) bacteremia with subcutaneous with subcutaneous abscesses on the scalp and, by gradual extension, cerebritis in a diabetic patient. All clinical signs disappeared after surgical drainage of the abscesses and protracted antibiotherapy. The well-known affinity of YE for iron led us to demonstrate an unrecognized hemochromatosis.
