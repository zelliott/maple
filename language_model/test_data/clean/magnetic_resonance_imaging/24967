A 44-year-old woman with progressive monocular visual loss was found to have ipsilateral optic disc drusen and an ipsilateral orbital apex mass compressing the optic nerve. The mass, not the drusen, was considered responsible for the worsening vision. Visual loss should not be glibly attributed to drusen, particularly if the visual loss is rapidly progressive. Retrobulbar imaging should be considered in such cases.
