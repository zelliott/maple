Chordoid meningioma is a rare subtype of meningioma characterized by myxoid matrices deposited among epithelioid or vacuolated tumor cells and infiltrates of inflammatory cells, and its cytologic features have rarely been reported.

A 57-year-old man with a history of headache and visual disturbance presented with a tumor in the suprasellar region. Intraoperative touch smear cytology of the tumor disclosed a cord-like arrangement of polygonal tumor cells occasionally containing intranuclear inclusions. Furthermore, periodic acid-Schiff-positive, mucinous matrices were deposited among the tumor cells. Also, infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells were noted. Histologic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examination confirmed the diagnosis of chordoid meningioma.

Intraoperative smear cytology in a case of chordoid meningioma showed distinctive cytologic features suggestive of the histologic patterns. The cytologic features, together with a histologic examination, are useful for its diagnosis.
