Gadolinium-enhanced ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) spoiled gradient-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a noninvasive method for evaluating the abdominal aorta and the visceral and iliac vessels. With an enhanced gradient system, 20-48 sections can be obtained during a single 18-32-second patient breath hold. The 3D volume obtained from a single acquisition can be reformatted at a workstation and the vascular anatomy viewed in any projection and with a variety of section thicknesses, making this MR imaging technique particularly useful in the evaluation of aberrant arteries, vascular stenoses, aneurysms, and dissection flaps. Gadolinium-enhanced ultrafast 3D spoiled gradient-echo MR imaging has been used instead of or in addition to conventional contrast material-enhanced MR angiography in patients who have chronic symptoms of mesenteric ischemia, who have abdominal aortic aneurysms, or who are at risk for iodinated contrast material-related renal dysfunction. This technique shows great promise for accurate and noninvasive evaluation of the abdominal aorta and the visceral and iliac vessels.
