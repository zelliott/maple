Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a degenerative disease of the brain associated with a rapidly progressive spongiform encephalopathy. Visual symptoms and neuro-ophthalmological signs are not infrequent, and presentation to an ophthalmologist may result. A case is reported of an 89-years-old gentleman who presented with a short history of isolated deterioration in vision. He underwent ocular intervention but subsequently developed progressive dementia, asterixis, myoclonus, cerebellar and extrapyramidal signs, and cortical blindness. An electroencephalogram was consistent with CJD. The patient progressively deteriorated and died 9 weeks after symptom onset. Limited post-mortem examination confirmed CJD.
