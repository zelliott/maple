Cystic pancreatic lesions are often discovered incidentally as an asymptomatic finding, at a rate which is increasing considerably. In recent years the understanding of such tumors has become clearly differentiated. The spectrum of relevant lesions includes in particular the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), serous cystic neoplasm (SCN) and mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN). With certain knowledge of their histological and radiomorphological structure as well as their distribution in terms of location, age and sex, such tumors are easy to differentiate and demarcate from common pancreatic pseudocysts. This also implies the fundamental understanding of complementary endoscopic procedures such as endosonography, which enables aspiration of the content of the cyst. A number of cystic pancreatic lesions have the potential to undergo malignant transformation along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and therefore necessitate a differentiated approach to their radiological management. This review aims to develop a broad understanding of the pathological and radiomorphological characteristics of cystic pancreatic lesions and provides advice regarding procedures, particularly with respect to incidentally detected lesions.
