Inflammatory diseases, such as non-specific sinusitis, fungal sinusitis and mucocele, commonly involve the sphenoid sinus. Endoscopic surgery provides an easy and successful access to isolated sphenoid sinus diseases (ISSDs) with rare complications.

The incidence of ISSDs has decreased since a wide use of antibiotics. ISSDs can cause severe complications due to the deep location in the skull base. Endoscopic surgery for the sphenoid sinus has recently become popular, with several advantages. The aim of this study was to analyse ISSDs in terms of the clinical symptoms, histological diagnosis and treatment outcomes with our 22 years' experience.

Seventy-six patients with ISSDs, who were treated at Seoul National University Hospital between 1985 and 2007, were analysed. Patients with lesions confined to the sphenoid sinus were included. A retrospective chart review was performed with respect to the symptoms, pathology and treatment outcomes.

Fifty-seven of 76 cases were inflammatory lesions, 9 neoplastic lesions and 10 fibrous dysplasia. Headache was the most common symptom (65.8%), followed by nasal obstruction (22.4%) and postnasal drip (21.0%). Ophthalmologic symptoms were observed in 15 cases (19.7%). Endoscopic sphenoidotomy was performed in 51 of the 57 ISSDs. Symptoms completely improved in 92.2% of the patients.
