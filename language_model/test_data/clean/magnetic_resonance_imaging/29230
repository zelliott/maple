We studied 33 patients with astrocytomas of different grades (68 examinations) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). We found that in 80% of the spectra, the presence of signals in the area of 0.8-1.5 ppm, assigned to lipids/lactate in (1)H-MR spectra, correlated with signal enhancement after Gd-DTPA administration. We suggest that visibility of lipid/lactate signals could be due to blood-brain barrier damage, which is characterized by contrast agent enhancement.
