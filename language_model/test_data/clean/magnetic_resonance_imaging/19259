Morgagni hernia is a rare type of diaphragmatic hernia. It is frequently associated with elusive clinical and radiological findings in the adult and consequently, diagnosis and appropriate therapy are usually delayed. We describe a case in which a Morgagni hernia presented as a right sided cardiophrenic mass on a routine chest X-ray. The diaphragmatic defect was further confirmed by computed tomography (CT), by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest. The defect was closed by a prolene mesh.
