Magnetoencephalography has proven to be a powerful noninvasive tool for investigating the functional organization of the human auditory cortex and its plastic changes. The first part of this review summarizes some recent experiments on the tonotopic organization, which can be observed not only in the slow auditory evoked fields, but also in the middle-latency and the steady-state fields. In the second part of this review, recent studies on plasticity of the auditory cortex are outlined. These studies showed that the cortical representation of tones may change within hours after a reversible "functional deafferentation" (short-term plasticity) and that early musical training leads to an expansion in the cortical representation of complex harmonic sounds (long-term plasticity).
