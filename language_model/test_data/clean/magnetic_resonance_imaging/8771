Left ventricular hypertrophy, a major cardiovascular risk factor for morbidity and mortality, is commonly caused by arterial hypertension. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may contribute to the pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy. The Assessment of Lotrel in Left Ventricular Hypertrophy and Hypertension Study compared a single-pill combination of amlodipine/benazepril at doses 5.0/20.0 mg, 5.0/40.0 mg, and 10.0/40.0 mg with hydrochlorothiazide/benazepril at doses 12.5/20.0 mg, 12.5/40.0 mg, and 25.0/40.0 mg on the reduction of left ventricular mass index measured by cardiac MRI in stage 2 hypertensive patients over 52 weeks of treatment in a randomized clinical trial. A total of 125 male and female patients, > or =55 years of age, with echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy and high-risk hypertension defined as blood pressure > or =160/100 mm Hg or current antihypertensive treatment were enrolled. After 52 weeks of treatment, left ventricular mass index was significantly reduced from baseline with amlodipine/benazepril (mean: 10.16 g/m(2)) or hydrochlorothiazide/benazepril (mean: 6.74 g/m(2); both P<0.0001), with a mean difference between treatment groups of 3.36 g/m(2) (P=0.16). No significant treatment differences were observed in subgroups defined by age, male gender, race, diabetes status, or dose level. However, in female patients, left ventricular mass index reduction was greater with amlodipine/benazepril (P=0.02). Both treatments were well tolerated.
