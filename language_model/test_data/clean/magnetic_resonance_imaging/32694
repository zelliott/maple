A fast spiral chemical shift imaging (spCSI) sequence was developed for application to hyperpolarized (13)C imaging. The sequence exploits sparse spectra, which can occur in such applications, and prior knowledge of resonance frequencies to reduce the measurement time by undersampling the data in the spectral domain. As a consequence, multiple reconstructions of a given data set have to be computed in which only components with frequencies within a certain bandwidth are reconstructed "in focus" while others are severely blurred ("spectral tomosynthesis"). The sequence was tested at 3 T on a phantom containing approximately 1.5-M solutions of alanine (Ala), lactate (Lac), and pyruvate-pyruvate hydrate C1-C2 ester (with two resonances, PPE1 and PPE2) at thermal equilibrium polarization, all enriched to 99% (13)C in the C1 carbonyl positions. Results from spCSI with a single spatial interleaf (single-shot spCSI) and three interleaves (three-shot spCSI) were compared with those obtained by phase-encoded free induction decay CSI (FIDCSI). The metabolic maps of all four resonances for three-shot spCSI, and of PPE1 and PPE2 for single-shot spCSI demonstrate resolution and localization properties similar to those of the FIDCSI images. The metabolic maps of Ala and Lac for single-shot spCSI contain minor artifacts due to signal overlap of aliased resonances.
