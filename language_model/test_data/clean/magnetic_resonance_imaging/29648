There are a variety of disease entities that present as symmetrical basal ganglia abnormalities. Although these findings may not indicate a specific diagnosis, knowledge of the characteristics of diseases that affect this area can limit the differential considerations. Clinical information is often essential for narrowing the possible pathology that can be found here.
