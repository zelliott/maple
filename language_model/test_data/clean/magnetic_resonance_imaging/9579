Although ultrasound remains the screening modality of choice in evaluation of the fetal nervous system, magnetic resonance imaging with its multiplanar imaging ability and high signal-to-noise ratio is highly accurate in illustrating the morphologic changes of the developing brain and fetal brain abnormalities. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging is an established powerful tool for obtaining additional information in evaluation of anomalies of the fetal face, neck, and spine. It is helpful to patients and their health care professionals in making vital management decisions and aids in genetic counseling for future pregnancies.
