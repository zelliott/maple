The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of 7-T contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the female pelvis.

Ten healthy female volunteers were examined on a 7-T whole-body MR system utilising a custom-built eight-channel transmit/receive radiofrequency body coil. The examination protocol included (1) T1-weighted fat-saturated 2D spoiled gradient echo (FLASH), (2) dynamic T1-weighted fat-saturated 3D FLASH, and (3) T2-weighted TSE sequences. For qualitative image analysis pelvic anatomy, uterine zonal anatomy and image impairment due to artefacts was assessed using a five-point scale. For quantitative analysis contrast ratios between the junctional zone and myometrium were obtained for T2-weighted MRI.

Two-dimensional FLASH MRI offered the best overall image quality (meancontrast-enhanced 4.9) and highest tissue contrast (meancontrast-enhanced 4.7). T2-weighted TSE imaging provided a moderate to high conspicuity of the uterine zonal anatomy with mean scores ranging from 3.5 for endometrium to 4.65 for myometrium. Overall image impairment was rated strongest for T2-weighted MRI (2.9) and least for 2D FLASH MRI (mean 4.2).

This study demonstrated the feasibility of 7-T T1-weighted MRI of the female pelvis and current constraints associated with T2-weighted MRI.

• Dynamic contrast-enhanced female pelvis MR imaging at 7 T is feasible. • Unenhanced T1-weighted MRI offers inherent hyperintense delineation of pelvic arterial vasculature. • Two-dimensional FLASH MRI provided best overall image quality and least artefact impairment.
