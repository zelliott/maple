Few have been reported on the role of early primary ligament repair for acute unstable elbow dislocation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome of early primary ligament repair for unstable elbow dislocation followed by protected early joint mobilization exercise. Thirteen patients who underwent operative treatment due to unstable elbow dislocation without associated fracture were retrospectively reviewed. There were 11 male and 2 female with average age of 37 years (range; 18-72 years). Surgical indications of the unstable elbow were subluxation or non-congruent elbow joint on the radiographs following closed reduction. Elbow dislocation which required extension block splint over 45 degrees to maintain reduction was considered as unstable elbow dislocation. In ten patients, full stability was restored only after both medial and lateral structures were re-attached. In two patients, only lateral structure (LCLC and common extensor tendon) was repaired and in one patient, only medial structure (MCL and flexor pronator tendon) was repaired for stability. Overall mean functional Mayo Elbow Performance Score was 93.5 (range; 70-100). No elbow was dislocated or subluxated after operation. All ten patients returned to previous work level in average of 3.5 months. Heterotopic calcification was noted in six patients and three had mild ulnar nerve symptoms after operation. In conclusion, primary ligament repair in acute unstable elbow dislocation were successful, because surgery achieved sufficient stability to allow early exercise.
