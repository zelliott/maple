Radiation studies, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), revealed that these techniques can accurately determine the site of a tumor, the borders of its spread to the adjacent anatomic structures. They also revealed the features of CT in detecting osseous structural destruction and the advantage of MRI in visualizing the soft tissue component of a neoplasm and in distinguishing the degree of contrast of tumor tissue and concurrent secondary inflammation. The accuracy of CT and MRI for small tumors is 45-80 and 29% higher than that of X-ray study and traditional tomography, respectively. The potentialities of all radiation diagnostic techniques for over 3.0-cm tumors are equal.
