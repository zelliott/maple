Langerhans cells granulomatosis is a rare disease characterized by the clonal proliferation of the Langerhans cell, a cell element pertaining to the mononuclear phagocytes system. Hepatic involvement may be presented, particularly in the multifocal or disseminated form, together with the remaining surrounding organs. Radiologic findings have recently been reported including echographic, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance of the hepatic lesion of the disease. The case of a patient whose initial radiographic study suggested the existence of hepatic metastasis and which was later diagnosed with multifocal granulomatosis of Langerhans cells with hepatic involvement is reported. Radiologic and histologic images are provided and the data reported in the literature concerning this disease are reviewed.
