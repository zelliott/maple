The purpose of this study was to analyze the treatment of recurrent parotid gland cancers with radioactive iodine ((125)I) seed implantation.

Fifteen patients with recurrent previously irradiated parotid gland cancers were treated with postoperative (125)I seed implantation between April 2004 and June 2009. Local control, survival rates, and side effects were retrospectively reviewed.

The 3-year and 5-year local control rates were 67% and 53.6%, and the overall survival rates were 76.2% and 66.7%, respectively. Four patients with House-Brackman (H-B) grade IV cancer recovered to grade II during follow-up. Four patients (26.7%) developed grade IV skin ulceration. Two patients (13.3%) developed moderate fibrosis of the subcutaneous tissues, and 2 patients (13.3%) had hearing loss for 1 year after brachytherapy.

This study showed excellent local control and a good survival rate in patients who received (125)I brachytherapy. These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small number of patients and the relatively short follow-up.
