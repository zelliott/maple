Eight patients with liver metastases from endocrine gastrointestinal tumours were examined with magnetic resonance imaging of the liver before and during treatment with interferon. T1, T2 and tumour size were measured and compared with tumour marker levels and symptomatic improvement or deterioration. Before therapy all tumours showed a long T1 and T2, in comparison to normal liver and fat, and during therapy they all showed a decrease in T1. As no change in liver T1 and fat T1 occurred, the decreased tumour T1 is considered to be a therapy effect. This cannot be fully explained but is possibly due to a reduction in tumour growth rate during interferon treatment. There was no certain correlation between tumour T1 and tumour marker levels or symptomatic changes.
