To test the hypothesis that dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) provides a useful in vivo measure of passive blood retinal barrier permeability surface area product (BRB PS) in experimental diabetic retinopathy.

BRB PS (cm(3)/min) was measured using DCE-MRI and Gd-DTPA (MW 590 Da) in urethane-anesthetized control rats, sodium iodate-treated rats, rats receiving intravitreally injected human serum albumin (HSA) or vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF), or in rats that were diabetic for 2, 4, 6, or 8 months.

Sodium iodate-treated rats exhibited an eightfold increase (P < 0.05) in BRB PS compared to that in control animals. Furthermore, in iodate-treated rats, the average vitreous signal enhancement was linearly dependent on Gd-DTPA dose (r = 0.91, P < 0.0001). Six hours postinjection, VEGF/VPF-treated rats exhibited a threefold increase in BRB PS (P < 0.05) compared to eyes injected with HSA. In 2-, 4-, and 6-month diabetic rats, BRB PS was not significantly different (P > 0.05) from control BRB PS values. After 8 months of diabetes, a twofold increase (P < 0.05) in PS over control PS values was found. DCE-MRI demonstrated that the BRB becomes leaky immediately before death, possibly causing an artificial increase in retinal permeability in methods that require enucleation or retinal isolation to assess permeability.

DCE-MRI provides a sensitive, noninvasive, and linear assay that accurately measures, without potential artifacts associated with death and enucleation, passive BRB PS in experimental diabetes. DCE-MRI BRB PS measurements are expected to provide a useful surrogate marker of drug treatment efficacy.
