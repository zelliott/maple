Microparticulate embolization of meningiomas is a useful preoperative measure, but the potential risk of hemorrhagic complications should be recognized and balanced against the benefits. We report a case of subarachnoid hemorrhage occurring immediately after the embolization of a meningioma. Techniques for early diagnosis, such as CT, and early surgical intervention are crucial to a promising outcome. Large-size and necrotic or cystic components of a meningioma are probable risk factors that demand special consideration.
