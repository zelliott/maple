To determine spontaneous involution of unilateral acoustic tumors in untreated patients.

Outcome of a continuous study, 1982 to present.

Private tertiary otology/neurotology referral center.

Patients with unilateral acoustic tumors for whom interval imaging was selected rather than surgery or gamma knife radiation, 1982 to the present.

Interval imaging with computerized axial tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging.

Spontaneous involution of acoustic tumors.

Forty-seven patients with unilateral acoustic tumors were untreated and followed up with interval imaging for 1 to 12.5 years. Six patients (13%), whose ages ranged from 59 to 74 years and who were followed up for 4.3 to 12.5 years, demonstrated imaging evidence of spontaneous acoustic tumor involution. Involution varied from 3.4 mm to 15 mm.

Spontaneous involution of acoustic tumors does occur. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determine this potential.
