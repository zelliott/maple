Magnetic resonance (MR) findings in one case each of extradural and intradural arachnoid cyst are described. Thoracic segments were involved in both cases. The cysts were slightly more intense than cerebrospinal fluid in both cases on T1 weighted images. The nature and extent of the lesions were better demonstrated on MR images as compared with combined myelography and computed tomography.
