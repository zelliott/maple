Functional renal imaging-a fast-growing field of MR-imaging-applies different sequence types to gather information about the kidneys other than morphology and angiography. This update article presents the current status of different functional imaging approaches and presents current and potential clinical applications. Apart from conventional in-phase and opposed-phase imaging, which already yields information about the tissue composition, BOLD (blood-oxygenation level dependent) sequences, DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) sequences, perfusion measurements, and dedicated contrast agents are used.
