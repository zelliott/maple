Dermoid tumor associated with cerebral aneurysm is extremely rare. We report here a case of ruptured suprasellar dermoid cyst associated with middle cerebral artery (M1) aneurysm and stenosis of adjacent arterial trunks. The characteristic feature of this association is the tight adhesion of the vascular lesion to the tumor capsule.
