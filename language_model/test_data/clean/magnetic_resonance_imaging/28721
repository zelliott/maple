We describe 4 patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) who were treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) after getting no immediate response from a 3-5 day course of high dose intravenous methylprednisolone. All had clinical features to suggest poor prognosis and MRI findings to indicate extensive white matter changes in the brain. Two patients who had spinal cord involvement as well, required ventilatory support during acute phase of the illness. All the 4 patients recovered dramatically. Recovery pattern suggested that IVIg might be useful in fulminant ADEM. Further trials are needed to look for the efficacy of IVIg alone and in combination with methylprednisolone in the treatment of ADEM.
