Amyloidosis is a rare disease that can involve a great variety of organs. As a consequence, clinical and radiological manifestations are very different as well. We report on a patient with primary amyloidosis who presented with diffuse pancreatic involvement detected by ultrasound, helical CT, and MRI. There are very few imaging descriptions about this glandular involvement in amyloidosis in the literature. Despite the apparent uncommon radiological appearance, we believe that this entity should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of diffuse infiltrative pancreatic lesions in the appropriate clinical and analytical setting.
