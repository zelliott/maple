In a prospective study we examined the diagnostic value of MRI and MR cholangiography (MRC) in patients suffering from hepatobiliary disease. By using hepatobiliary contrast media (Mn-DPDP, Gd-BOPTA), sensitivity and specificity of MRI were significantly increased. In 65 patients we comparatively analyzed the diagnostic results of MRI and MRC versus ultrasound, CT and invasive techniques such as ERCP. We conclude that the use of MRI and MRC improves the diagnostic evaluation of patients with hepatobiliary disease.
