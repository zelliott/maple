We studied the assessment of proximal biceps tendon lesions including degeneration, tendon luxation, and partial and complete tendon tears with 3T MR arthrography and CT arthrography. Thirty-six patients who underwent both studies, as well as arthroscopy were included in the study. The images were randomized and blinded and independently reviewed by two musculoskeletal radiologists. The pooled sensitivity for lesion detection for CT arthrography was 31% and the specificity 95%. The pooled sensitivity for MR arthrography was 27% and the specificity 94%. There were no statistically significant differences between CT and MR. The interobserver agreement calculated with the kappa statistic was poor for CT and for MR. Both CT arthrography and MR arthrography perform poorly in the detection of biceps tendon pathology of the shoulder.
