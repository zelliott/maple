Stem cell therapy is an emerging treatment modality in cardiovascular disease. The best cell type and delivery method in different cardiovascular diseases remain to be determined.

The MSC-HF trial is a phase 2, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intramyocardial delivery of autologous bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in patients with chronic ischemic heart failure. A total of 60 patients will be randomized in a 2:1 pattern to receive intramyocardial injections of either MSCs or placebo. Patients will be followed up for 12 months.

Bone marrow will be obtained by aspiration from the iliac crest. Mesenchymal stromal cells will be isolated, and culture will be expanded for 6 to 8 weeks. A total of 12 to 15 MSC or placebo injections will be placed in an ischemic viable region of the myocardium using the electromechanical NOGA-XP system (Biologics Delivery Systems Group, Johnson & Johnson, Irwindale, CA).

The primary endpoint is change in left ventricle end-systolic volume, measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) at 6-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints are left ventricle ejection fraction, ventricular volumes, wall thickness, and systolic wall thickening measured by MRI or CT in addition to measurement of myocardial scar tissue by MRI. Other secondary endpoints are safety of treatment, clinical symptoms and functional capacity, weekly angina attacks, use of short-term nitroglycerine, and quality of life.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of intramyocardial delivery of MSCs in patients with ischemic heart failure has been set up to confirm the positive findings in open-labeled clinical trials.
