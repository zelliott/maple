A neonate presented with Dandy-Walker syndrome associated with occipital meningocele and spinal lipoma, manifesting as soft masses on the skull and lumbosacral regions. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a large posterior fossa cyst between the fourth ventricle and occipital meningocele, but the aqueduct was patent and there was no sign of hydrocephalus. A cyst-peritoneal shunt was emplaced at the age of 8 days followed by partial removal of the spinal lipoma and untethering of the cord at the 3 months. Follow-up examination of age 3 years found almost normal development, although the cyst still persisted.
