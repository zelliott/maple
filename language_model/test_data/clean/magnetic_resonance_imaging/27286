The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of undertaking visual functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in very preterm children.

Forty-seven infants born at less than 32 weeks gestational age (25 males, 22 females; mean (SD) age at birth 28.8 wks [1.9]) were scanned using 1.5 T MRI as part of a longitudinal neuroimaging study. These infants were scanned at preterm age (within 2 wks of birth) and at term-equivalent age. Quantitative T2* data and fMRI in response to visual stimuli (flashing strobe) were acquired in this population. T2* values were compared at preterm age and at term-equivalent age using a two-tailed t-test. A general linear model was used to evaluate occipital lobe response to visual stimuli.

T2* values were significantly higher at preterm age than at term-equivalent age in both the medial and lateral occipital lobes (preterm infants: 187.2 ms and 198.4 ms respectively; term infants: 110.9 ms and 133.2 ms respectively; p<0.002). Significant positive occipital lobe activation (q<0.01) was found in 3 out of 65 (5%) fMRIs carried out at preterm age and in 19 out of 26 (73%) scans carried out at term-equivalent age.

Visual stimuli do not elicit a reliable blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in very preterm infants during the preterm period. This suggests that BOLD fMRI may not be the appropriate modality for investigating occipital lobe function in very preterm infants.
