Pick's disease is a subset of fronto-temporal dementia characterised by severe atrophy of the temporal and frontal lobes due to marked neuronal loss accompanied by astrocytic gliosis enriched in glial acidic protein. The remaining neurones have intracytoplasmic inclusions composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, called Pick bodies, in addition to hyperphosphorylated tau in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Gel electrophoresis and western blotting using markers of glycoxidation (advanced glycation end products, N-carboxyethyl-lysine and N-carboxymethyl-lysine: AGE, CEL, CML, respectively) and lipoxidation (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal: HNE, and malondialdehyde-lysine: MDAL) were used in the frontal and occipital cortex in three Pick's disease cases and three age-matched controls. In Pick's disease, increased AGE, CML, CEL, HNE and MDAL bands of about 50 kDa were observed in the frontal cortex (but not in the occipital cortex) in association with increased density of glial acidic protein bands. Bi-dimensional gel electrophoresis and western blotting also disclosed increased amounts and numbers of glial acidic protein isoforms in the frontal cortex in Pick's disease. Moreover, redox proteomics showed glycoxidation, as revealed with anti-CEL antibodies and lipoxidation using anti-HNE antibodies, of at least three glial acidic protein isoforms. The present results demonstrate that glial acidic protein is a target of oxidative damage in the frontal cortex in Pick's disease.
