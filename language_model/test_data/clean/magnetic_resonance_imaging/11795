Congenital dermal sinus is a type of closed spinal dysraphism. Cervical and thoracic regions are the rare sites for dorsal dermal sinuses. Dermal sinuses are frequently associated with dermoid or epidermoid tumor and osseous abnormalities such as bifid spinous process. The association of dorsal dermal sinuses with vertebral body anomalies is very rare. We present MR imaging features of a case of thoracocervical dorsal dermal sinus associated with multiple vertebral body anomalies.
