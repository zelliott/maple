A 9-year-old girl had hemiparesis, and a diagnosis of primary Sj√∂gren syndrome was made. The neurologic dysfunction was multifocal, involving both the brain and spinal cord, and was recurrent; the findings mimicked multiple sclerosis. Corticosteroid treatment during episodes of acute neurologic dysfunction appeared to be beneficial.
