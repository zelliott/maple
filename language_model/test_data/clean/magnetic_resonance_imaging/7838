Inadequate or incomplete information on radiology requisitions may have a substantial impact on the radiological process. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of standardization and computerization of radiology requisitions on the quality of provided data, satisfaction of hospital staff and access time.

The impact of requisition support was assessed at each step of the improvement process for inpatients: before (Step 1), after standardization (Step 2) and after computerization of radiology requisition (Step 3). The quality of information provided was assessed by proportion of missing data on MRI and CT requisitions. Satisfaction was assessed by an anonymous auto-questionnaire filled by ordering physicians, radiologists and radiology technicians. Access time was prospectively assessed.

Standardization of radiology requisition resulted in a significant drop in proportion of missing data. Computerization of radiology requisition, based on the single standardized radiology requisition, further improved the quality of information reported on radiology requisitions. The median access time was significantly improved (from 5 to 3days) for the largest provider of CT requisitions.

Standardization and computerization have a synergistic effect on the overall quality improvement. Moreover, the computerized provider order entry enables traceability of information, makes communication between radiologists and ordering physicians easier and improves examination planning.
