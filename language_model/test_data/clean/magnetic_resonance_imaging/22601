Cerebral edema, as assessed by computer-assisted tomography, has been proposed as a prognosis factor of poor outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, this radiological finding might wrongly influence the decision to maintain or withdraw treatment in critically ill patients.

We present the case of a 63-year-old female presenting with poor clinical grade after an aneurysmal rupture that developed extensive right hemispheric cytotoxic edema. With appropriate treatment, the brain edema progressively resolved and the clinical state improved.

We discuss the importance of recognizing the possible reversibility of such extensive hemispheric edema and its relevance to patient management.
