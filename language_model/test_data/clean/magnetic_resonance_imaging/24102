The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles as a magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent in differentiating metastatic from benign lymph nodes. Eighteen patients with primary lung malignancy and suspected regional lymph node metastases underwent MR imaging before and after Combidex(R) infusion in a multi-institutional study. All MR sequences were interpreted by one or more board-certified radiologists experienced in imaging thoracic malignancy. Each patient was evaluated for the number and location of lymph nodes, homogeneity of nodal signal, and possible change of MR signal post contrast. All patients underwent resection or sampling of the MR-identified lymph node(s) 1-35 day(s) post contrast MR imaging. In all, 27 lymph nodes or nodal groups were available for histopathologic correlation. Combidex had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 80% in identifying pathologically confirmed metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes. Based on our preliminary data, Combidex MR imaging may provide additional functional information useful in the staging of mediastinal lymph nodes.
