To assess whether 18F-dopa PET/CT is able to provide information relevant in changing the clinical management of patients with gastro-enteropancreatic (GEP) tumours where there is negative or inconclusive conventional radiological imaging (ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy.

From January 2005 to October 2006, 84 patients with clinical and biochemical suspicion of GEP tumours were investigated by US and CT scans, MRI and 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy. In 13/84 (15.4%) both conventional radiological imaging and 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy provided negative or inconclusive findings, and patients were referred for 18F-dopa PET/CT imaging. Each patient received 5.3 MBq x kg(-1) 18F-dopa intravenously, and imaged 60 min later using a hybrid PET/CT scanner.

18F-dopa PET/CT detected the primary tumour in all 13 patients (size range, 7-26 mm, mean, 18 mm; SUVmax range, 2.3-16.3, mean, 5.7) and further 12 unsuspected lesions (size range, 12-23 mm, mean 17; SUVmax range 2.8-12.7, mean 4.6). Confirmation of the PET/CT findings was obtained in all patients from histopathological analysis of tissue obtained after surgery and/or biopsy. All the 18F-dopa-positive primary lesions were confirmed as being the primary tumour at histology, whereas of the other 12 unsuspected 18F-dopa-positive lesions, 11 were found to be metastatic deposits and one due to unspecific inflammation (one false positive result). Notably, the results of 18F-dopa PET/CT imaging changed the clinical management in 11/13 patients (84%).

Our preliminary results suggest that 18F-dopa PET/CT has a promising role in GEP patients with negative or inconclusive findings at conventional radiological imaging and 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy. The findings were helpful in biopsy guidance and played a major role in changing the management of those patients.
