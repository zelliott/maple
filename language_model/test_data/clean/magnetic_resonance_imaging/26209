To compare diagnostic applicability of combined computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with that of meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy in the preoperative localisation of MEN II related phaeochromocytoma.

Retrospective study

University hospital, The Netherlands.

17 patients with MEN II patients (33 adrenal glands) who were operated on for phaeochromocytoma. MIBG scintigraphy, CT and MRI were used to localize phaeochromocytoma. Histopathologically, an adrenomedullary lesion more than 1 cm in size was classified as a phaeochromocytoma.

Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of combined CT and MRI and MIBG scintigraphy, compared with histopathological findings.

Sensitivity of combined CT and MRI (27 adrenal glands) was 87%, with a specificity of 100% and a diagnostic accuracy of 89%. MIBG scintigraphy (31 adrenal glands) had a sensitivity of 92%, a specificity of only 17%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 77%.

If unilateral adrenalectomy is done when only one adrenal gland contains a phaeochromocytoma, then MRI should be the method of choice for localising MEN type II related phaeochromocytoma. MIBG scintigraphy can be restricted to those patients in whom MRI does not show a tumour.
