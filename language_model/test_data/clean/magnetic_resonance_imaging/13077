Lymphangiomas are benign tumors resulting from a congenital lymphatic malformation in infant and children. Most common sites are head, neck and axilla, and scrotal lymphangioma is very rare. Lymphangiomas are classified as capillary, cavernous, and cystic type and cystic type is most common. Complete surgical excision is definitive treatment and incomplete excision leads to local recurrence. We report a case of scrotal lymphangioma in 68-year-old male patient. Gray-scale sonography revealed multiseptated, hypoechoic mass abutting the upper pole of the normal right testis. Color Doppler sonography showed no remarkable blood flow in the mass. MRI demonstrated multispetated extratesticular and extraepididymal mass in the right scrotum. Surgical excision was performed and the histopathologic diagnosis was a cystic lymphangioma. In conclusion when multiseptated cystic scrotal mass was discovered in an elderly patient, scrotal lymphangioma should be included in differential diagnosis.
