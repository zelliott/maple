The preliminary results of magnetization transfer (MT) imaging on a whole body 4.0 T system are presented. Cooked egg phantoms and several volunteers were imaged on 1.5 and 4.0 T magnets interfaced to GE Signa scanners. The MT ratio (MTR), signal difference to noise ratio (SDNR), and contrast parameters were measured at both fields and compared. Furthermore, single-shot Z-spectroscopy was used to characterize the frequency dependence of the MT phenomenon. The results show that MT imaging can be safely performed at 4.0 T without exceeding limitations of radio frequency power. The MT effect is more pronounced at the higher field, leading to better quality images with higher contrast and SDNR. The Z-spectra are not markedly different at the higher field although the MTR is greater. The potential applications of this technique to study neurodegenerative diseases, as well as, perfusion imaging and angiography are discussed. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 1999;10:527-532.
