To determine the best combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters for the detection of locally recurrent prostate cancer after external beam radiation therapy.

Our Institutional Review Board approved this study with a waiver of informed consent. Twenty-six patients with suspected recurrence due to biochemical failure were part of this research. The MR protocol included T2-weighted, MR spectroscopy, and diffusion-weighted MRI. Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy was the standard of reference. We used logistic regression to model the probability of a positive outcome and generalized estimating equations to account for clustering. The diagnostic performance of imaging was described using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

The area under the ROC curve of MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) was 83.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 75.5-89.1). The combination of all MR techniques did not significantly improve the performance of imaging beyond the accuracy of MRSI alone, but a trend toward improved discrimination was noted (86.9%; 95% CI = 77.6-93.4; P = 0.09).

Incorporation of MRSI to T2-weighted and/or diffusion-weighted MRI significantly improves the assessment of patients with suspected recurrence after radiotherapy and a combined approach with all three modalities may have the best diagnostic performance.
