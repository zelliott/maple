We report a case of a pulmonary venous malformation in a 4-year-old boy who presented with recurrent pneumonia. A radiograph revealed a right infrahilar mass and a hyperlucent right lung. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a mass containing intensely enhancing areas and multiple phleboliths located in the right lower lobe and encasing the right bronchus and right inferior pulmonary vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) precisely revealed the mass demarcation. A right lower lobectomy was performed and a pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a venous malformation. To the best of our knowledge, a venous malformation in pulmonary tissue has not been reported in the English literature. Herein, we report a case of a pulmonary venous malformation, with the radiograph, CT, MRI, and blood pool scan findings, along with its pathologic correlation.
