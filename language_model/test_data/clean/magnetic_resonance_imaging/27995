We report the case of a woman who developed central pontine myelinolysis in spite of gradual correction of hyponatremia. The good clinical evolution as well as the influence of rapid correction of serum sodium concentration in the unfolding of this rare condition are discussed. Several diagnostic procedures, mainly auditory-evoked responses and magnetic resonance imaging are also analysed. We remark the particular interest of the auditory-evoked responses in the attestation of an eventual remyelination.
