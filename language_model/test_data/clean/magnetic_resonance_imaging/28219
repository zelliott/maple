The inherent vulnerability of the knee to injury and degenerative change means that there is a major requirement for an imaging technique capable of assessing such damage accurately, rapidly and non-invasively. Over a relatively short time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as the technique of choice in the assessment of internal derangement of the knee. The present review describes the wide application of MRI to the knee and considers the position of MRI in relation to other diagnostic methods.
