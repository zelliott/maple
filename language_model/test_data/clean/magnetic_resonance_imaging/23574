Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is a type of extra nodal malignant lymphoma seen in organs such as the stomach, thyroid and salivary glands. Furthermore, occurrence of colorectal MALT lymphoma is extremely rare. We report a case of a solitary rectal MALT lymphoma treated by surgical resection and radiotherapy. Lymphoma should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis when dealing with large bowel pathology. We would advocate the use of surgery as a primary treatment option for a medically fit patient.
