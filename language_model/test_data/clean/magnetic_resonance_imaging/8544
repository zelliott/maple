Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a well-defined clinical entity that is frequently misdiagnosed because little information regarding this type of headache exists in the Emergency Medicine literature. This report presents a case and relevant review of the literature on SIH. An understanding of the characteristic symptomatology, appropriate evaluation, treatment options, and prognosis is essential if the emergency physician is to provide the most appropriate care to these patients.
