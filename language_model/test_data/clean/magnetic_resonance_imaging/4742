The aim of this study is to investigate and correct for machine- and object-related distortions in magnetic resonance images for use in radiotherapy treatment planning. Patients with brain tumours underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the radiotherapy position with the head fixed by a plastic cast in a Perspex localization frame. The imaging experiments were performed on a 1.5 T whole body MRI scanner with 3 mT m-1 maximum gradient capability. Image distortions, caused by static magnetic field inhomogeneity, were studied by varying the direction of the read-out gradient. For purposes of accuracy assessment, external and internal landmarks were indicated. Tubes attached to the cast and in the localization frame served as external landmarks. In the midsagittal plane the brain-sinus sphenoidalis interface, the pituitary gland-sinus sphenoidalis interface, the sphenoid bone and the corpora of the cervical vertebra served as internal landmarks. Landmark displacements as observed in the reversed read-out gradient experiments were analysed with respect to the contributions of machine-related static magnetic field inhomogeneity and susceptibility and chemical shift artifacts. The machine-related static magnetic field inhomogeneity in the midsagittal plane was determined from measurements on a grid phantom. Distortions due to chemical shift effects were estimated for bone marrow containing structures such as the sphenoid bone and the corpora of the cervical vertebra using the values obtained from the literature. Susceptibility-induced magnetic field perturbations are caused by the patient and the localization frame. Magnetic field perturbations were calculated for a typical patient dataset.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
