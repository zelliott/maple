Females with Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome may require surgical removal of uterine remnant(s) which can be accomplished with a laparoscopic approach, described in this case series.

Nine females with MRKH and pelvic pain were treated with laparoscopic resection of uterine remnants without major complication. The following management recommendations are offered: (1) preoperative evaluation for urinary tract anomalies and postoperative cystoscopy; (2) medial traction of the remnant to allow adequate exposure of the pelvic sidewall; (3) awareness of possible anomalous vascular supply to uterine remnant; (4) individualized management of associated endometriosis; (5) careful use of surgical terminology, avoiding use of the word hysterectomy.

Laparoscopic removal of uterine remnant(s) is safe and effective.
