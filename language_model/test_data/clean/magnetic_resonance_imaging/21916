The syndrome of intermittent claudication can be induced not only by vascular insufficiency of the lower limbs but also by diseases of the spinal cord and cauda equina. The authors describe a sixty-year-old man with intermittent claudication due to spinal canal stenosis who was successfully treated with beraprost sodium, a stable prostaglandin I2 analogue. This drug has a long biological half-life and is orally effective in vasodilation, which is suggested to be beneficial in treating this syndrome. Beraprost sodium may become one of the major drugs for conservative therapy of intermittent claudication induced by spinal canal stenosis.
