Alterations of cerebral glucose metabolism are well anticipated during cerebral ischemia. However, detailed spatiotemporal characteristics of disturbed cerebral glucose metabolism during acute ischemia remain largely elusive. This study aims to delineate spatiotemporal distributions of [18]F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake using positron emission tomography imaging, particularly at the peri-ischemic zone, and its correlation with tissue outcome.

The intraluminal suture middle cerebral artery occlusion model was used to induce focal cerebral ischemia in rats (n=48). All animals underwent sequential MRI and FDG positron emission tomography imaging at different times (30-150 minutes) after middle cerebral artery occlusion. MR and positron emission tomography images were coregistered. FDG uptake in the peri-ischemic zone was assessed in relation to middle cerebral artery occlusion duration, cerebral blood flow, apparent diffusion coefficient, and 24-hour T2 lesions.

Elevated FDG uptake was consistently observed at the peri-ischemic zone surrounding the presumed ischemic core with low FDG uptake. Both the spatial volume and the uptake level of the hyper-uptake region were inversely correlated with the duration of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The hyper-uptake regions exhibited a mild reduction of cerebral blood flow (28.2±3.2%) and apparent diffusion coefficient (9.1±1.4%) when compared with that in the contralateral hemisphere. Colocalization analysis revealed that, with reperfusion, an average of 12.1±1.7% of the hyper-uptake volume was recruited into final infarction.

Elevated FDG uptake at the peri-ischemic zone is consistently observed during acute cerebral ischemia. The region with elevated FDG uptake likely reflects viable tissues that can be salvaged with reperfusion. Therefore, acute FDG positron emission tomography imaging might hold promise in the management of patients with acute stroke.
