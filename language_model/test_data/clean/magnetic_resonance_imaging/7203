Cavernous angiomas and venous angiomas may be discovered as associated lesions in the same patient. Most Authors report that Venous angiomas are not true vascular malformation; they should be considered as variant of normal venous drainage, consisting of tortuous medullary veins converging into a dilated draining one. By rule, they are quite asymptomatic, and very rarely bleed. On the other side, cavernous angiomas are true vascular malformations, usually angiographically occult. Their association is relatively rare, but it is important because of the possibility of bleeding, which should be related to the presence of the cavernous malformation. We report the cases of three patients studied by Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance and Digital Angiography in our Neuroradiologic Department.
