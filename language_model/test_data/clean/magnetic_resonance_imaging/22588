The clinical applications of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for defining viability are evolving as a result of the advantage of the technique's excellent spatial resolution. The value of delayed hyperenhancement imaging is for the accurate identification of the infarcted myocardium with resolution that allows determination of the transmural extent of myocardial injury. In addition, nonischemic patterns of myocardial injury such as dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been reported in other disease states. Delayed hyperenhancement may have an additional role in guiding the management of or determining the prognosis for diseases such as myocarditis. In this study, the clinical application of delayed hyperenhancement is demonstrated for various cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction, including right ventricular infarction; microvascular obstruction; and nonischemic cardiomyopathy such as dilated cardiomyopathy and myocarditis.
