The author presents a method for the mapping of diencephalic somatotopography by the use of computerized image acquisition of CT and/or MRI scans with a computer graphics technique. Data gathered from exploratory stimulation and recordings during the normal course of stereotactic surgical procedures can then be used with this image acquisition and graphics technique for composing diencephalic somatotopographical maps.
