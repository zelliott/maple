Forty-six patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix were examined with spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a superconducting magnet operating at a field strength of 0.5 T. All subjects later underwent lymphadenectomy and, when appropriate, radical hysterectomy. Surgical-pathologic correlation was carried out in order to assess the accuracy of the imaging modality in the staging of the disease. In the detection of nodal involvement, the accuracy of MR was 76%. The accuracy in determination of tumour size approached 100%. In the assessment of parametrial and vaginal involvement, the accuracy was 85% and 100% respectively.
