Dynamic susceptibility contrast-MRI requires an arterial input function (AIF) to obtain cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and mean transit time. The current AIF selection criteria discriminate venous, capillary, and arterial profiles based on shape and timing characteristics of the first passage. Unfortunately, partial volume effects can lead to shape errors in the bolus passage, including a narrower and higher peak, which might be selected as a "correct" AIF. In this study, a new criterion is proposed that detects shape errors based on tracer kinetic principles for computing cerebral blood volume. This criterion uses the ratio of the steady-state value to the area-under-the-curve of the first passage, which should result in an equal value for tissue and arterial responses. By using a reference value from tissue, partial volume effects-induced shape errors of the AIF measurement can be detected. Different factors affecting the ratio were investigated using simulations. These showed that the new criterion should only be used in studies with T(1) -insensitive acquisition. In vivo data were used to evaluate the proposed approach. The data showed that the new criterion enables detection of shape errors, although false positives do occur, which could be easily avoided when combined with current AIF selection criteria.
