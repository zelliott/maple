Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. However, it remains a difficult diagnosis problem to differentiate between benign and malignant breast lesions, especially in small early breast lesions.

To assess the diagnostic value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) combined with T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) for small breast cancer characterization.

Fifty-eight patients (65 lesions) with a lesion <2 cm in diameter underwent 3.0 Tesla breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including DWI and histological analysis. Three observers with varying experience levels reviewed MRI. The probability of breast cancer in each lesion on MR images was recorded with a 5-point scale. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were compared by using the Z test; sensitivity and specificity were determined with the Z test after adjusting for data clustering.

AUC of T2WI and DWI (Observer 1, 0.95; Observer 2, 0.91; Observer 3, 0.83) was greater than that of T2WI (Observer 1, 0.80; Observer 2, 0.74; Observer 3, 0.70) for all observers (P < 0.0001 in all comparisons). Sensitivity of T2WI and DWI (Observer 1, 90%; Observer 2, 93%; and Observer 3, 86%) was greater than that of T2WI alone (Observer 1, 76%; Observer 2, 83%; Observer 3, 79%) for all observers (P < 0.0001 in all comparisons). Specificity of T2WI and DWI was greater than that of T2WI alone for observer 1 (89% vs. 72%, P < 0.01) and observer 2 (94% vs. 78%, P < 0.001).

DWI combined with T2WI can improve the diagnostic performance of MRI in small breast cancer characterization. It should be considered selectively in the preoperative evaluation of patients with small lesions of the breast.
