The authors report one case of aneurysmal rachidian cyst who concern a young girl of eleven years old presenting lumbagos with pyramidal irritation on a L2 and L3 lesion. The radiological exploration (CT, MRI) has a double interest: to find again lytical pictures of the rear arch blowing the cortical, liquids levels, logets which remind the macroscopical appearance of the aneurysmal rachidian cyst; to specify the regional extension of preoperative interest. The histological confirmation of the aneurysmal rachidian cyst after a surgical treatment and the conformity of anatomo-radiological descriptions, confirm the predictive value of the semeiology described in case of aneurysmal rachidian cyst.
