A 9-year-old girl presented with profoundly decreased vision in both eyes and bilateral optic disc swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large intraventricular mass. Excisional biopsy diagnosed metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC). This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of ACC metastatic to the brain in a child. It also illustrates the importance of differentiating optic neuritis from papilledema in children.
