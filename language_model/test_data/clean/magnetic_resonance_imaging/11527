The primary aim of the audit described was to examine antiepileptic drug use among adult in-patients with learning disability. A secondary aim was to examine investigation in those patients. For the purposes of this paper "Learning disability" is synonymous with ICD-10 "Mental Retardation", "Mental Handicap" or "Intellectual Impairment" and should not be confused with the North American use of the term which refers to discrete, specific problems in mental abilities such as reading. A total of 75 adult patients on both the Northgate and Prudhoe sites (managed by Northgate and Prudhoe NHS Trust) were identified as being treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for postulated epilepsy. Only 12 (16%) patients were being treated with three AEDs or more, the remainder being on either one or two AEDs. All patients with a history of status epilepticus were prescribed rectal diazepam or, more rarely, intranasal midazolam. The number and type of investigations performed on patients varied widely and was sometimes limited by the patient's ability to co-operate with procedures. Overall, 28 patients were identified who might benefit from a reduction in the number of AEDs prescribed. In 15 of these patients antiepileptic drug regime was currently being reduced. The increased utilization of sleep/sedated electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI--for partial seizures), where practical, may also increase diagnostic accuracy in identifying epilepsy and its aetiology. Audit will be repeated in 12 months.
