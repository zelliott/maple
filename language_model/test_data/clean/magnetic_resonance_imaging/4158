In a 6-year longitudinal study of a patient with relapsing progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), we used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess N-acetylaspartate (NAA) from a large central brain volume to evaluate the relationship between this marker of neuronal integrity and clinical disability. During the follow-up period, there was one major relapse and its subsequent partial remission. Changes in the brain NAA to creatine ratio correlated strongly with clinical disability (Spearman rank coefficient = -0.73, p < 0.001). We interpret this as evidence that axonal dysfunction or loss contributes to functional impairment of patients with MS. Because the NAA signal in the large volume of interest originated predominantly from white matter that appeared normal on conventional MRI, these results also suggest that some degree of axonal dysfunction may be widespread in acute, severe relapses.
