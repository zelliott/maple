In three patients with histologically proved cavernous hemangiomas of the spinal cord, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was superior to myelography, delayed computed tomography (CT) myelography, and contrast-enhanced CT in depicting the lesion. The presence of mixed subacute and chronic hemorrhage, suggested by mixed high- and low-signal-intensity components of these lesions on MR images, may be characteristic of this rare, intramedullary vascular malformation.
