A new nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, Rotating Delivery of Excitation Off-resonance (RODEO), has been developed to assist surgeons in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. A nonrandomized, prospective study of 100 patients with a high suspicion of breast cancer was conducted; these patients were examined by RODEO and conventional breast imaging, including mammography. Forty-one breasts were removed by mastectomy; each pathologic specimen was examined by sectional analysis. This study was undertaken to determine the extent that RODEO can aid in detecting breast tumors (including multicentric disease) and in evaluating candidates for conservative breast surgery. RODEO detected 85 pathologically confirmed lesions, 64 of which proved to be malignant. RODEO had a sensitivity of 95%, compared with a sensitivity of 58% for conventional imaging. More study is needed to determine distinguishing MRI characteristics that are suspicious for malignancy. RODEO may be used clinically to assess multicentricity and response to chemotherapy.
