We describe the clinical, imaging, histologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features as well as the DNA ploidy analysis of two primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms demonstrating prominent cytoplasmic lipid accumulation originating in the posterior fossa of adults. These two tumors most likely exemplify a variant of medulloblastoma with heavily lipidized cells and support the postulated pluripotentiality of primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms. Recognition of this entity as a phenotypic variant of medulloblastoma will militate against diagnostic confusion with other entities that may contain cells with lipoblastic or adipocytic differentiation.
