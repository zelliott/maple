Solitary focal eosinophilic granuloma (EG) is one element in the spectrum of diseases associated with Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (LCH). This report documents the occurrence of a primary isolated hypothalamic EG in a man who presented with diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism. His treatment consisted of complete microsurgical excision of the lesion. After a 13-month follow-up period, no residual tumor was evident on magnetic resonance imaging and no other lesions were present in peripheral tissues. This case is unique in several respects: 1) it is the third documented case of a primary isolated hypothalamic LCH granuloma diagnosed in a living patient; 2) it is the only known example of complete microsurgical excision of such a lesion in the hypothalamic region; and 3) it demonstrates the efficacy of direct surgery in this scenario, as compared with other treatment modalities such as biopsy and irradiation, suggesting that complete surgical excision may represent the treatment of choice for isolated intracerebral LCH granulomas, being curative in most instances. Also, the literature is reviewed for information about the diagnosis and treatment of this particular type of unifocal brain lesion.
