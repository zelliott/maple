Fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized our ability to image the fetus. Using fast scanning techniques, individual images are obtained in 300-400 ms, allowing for imaging of the fetus without sedation. MRI is most useful for evaluation of the anomalous fetal central nervous system, for further characterization of complex anomalies not fully elucidated by ultrasound and for evaluation of patients desiring fetal surgery. This review describes the history of fetal MRI, discusses current applications and mentions developments on the horizon.
