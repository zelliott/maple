Mediastinitis is a life-threatening condition and would appear to have been rarely reported as arising as a central-venous catheter-associated complication. Here we report on one cancer patient featuring a Port-A catheter tip positioned within the innominate vein, who developed mediastinitis and mediastinitis-like symptoms subsequent to chemotherapeutic-agent infusion through this catheter. The relevant literature pertaining to this condition was reviewed, and the possible pathophysiology of the condition was discussed.
