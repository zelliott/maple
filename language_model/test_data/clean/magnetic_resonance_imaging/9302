The authors report the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in a 52-year-old man with cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis C who developed episodic acute hepatic encephalopathy Type C following placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Brain MRI revealed hyperintense T2 signal and restricted diffusion distributed through the cerebral cortex. The patient's mentation improved with treatment of his hyperammonemia. Brain MRI performed 5 months later revealed diffuse cerebral atrophy and new areas of hyperintense T2 signal in the cerebral white matter. The cortical signal abnormalities and low apparent diffusion coefficient values on the initial MRI resolved with exception of a mild amount of hyperintense FLAIR signal in the cingulate cortex. Acute hepatic encephalopathy following portosystemic shunting -- either from placement of TIPS or from development of spontaneous shunts -- is a widely recognized complication of portal hypertension and cirrhosis. We report MRI findings of reversible cytotoxic edema in a patient with acute hepatic encephalopathy following placement of TIPS.
