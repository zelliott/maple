Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is still the standard technique in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), despite low pathological specificity and poor correlation to the disability. The results of T2- and T1-weighted imaging with and without contrast and the lesion characteristics are presented in this review. The numerous differential diagnoses and the diagnostic MRI criteria are also reviewed.
