We report the case of a traumatic Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome (SFMC) which is the cortico-subcortical type of suprabulbar palsy. A 10-year-old boy was brain injured in a traffic accident in August 1996. He was found comatous (initial GCS = 6) without any focal neurological deficit. The hemodynamic situation was stable even though he presented two wounds of the scalp and a hemoperitoneum that required intensive perfusions. The initial CT scan elicited a frontal fracture, ischemo hemorrhagic lesions of the right frontopolar and anterior temporal cortex. On the second day, he developed on the left side a subdural collection and a extradural hematoma which was surgically withdrawn. The comatous state ended on the ninth day. On examination, The child was awake and alert, able to understand spoken and written language but unable to speak. There was masticatory diplegia: the mouth was half open, the patient was drooling, chewing was impossible. The most striking feature was the automatic voluntary dissociation which might be observed on laughing, crying and yawning. The patient was unable to initiate swallowing but reflex swallowing was preserved once food was placed into the pharynx. The child had a deficit of voluntary control of muscles supplied by nerves V, VI, IX, X, XI. These clinical features are the hallmarks of SFMC. The first case was reported in 1837 by Magnus. The syndrome was described by Foix Chavany et Marie in 1926, and called SFMC by Weller (1993). His literature review of 62 SFMC allowed the differentiation of five clinical types: the classical and most common form associated with cerebrovascular disease, a subacute form caused by central nervous system infections, a developmental form, a reversible form in children with epilepsy and a rare type associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Bilateral opercular lesions was confirmed in 31 of 41 patients who had CT or MRI performed, and by necropsy in 7 of 10 patients. As previously reported, the outcome was poor for this boy who recovered very limited orofacial motor abilities. The medical functional readaptation was long et tedious and took in consideration the fact that the speech disturbance was anarthria and not an aphasic or an apraxic one and the age of onset of this acute acquired syndrome.
