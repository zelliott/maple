The article presents the results of clinical, laboratory, CT and MRT examination and treatment of patients with otogenic intracranial complications (OIC) hospitalized to ENT clinics for the last 10 years. The statistics show that the number of OIC patients tends to decrease for the last 40 years. This may be explained by perfection of specialized ENT service in backcountry rural districts. It is emphasized that use of antibiotics and other anti-inflammatory drugs before hospitalization changes a clinical OIC picture and complicates early diagnosis especially the diagnosis of cerebral and cerebellar abscesses.
