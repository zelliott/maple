The diagnostic potential of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography (MRCP) has improved as a result of evolving technique. MRCP has the advantage of negligible morbidity and mortality in contrast to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This study was performed to evaluate MRCP as a replacement for diagnostic ERCP for the suspicion of common bile duct (CBD) stones.

From 1998 to 2001, MRCP was performed in 202 patients with a suspicion of CBD stones based on medical history (MH), cholestatic liver function tests (CL), both MH and CL or other reasons. ERCP was performed in all patients where MRCP indicated the presence of CBD stones and in those patients with a persistent strong clinical suspicion for CBD stones despite a negative MRCP.

In 25 patients, MRCP suggested CBD stones which were proven with ERCP in 24 patients. Despite a negative MRCP, 27 patients had a subsequent ERCP. None of these patients appeared to have CBD stones. In this group, MRCP resulted in 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity in detecting CBD stones. Follow-up of all patients revealed 5 more patients with persistent clinical suspicion or cholestatic liver function values. Assuming CBD stones in these patients, MRCP had a sensitivity of 83 % and a specificity of 99% for this diagnosis.

In the case of CBD stone suspicion, MRCP should be the diagnostic procedure of choice.
