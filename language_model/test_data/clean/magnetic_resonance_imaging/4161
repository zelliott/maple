We report 18 patients who presented prior to age 20 years with epilepsy or fixed neurologic deficits. MRI showed signal abnormality extending from the cortex to the superolateral wall of the lateral ventricle. Histology showed cortical disorganization, neuronal cytomegaly, balloon cells, indistinct cortical gray matter-white matter junctions, and variable accompanying astrogliosis. We propose that this transmantle dysplasia is a specific anomaly resulting from abnormal stem cell development.
