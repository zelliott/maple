A case of spinal extramedullary cysticercosis with location in basal cisterns is reported. It was revealed by a severe sciatalgia and studied with MR imaging which is precious for the diagnosis and the follow-up. Cerebral cisternal arachnoiditis is the main problem in this racemose form where long medical treatment is necessary.
