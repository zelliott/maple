Four cases of aspergillus spondylodiscitis were treated with operative debridement and fusion. In this rarely encountered mycotic infection of the spine in immunocompromised patients rapid destruction of the intervertebral disc and vertebral bodies can occur. In advanced cases antimycotic drug therapy is thought to be ineffective and a forcing indication for surgery exists when the destruction is progressive and spinal cord compression is imminent or manifest. Spinal instrumentation can be of help in maintaining or restoring spinal stability and maintaining spinal alignment. In our four patients the aspergillus spondylodiscitis was successfully eradicated and fusion achieved. In two of three patients with a neurologic deficit, this deficit disappeared. Two patients died within 6 months after the operative treatment, due to complications related to the underlying illness. One patient was left with a subtotal paraplegia.
