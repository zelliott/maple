The aim of this study is to evaluate the value of early radiological investigations in predicting the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome of infants with inflicted traumatic brain injury (ITBI).

Clinical and radiological investigations of 24 infants with ITBI were performed during the acute phase of injury (1-3 days), and during the early (4 days up to 3 months) and late (>9 months) postinjury phases. The clinical outcome in survivors (n = 22) was based on the Rankin Disability Scale and the Glasgow Outcome Score.

Five out of 24 infants (21%) had a poor neurodevelopmental outcome (death and severe disability), 17 infants (71%) had different developmental problems and 2 infants were normal at the mean age of 62 (54-70) (95% CI) months. A low initial Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or below [p < 0.05, OR 13.0 (1.3-133.3)], the development of brain oedema [p < 0.005, OR 13.0 (1.6-773)], focal changes in the basal ganglia during the acute phase [p < 0.01, OR 45 (2.1-937.3)], the development of new intracerebral focal changes early postinjury [p < 0.05, OR 24.1(1.0-559.1)], a decrease in white matter [p < 0.01, OR 33 (1.37-793.4)] and the development of severe atrophy before 3 months postinjury [p < 0.05, OR 24 (11.0-559.1)] were significantly correlated with a poor neurodevelopmental outcome.

Early clinical and radiological findings in ITBI are of prognostic value for neurodevelopmental outcome.
