A previously healthy 16-year-old woman experienced progressive dyspnea on exertion. The echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a significant increase in cardiac chambers, severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, and prominent ventricular trabeculations suggesting noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCC). The patient underwent heart transplantation 5 years after the NCC diagnosis, and the anatomopathological examination evidenced diffuse biventricular hypertrabeculation compromise, including the basal region of the biventricular wall. There is no consensus about the gold-standard diagnostic criteria, which demands a conceptual review and attention to another point: the relation of trabeculation volume and prognosis.
