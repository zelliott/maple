A patient affected by an ischaemic lesion of the right medial thalamic nucleus presented with a uniocular dissociation of upward vertical saccades and pursuit movement, with absent upward vertical saccades in the left eye. Clinical observations were confirmed by magnetic field scleral search coils analysis. During the vertical eye movement the patient denied any diplopia, thus suggesting a transient visual suppression in the left eye.
