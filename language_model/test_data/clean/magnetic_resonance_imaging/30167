Several lines of evidence have highlighted the role of the serotonergic system in working memory (WM) processes. The X-linked Mono-Amine Oxidase A (MAO A) gene, coding for an enzyme especially involved in the serotonin (5-HT) catabolism, presents a well-characterized functional polymorphism consisting in a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the promoter region with high activity and low activity variants. The high activity allele carriers have been associated with higher enzyme expression, lower amine concentration and altered prefrontal cortex (PFC) function during motor inhibition, but a direct effect of MAO A genotype on WM-related brain activity has not been demonstrated. We have studied the relationship of this polymorphism to brain activity elicited by a spatial working memory task (n-back) using blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging in 30 healthy male individuals matched for a series of demographic and genetic variables (COMT Val108/158Met). We show that the high activity allele was significantly (p-level<0,001) associated with increased activity of the right ventro-lateral PFC (VLPFC, BA 47) during the high load condition of the n-back task. Our data reveal pronounced genotype-related functional changes in specific prefrontal region (VLPFC) subserving spatial working memory. Moreover, given the well-known role of this area in inhibitory control, our finding also provides new evidence for the involvement of 5-HT in PFC-mediated WM function.
