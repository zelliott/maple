To assess the value of MRI in the diagnosis of portal cavernoma with biliary obstruction.

and methods: six patients referred for clinical suspicion of biliary obstruction and portal cavernoma were explored with MRI. all patients were explored using a signa 1.5 t GE MR unit, with high gradient field strength and torso phased array coil. Biliary ducts were explored with ss-fse sequences of MR-cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), coronal and oblique coronal 20mm thick slices. Then, coronal T2w with shorter TE eff, MR-angiography and delayed T1w sequences were performed. CT scan and sonographic examinations of the liver were performed in all patients. Two patients were operated on and 2 underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiography.

Three different types of biliary involvement were found: in 3 cases findings that mimic cholangiocarcinoma spreading along the common bile duct and in 3 other cases multiple smooth extrinsic impressions along the common bile duct; in one patient MRCP demonstrated an irregular narrowing of the common bile duct mimicking chronic cholangitis. In all cases, the bile duct varices appeared of low T2W signal; in three cases, fibrosis was identified on delayed sequences.

MRCP and MR-angiography can be proposed as a first imaging study in patients with portal cavernoma and cholestasis or bile duct dilatation.
