To assess predictive factors of long-term facial nerve function in a series of patients undergoing vestibular schwannoma surgery and to evaluate the reproducibility of the relevant parameters.

Prospective.

Three tertiary referral neurotology units in two separate countries.

A total of 67 patients, with normal preoperative facial function and an anatomically intact facial nerve postoperatively, undergoing vestibular schwannoma surgery during a sequential 18-month period.

Recording of intraoperative stimulus amplitudes (minimum intensity medial to the tumor after excision) and postoperative facial nerve function up to 2 years after surgery.

Long-term facial nerve function related to tumor size, early postoperative facial nerve function, and intraoperative electrophysiologic intensities.

Multivariate logistic regression model identified tumor size and the minimum intensity required to provoke a stimulus threshold event medial to the tumor after excision as independent predictors of a favorable initial outcome. Immediate facial nerve function was the only independent predictor of long-term normal function. The sensitivity of this predictor was 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89-100%); specificity, 83% (95% CI, 62-100%); positive predictive accuracy, 96% (95% CI, 91-100%); and negative predictive accuracy, 77% (95% CI, 54-100%).

The combination of electrophysiologic intensities and tumor size are reproducible and better predictors of initial facial nerve function than any individual parameter, but long-term facial nerve function is more likely to have a better outcome if the nerve is left intact and a per-operative graft repair is not performed. The study suggests that although the best available predictor of overall long-term facial nerve outcome is the level of early postoperative function, this factor is not useful in surgical rehabilitation decision making.
