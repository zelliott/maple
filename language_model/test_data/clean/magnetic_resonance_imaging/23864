Posterior tibial slope was evaluated in 30 normal and 30 varus knees using magnetic resonance imaging. The mean tibial posterior slope in the medial plateau was 10.7 degrees (range: 5 degrees - 15.5 degrees) in the normal knees and 9.9 degrees (range: 1.5 degrees - 19 degrees) in the varus knees. The mean tibial posterior slope in the lateral plateau was 7.2 degrees (range: 0 degrees - 14.5 degrees) in the normal knees and 6 degrees (range: 1 degrees - 13 degrees) in the varus knees. Although these differences were not statistically significant, there was a large range in the posterior tibial slope in both groups. When 10-mm thickness of bone was resected in the middle of the lateral plateau in total knee arthroplasty, the thickness of the bone resection in the anterior and posterior part of the lateral plateau was measured. The presumed thickness of bone was 10.1 mm (range: 7.3-13.9 mm) in the anterior part and 7.5 mm (range: 5-10.3 mm) in the posterior part. A large range in the measured thickness of bone also was detected in the varus knees. These results suggest that the shape of the proximal tibia varies among individuals and that the cutting angle should be determined in each case to avoid any mismatch of the patient's posterior slope of the tibia after implantation.
