We evaluated the imaging quality of 2D-TOF MR venography of the lower part of the leg and the efficacy of a tourniquet around the knee and leg-warming. In 8 healthy volunteers, MR venography was carried out under the following four conditions: (a) usual MR venography, (b) MR venography with tourniquet around the knee, (c) MR venography after leg-warming and (d) MR venography with tourniquet after leg-warming. Our results suggested that MR venography with tourniquet after leg-warming is best suited for imaging the veins of the leg. We also compared the diagnostic image quality of MR venography and conventional contrast venography in 7 patients with varices. The results showed no significant differences between the two methods. We conclude that MR venography with tourniquet after leg-warming is a technique that provides reliable information about the veins of the leg.
