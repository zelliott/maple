This work was undertaken to investigate the feasibility of using a cylindrical phased array for transoesophaeal thermal ablation under magnetic resonance (MR) imaging guidance. Sixty-four transducers (0.45 mm wide by 15 mm tall), operating at 4.6 MHz, were spread around the periphery of a 10.6-mm-diam cylinder. The head of the applicator was covered with a 65-microm thick latex balloon attached using watertight seals. This envelope was inflated with degassed water to provide acoustic coupling between the transducer and the tissues. The underlying operating principle of this applicator is to rotate a plane ultrasound beam electronically. For this purpose, eight adjacent transducers were excited with appropriate delay times so as to generate a plane wave. The exposure direction was changed by exciting a different set of eight elements. Ex vivo experiments conducted on 47 samples of pig liver under MR temperature monitoring demonstrated the ability of this applicator to generate cylindrical or sector-based coagulation necroses at depths up to 19 mm with excellent angular precision by applying 20 W/cm2. MR thermometry was performed in "real-time" with segmented echo-planar imaging gradient echo sequences. The temporal resolution was approximately 3 s/ image. The average value for the temperature baseline in liver tissue close to the applicator was 0.3 degrees C (+/- 0.6 degrees C). The thermal dose delivered in tissues was computed on-line during temperature imaging. Excellent MR compatibility was demonstrated, all MR acquisitions were performed without susceptibility artifacts or radio-frequency interferences with the ultrasound device. Thermal lesions identified on post-treatment follow up showed good correlation with online MR thermometry data. The individual differences between measurements performed visually and using MRI thermal dose maps were about 11% of volume. This study demonstrated the feasibility of thermal ablation using a phased array intraluminal ultrasound applicator and on-line MR monitoring.
