To evaluate the diagnostic value of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and skeletal scintigraphy in the detection of skeletal metastases in patients with solid tumors.

One hundred and twenty-nine tumor patients were examined with whole-body MRI using coronal TIRM sequences for the different anatomical regions. Skeletal scintigraphy was performed with 99mTc-DPD.

In 105/129 (81%) patients, the whole-body MRI and skeletal scintigraphy findings were concordant. In 56/129 (43%) patients, both imaging modalities excluded skeletal metastases. In 49/129 (38%) patients, whole-body MRI and skeletal scintigraphy revealed metastases, however whole-body MRI demonstrated more extensive disease in 22/49 (45%) cases. In 6/49 (12%) cases, skeletal scintigraphy was superior to whole-body MRI in detecting more skeletal metastases. In 24/129 (19%) cases, the imaging findings were discordant. In 15 cases, skeletal scintigraphy was negative, whereas whole-body MRI revealed skeletal metastases. In 9 cases, skeletal scintigraphy was positive, whereas whole-body MRI failed to detect these metastases. In 77/129 (60%) patients, whole-body MRI revealed additional tumor-related findings.

Whole-body MRI, as a new staging method, is superior to skeletal scintigraphy with respect to the detection of skeletal metastases and the extent of metastastic disease. Furthermore, whole-body MRI yields additional tumor-related findings. Therefore, whole-body MRI should be performed as an alternative to skeletal scintigraphy for the assessment of skeletal metastases.
