A functional-anatomical brain scanner that has a temporal resolution of less than a hundred milliseconds is needed to measure the neural substrate of higher cognitive functions in healthy people and neurological and psychiatric patients. Electrophysiological techniques have the requisite temporal resolution but their potential spatial resolution has been not realized. Here we briefly review progress in increasing the spatial detail of scalp-recorded EEGs and in registering this functional information with anatomical models of a person's brain. We describe methods and systems for 124-channel EEGs and magnetic resonance image (MRI) modeling, and present first results of the integration of equivalent-dipole EEG models of somatosensory stimulation with 3-D MRI brain models.
