A middle cerebral artery aneurysm, completely enclosed in a large frontotemporal anaplastic astrocytoma, is demonstrated in a 11-month-old girl admitted for intracranial hypertension. Clipping of the aneurysm along with radical resection was successfully performed. Five years later, follow-up neurological examination is normal, aneurysm occlusion and no evidence of tumor recurrence are demonstrated by angiogram and MRI. The association of brain tumor and aneurysm is discussed, and documented with the only two cases of a neoplasm surrounding on aneurysm reported in the literature.
