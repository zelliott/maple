Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a new method of evaluating velopharyngeal dysfunction. The anatomy of the palate and velopharyngeal closure can be visualized with MRI. Also, fast scanning with turboflash sequences allows surgeons to evaluate the speech mechanism during phonation. The dimensions of the velopharynx are another important factor in velopharyngeal closure, together with the functional performance of the soft palate during phonation. During this study, velopharyngeal anthropometric analyses were performed in cerebral MR images of 136 male and 141 female normal speakers who underwent cerebral MRI for reasons other than speech problems. Age-dependent changes in velopharyngeal dimensions were evaluated. Although the growth of the soft palate was continuous throughout life, hard palate growth ceased by age 15. By using anthropometric data available from MR images taken on normal subjects for other reasons, a large database of age-, gender-, and race-specific data on palatal and pharyngeal morphology was acquired. Comparative data of noncleft subjects in multiple age groups were obtained with MRI.
