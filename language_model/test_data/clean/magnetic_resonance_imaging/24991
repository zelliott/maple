Primary leiomyosarcoma of the pulmonary artery is an extremely rare tumor that is frequently misdiagnosed as chronic pulmonary embolism.

We describe a new case and discuss diagnosis criteria, especially thanks to modern imaging techniques. A sarcomatous disease should be ruled out, if obliteration progress or is stable, on serial RMI or CT scans images, despite effective anti-coagulation treatment.

An early identification and aggressive medical and surgical intervention has the potential for long-term survival.
