This article discusses the imaging of infectious and other inflammatory conditions that affect the spinal cord, spinal column, intradural spinal nerve roots, and spinal meninges with emphasis on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Inflammatory lesions of the spine are often indistinguishable on imaging and even on pathologic examination. However, infectious causes are treatable so it is important for the radiologist to make the diagnosis. The most common inflammatory and infectious conditions affecting the anatomic compartments of the spine are described, following an external to internal anatomic approach. Subsequently, several infectious pathogenic agents are discussed individually as they affect the spinal column and its contents.
