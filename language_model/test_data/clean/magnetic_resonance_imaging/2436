We report an unusual case of ecchordosis physaliphora of the thoracic spine.

The clinical presentation was one of disabling thoracic radicular pain without objective neurological deficit. The imaging characteristics of the lesion were those of a cyst containing aqueous fluid. There was no bone destruction.

Gross total removal of the lesion was accomplished.

We present the only well-documented case of thoracic extradural ecchordosis physaliphora and discuss the relationship between the notochord, ecchordosis physaliphora, and chordoma. We provide a comprehensive list of lesions exhibiting physaliphorous cells.
