Radiological features of 17 cases of neural arch tuberculosis (NAT), treated surgically by the authors, are reviewed and correlated with the operative and histopathological findings. The diagnostic accuracy of different imaging modalities in the evaluation of this rare, atypical form of spinal tuberculosis was found to be very low. Thus, the initial diagnosis was in error in 15 out of 17 of our cases. Recognition of the radiological diagnostic features of NAT is important, not only because they may mimic primary or metastatic spinal neoplasms, but also because of the surgical implications. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features correlated most closely with the surgical findings, whereas plain spinal radiographs and myelograms were found to be non-specific and non-diagnostic.
