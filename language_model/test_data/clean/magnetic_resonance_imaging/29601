We modeled four different end-ring/shield configurations of a birdcage coil to examine their effects on field homogeneity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 64 MHz and 125 MHz. The configurations are defined as: 1) conventional: a conventional cylindrical shield; 2) surrounding shield: a shield with annular extensions to closely shield the end rings; 3) solid connection: a shield with annular extensions connected to the rungs; and 4) thin wire connection: a shield with thin wires connected to the rungs. At both frequencies, the coil with conventional end-ring/shield configuration produces the most homogeneous RF magnetic (B1) field when the coil is empty, but produces the least homogeneous B1 field when the coil is loaded with a human head. The surrounding shield configuration results in the most homogeneous B1 and highest SNR in the coil loaded with the human head at both frequencies, followed closely by the solid connection configuration.
