A 58-year-old man presented with knee pain and swelling, following a previous injury. A displaced bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus was diagnosed on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and subsequently confirmed by arthroscopy. MR imaging is accurate in diagnosing bucket-handle tears. The different MR imaging signs of bucket-handle tears include the double posterior cruciate ligament sign, displaced fragment in intercondylar notch sign, absent bow-tie sign, anterior flipped meniscus sign and coronal truncation sign. Specificity is increased when a combination of the different imaging signs is present. Understanding the meniscal anatomy and potential mimics of the bucket-handle tear is important in order to ensure an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
