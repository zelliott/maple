Using fMRI at a static magnetic field strength of 1.5T, we investigated how comprehension and humor of sentences would correlate to activation of the language areas in listening comprehension of a native language. Sentences with a high comprehension score augmented activation in the left inferior parietal lobule and posterior part of the left superior temporal gyrus, which may be related to semantic processing. Sentences with a high humor score induced activation in Broca's area, which may be associated with syntactic processing and auditory working memory. Furthermore, sentences with a high humor factor and/or a low comprehension score activated the middle frontal gyrus, which may be attributed to auditory working memory.
