Particular problems in MEN 1 syndrome come from the morphological identification of pancreatic tumors because of their are often small [<1 cm] and multiple [89% of the cases]. However intraoperatively it could be difficult to identify with palpation the tumors described by preoperative investigations and to decide the most suitable surgical treatment. The authors describe one case recently observed to underline and update the correct management.

A 34 year old woman was admitted for the surgical treatment of an insulinoma. Polimenorrea, hypercalcemia and familiarity for MEN 1 syndrome were also present. A CT scan showed the tumors in the body and tail of the pancreas [diameter 0.5-1 cm]. MRI described only a small mass in pancreatic head. A calcium angiography was positive for insulin secretion after calcium infusion in hepatic and gastroduodenal artery, and for glucagon secretion after infusion in splenic artery. An intraoperative ultrasonography discovered three nodules that were enucleated. They were one insulinoma and two glucagonomas respectively. After enucleation glycemia became immediately normal.

To avoid wide surgical resections [es. left pancreatectomy] we suggest a conservative treatment [multiple enucletion with or without a pancreatic-jejunum side-to-side anastomosis] with a meticulous preoperative and intraoperative evaluation of all pancreatic nodules.
