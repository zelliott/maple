Isolated direct metastasis of uterine cervical carcinoma to the right ventricular endocardium is very rare. A 68-year-old woman was initially diagnosed as having stage IIIb squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, and was treated with radiation therapy. After 2 years, she developed heart failure and presented with a mass in the right ventricle. The results of further examinations were consistent with a tumor or a thrombus in the right ventricle. She underwent excision of the mass under cardiopulmonary bypass, and histopathologic examination of the resected tissue revealed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. She was discharged 3 weeks after the operation, and underwent chemotherapy. However, she was readmitted with drug-induced interstitial pneumonia and died 5 months after the surgery. Patients with an intracardiac mass and a history of uterine cervical cancer should be suspected of having a myocardial metastasis until it is proven otherwise.
