The aim of this work is to evaluate the relationship between improvement of regional myocardial function and visual analysis of contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI in patients after acute myocardial infarction. MRI was performed on 19 patients 1 and 11 weeks after a reperfused acute myocardial infarction. Perfusion data (first-pass images [FPI] and delayed CE images) were acquired after an intravenous bolus of gadolinium-DTPA and visually analyzed using a 17 segment model. Each segment was then classified in 3 groups, according to the presence or absence of FPI and CE patterns at baseline study: group 0: normal-appearing segments; group 1: segments with delayed hyper-enhancement but no early hypo-enhancement; group 2: segments with early hypoenhancement. Relative Wall thickening (RWT) was analyzed in each segment and its improvement evaluated in each group. Between first MRI and follow-up study, a significant improvement of RWT occurred in group 1 (mean +/- SD) [from 43.43 +/- 26.59% to 76.71 +/- 47.38%; p = 0.001] but not in group 2 (from 32.73 +/- 25.58% to 39.57 +/- 30.57%; p = NS). In group 0, RWT despite normal value at baseline study exhibited a significant improvement at follow-up (from 65.23 +/- 46.52% to 79.73 +/- 48.46%; p = 0.0015). In conclusion, the combined analysis of early and delayed perfusion abnormalities in MRI in the week following myocardial infarction can predict myocardial viability and allows in the future an evaluation of the efficacy of perfusion therapy.
