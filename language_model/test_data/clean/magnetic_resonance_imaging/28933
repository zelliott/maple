Oral cancer accounts for 5% of all tumors in men and 2% in women. We analyzed frequency, sex distribution and cervical lymph node involvement in relation to tumor site. Local extension was diagnosed in 66 patients by MR imaging and the results were compared to CT scan. The results of these studies were correlated with the histopathological study of the specimen in relation to the diagnosis of bone infiltration, tumor size and cervical node infiltration. Bone infiltration was similar in MR images and CT scans. Tumor size was better diagnosed by MR imaging. Detection of cervical lymph node involvement was similar in MR imaging and CT scan.
