The pathogenetic mechanism of hearing loss in patients with vestibular schwannomas (VS) remains unclear. Our aim was to determine the radiological and clinical parameters that might be related to hearing. The radiological images and charts of 99 patients were reviewed. Image processing software was used to analyse the maximal tumor diameter in three planes; its volume; its extension cranially, caudally, anteriorly and posteriorly; the width and length of the intrameatal tumor portion, its shape and consistency; and the tumor-fundus distance. These parameters were correlated with the patient's pre-operative hearing range. The degree of hearing correlated significantly with the tumor size, volume and coronal diameter, the degree of intrameatal tumor growth, and the distance between the lateral tumor end and the fundus (p < 0.05). No correlation was found regarding tumor extension, shape and consistency, the presence of hydrocephalus, or the extent of erosion of the internal auditory canal. Loss of hearing in the VS appears to be multifactorial. Determining the radiological parameters related to the hearing level can help to clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms involved.
