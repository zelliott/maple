The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agents on neurologic outcome and infarction size in a rat stroke model. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in 80 rats using an endovascular occlusion technique of the middle cerebral artery. Four hours after occlusion, 64 animals (4 groups of 16 each) received gadodiamide (Gd-DTPA-BMA) in a single (0.1 mmol/kg) or triple (0.3 mmol/kg) clinical dose or the ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles contrast agent NC 100150 in a single (0.03 mmol/kg, 1.5 mg Fe(2+)/kg) or double (0.06 mmol/kg, 3.0 mg Fe(2+)/kg) clinical dose, respectively. Sixteen animals received equivolumetric saline (control group). Neurologic score and body weight were recorded every 8 hours. Twenty-four hours after vessel occlusion, infarction size was measured by 2,3, 5-triphenyl-tetrazolium-chloride (TTC) staining. Neither the normal nor the triple clinical dose of gadodiamide or NC 100150 in the single or double dose had any statistically significant effects on infarction volume, mortality, body weight, or neurologic outcome (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that bolus injection of gadodiamide and the ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles NC 100150 in clinically relevant doses does not significantly affect infarction volume and clinical outcome of acute cerebral ischemia.
