A 38-year-old man presented with progressive cervical myelopathy due to atlas hypoplasia associated with non-traumatic retro-odontoid mass. The neuroimaging findings suggested hypertrophy of the transverse ligament of the atlas. No histological confirmation of the retro-odontoid mass was obtained. Clinical manifestations improved after posterior decompression. Decompressive laminectomy of the atlas with or without fusion can achieve a good outcome in such cases.
