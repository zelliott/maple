Previous studies have shown that affective symptoms are part of the clinical picture in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common motor neuron disorder in elderly people. Diffuse neurodegeneration of limbic regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex [PFC], amygdala) was demonstrated in ALS post-mortem, although the mechanisms of emotional dysregulation in ALS in vivo remain unclear. Using functional imaging, we assessed the brain responses to emotional faces in 11 cognitively unimpaired ALS patients and 12 healthy controls (HCs). We tested whether regional activities and connectivity patterns in the limbic system differed between ALS patients and HCs and whether the variability in clinical measures modulated the neuroimaging data. Relative to HCs, ALS patients displayed greater activation in a series of PFC areas and altered left amygdala-PFC connectivity. Anxiety modulated the right amygdala-PFC connectivity in HCs but not in ALS patients. Reduced right premotor cortex activity and altered left amygdala-supplementary motor area connectivity were associated with longer disease duration and greater disease severity, respectively. Our findings demonstrate dysfunctions of the limbic system in ALS patients at early stages of the disease, and extend our knowledge about the interplay between emotional brain areas and the regions traditionally implicated in motor control.
