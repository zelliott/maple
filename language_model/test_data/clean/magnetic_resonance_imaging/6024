Hyperlipidemia and particularly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) have been proposed as independent risk factors predisposing to chronic allograft nephropathy.

The primary objective of this prospective randomized study was to evaluate the efficacy of the modified National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step I Diet to prevent posttransplantation hyperlipidemia. The secondary objective was to assess the impact of fluvastatin on the lipid profile of patients unresponsive to dietary measures.

The study population consisted of 143 consecutive patients who underwent transplantation between October 1998 and January 2005. Patients who failed to demonstrate total and LDL-C levels below the optimal values of 200 mg/dL and 130 mg/dL respectively, were recruited for fluvastatin treatment. The remaining patients who achieved and maintained the target lipid levels continued on the same dietary regimen.

Baseline demographic characteristics were not different among the fluvastatin and modified Step I Diet groups. Mean total cholesterol (231.2 vs 187.3 mg/dL; P < .000), LDL-C (134.5 vs 99.2 mg/dL; P < .000), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; 62.9 vs 55.7 mg/dL; P = .012), and triglyceride (170.3 vs 138.7 mg/dL; P = .011) levels following the dietary run-in period were significantly different between the patients assigned to fluvastatin treatment and those left on the diet, respectively. Fluvastatin achieved reductions ranging from 12% to 14% in the concentrations of total cholesterol (231.2 +/- 4.29 mg/dL to 202.7 +/- 3.89 mg/dL; P < .000) and LDL-C (134.5 +/- 3.53 mg/dL to 115.6 +/- 3.18 mg/dL; P < .000) among 91% of patients after 1 year of treatment. A substantial decrease in all lipoprotein concentrations occurred in 53 patients in the modified Step I Diet group with significant reductions in total cholesterol (187.3 +/- 4.98 mg/dL to 172.7 +/- 3.8 mg/dL; P < .000) and LDL-C (99.2 +/- 4.0 mg/dL to 96.2 +/- 3.44 mg/dL; P < .000).

Initiation and education of the Step I Diet should be provided during hospitalization. The 3-month dietary run-in period was deemed sufficient to determine the effect of diet on lipid abnormalities. Reduction of lipoprotein levels by a 40-mg daily fluvastatin dose was sufficient, safe, and tolerable.
