The purpose of this study was to assess whether prone or supine imaging provides superior small-bowel loop distention during MRI small-bowel follow-through examinations and whether either position is better with regard to lesion detection and evaluation.

Forty consecutively enrolled clinically referred patients with known or suspected small-bowel abnormalities prospectively underwent 62 MRI small-bowel follow-through examinations in both the prone and the supine positions. Images were blindly and independently reviewed by two observers. Each small-bowel segment was assessed with a 3-point scoring system, and differences in bowel distention in the prone and supine positions were evaluated with a paired Wilcoxon's test. Differences between rates of lesion detection and characterization (e.g., ulceration, stricturing) were analyzed with a paired Student's t test. Interobserver agreement was estimated with the kappa coefficient.

In both normal and diseased small bowel, the prone position had statistically significantly higher distention scores than did the supine position (p < 0.05) with a high level of interobserver agreement. This finding, however, did not translate into improved lesion detection or characterization (p > 0.05).

Although use of the prone position results in superior small-bowel distention during MRI small-bowel follow-through, both the prone and supine positions are equal in terms of lesion detection and feature visualization.
