Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is a rare systemic vasculitis, almost invariably accompanied by asthma, nasal polyposis, paranasal sinus abnormalities, and increased peripheral blood eosinophil count. Neurological involvement as peripheral neuropathy is a common feature, whereas cerebral involvement is extremely rare. Herein, we report the case of a young man who presented with sudden onset of right-side emiparesis and aphasia, whose head CT scan showed the presence of large haemorrhage in the left striatum nucleus involving part of the temporal lobe. Based on clinical and laboratory findings (asthma, eosinophilia >10%, paranasal sinus abnormalities and mononeuritis multiplex) a diagnosis of CSS was made. Cerebral angiography resulted normal, excluding the presence of vascular malformations or signs of vessel abnormalities. Pharmacotherapy with (intravenous and afterwards oral) corticosteroid and immunosuppressors (cyclophosphamide and then azathioprine) was initiated. The outcome was good with neurological follow-up showing a nearly complete recover. Our case points out that intracerebral haemorrhage can be, despite rare, a presenting feature of CSS. Previously reported patients affected by cerebral haemorrhage and CSS are summarized and briefly reviewed.
