Diastematomyelia is a form of an occult dysraphism, which can present with lower urinary tract dysfunction. We present the findings in 21 patients with diastematomyelia evaluated at the Children's Hospital in Boston. Seventy-six percent of the patients were female. Eighty-six per cent had a cutaneous lesion present overlying the spine. Urodynamic and electrophysiologic studies showed abnormalities in 17 (81%) of 21 patients, of whom 13 (62%) had upper motor neuron dysfunction. Seventeen patients underwent corrective spinal surgery and none of the patients deteriorated on a follow-up urodynamic and electrophysiologic study. We recommend that patients with cutaneous, midline lower back lesions with or without lower urinary tract dysfunction be evaluated with a urodynamic and electrophysiologic study to characterize the extent of neurologic and urologic dysfunction.
