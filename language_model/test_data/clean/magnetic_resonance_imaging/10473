Proton-density-weighted fMRI at low field (0.2 T) was carried out in the cervical spinal cord of healthy volunteers in this study to examine the feasibility of detecting proton density alteration accompanying activation in the spinal cord. Subjects were asked to grip both hands simultaneously, providing sensorimotor simulation for spinal fMRI. Over 70% subjects recruited had activation localized at C6-C7 spinal levels with discrete activation detected in both the anterior and posterior horns of the cervical spinal cord, and the average fractional signal change was 4.06%. The 0.2 T low magnetic field and the 24 ms short TE used in this study diminished the BOLD effect to a negligible level, thus the observed signal change was believed to be mainly attributable to proton density increase during neuronal stimulation. Our results suggested the existence of task-driven proton density change in the cervical spinal cord.
