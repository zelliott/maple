In myopic strabismus fixus, there is acquired esotropia and hypotropia associated with restricted elevation and abduction. One possible etiology is an enlarged globe herniating superotemporally through the muscle cone. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated the inferolateral displacement of the lateral rectus (LR) muscle in this restrictive motility disorder. Surgical treatment is difficult. We report two cases of myopic strabismus fixus that were treated with a loop myopexy of the LR and superior rectus (SR) muscles.
