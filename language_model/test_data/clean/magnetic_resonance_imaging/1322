31Phosphorus-NMR spectroscopy may have the potential to help in the noninvasive diagnosis of malignant hyperpyrexia (MH). Changes in the phosphate-metabolite profile of MH-susceptible (MHS) skeletal muscle occur more readily under conditions of anoxia than in control muscle. Induction of anoxia caused a rapid fall in intracellular phosphocreatine, an elevation of inorganic phosphate, and finally a diminution of ATP in MHS muscle. The onset of metabolic change was slower in control tissue. Increased oxygen consumption may occur in anoxic MHS muscle, which leads to accelerated glycolysis and a rapid fall in the intracellular high-energy phosphates. In MHS muscle an abnormality may exist in carbohydrate metabolism linked with poor resynthesis of the high-energy phosphates, which may be precipitated under anaerobic conditions. Accelerated muscle metabolism is also observed in the presence of 2 mM caffeine and 3% halothane in MHS muscle. Changes in the concentrations of metabolites could be mapped noninvasively under anoxic conditions using topical 31P-NMR.
