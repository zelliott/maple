A 64-year-old woman developed multiple brain abscesses of the basal ganglia associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae septicemia. Magnetic resonance (MR) images showed three different stages of the brain abscesses. The images of early cerebritis of this site mimicked lacunar infarctions or dilated Virchow-Robin spaces. The differentiation of the brain abscess from lacunae and dilated Virchow-Robin spaces is discussed, together with the evolution of the brain abscesses on MR images.
