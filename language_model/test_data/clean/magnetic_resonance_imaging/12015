The authors report a case of hepatic angiosarcoma revealed by massive haemoperitoneum. They analyse the CT and MRI features of this rare tumour and recall the difficult diagnostic problems raised by cavernous angiomas. The new MRI diagnostic criteria must be recognized, but do not constitute formal proof of the diagnosis.
