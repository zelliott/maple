A specific mouse whole body coil and a dedicated gradient system at 4.7 T were coupled with an ultra-fast 3D gradient echo MRI and keyhole reconstruction technique to obtain 3D whole-body dynamic T(1)-weighted or T(2)*-weighted imaging. The technique was used to visualize the real-time distribution of non-targeting T(1) and T(2)* contrast agent (CA) in a glioma-bearing mouse model. T(1) dynamic contrast-enhancement imaging was performed with a fast imaging with steady-state precession sequence [echo time/repetition time (TE/TR), 1.32/3.7 ms] before and after CA injection (Gd-DOTA and BSA-Gd-DOTA) for 21 min. The temporal resolution was 1 image/6.5 s. T(2)* imaging (TE/TR, 4/8 ms) was performed before and after iron-based (small and ultra-small particles of iron oxide) CA injection for 45 min. The temporal resolution was 1 image/14 s. Signal-to-noise ratio curves were determined in various mouse organs. The whole-body coil and gradient systems made it possible to acquire data with sufficient and homogeneous signal-to-noise ratio on the whole animal. The spatial resolution allowed adequate depiction of the major organs, blood vessels and brain glioma. The distribution and the time-course of T(1) and T(2)* contrasts upon contrast agent injection were also assessed. 3D whole-body mouse MRI is feasible at high spatial resolution in movie mode and can be applied successfully to visualize real-time contrast agent distribution. This method should be effective in future preclinical molecular imaging studies.
