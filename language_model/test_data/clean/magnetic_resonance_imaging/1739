We present and illustrate the MRI appearances of two children with choroid plexus carcinoma. The MRI characteristics of these rare tumours are reviewed. Since total surgical resection is a significant prognostic factor, early postoperative MRI was performed in both cases to ensure surgical clearance. In one case a complete resection was documented and this patient remains well at short-term follow-up. Residual tumour was noted in the second case, but despite "second look" surgery there was subsequent local relapse.
