We describe characteristic spinal MR findings of two cases of familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP). Both cases showed leptomeningeal enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image. In addition, three-dimensional constructive interference in steady-state imaging demonstrated thickening of the ligaments, other connective tissues within the spinal canal, dura matter, and dorsal nerve roots. These findings in FAP are felt to represent amyloid deposition.
