A single-turn solenoid, lacking the conventional cylindrical or rectangular symmetry, was constructed for magnetic imaging of the human wrist at 1.5 Tesla. As is characteristic of single-turn solenoids, this wedge-shaped geometry solenoid was found to have a high filling factor and quality factor, as well as produce images with a favorable signal-to-noise ratio. The radio frequency (RF) transmitter power required to produce a 90 degrees pulse in the solenoid was 130 mW. The asymmetric solenoid had a small variation in the intensity of the RF field across its volume, which is characteristic of symmetrical single-turn solenoids. The combination of these four properties of the coil resulted in the production of excellent 1.5-mm thick anatomical images of the wrist.
