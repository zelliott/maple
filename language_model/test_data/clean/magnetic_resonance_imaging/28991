Although T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reported to be useful for depicting rhabdomyolysis lesions, little is known as to the usefulness of gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. The authors performed noncontrast and postcontrast T1-weighted MRI along with T2-weighted MRI in a patient with rhabdomyolysis in the chronic phase. Non-contrast T1-weighted imaging revealed no abnormality, whereas postcontrast T1-weighted imaging demonstrated lesions more definitively than T2-weighted imaging. Gadolinium-enhancement study may contribute to the MRI diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis.
