Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD) is a rare benign lesion of uncertain pathogenesis characterized by distortion of the normal cerebellar laminar cytoarchitecture. We report a 22-year-old man admitted for injury sustained in a traffic accident with the incidental finding of a cerebellar mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass lesion within the right cerebellar hemisphere. The final diagnosis of LDD was made by obtaining a surgical specimen and identifying the characteristic appearance of the lesion by MRI study. The images showed the typical striated pattern of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images and corresponding hypointensity on T1-weighted images, as well as the typical absence of enhancement following gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) administration. In addition, no disturbance of water diffusion on diffusion-weighted MRI, and associations of decreases in the N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) and NAA/Choline (Cho) ratios with near normal values of Cho/Cr, as well as an obvious lactate peak gave supplemental information for diagnosis.
