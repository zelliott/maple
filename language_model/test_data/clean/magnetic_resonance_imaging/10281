Survivors of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair constitute a large and growing population of patients. Although postsurgical outcome is generally favorable, as these patients move into adulthood, late morbidity is becoming more prevalent and the notion that TOF has been "definitively repaired" is increasingly being challenged. Recent evidence suggests that adverse long-term postsurgical outcome is related to chronic pulmonary regurgitation, right ventricular dilatation, and deteriorating ventricular function. Cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been established as an accurate technique for quantifying ventricular size, ejection fraction, and valvular regurgitation. Cardiac MR imaging does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation and is therefore ideal for serial postsurgical follow-up. Familiarity with the anatomic basis of TOF, the surgical approaches to repair, and postrepair sequelae is essential for performing and interpreting cardiac MR imaging examinations. For example, awareness of the complications and sequelae that can occur will assist in determining when to intervene to preserve ventricular function and will improve long-term outcome. Technical facility is necessary to tailor the examination to the individual patient (eg, familiarity with non-breath-hold modifications that allow evaluation of young and less compliant patients). The radiologist can play an essential role in the treatment of patients with repaired TOF by providing noninvasive anatomic and physiologic cardiac MR imaging data. Further technologic advances in cardiac MR imaging are likely to bring about new applications, better normative data, and more examinations that are operator independent.
