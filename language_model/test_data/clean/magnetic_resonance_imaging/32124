Brain volumetry is widely used for evaluating tissue degeneration; however, the parcellation methods are rarely validated and use arbitrary planes to mark boundaries of brain regions. The goal of this study was to develop, validate, and apply an MR imaging tracing method for the parcellation of 3 major gyri of the frontal lobe, which uses only local landmarks intrinsic to the structures of interest, without the need for global reorientation or the use of dividing planes or lines.

Studies were performed on 25 subjects--healthy controls and subjects diagnosed with Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer disease--with significant variation in the underlying gyral anatomy and state of atrophy. The protocol was evaluated by using multiple observers tracing scans of subjects diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease and those aging normally, and the results were compared by spatial overlap agreement. To confirm the results, observers marked the same locations in different brains. We illustrated the variabilities of the key boundaries that pose the greatest challenge to defining consistent parcellations across subjects.

The resulting gyral volumes were evaluated, and their consistency across raters was used as an additional assessment of the validity of our marking method. The agreement on a scale of 0-1 was found to be 0.83 spatial and 0.90 volumetric for the same rater and 0.85 spatial and 0.90 volumetric for 2 different raters. The results revealed that the protocol remained consistent across different neurodegenerative conditions.

Our method provides a simple and reliable way for the volumetric evaluation of frontal lobe neurodegeneration and can be used as a resource for larger comparative studies as well as a validation procedure of automated algorithms.
