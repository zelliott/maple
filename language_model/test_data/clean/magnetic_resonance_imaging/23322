Osteochondromas are the most common benign bone tumor, most commonly found in the ends of long bones; however, they rarely involve facial bones, particularly the mandible. Osteochondromas involving the coronoid process have rarely been reported in the literature but pose a diagnostic dilemma. When large enough, osteochondromas of the mandibular coronoid process can form a joint with the zygomatic arch (Jacob's disease). This pseudoarticulation results in restricted jaw motion, which can clinically be mistaken for temporomandibular joint dysfunction. We report a case of a 39-year-old man with chronic restricted jaw motion undiagnosed for several years.
