Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia is the most common form of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT). Phenotypically, RVOT tachycardia segregates into two predominant forms, one characterized by repetitive monomorphic nonsustained VT and the other by paroxysmal exercise induced sustained VT. There is an increasing body of evidence to support the concept that both forms of tachycardia reflect disparate clinical manifestations of an identical cellular mechanism (i.e., cAMP-mediated triggered activity), which is identified clinically by the tachycardia's sensitivity to adenosine. The clinical characteristics, natural history, and approaches to therapy of RVOT tachycardia are delineated herein.
