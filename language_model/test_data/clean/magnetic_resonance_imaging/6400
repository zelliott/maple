A computer-assisted stereotactic biopsy technique has been used in 30 patient (ages 5 months to 16 years) with intracranial lesions (supratentorial in 23 and infratentorial in 7). The computer program integrates stereotactically gathered imaging data and permits preoperative planning of a biopsy trajectory. Diagnostic tissue was obtained in 27 cases. In 2 cases, therapeutic interventions--third ventriculostomy and cyst aspiration--were accomplished at the time of the biopsy. There were no major complications related to the procedure; however, 2 patients had transient neurologic deficits. Computer-assisted stereotactic biopsy is a valuable diagnostic procedure in the pediatric patient with an intracranial lesion.
