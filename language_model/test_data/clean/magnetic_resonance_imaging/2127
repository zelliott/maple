Case report.

To describe a patient with a large tumor lesion of the 6th vertebrae affecting surrounding soft tissue, and symptoms of cord compression. Histologic diagnosis indicated a destructive osteoblastoma following dorsal and anterior resection and internal fixation.

University Hospital, Germany.

A 23-year old male patient was admitted with a 2-month history of increasing upper extremity weakness and pain. X-ray and MRI indicated massive involvement of the anterior and posterior elements of the 6th vertebrae with a large soft tissue mass. Following emergency decompression and dorsal stabilization, the pathologic investigation revealed a destructive osteoblastoma. Subsequent dorsal and anterior resection with internal fixation were performed.

The patient initially presented with symptoms of beginning paraplegia of C6/7. According to the neurologic classification of spinal cord injury, motor function score was 56 and sensory function score 83. After emergency dorsal decompression and internal fixation with Luque-Instrumentation he showed increasing neurological recovery. Complete neurological recovery was achieved at 2 and 12-months postoperatively, following secondary dorsal and anterior resection of the tumor and internal fixation with bone cement (PalacosR) and Harms-cage. Radiologic signs of local recurrence were identified 1 year postoperatively.

Osteoblastoma of the cervical spine is rare. Patients often present with severe neurological symptoms due to significant tumor mass. Complete resection is necessary to regain full recovery, to prevent recurrence and, in some cases, malignant transformation.
