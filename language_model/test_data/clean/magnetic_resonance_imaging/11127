Central neurocytoma is a tumour that typically occurs in young adults in close association with the lateral and third ventricles of the cerebrum.

We report the unusual case of a central neurocytoma that developed in the fourth ventricle of a 59-year-old woman and metastasized to the upper cervical canal. Subtotal excision and adjuvant radiotherapy were used to treat the lesion. Microscopic evaluation, discussion of the pathologic differential diagnosis and theories of the histogenesis of the tumour are presented.

Fourth ventricular neurocytoma is rare and has only been reported twice previously. It appears most likely that this tumour arises from subependymal progenitor cell lines.
