The triad of Currarino, also known as Currarino syndrome or complex, is a rare hereditary syndrome involving a bony sacral defect, an anorectal malformation and a presacral mass. Thus far, only 250 cases have been reported, but milder cases may not be recognized, and many cases may not be published. In addition to disorders of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, sensory and motor deficits may be present. Currently, there are no reports of women with the triad of Currarino undergoing cesarean delivery with the use of neuraxial anesthesia. Neuraxial anesthesia in patients with congenital malformations of the spine may be complicated or contraindicated, depending on the level and severity of the anatomic abnormality. We present the case of a pregnant woman at 36 weeks of gestation who underwent uncomplicated neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery. When neuraxial anesthesia is contemplated in such patients, they should first receive careful neurologic and radiologic evaluation.
