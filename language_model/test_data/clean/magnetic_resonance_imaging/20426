We report the first use of a stented pulmonic valve within the right atrial to right ventricular conduit of a patient who underwent a Björk modification Fontan for tricuspid atresia. In effect, a functional tricuspid valve was created. This case report demonstrates the feasibility of transcatheter valve replacement in positions other than the pulmonic or aortic valve and that future revision of conduits in the Björk modification Fontan can be performed percutaneously.
