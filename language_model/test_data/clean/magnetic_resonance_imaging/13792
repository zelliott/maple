Osteoarticular tuberculosis rarely occurs in developed countries. Initial symptoms are often overlooked and the diagnosis is frequently delayed for several months. Thus, despite available diagnostic tools and accessible treatment, destruction of affected joints remains a complication of non-vertebral osteoarticular tuberculosis even in industrialized countries. We report a patient from Cleveland, Ohio, USA, in whom the delayed diagnosis of tuberculous osteoarthritis led to severe destruction of the left knee and finally, after superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus, to an above-the-knee amputation. The epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis and treatment of nonvertebral tuberculous osteoarthritis are discussed.
