Extraventricular neurocytoma (EVN) is a rare tumor that mainly occurs in the cerebral hemispheres and spinal cord. Sellar neurocytoma is extremely rare, with only two previously reported cases. We report a sellar EVN in a 48-year-old man presenting with visual impairment. This tumor was partially resected. The residual tumor disappeared on MRI with adjuvant radiotherapy. However, 2 years later the tumor recurred with craniospinal dissemination, which is also very rare, with only four previously reported cases. The recurrent tumor showed atypical features with an MIB-1 LI score of 3 %. It is suggested that postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy with long-term follow-up is required for incompletely resected EVN.
