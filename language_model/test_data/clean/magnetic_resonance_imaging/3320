Gout is a painful inflammatory arthropathy caused by crystallization of monosodium urate within the joints. We present the case of a patient with primary gout who had positive results of joint aspiration and synovial biopsy for monosodium urate crystals in the third metacarpophalangeal joint but false-negative results of dual-energy computed tomography.
