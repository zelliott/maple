Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare malignancy arising from the olfactory epithelium. We present a case history of a 75-year-old man who presented with a Kadish stage C esthesioneuroblastoma and underwent craniofacial surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Two years later he was found to have diffuse subdural deposits with distant bone and nodal metastases, treated with further radiotherapy. The patient's condition subsequently deteriorated and he died. Given this unusual pattern of failure, we review the recent published studies regarding the natural history, treatment and outcome for this tumour.
