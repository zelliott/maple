Two cases of spinal epidural lipomatosis (SEL) were reported. Patient 1 was on oral corticosteroid and patient 2 was obese and had prostate cancer. Patient 1 was a 45-year-old man diagnosed as sarcoid myelopathy at C 5/6 vertebral body levels and had been placed on oral corticosteroid therapy for 14 months. He showed spastic paraplegia, hypesthesia below C 4 level with distal dominancy and dysesthesia below Th 6 level. MRI revealed epidural lipomatosis from Th 3 to Th 9 vertebral bodies, which presented high in T 1 weighted image (WI) and T 2 WI, and non-signal in STIR image. On axial image spinal cord was compressed by this mass. Patient 2 was a 73-year-old man with spastic paraplegia, and superficial and deep sensory disturbances below Th 6. He had been obese (BMI 26.1) upon admission. He was diagnosed as prostate cancer with bone metastasis. On MRI of the thoracic spine revealed epidural mass of high in T 1 WI and T 2 WI, and non-signal in STIR image. SEL is a rare condition known as hyperplasia of normal fat tissue in epidural space which sometimes compresses the spinal cord or spinal nerve roots resulting in neurologic deficit. SEL should be kept in mind as having possible neurologic complications in obese patients or ones on long term steroid therapy.
