To clarify CT and MR features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in children and young adults.

CT and MR findings of 13 patients (30 years old or younger) with a histopathologic diagnosis of NPC were reviewed.

Skull base invasion (12/13), lymphadenopathy (10/13), and infiltrative growth (8/8) were common findings. The signal intensity of tumours was slightly higher than that of muscles in six cases and isointense to that of muscles in two cases on T1-weighted images; it was higher than that of muscle and lower than that of cerebellar grey matter on T2-weighted images in all cases. Internal signals were homogeneous in both pre- and post-Gd-enhanced MR images in all cases.

Despite its rarity in this age group, NPC should be included in a differential diagnosis when CT and MR imaging reveal these features.
