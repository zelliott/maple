Rupture of a congenital aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva is a rare congenital cardiac malformation. This case report describes a congenital aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva which ruptured into the right ventricle in a 3-year-old girl. The exact route of the fistula through the cardiac walls and the localization of the rupture into the right ventricle was not completely defined by two-dimensional and color Doppler echocardiography and could be determined only by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
