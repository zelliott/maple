The patient was a 52-year-old woman maintained on peritoneal dialysis for 9 years and on hemodialysis for 7 years. This patient complained of palpitations and hypertensive attack during the hemodialysis. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the presence of right adrenal tumor(1.5 x 1.5 cm) and bilateral multiple renal cysts. Right adrenal pheochromocytoma was confirmed by elevated serum level of catecholamines and diagnosed by 131I-MIBG scintigram. This patient underwent right adrenalectomy and nephrectomy in consideration of future generation of cancer in the acquired cystic kidney. Histological examination confirmed malignant pheochromocytoma and small multiple renal cell carcinomas. The patient was alive without any recurrence 6 months postoperatively. To our knowledge, this is the fifth case of adrenal pheochromocytoma and renal cell carcinoma associated ACDK in a hemodialysis patient in the Japanese literature.
