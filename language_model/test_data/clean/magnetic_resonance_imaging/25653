Wandering spleen is a rare clinical entity and remains an elusive clinical diagnosis, particularly in the pediatric patient. Among the imaging modalities (computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine, ultrasonography, plain films) used in the diagnosis of wandering spleen, ultrasonography is the least invasive and most effective. Elective splenopexy remains the treatment of choice when the diagnosis is made before splenic infarction. We present two cases of wandering spleen manifested as a lower abdominal mass, and we discuss the surgical anatomy of the spleen and splenic ligaments and the hypothetical responsibility of these ligaments for the genesis of this clinical entity.
