To compare the results of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary gland in dogs with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) caused by histologically confirmed pituitary adenoma.

Retrospective case series.

11 dogs with PDH that underwent transsphenoidal hypophysectomy.

Medical records of dogs examined between January 2001 and March 2003 were reviewed. Dogs were included in this study if they had clinical signs of hypercortisolism at the time of admission (for which PDH was diagnosed) and underwent transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. Pre- and postcontrast CT and low-field MRI (0.2-Tesla magnet) were performed on the same day as surgery for each dog.

An abnormal pituitary gland was found in 7 dogs by use of MRI and in the same 7 dogs by use of CT. Significant differences were found between postcontrast CT and MR images for height, width, and length of the pituitary gland; brain area; and thickness of the sphenoid bone. However, the pituitary gland height-to-brain area ratio determined from postcontrast CT and MR images was not significantly different. The signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of pre- and postcontrast MR images were significantly higher than those of the CT images.

Low-field MRI and dynamic CT imaging of the pituitary gland provided comparable information on the presence of pituitary adenomas in dogs with PDH.
