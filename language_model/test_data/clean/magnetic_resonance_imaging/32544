We report the case of a 58-year-old woman in whom relapsing painful ophthalmoplegia related to a mycetoma of the sphenoid sinus gave origin to meningitis with markedly depressed glucose levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Surgical exeresis of the mycetoma allowed aetiological diagnosis (aspergillosis) and--together with antimycotic therapy--led to durable clinical response.
