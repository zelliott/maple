Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the newest evaluation procedure to be applied to the identification and study of osteomyelitis. MRI offers the sensitivity of scintigraphy but with far greater resolution. The differentiation of cellulitis from osteomyelitis can be made with greater accuracy than with scintigrams and MRI allows the identification of abscesses, sinus tracts, sequestra, and soft tissue abscesses with the reliability of computed tomography. Areas adjacent to metallic fixation devices show some signal loss but the distortion is less than with computed tomography. There is no risk to the patient caused by imaging with the fixation devices in place. The major problem in MRI use today is its relatively high cost, although it is less expensive than the combination of nuclear medicine studies often employed for the study of osteomyelitis.
