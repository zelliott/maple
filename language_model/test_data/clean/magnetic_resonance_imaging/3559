Peyronie's disease is relatively frequent and can cause pain and penile induration. Penile soft tissue tumors, however, are exceptional, with fewer than 45 cases reported since 1930. Some clinical and imagery elements could lead to earlier diagnosis through biopsy, enabling more extensive resections and, ultimately, better prognosis.
