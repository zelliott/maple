A 44 year-old man who underwent radiotherapy for Hodgkin disease in 1987 developed in 1996 pain and calf hypertrophy. Nerve conduction studies were normal and needle electromyography revealed a neurogenic pattern in the L-5 and S-1 roots, predominantly on the left side. An abdominal tomodensitometry revealed a splenic and left renal atrophy. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated protein level (1.35 g/l) and no malignant cell. Spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging revealed no abnormality of the roots and the cauda equina. Muscular hypertrophy, as the consequence of post-irradiation lumbar radiculopathy is rarely reported. We discuss the possible mechanism of neurogenic muscular hypertrophy.
