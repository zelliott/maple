Evaluation of cardiac tumors with cardiovascular imaging aims to establish aetiology, identify complications of tumor and help define management strategy. 2D echocardiography remains the primary diagnostic modality. Additional use of newer echocardiographic techniques such as 3D, strain and contrast echocardiography better characterise tumor morphology, tissue characteristics and vascularity respectively. Cardiac MRI and computed tomography provide complementary information and are able to identify extra-cardiac infiltration and also provide further tissue characterisation. This review explores the non-invasive diagnostic approach to evaluation of cardiac tumors.
