Acquiring three dimensional image volumes with techniques such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) relies on reconstructing the tissue layers based on reflection of light from tissue interfaces. One B-mode scan in an image is acquired by scanning and concatenating several A-mode scans, and several contiguous slices are acquired to assemble a full 3D image volume. In this work, we demonstrate how Compressive Sampling (CS) can be used to accurately reconstruct 3D OCT images with minimal quality degradation from a subset of the original image. The full 3D image is reconstructed from sparsely sampled data by exploiting the sparsity of the image in a carefully chosen transform domain. We use several sub-sampling schemes, recover the full 3D image using CS, and show that there is negligible effect on clinically relevant morphometric measurements of the optic nerve head in the recovered image. The potential outcome of this work is a significant reduction in OCT image acquisition time, with possible extensions to speeding up acquisition in other imaging modalities such as ultrasound and MRI.
