Surgical treatment of giant pituitary adenomas is one of the most complicated problems of modern neurosurgery. Before introduction of dopamine agonists surgery was the dominating therapy. Advances in modern pharmacology allowed to approach the alternative way of management of giant prolactinomas (GP). The paper focuses on comparative analysis of results of surgical and conservative treatment of 57 patients with GP. 34 of them were operated and 23 received cabergolin as primary therapy. Assessment of neurological status, visual functions, hypopituitary disorders and prolactin level was performed. Dynamics of evaluated symptoms resulting from tumor shrinking showed that primary conservative treatment of GP is more preferable than surgical.
