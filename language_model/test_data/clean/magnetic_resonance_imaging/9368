Noninvasive evaluation of hepatic tumor response is necessary to improve the survival rate and quality of life of cancer patients. Among radiologic imaging modalities, MRI plays a significant role in the management of patients with hepatic tumor and is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning and assessment of response or recurrence, because of its high contrast resolution, lack of ionizing radiation and the possibility of performing functional imaging sequences. This review provides an overview of the MRI findings after various treatments in patients with primary and secondary focal liver malignancies. The imaging methods described focus on the recent trends of using MRI techniques as biomarkers for disease. We also describe the appearance of successful and incomplete response for the various forms of treatment, including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, ablative therapy, systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is regarded as an established noninvasive method and potential biomarker for tumor detection, as well as for the characterization of the tumor response. Diffusion-weighted MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI and MRS are also promising functional biomarkers to help select patients for various therapies and to assess the response to treatments. However, further validation and standardization should be performed before their widespread use as imaging biomarkers.
