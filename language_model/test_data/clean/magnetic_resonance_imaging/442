Cranial magnetic resonance imaging was performed in three cases of acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy with three diverse etiologies: infantile citrullinemia, acute hepatic encephalopathy, and proximal urea cycle disorder. All three patients exhibited diffuse extensive cortical signal changes and swelling. Neurologic outcome was poor in all three cases. Knowledge of the magnetic resonance imaging findings of hyperammonemic encephalopathy may help in early diagnosis and treatment and could influence the neurologic outcome.
