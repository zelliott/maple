Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) or neurofibrosarcoma, previously described as malignant Schwannoma or neurosarcoma, is an extremely rare cause of malignancy localized in the neck. Half of reported cases occurred in patients with neurofibromatosis in Von Recklinghausen disease type I. Typical features include high grade malignancy and a tendency to recurrence and distant metastases. We report the case of a 56-year-old woman with neurosarcoma of the neck, which was revealed by a cervicobrachial neuralgia. The physical examination found a mass on the left side of the neck. Plain radiographs showed osteoarthritis. MRI showed a well-defined paravertebral mass. Pathologic diagnosis was neurosarcoma. Radiotherapy was delivered.
