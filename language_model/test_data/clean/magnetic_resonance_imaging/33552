A 3-4% change in signal intensity correlated with visual stimulation was observed in the occipital lobes of three normal volunteers examined with MRI at 0.15 T using fluid attenuated inversion recovery pulse sequences. Similar results were observed at 1.0 T. A double difference technique in which difference images are themselves opposed provided an increase in sensitivity.
