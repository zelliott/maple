The diagnosis of median facial dysplasia is made in cases of a typical deficiency of the median facial structures without concomitant abnormalities of the brain, and presence of unilateral or bilateral cleft lip and palate. The identification and description of this type of cleft lip and palate are important because such patients have severe growth disturbances and tissue deficiencies. These make surgical reconstruction and orthodontic treatment difficult. This is demonstrated in two examples. The clinical and roentgenological findings in the mother of one of the demonstrated patients point to a discrete form of the same anomaly.
