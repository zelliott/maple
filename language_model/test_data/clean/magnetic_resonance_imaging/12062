In an HIV-seropositive patient presenting generalized tonic-clonic seizures, magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid examination disclosed the signs of a previous subarachnoid bleed. No vascular malformation was observed with cerebral angiography. Laboratory tests revealed an autoimmune thrombocytopenia. A spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage induced by thrombocytopenia should be considered when investigating HIV patients presenting even non-specific neurological symptoms.
