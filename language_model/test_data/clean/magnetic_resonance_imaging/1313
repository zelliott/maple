47 patients with histologic/cytologic confirmed bronchogenic carcinoma were examined with CT and MRI. Negative and contrast enhanced CT examinations were performed, MR images were obtained with ECG gated T1- and T2-weighted SE sequences in axial and coronal planes. Both methods were evaluated with respect to tumor imaging and delineating of tumor extensions. CT and MRI were generally in agreement for primary tumor and lymph node staging. 7 out of 10 patients with malignant pericardial involvement and 3 out of 27 patients with mediastinal subcarinal lymph node metastases were identified only in MR images. MRI was superior to CT in demonstration of aortic involvement, poststenotic syndrome and extension of chest wall invasion. Additionally MRI gave functional informations about blood flow in case of superior vena cava obstruction.
