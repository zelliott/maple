A case of histiocytoma in a 63-year-old woman with general fatigue is described. Ultrasonography and radiological examination revealed a large mass at the retroperitoneum displacing the right kidney to medial anterior abdomen. Exploration of the tumor with right kidney was done via a transperitoneal approach because the tumor had invaded the hilar fat tissue of the right kidney. The total resected weight was 3,200 g. Histological study showed malignant fibrous histiocytoma, storiform-pleomorphic type. Post-operative chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, dimethyl triazeno-imidazole carboxamide (CYVADIC) was performed and the patient is doing well without any evidence of recurrence or metastasis.
