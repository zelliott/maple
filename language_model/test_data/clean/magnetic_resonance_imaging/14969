Cross-sectional imaging modalities play a pivotal role in the diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of patients with endometrial and cervical carcinomas. Ultrasonography, including sonohysterography, permits evaluation of endometrial abnormalities and characterization of adnexal masses. Computed tomography, particularly in conjunction with (18)(F)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, is increasingly used to stage the cancers and to detect disease recurrence. Magnetic resonance imaging plays a major role in accurate locoregional staging of these cancers, and significantly influences treatment decisions and outcomes. This article discusses the role of imaging modalities in the diagnosis, management, and surveillance of these cancers.
