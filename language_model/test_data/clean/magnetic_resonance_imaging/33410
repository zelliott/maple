A case of band heterotopia was reported with findings of positron emission tomography (PET). The patient was an 8-year-old girl who had mild mental retardation and intractable partial epilepsy. Her MRI showed another diffuse layer of gray matter underlying the normal-looking cortex and separated from it by an apparently normal layer of white matter. PET scan with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose revealed that band heterotopia had the same degree of glucose metabolism as that of the overlying cortex.
