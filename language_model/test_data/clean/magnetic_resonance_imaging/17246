Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities in cellular migration, proliferation, and differentiation in many tissues. Benign hamartomas develop in multiple organs, believed to be caused by somatic mutation in addition to germ line mutation to cause loss of both alleles of either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene, with resultant dysregulated growth due to loss of hamartin or tuberin function, respectively. This study focuses on detecting spontaneous lesions in a knockout mouse model of TSC2 by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and exploring the efficiency of introducing gene products into lesions, using transduced endothelial cells as gene vehicles. MRI was shown to be effective in detecting spontaneous lesions in multiple tissues as a means of assessing the prevalence of tumors. Tsc(2+/) heterozygous mice were screened at 12-24 months of age. MRI detected 100% of the renal lesions (cystadenomas, renal cell carcinomas) and 75% of the hepatic lesions (hemangiosarcomas), later identified by histology. Cell-mediated gene delivery was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of renal, hepatic, and lung lesions after intravenous delivery of MS1 mouse endothelial cells, transduced to express an enhanced form of green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Preliminary immunohistochemical analysis, using a polyclonal antibody to EGFP and a horseradish peroxidase-diaminobenzidine detection system, revealed these cells throughout liver, kidney, and lung sections from injected animals, organs that are frequently affected in TSC2 patients, as well as within the lesions themselves.
