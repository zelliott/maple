We reviewed the medical records including pathologic descriptions, CT images, MR images, and digital subtraction angiograms of three patients with hepatic lesions that were associated with abnormal development of the portal vein-patent ductus venosus or congenital absence of the portal vein-to clarify the imaging characteristics of these abnormalities.

Two-phase helical CT and MRI, including MR angiography and dynamic studies, are useful for the diagnosis of patent ductus venosus and congenital absence of the portal vein. MRI may more effectively reveal hepatic lesions than two-phase helical CT under such abnormal conditions in which the liver has only the arterial but not the portal blood supply.
