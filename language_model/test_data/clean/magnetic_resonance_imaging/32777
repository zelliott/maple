Mucinous eccrine carcinoma (MEC) is a rare skin cancer of sweat gland origin with a high rate of recurrence. The most common sites are head and neck, with 40% of cancers found on the eyelid. The clinical appearance and differential diagnosis of MEC are highly varied, but histologically it is similar to metastatic carcinomas, specifically breast and colon. A diagnosis of primary MEC always warrants a full systemic workup to ensure that no other malignancy is present. This cancer is known for frequent recurrences, but rarely metastasizes to distant organs. MEC is resistant to both chemotherapy and radiation; surgical excision remains the treatment of choice in most cases. The authors report a unique case of extension of MEC to the lacrimal gland with a brief review of histologic characteristics of this tumor.
