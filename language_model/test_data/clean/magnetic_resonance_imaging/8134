This paper reports on two cases of medial meniscus injury involving detachment of the anterior horn together with a coronary ligament tear. Both cases were associated with tearing of the anterior cruciate ligament. The meniscal injuries observed were similar to those reported in the literature prior to the development of arthroscopic surgery. Variant attachments of the anterior horn of the medial meniscus are thought to have contributed to this injury.
