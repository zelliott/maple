The purpose of this article is to review reliability and validity of imaging diagnosis of temporomandibular joint disorders. Plain-film and tomography are basic imaging techniques for assessment of the temporomandibular joint. These can be used for evaluation of osseous disease and as a baseline for follow-up. In patients with symptoms from the joint, plain-film and tomography are rarely definitive, and evaluation of the soft tissues is frequently necessary. Arthrography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have all been used for evaluation of the soft-tissue components of the joints. Accuracy studies of these techniques have demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for magnetic resonance imaging. Arthrography is relatively insensitive for detection of medial and lateral displacements. Magnetic resonance imaging accurately depicts both hard and soft tissues, and this technique is emerging as the prime diagnostic imaging technique in patients presenting with clinical signs and symptoms of a disorder of the temporomandibular joint. The most frequent findings when patients with clinical symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorders are "imaged" are different forms of disc displacement and degenerative joint disease. Studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of different forms of disc displacement in patients, although these abnormalities are also seen in some asymptomatic volunteers. Future research should further refine imaging techniques to come closer to an understanding of the association between morphologic alterations and patient symptoms.
