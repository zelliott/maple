Primary central nervous system lymphoma is a very rare condition in pediatric patients.

We describe the case of a 10-year old girl who presented with acute bilateral vision impairment. At the time of presentation, the only positive finding was optic disk swelling, and the brain MRI scan was normal. Seventeen months later, she developed a large-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the brain, with no evidence of neoplasia elsewhere. Immunodeficiencies and Epstein-Barr virus infection could not be demonstrated. The patient was successfully treated with a combination of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, vincristine, methotrexate, and cytarabine, plus intrathecal chemotherapy. Craniospinal irradiation was not used.

The patient's condition is still in remission 68 months after completing the treatment.

This case is the only non-Hodgkin lymphoma with primary central nervous system location treated in our institution in the last 10 years and represents less than 0.5% of our non-Hodgkin lymphoma series. Due to its rare occurrence, not much is known about the clinical features and treatment outcome of primary central nervous system lymphoma in pediatric patients.
