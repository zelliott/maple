Dunnigan-Kobberling syndrome is a form of partial lipodystrophy characterized by sparing of the face. Despite descriptions of six families since 1974, details of total body adipose tissue distribution and studies of carbohydrate and fat metabolism are lacking. The mode of inheritance also remains unclear, with most authors favouring an X-linked dominant transmission lethal in the hemizygous male. We examined 23 members of a family, of whom at least eight had partial lipodystrophy. Auxological evaluation and cross-sectional imaging showed absence of subcutaneous fat, presence of adipose tissue inside the body cavities, and skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Biochemical evaluation identified insulin resistance but revealed inadequate suppression of non-esterified fatty acids. In this family, male-to-male transmission supports an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance for Dunnigan-Kobberling syndrome.
