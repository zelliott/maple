The authors describe the case of a 51-year-old male who presented with an acute left petrous carotid dissection with neuroimaging evidence of decreased perfusion. Revascularization was accomplished with the placement of an intracranial stent (Neuroform III, Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, Massachusetts). The patient had a good clinical and radiographic outcome.
