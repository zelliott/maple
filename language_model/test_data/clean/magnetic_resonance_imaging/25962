The acceleration-induced displacement artifact impairs the accuracy of MR velocity measurements. This study proposes a post processing method for correction of this artifact. Velocity measurements were performed in a flow phantom containing a constriction. Velocity curves were obtained from streamlines parallel to the frequency, phase, and slice directions, respectively. The acceleration-induced displacement artifact was most prominent when the frequency encoding direction was aligned with the flow direction. After correction, velocity assignment improved and a more accurate description of the flow was obtained. In vivo measurements were performed in the aorta in a patient with a repaired aortic coarctation. The correction method was applied to velocity data along a streamline parallel to the frequency encoding direction. The result after correction was a new location of the peak velocity and improved estimates of the velocity gradients.
