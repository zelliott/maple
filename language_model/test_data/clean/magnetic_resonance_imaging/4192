Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful technique for measuring brain activity associated with the performance of different mental tasks. We briefly describe this technique and the images it produces and review methods of analysis that have been applied to fMRI data. Throughout the paper, we illustrate various points on an fMRI dataset.
