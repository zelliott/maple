MR imaging is the most accurate modality for the diagnosis of AVN, bone marrow edema syndrome, and femoral head insufficiency fractures. When the particular demographics of the patient are considered, the specificity of this examination is high. The reported success rates of joint-sparing operative intervention are variable. When compared with conservative management, the outcome of joint-sparing operative intervention in patients who have early (stage I, II) AVN lesions is improved. This is impetus for screening programs for patients who are known to be at high risk for AVN, such as patients who have undergone renal transplants and others who are on long-term, high-dose corticosteroid treatment. There is strong evidence that bone marrow edema syndrome (TO) is a distinct entity with demonstrable unique histopathology and well-defined demographics. Increased spatial resolution revealed typical subchondral findings of AVN in lesions that were once believed to represent irreversible TO. SIF of the femoral head is a new concept with a seemingly distinct population and with clinical presentation and imaging characteristics that should permit its differentiation from AVN.
