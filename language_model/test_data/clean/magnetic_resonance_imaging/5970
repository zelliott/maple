To investigate the CT and MR imaging features of pleomorphic adenoma in the head and neck area.

Our materials of this study consisted of 50 pleomorphic adenomas from 50 patients which were all histopathologically diagnosed. The CT and MR images were retrospectively evaluated. The following features were evaluated: the detectability of the lesion, the tumor margin, the border of the lesion, the aspect of the lesion, the contrast between the lesion and surrounding tissue, the signal intensity of the lesion, the enhancement of contrast medium, the aspect of the lesion after the injection of contrast medium, the detectability of the capsule, and the detectability of bone resorption of the lesion.

The tumor detectabilities were 77% on axial plain CT images and 90% on axial CE CT images, respectively. On CT images, pleomorphic adenoma tended to show a well-defined margin, a smooth border, an inhomogeneous aspect, a low or high contrast, and intermediate or high signal intensity. After contrast medium administration, pleomorphic adenoma tended to show a slightly high enhancement and either an inhomogeneous or a periphery enhancement on the CE CT images. The capsule could be hardly detected on CT images. The tumor detectabilities were 86% on axial T1-weighted MR images, 88% on axial T2-weighted MR images, and 85% on axial CE T1-weighted MR images, respectively. On MR images, pleomorphic adenomas tended to show well-defined margin, a lobulate border, an inhomogeneous aspect, a high contrast, and intermediate or high signal intensity. After contrast medium administration, pleomorphic adenoma tended to show a high enhancement and either an inhomogeneous or a periphery enhancement on MR images. The capsule could be detected in many cases on MR images.

It was possible to detect the capsule in pleomorphic adenoma using MR images. The pleomorphic adenomas in head and neck area should be evaluated with MR images.
