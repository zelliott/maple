We describe a case of spinal cord compression secondary to extramedullary haematopoiesis in a patient with primary myelofibrosis. We show that MRI should be the procedure of choice for patients suspected of this condition. Furthermore, it could be of value for assessing the extent of cord compression, planning radiotherapy and for follow-up.
