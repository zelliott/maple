A prospective study was undertaken to compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with computed tomography (CT) and examination under anesthesia (EUA) in staging cervical carcinoma, with special emphasis on parametrial status. Twenty patients with carcinoma of the cervix, in whom the extent of the disease was surgically confirmed, were analyzed by MRI, CT and EUA. The tumor size estimated by MRI correlated well (r = 0.79, p < 0.001) with those obtained by histopathologic measurement of the surgical specimen. Neither clinical examination nor CT could precisely estimate tumor size. The overall accuracy rate of MRI in staging carcinoma of the cervix was 75%, compared with 32% for CT staging and 55% for clinical staging. The accuracy rate of these modalities for parametrial status was 90% for MRI, 55% for CT and 82.5% for EUA. MRI accurately excluded all 20 patients with pelvic side wall, bladder and rectal involvement. In conclusion, MRI is superior to CT and EUA in assessment of the parametrium (90% vs 55% vs 82.5%, p < 0.005). From MRI, tumor size can be estimated precisely. Although a larger scale study comparing MRI and CT is needed to determine their roles, both should help in the diagnosis and selection of proper treatment for cervical carcinoma. Our preliminary report agrees with previous reports that MRI is promising and indispensable. MRI should be routinely used in conjunction with clinical staging to determine appropriate therapy in patients with cervical carcinoma.
