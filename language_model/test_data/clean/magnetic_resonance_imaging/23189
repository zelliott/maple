Conventional treatment for cervical disc herniations often defaults to open cervical discectomy, potentially supplemented by intervertebral fusion. Newer treatment strategies focus on percutaneous, minimally invasive procedures which are capable of resolving herniation pathology while offering decreased morbidity and convalescence time when compared to fusion. In cases where patients complain of radicular and neck pain symptoms related to a contained herniated disc, plasma disc decompression may be used as a minimally invasive treatment option on the cervical intervertebral discs.Three hundred and forty-nine patients who presented with a contained herniated cervical disc or focal protrusion causing pain associated with cervical nerve root compression were treated between January 2003 and May 2007. This case series study was conducted to evaluate clinical results through 1 year postoperatively.
