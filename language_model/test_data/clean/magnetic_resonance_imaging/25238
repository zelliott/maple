The analysis of the FOXL2 gene (3q23) in a series of two families and two sporadic cases affected with Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) is presented. This study detected two novel FOXL2 mutations (missence and nonsens mutations) and confirmed the recurrence of a previously described duplication. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the orbit, in one family, showed absence or hypotrophy of the eyelid superior levator muscle suggesting a possible role of FOXL2 in the development of this extra-ocular muscle.
