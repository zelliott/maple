Commentaries by Derrfuss and Mar (Derrfuss, J., Mar, R., 2009. Lost in localization: the need for a universal coordinate database. Neuroimage.) and Nielsen (Nielsen, F.A., 2009. Lost in localization: a solution with neuroinformatics 2.0? Neuroimage.) outline the need for a universal coordinate database and some possible approaches to creating one. I highlight the issue of minimal or maximal database scope and advocate a bottom-up approach to this problem.
