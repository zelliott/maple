Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been in clinical use for barely a decade. During this relatively short period MRI has established itself as an important diagnostic instrument. MRI is an intrinsically three-dimensional, completely noninvasive technique. Its inherent high contrast between the flowing blood on the surrounding tissue make MRI an ideal diagnostic method for cardiovascular diseases, since it does not expose patients and staff to ionizing radiation and there is no need for the application of contrast media. The high spatial and excellent contrast resolution are the basis for the distinct delineation of the cardiovascular pathoanatomy. Infarcted and non-infarcted myocardium may be differentiated by the assessment of tissue relaxation times. With the use of Cine MRI, global and regional ventricular function may be quantified and bloodflow within cardiac chambers may be analyzed. Today's indications for cardiovascular MRI based on personal experience and the literature are presented.
