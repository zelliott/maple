Glomus tumors originate from paranglionic tissues. In head and neck, these lesions are mainly found near carotid bifurcation, X nerve, jugular bulb or middle ear. These tumors have a low growing rate and are hypervascularized. Their histology show "nonchromaffin" cells and vascular structures involved by a fibrous matrix. MRI, CT and angiography are imaging methods used in glomus tumor. The author describe four cases of jugulo-timpanic glomus tumors studied by MRI, showing their main findings and the value of this method to detection of these lesions.
