The authors report on movement disorders that persist for a long duration following Japanese encephalitis (JE). Fifteen patients with diagnosed JE were followed up after an interval of 3 to 5 years. Of the four patients with a movement disorder, two were children with severe generalized dystonia in whom MRI revealed bilateral thalamic lesions. The two adult patients had parkinsonism. MRI in both adult patients showed lesions confined to the substantia nigra. Viral antibody and antigen were absent in the CSF of all patients.
