The aim of this paper is to point out the value of MRI in diagnostic assessment of cervical lymphadenopathies and associated oral cavity pathological conditions. We used a statistic retrospective method to evaluate the results obtained after MRI examinations of 64 patients diagnosed with oral cavity pathology and cervical lymphadenopathies. In all cases the MRI exams detected the presence of cervical lymphadenopathies, their topoanatomic sites and oral cavity pathological entities that produced them. Due to fine characterization abilities by internal signal variation. MRI is the method of choice in daily practice for diagnosing, evaluation and staging of oral cavity pathology and cervical lymphadenopathies. Due to fine capacities of detecting internal signal variations in soft tissues or visceral parenchyma, MRI has high abilities in diagnostic assessment of oral cavity pathologies being a daily method of choice for diagnosing, evaluation and staging, with great value in any morbid entity.
