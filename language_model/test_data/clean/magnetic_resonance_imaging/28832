To evaluate the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging during manual positioning of the hip, or multipositional MR imaging, in an open-magnet configuration to study femoral head containment, articular congruency, and femoral head deformity in Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease.

In 12 children with advanced Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, multipositional MR imaging and conventional arthrography were compared in the assessment of containment, femoroacetabular congruency, and femoral head deformity. Images of the hips in several positions were compared subjectively and objectively.

MR imging correlated well with arthrography for overall subjective assessment of severity of disease (r = 0.71, P = .01), with good interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.65, P < .001). MR images demonstrated all cases of hinge abduction shown arthrographically. However, MR imaging failed to depict one case of femoral head flattening. MR imaging correlated well with arthrography in the objective evaluation of joint fluid and lateral subluxation (r = 0.80, P < .01). MR imaging correlated poorly with arthrography in the measurement of sphericity of the femoral head.

Multipositional MR imaging with an open-magnet configuration was comparable to arthrography for demonstration of femoral head containment and congruency of the articular surfaces of the hip. In the evaluation of deformity, it performed less well.
