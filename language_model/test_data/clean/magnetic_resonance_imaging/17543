The authors report the case of a 26-year old professional ballet dancer with chronic dysmenorrhea and a Body Mass Index of 17, who presented with right hip pain related with a stress fracture of the acetabulum. Plain radiographs were unremarkable and the diagnosis was made with magnetic resonance imaging. Conservative treatment including partial weight bearing with crutches for six weeks resulted in immediate resolution of symptoms. The authors discuss the specific risk factors for stress fractures encountered in professional ballet dancers, such as hypogonadism and eating disorders.
