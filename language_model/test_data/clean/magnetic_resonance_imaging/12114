To prove the usefulness of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in determining the invasion of uterine cervical cancer with imaging planes, we evaluated 44 patients with histologically proved cervical cancer. MRI was performed with a Signa 1.5 T (General Electric), and a T2-weighted image was used. In coronal planes, the accuracy was 75.0% for parametrial invasion. It was impossible to diagnose in 77.8%, 92.1% and 63.2% the invasion of the uterine body, bladder and rectum, respectively. In axial planes, the accuracy was 76.3%, 92.1% and 78.9% for the invasion of parametrium, bladder and rectum, respectively. It was impossible to diagnose in 72.2% the invasion of the uterine body. In sagittal planes, the accuracy was 80.6%, 97.4% and 89.7% for invasion of the uterine body, bladder and rectum, respectively. In all 39 cases it was impossible to diagnose parametrial invasion. In five cases, MRI failed to detect the tumor in any of the three planes, but in three cases it was able to detect the tumor in at least one of the three. We conclude as follows: 1) MRI is a useful method in determining the invasion of cervical cancer. 2) Coronal planes are recommended for the determination of parametrial invasion, axial planes for the parametrium, bladder and rectum, and sagittal planes for the uterine body, bladder and rectum. 3) All three planes are needed to determine cervical cancer.
