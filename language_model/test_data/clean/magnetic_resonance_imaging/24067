Fast fat-suppressed (FS) three-dimensional (3D) spoiled gradient-recalled echo (SPGR) imaging of 64 articular cartilage regions in 16 patellofemoral joints was evaluated to assess its feasibility in diagnosing patellofemoral chondromalacia. It demonstrated good correlation with arthroscopic reports and took about half of the examination time that FS 3D SPGR did. This modified, faster technique has the potential to diagnose patellofemoral chondromalacia with shorter examination time than FS 3D SPGR did.
