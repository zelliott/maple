Minipigs are widely used to examine physiologic mechanisms under experimental settings. The purpose of our study was to localize the visual cortex of minipigs using visual stimulation in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Five male GÃ¶ttinger minipigs were studied with fMRI during visual stimulation with series of light impulses conducted into the MR cabin via fibre optical wave guides (EPI sequences, block design, 1.5 T clinical routine MR-scanner). Statistics were performed using SPM'99. All minipigs showed activation of the visual cortex due to light stimulation. The activation could be superimposed to T2-weighted structural images with good spatial resolution revealing the exact location of the visual cortex. We were able to localize the visual cortex in minipigs for the first time utilizing fMRI on a routine scanner. However, this may be useful for precise positioning of electrodes or implants or be used as a further uncomplicated non-invasive method in physiologic experiments.
