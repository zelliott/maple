The role of MR imaging in the diagnosis of impingement and rotator cuff disorders is expanding greatly. This article discusses the clinically pertinent history, physical examination, and surgical treatment of rotator cuff problems. A rationale for consideration of open, "mini-open," and arthroscopic surgical intervention is proposed. The utilization of MR imaging by the orthopedic surgeon for nonoperative, preoperative, and postoperative decision-making are presented. A close working relationship between the radiologist and the orthopedist is emphasized.
