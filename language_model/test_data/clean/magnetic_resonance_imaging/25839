To evaluate the clinical desired accuracy of the left ventricular ejection fractions (EFs) calculated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Within one to three days post coronary angiography and left ventriculogram, twenty-five adults were studied by MR imaging. They had nuclear medicine studies for left ventricular ejection fractions as well. EKG-gated spin-echo 30-msec echo-delay images were obtained in end systole and end diastole in a plane parallel to the ventricular septum. Analysis of ventricular volumes and ejection fractions were performed using the area-length method. The EFs calculation by gated MRI were compared with that obtained by angiocardiography and nuclear medicine studies. The linear regression line obtained for ejection fraction was y = 0.858x +6.813, r = 0.753, p = 0.009; y' = 1.567x'-24.692, r' = 0.783, p' = 0.002. The above figure indicate a reasonable correlation among these three methods.
