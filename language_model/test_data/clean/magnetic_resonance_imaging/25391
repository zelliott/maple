Intracerebral and intramedullary schwannomas are uncommon; but, in general, spinal intramedullary schwannomas are more frequent than intracerebral schwanomas. We present a case of right lateral ventricle schwannoma in a 21-year-old man and review the associated literature. The 21-year-old right-handed man presented with loss of the left-eye vision approximately 8 months before referral to an ophthalmologist. The patient was immediately subjected to computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed an enhanced lesion with cystic component in the right occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. And consecutively, he was admitted to our department. The tumor was evacuated via craniotomy with marked improvement in his clinical state. The postoperative course was uneventful and postoperative CT control showed no residue. On MRI control no recurrence was noted after a follow-up period of 8 years. Intracerebral schwannoma is a rare, benign neoplasm. It is usually located superficially or adjacent to a ventricle. Characteristic imaging features include cyst formation, calcification, and evidence of peritumoral edema or gliosis. The recognition of this benign and potentially curable neoplasm and its differentiation from other neoplasms, some of which have less favourable outcomes, is of obvious importance.
