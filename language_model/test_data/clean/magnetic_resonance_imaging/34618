The incidence of intracranial aneurysm associated with pituitary adenoma is not definitely established although reported higher than in general population. This study was designed to find the existence of such association in a large series of pituitary adenoma cases. A retrospective study of 467 cases of pituitary adenoma (mean age: 41 +/- 15 years) was done. All patients underwent cerebral angiography at least of anterior circulation, detailed hormonal study, and 155 cases had additional magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. Twenty-five cases (5.4%) of pituitary adenoma (mean age 52 years) had intracranial aneurysm, 97% on anterior circulation, and 12% had multiple aneurysms. Two cases presented with aneurysmal rupture and the rest were incidental. Aneurysm was more frequently seen with increasing age (p < 0.001) and the age distribution resembled that of aneurysm among general population. Although the combination was most frequent among nonfunctioning adenoma (8.8%), and least frequent among prolactinoma (2.4%), this association was again due to age factor. There was no association between hormone secretion, size and invasive nature of the tumor. The results showed no association between intracranial aneurysm and pituitary adenoma. Our speculation is that such occurrence is merely a chance factor and the risk is no greater than that among general population.
