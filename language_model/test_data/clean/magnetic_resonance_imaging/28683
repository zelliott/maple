To define the spectrum of MRI appearances of postoperative seromas in patients who have undergone excision of extremity soft tissue sarcomas. Local recurrence is always of concern; often a second-look procedure is performed to assess this possibility. Unnecessary surgical exploration may be avoided if radiologists and orthopedic oncologists are familiar with this spectrum of MRI appearances.

The medical records and images of 85 patients with extremity soft tissue sarcomas were reviewed. Postoperative MRI examinations were available in 46 patients. Eight of these demonstrated MRI evidence of postoperative seroma. The initial size, rate of change, margin, and internal architecture of each seroma was measured, calculated, graded, and graphed.

MRI is an excellent modality for the evaluation of postoperative seromas. Globular areas of low to intermediate signal material within seromas may represent organized hematomas or granulation tissue rather than sarcoma recurrence. Local recurrence rarely occurs within seromas.
