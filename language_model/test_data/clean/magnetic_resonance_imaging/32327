The ability of different MRI sequences to depict characteristic findings suggestive of ventriculitis was compared.

The study comprised 20 brain MRI studies in 13 patients who had a final diagnosis of ventriculitis. Both diffusion-weighted imaging and FLAIR imaging were equally and highly sensitive for detecting intraventricular debris and pus--the most common MRI finding suggestive of ventriculitis. FLAIR imaging was superior to contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging for depicting ventricular wall abnormalities--a less common finding that also is suggestive of ventriculitis.
