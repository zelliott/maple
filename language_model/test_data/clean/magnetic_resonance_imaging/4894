Children with new-onset seizures may have antecedent neurobiologic alterations that predispose them to developing seizures. Our aim was to evaluate hippocampal and thalamic volumes and lobar cortical thickness of children with new-onset seizures.

Twenty-nine children with new-onset seizures and normal MR imaging findings were recruited. Ten patients had generalized seizures, 19 had partial seizures, and 15 were on antiepileptic medications. Twenty-three age-matched healthy controls were also recruited. Hippocampal and thalamic volumes and lobar cortical thickness, including frontal, medial temporal, lateral temporal, parietal, cingulate, and occipital cortical thickness, were assessed by using volumetric T1-weighted imaging and were compared between patients and controls.

There were no significant differences in hippocampal and thalamic volumes of patients with new-onset seizures, including the subgroups with generalized and partial seizures and those on and off antiepileptic medications, compared with controls (P > .01). There was significant reduction in cortical thickness in right cingulate (P = .004), right medial temporal (P = .006), and left frontal (P = .007) cortices in patients with new-onset seizures. Patients with generalized seizures did not demonstrate a significant reduction in cortical thickness (P > .01). Patients with partial seizures demonstrated a significant reduction in cortical thickness in the right frontal (P = .008), right parietal (P = .003), and left frontal (P = .007) cortices. There were no significant differences in cortical thickness among patients on or off antiepileptic medications (P > .01).

We found reduced cortical thickness in children with new-onset seizures. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the neurobiologic relevance of these structural changes.
