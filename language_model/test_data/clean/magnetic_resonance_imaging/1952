Parapharyngeal tumors account for only 0.8% of all head and neck tumors which often presents the problem of preoperative diagnosis. Up to 80% of parapharyngeal tumors are benign.

Starting November 1995 to March 2001, 16 patients with parapharyngeal tumors and 1 retropharyngeal abscess were treated. The median age was 54 years. Only 2 patients demonstrated peripheral nerve lesions preoperatively.

17 tumors and the retropharyngeal abscess were excised via transcervical approach, with an extension by parotidectomy and temporary mandibular split in 1 case. Histological entities were pleomorphic adenomas in 5 cases, a ganglioneurinoma, neurinoma of the vagal nerve and metastasis of a squamous cell carcinoma in 2 patients each, furthermore neuroblastoma, extramedullary plasmocytoma, T-cell lymphoma, and hemangioma in 1 patient each.

We demonstrate the differential diagnosis of parapharyngeal tumors as well as their diagnostic and therapeutic management. The tumors should be excised by a transcervical approach to protect cervical vessels and nerves, which is limited by a transoral approach.
