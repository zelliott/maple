We present a method to register a preoperative MR volume to a sparse set of intraoperative ultrasound slices. Our aim is to allow the transfer of information from preoperative modalities to intraoperative ultrasound images to aid needle placement during thermal ablation of liver metastases. The spatial relationship between ultrasound slices is obtained by tracking the probe using a Polaris optical tracking system. Images are acquired at maximum exhalation and we assume the validity of the rigid body transformation. An initial registration is carried out by picking a single corresponding point in both modalities. Our strategy is to interpret both sets of images in an automated pre-processing step to produce evidence or probabilities of corresponding structure as a pixel or voxel map. The registration algorithm converts the intensity values of the MR and ultrasound images into vessel probability values. The registration is then carried out between the vessel probability images. Results are compared to a "bronze standard" registration which is calculated using a manual point/line picking algorithm and verified using visual inspection. Results show that our starting estimate is within a root mean square target registration error (calculated over the whole liver) of 15.4 mm to the "bronze standard" and this is improved to 3.6 mm after running the intensity-based algorithm.
