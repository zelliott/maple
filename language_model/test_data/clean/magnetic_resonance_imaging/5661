We report a 12-year-old female presenting with an abdominal tumor. Diagnostic workup revealed giant bilateral ovarian cysts, severe hypothyroidism as well as an elevation of CA 125. We refrained from ovariectomy, which would be necessary for a malignant tumor, in view of an evident Van Wyk and Grumbach syndrome. The patient promptly responded to L-thyroxine with complete regression of all symptoms. Hypothyroidism should be considered in the evaluation of ovarian cysts. Although the Van Wyk and Grumbach syndrome is rare, it is crucial to rule it out in order to avoid unnecessary ovarian surgery when thyroid replacement is completely sufficient.
