Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) offer noninvasive ways to observe structural and biochemical changes which might serve as valuable diagnostic markers for detecting brain damage from prenatal ethanol teratogenesis. Cranial MR imaging and spectroscopy were performed on 20 nonhuman primates (Macaca nemestrina) with known prenatal ethanol exposures and well-documented cognitive and behavioral levels of performance. The choline: creatine ratio detected by 1H-MRS in the brain increased significantly with increasing duration of in utero ethanol exposure. These signal alterations occurred in the absence of gross structural brain anomalies (detectable by MRI) and were significantly correlated with alcohol-related cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. These observations are consistent with reports of elevated choline: creatine ratios associated with various neurologic insults and disease states. The association observed between brain choline:creatine ratios and in utero ethanol exposure suggest a role for 1H-MRS in elucidating mechanisms of ethanol teratogenicity.
