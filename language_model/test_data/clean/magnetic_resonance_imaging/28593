The early clinical experience with a 3-Dimensional Fourier Transform Gradient Echo sequence with fat suppression in the evaluation of breast masses is reported. Ten female patients with breast malignancies were pre-operatively evaluated with this sequence and the results compared with the pathological specimens. The scanning protocol included a non-contrast sequence followed by an immediate post-contrast sequence (completed 4.5 min after intravenous contrast injection) and a delayed sequence. Images were assessed for maximum lesion and parenchymal enhancement, lesion size and additional enhancing abnormalities. In six patients, malignant masses enhanced maximally on the immediate post-contrast sequence with parenchyma enhancing maximally on delayed images. In three cases, there was preferential enhancement of malignant lesions over normal parenchyma but to a similar degree on both post-contrast sequences. In one case, both the lesion and parenchyma enhanced maximally on the delayed sequence. Magnetic resonance assessed lesion size accurately and also detected satellite malignancies in one case. However, lesion grade, associated in situ carcinoma and lymphovascular invasion did not impact on lesion enhancement. In this small series, a contrast-enhanced, fat-suppressed 3-D Gradient Echo Sequence detected breast carcinoma with high sensitivity. The technique holds promise but further evaluation is required.
