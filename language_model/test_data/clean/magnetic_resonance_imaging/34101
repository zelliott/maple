Extramedullary hematopoiesis usually occurs in hematological diseases but may also be found as an uncommon complication of Paget's disease, probably due to bone effraction mechanism. We present a case of intrathoracic extramedullary hematopoiesis related to Paget's disease. To our knowledge, this is the seventh case reported in the literature. We describe and correlate the conventional X-ray, CT, MR imaging, and cytological findings.
