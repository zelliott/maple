Acoustic neuroma/vestibular schwannoma treatment has changed considerably since the 1990s, when surgical treatment was recommended in all cases of schwannoma, whereas nowadays a more differentiated approach is taken. The three classical approaches (translabyrinthine, transtemporal, and suboccipital) still have their surgical value; however, greater importance is apportioned to radiotherapy (radiosurgery, gamma- and cyber-knife). Magnetic resonance imaging in particular has changed diagnostics and how tumor growth is followed. Electrophysiological monitoring of facial and auditory nerves has helped lower postoperative morbidity. New issues have been raised regarding quality of life. Neuropsychological investigations for cognitive and mnestic performance following procedures in the cerebellopontine angle have highlighted problem areas receiving hitherto little attention. Finally, the therapy of this benign lesion should be planned individually, taking the patient's age as well as their professional and personal status into consideration.
