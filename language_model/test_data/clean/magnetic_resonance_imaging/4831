Successful aging (SA) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are heterogeneous groups of aging. To explore the heterogeneity, the functional connectivity was studied in these populations.

The present study utilized functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to investigate default mode network (DMN) in 8 healthy subjects of SA, 8 subjects of usual aging (UA), and 8 MCI patients during verbal fluency tests (VFTs). Functional connectivity (based seeds) of different groups was analyzed by using statistical test.

Compared with SA and UA groups, MCI subjects exhibited decreased functional connectivity in the DMN regions, including the inferior parietal lobule and left angular gyrus (t = 3.53, P < 0.001). Compared with UA and MCI groups, the SA elderly exhibited increased functional connectivity in the precuneus (t = 3.53, P < 0.001).

These findings suggested that abnormalities of functional connectivity in DMN might be related with semantic memory impairment in aging. Left angular gyrus and precuneus might be the potential imaging-based biomarker for distinguishing heterogeneous process of elderly.
