The authors report a novel management option for patients with complex dissecting aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). The authors reviewed the medical records and neuroimaging studies of 3 patients who underwent a novel surgical treatment for complicated dissecting PICA aneurysms. The mean follow-up period was 1.1 years, and no patient was lost to follow-up. Two patients were in poor condition following an acute, severe subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 1 presented with headaches and a remote history of bleeding. All patients underwent surgical occlusion of the PICA beyond the tonsillar loop, distal to the aneurysmal segment. Intraoperative and delayed follow-up angiography demonstrated progressive diminution in size of the aneurysmal dilation but persistent filling of the proximal PICA segments supplying the brainstem. Outcome was good in all cases. This novel technique has been used successfully in 3 cases and, to the authors' knowledge, has not been reported previously.
