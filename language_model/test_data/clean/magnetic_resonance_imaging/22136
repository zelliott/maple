Preoperative localization of hyperactive parathyroid glands is useful to minimize operative time and reduce patient morbidity. This investigation compared the sensitivity of radionuclide imaging with 99mTc tetrofosmin with that of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with hyperparathyroidism.

Twenty-six patients with primary (n = 7) or secondary (n = 19) hyperparathyroidism were imaged with 99mTc tetrofosmin, ultrasound and MR imaging of the neck and thorax to localize the lesions. The presence of hyperparathyroidism was identified by an intact parathyroid hormone in vitro assay. The parathyroid/normal thyroid tissue activity ratio was calculated for all patients with evidence of an abnormality on tetrofosmin images. Pathological findings were compared with the results of imaging in 18 of the 26 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy.

Technetium-99m tetrofosmin scans demonstrated focal uptake in 46 glands of 26 patients. The uptake was categorized as slight in 78.3% (36/46) and intense (parathyroid/normal thyroid tissue activity ratio, > 1.4) in 21.7% (10/46). Ultrasonography and MR imaging identified 44 and 47 glands, respectively, in these patients. Eleven of the 18 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy within 1 mo after tetrofosmin imaging had hyperplastic glands, while 7 had parathyroid adenomas. Tetrofosmin imaging successfully localized 7 of 7 (100%) adenomas and 27 of 37 (73.0%) hyperplastic glands. The sensitivities of each technique for localizing abnormal parathyroid glands were 77.3% (34/44) for tetrofosmin imaging: 68.2% (20/44) for ultrasonography: and 68.2% (30/44) for MR imaging. Technetium-99m tetrofosmin uptake ratio in the 18 patients with surgical exploration was not proportional to several oxyphil cells.

Technetium-99m tetrofosmin parathyroid imaging may be useful for localizing abnormal glands in patients with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The sensitivity of 99mTc tetrofosmin parathyroid imaging was high as compared to ultrasonography or MR imaging. The prolonged retention of tetrofosmin may not depend on the number of mitochondria-rich oxyphil cells.
