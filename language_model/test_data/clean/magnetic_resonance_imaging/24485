Interstitial deletions of the long arm of the chromosome 17 are relatively rare. Up to 17 cases involving the q22-q23.3 band have been reported so far. A common phenotype has not yet been delineated and epilepsy has been reported in only 2 out of 17 cases. We describe a clinical phenotype of epilepsy characterized by myoclonic atonic and absence seizures in a 6-year-old boy carrying a de novo 17q22q23 deletion detected by oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).
