Normal brain tissue is probably the most important tissue compartment in the brain involved in adverse radiation effects (AREs). The capabilities of computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography in repeat examinations of a treatment outcome provide a baseline by which to monitor the AREs in vivo and to follow their sequential changes. This article relates the AREs seen after radiosurgery to the dose/volume and specific tissue effects established from 30 years of collected experience with radiosurgery at the Karolinska Hospital.
