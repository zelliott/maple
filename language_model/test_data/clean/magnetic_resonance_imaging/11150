Hemangiopericytomas are rare perivascular tumors. The nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are most often involved in the head and neck region. A case of hemangiopericytoma in a 63 year old patient is presented. The initial symptom was recurrent bleeding from the nose. The patient had a history of radiotherapy for a pituitary adenoma 30 years previously. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a polypoid opacification of the ethmoid, sphenoid and basal aspects of the frontal sinus on the right side. Histological diagnosis was obtained from nasal biopsy. Preoperatively, arteriography and tumor embolisation were performed. The tumor was completely excised using a combined endonasal and external approach as an osteoplastic revision of the frontal sinus via bicoronal incision. There was no recurrence at follow-up 1 year later.
