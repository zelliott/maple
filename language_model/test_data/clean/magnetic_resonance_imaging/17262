The authors report a case of eosinophilic granuloma involving the roof and the lateral wall of the left orbit in a 5-year-old boy. The clinical presentation and especially the imaging features (computed tomography and MRI) suggested a malignant tumor and the final diagnosis was obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy with histopathologic examination. Despite its alarming radiologic appearance, there was spontaneous healing of the eosinophilic granuloma with restitution ad-integrum of the bone.
