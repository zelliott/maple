The clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) can be supported by the analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the detection of an inflammatory reaction in central nervous system. The most sensitive method for the detection of oligoclonal IgG bands is isoelectric focusing. However magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive and predictive. Nevertheless CSF study is useful in monosymptomatic manifestation when MRI is normal, and primordial in primary progressive MS diagnosis. More studies are needed to determine the optimal sequence of CSF study, MRI and evoked potentials in the diagnosis of different presentation of MS.
