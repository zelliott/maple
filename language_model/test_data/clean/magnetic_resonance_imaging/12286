Recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have revolutionized peripheral nerve imaging and made high-resolution acquisitions a clinical reality. High-resolution dedicated MR neurography techniques can show pathologic changes within the peripheral nerves as well as elucidate the underlying disorder or cause. Neurogenic pain arising from the nerves of the pelvis and lumbosacral plexus poses a particular diagnostic challenge for the clinician and radiologist alike. This article reviews the advances in MR imaging that have allowed state-of-the-art high-resolution imaging to become a reality in clinical practice.
