While diaphragmatic hydatid disease is a rare condition, subcutaneous extension of the disease is very rare. A 33-year-old female visited our clinic due to swelling on the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Thoraco-abdominal CT scan and MRI revealed a hydatid cyst (110 x 98 x 78 mm) located in the costal part of the hemidiaphragm extending into the preperitoneal space and protruding intercostally to a subcutaneous area. Total pericyst resection without opening the cyst, including a margin of normal diaphragm, was performed. The patient was started on albendazole for three months. Hydatid cyst in the diaphragm should be considered in patients with preoperative imaging data indicating cystic lesions adjacent to the diaphragm, especially for cystic lesions encountered in patients who live in or who have come from endemic regions.
