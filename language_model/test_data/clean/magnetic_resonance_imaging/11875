To investigate the clinical types and characteristics of cerebral watershed infarcts (CWI).

Analysis of the clinical data and imaging characteristics of 192 cases with CWI confirmed by CT scan or MRI.

In 69 cases (35.9%), CWI appeared as wedge-shaped areas on CT scan or MRI, the infarcts located at marginal zones between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries and were usually associated clinically with hemiparesis, transcortical motor aphasia and dementia. In 74 cases (38.5%) the infarcts also appeared as wedge-shaped areas on CT scan and MRI, but located at marginal zones between the middle and posterior cerebral arteries, the patients mainly showed mild hemiparesis and apathy. In 49 cases (25.5%), the long-line or triangle-shaped infarct areas usually located at marginal zones between the superficial and deep territory of the middle cerebral arteries in the basal ganglia and posterolateral angulus frontalis.

The presentation of CWI is complicated, and the diagnosis of that mainly depends on imaging studies such as CT scan and MRI.
