A 50-year-old woman visited our department for further examination of incidental bladder tumor detected by ultrasound at her health check. Cystoscopy demonstrated a submucosal tumor in the anterior wall of the urinary bladder. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the tumor had high intensity in T2- weighted images. The slightly-elevated serum level of dopamine and uptake image in the meta iodobenzyl granidine-scintigraphy test suggested that she might have ectopic pheochromocytoma in the urinary bladder. Partial cystectomy with extirpation of the tumor was performed. The histological diagnosis was schwannoma, which is rarely found in the urinary bladder.
