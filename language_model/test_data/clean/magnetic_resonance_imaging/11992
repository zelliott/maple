Sixteen young patients, with clinical and radiological signs of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), were investigated with MR imaging. Twelve of them were investigated with US in the perinatal period. The extant 4 patients, older than the others, had a clinical history of PVL. US scans were capable of yielding precise information about the anatomical features of PVL in both the acute and the middle phases. The lesions appeared as hyperechoic areas which subsequently turned to anechoic cavities. MR imaging and CT scans did not present any particular advantage over US scans in the acute phase, but they did detect periventricular damage when the patient was 6-7 months old. MR imaging was superior to CT in detecting the delayed myelination of white matter. Inversion-recovery sequences gave more anatomical details to distinguish normal from abnormal white matter. Spin-echo proton-density images detected periventricular gliosis, which appeared as persistent hyperintense areas. CT might be useful in the acute phase, after US detection of hyperechoic intraparenchymal areas, for it allowed purely ischemic lesions to be distinguished from hemorrhagic ones.
