In order to compare score values, joint alterations in haemophilic patients on early and late prophylaxis were assessed and evaluated by X-ray radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a prospective study.

24 joints (10 knees and 14 ankles) of 15 haemophilic patients, with at least one manifestation of bleeding (proven by sonographic assessment) were investigated. Radiological and MRI investigations were done after complete resorption of bleeding. For radiological evaluation a Petterson score (max. 13 points), and for MRI evaluation a modified MRI score (max. 13 points) according to Nuss et al. were used.

Good correlation could be demonstrated between the number of joint bleedings and the degree of arthropathy. 16 joints with maximal 2 bleedings had no alteration on both MRI and radiological assessment. Joints with 3 bleedings had Pettersson score from 0 - 3 points and MRI scores of 2 points. Joints with greater-than-or-equal 4 bleedings had a radiological score between 7 and 12 points, MRI scores ranged from 3 to 8 points.

Increasing severity of heamophilic arthropathy could be demonstrated initially by the MRI score and later by the Pettersson score depending on the number of bleedings. The MRI score describes initial joints alterations more precisely and earlier than the Pettersson score, allowing a discerning estimation of the degree and a follow-up of haemophilic arthropathy.
