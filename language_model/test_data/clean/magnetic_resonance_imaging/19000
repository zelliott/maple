A 17-year-old patient with pre-existing grade II spondylolisthesis of L5/S1 sustained a partial disruption of the left sacroiliac joint with haematoma of the iliac muscle after a fall. The haematoma probably led to occlusion of the left ureter, resulting in a urinary tract infection. After initial conservative treatment the patient developed fever and radicular pain of the left leg. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a left-sided epidural abscess at L5/S1, which had probably spread from the infected iliac haematoma along the injured sacroiliac joint. Prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic coverage with cefuroxime and flucloxacillin led to rapid clinical improvement. Staphylococcus aureus was identified as the pathogen. At follow-up 6 months postoperatively all symptoms had resolved, while MRI still revealed residual osseous oedema of the sacroiliac joint. The haematoma of the iliac muscle resolved without surgical intervention.
