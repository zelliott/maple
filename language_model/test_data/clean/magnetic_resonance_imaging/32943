Recurrent pleomorphic adenoma (RPA) of the parotid gland represents a challenging task for maxillofacial surgeons. The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of RPA of the parotid gland has been studied in previous experiences, and its use has been considered questionable. The aims of our article were to analyze and illustrate a case of RPA, initially treated with enucleations at another institution, showing a multinodular pattern with positivity for S-100 protein and cytokeratin, managed with conservative parotidectomy and neutron radiotherapy.
