We report a complex and rare combination of clinical and histological findings in a 59-year-old female patient: severe sicca-syndrome due to M. Sj√∂gren, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MALT-type) in labial salivary glands with localized amyloid deposition, IgM-paraproteinemia, and Bence-Jones proteinuria. The causal association of these findings could only be elucidated by intense interdisciplinary correlation of all findings.
