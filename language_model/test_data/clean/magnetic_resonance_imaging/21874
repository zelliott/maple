In patients with male infertility, endorectal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides high-resolution images of the prostate gland and ejaculatory apparatus. The multiplanar capability of MR imaging allows production of a detailed map of the reproductive tract for guiding treatment. Causes of male infertility can be classified as congenital, acquired, infectious, or hormonal. Wolffian duct abnormalities include agenesis of the kidney, vas deferens, or seminal vesicle and cysts of the vas deferens, seminal vesicle, or urogenital sinus-ejaculatory duct. Müllerian duct abnormalities are less common and consist of müllerian duct cysts and utricle cysts. Cowper duct cysts and peripheral-zone prostatic cysts are acquired causes of male infertility. Prostatitis, an infectious cause of male infertility, may mimic carcinoma on long repetition time/echo time images. A low testosterone levels is one of the hormonal causes of male infertility. Pitfalls in the interpretation of MR images can be avoided by familiarity with normal and abnormal findings in patients with male infertility.
