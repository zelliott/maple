The research goals were to fabricate a crosslinked hyaluronate (HA)/collagen membrane and study its efficacy in preventing peridural adhesion. Different weight ratios of HA/collagen membranes crosslinked with carbodiimide were tested for biocompatibility and biodegradability first. Forty-eight adult New Zealand white rabbits underwent an L6 laminectomy. Sixteen rabbits each received a weight ratio of HA/collagen = 60/40 membrane (Membrane A) or a 40/60 membrane (Membrane B) on the exposed dura. The last 16 rabbits received no treatment and served as controls. No adverse reaction of the membranes was noted. Magnetic resonance images revealed a hyposignal space between the dura and the scar tissues at Membrane B-treated laminectomy site 3 months after surgery. Histological examination showed that the amount of scarring decreased with time in all groups. Amount of scarring decreased significantly at laminectomy sites treated with either membrane. Compared with the control group, the extent of peridural adhesion decreased significantly in the Membrane B-treated group at 3 months after surgery; while it decreased substantially, but not significantly, in the Membrane A-treated group. The carbodiimide-crosslinked HA/collagen membrane is a safe and effective antiadhesive material in vivo. When placed onto the laminectomy site, the membrane with a weight ratio of HA/collagen = 40/60 appears to reduce peridural scar adhesion.
