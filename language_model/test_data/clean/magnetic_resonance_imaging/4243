Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a relatively new method of examining the liver. Attempts have been made to optimize the method by developing new imaging techniques and introducing new contrast agents. The new imaging techniques have improved the image quality by shortening the examination time, reducing motion artifacts, and improving contrast-to-noise ratio. Contrast agents have improved the diagnosis of focal hepatic lesions in MR imaging in several ways. Extracellular gadolinium chelates have significantly improved the characterization of lesions, and can be optimally used as a problem-solving method for differentiating focal lesions of an unknown nature that have already been detected by other imaging modalities or by unenhanced MR imaging. Hepatobiliary and macrophage monocytic phagocytic system (MMPS)-targeted contrast agents have improved the detection of hepatic lesions. These agents are best used for preoperative evaluation of the exact number of lesions in patients with primary or secondary hepatic neoplasms.
