Agenesis, aplasia and hypoplasia of the internal carotid arteries (ICA) are rare congenital disorders with few descriptions in the otorhinolaryngological literature. We present two cases of major abnormalities of the ICA, one with isolated hypoplasia and another with agenesis associated with ear malformation and facial palsy. We briefly review the normal anatomy and discuss the main aspects of these malformations.
