Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage is a rare and potentially life threatening situation in adults. The clinical presentation is non-specific, and the diagnosis is based on imaging. The purpose of this report is to provide an illustrative case of spontaneous bilateral adrenal hemorrhage that occurred during pregnancy. The sonographic and computed tomographic findings included large bilateral adrenal hematomas with no evidence of underlying malignancy. Since bilateral adrenal hemorrhage is a rare but potentially life threatening situation, prompt laboratory and imaging evaluation are essential and may reduce both morbidity and mortality.
