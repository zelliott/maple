Oncogenic osteomalacia is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by hypophosphatemic osteomalacia due to renal phosphate wasting. The same biochemical features are found in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia and sporadic hypophosphatemic osteomalacia with unknown etiology. Oncogenic osteomalacia is cured by resection of the responsible tumor. In contrast, patients with other types of hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia need long-term treatment with large doses of active vitamin D3. Therefore, detection of the responsible tumor for oncogenic osteomalacia has great clinical importance. However, there is no standard method for detecting the tumor for oncogenic osteomalacia, and the responsible tumor is often very difficult to be found. We describe a patient with adult-onset osteomalacia due to renal phosphate wasting. Although oncogenic osteomalacia was suspected, cranial, chest, and abdominal computed tomography scanning, urological and otolaryngological examinations, and detailed palpation for soft tissue mass failed to detect the responsible tumor. However, magnetic resonance imaging skeletal survey revealed a tumor in the right femoral bone. Resection of the tumor resulted in normalization of serum phosphate and renal phosphate handling. Because the most frequent causes for oncogenic osteomalacia are tumors in bone or soft tissue, magnetic resonance imaging skeletal survey is a very powerful method for detecting the responsible tumor. Vigorous search for tumors with this method in patients with hypophosphatemic osteomalacia would be helpful not only for proper management of patients, but also for clarifying the identity of sporadic hypophosphatemic osteomalacia.
