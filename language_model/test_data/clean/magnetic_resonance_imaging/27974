We describe a case of pyomyositis of the quadriceps associated with septic arthritis of the knee that developed after Fusobacterium nucleatum septicemia in a healthy man. The primary foci was presumed to be the oral cavity. Pyomyositis from Fusobacterium nucleatum is uncommon, and to our knowledge its association with septic arthritis has not been described.
