To estimate and compare the fractional distribution volume (fDV) of gadodiamide injection and technetium 99m-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) in the reperfused myocardium of rat hearts subjected to various durations of ischemia.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and autoradiography were performed in rats subjected to 20, 30, 40, or 60 minutes of regional ischemia followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. The fDVs of gadodiamide injection and (99m)Tc-DTPA were measured and compared by using inversion-recovery echo-planar imaging and autoradiographic phosphor imaging, respectively.

The mean fDV of both tracers (gadodiamide and (99m)Tc-DTPA) in normal myocardium was 18% +/- 1, whereas that in the entire area at risk increased significantly (P <.05) with 20, 30, 40, and 60 minutes of ischemia to 32% +/- 1, 57% +/- 4, 66% +/- 2, and 68% +/- 2, respectively. The fDV was significantly (P <.05) greater in the core of infarction-78% +/- 4, 89% +/- 5, and 88% +/- 5 with 30, 40, and 60 minutes of ischemia, respectively-than in the normal myocardium or in the area at risk.

The fDV of MR contrast material in the periinfarcted rim was significantly (P <. 05) greater than that in the normal myocardium, but significantly less than that in the core of infarcted myocardium.
