We present a case of insufficiency fracture (IF) of the calcaneum diagnosed by sonography (US). An 83-year-old woman consulted because of pain and swelling of the left heel without history of trauma. Standard radiographs showed osteoporosis without fracture. US revealed thickening of the calcaneal periosteum associated with edema of the adjacent soft tissues. Color Doppler imaging showed marked increased vascularity of the periosteum. US changes, together with the clinical and radiographic findings, were consistent with an IF of the calcaneum that was confirmed by MRI. The patient was treated successfully by conservative treatment. In the proper clinical setting, US can suggest the diagnosis of IF of the calcaneum.
