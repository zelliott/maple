A case report of fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE) presenting as acute myelopathy.

To illustrate the clinical presentation and magnetic resonance imaging features of FCE.

Johns Hopkins Transverse Myelitis Center.

A 16-year-old boy was diagnosed with ischemic myelopathy secondary to FCE 2 years after symptom onset. Diagnosis was delayed because the clinical and radiological characteristics were not recognized initially. After rehabilitation, the patient made a modest recovery.

Diagnosis of FCE can be made by recognition of the characteristic clinical and radiological features and a high index of suspicion.
