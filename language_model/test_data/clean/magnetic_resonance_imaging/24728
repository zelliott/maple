Adrenal gland tumours in pregnancy are very rare occurrences and have highly variable clinical presentations. The timely diagnosis of adrenal tumours in pregnancy is extremely important, as failure to do so may lead to fatality. As there is limited published literature on adrenal tumours in pregnancy and no consensus on its management, the management of such patients with regard to medical and surgical treatments, as well as timing of delivery, must therefore be individualised and carried out with multidisciplinary expertise. We present two cases of adrenal tumours in pregnancy, both with favourable outcomes and variable gestations. Our first and second cases discuss a large phaeochromocytoma and a cortisol-secreting adrenal cortical adenoma in pregnancy, respectively.
