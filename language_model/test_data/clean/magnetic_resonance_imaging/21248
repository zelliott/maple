To evaluate the clinical efficacy of incising spinal pia mater to relieve pressure and unilateral open-door laminoplasty with internal screw fixation for treatment of the dated spinal cord injury.

From March, 2009 to July, 2010, 16 cases with chronic cervical cord injury underwent spinal dura mater incision and unilateral open-door laminoplasty with internal screw fixation. Nerve functions of pre- and postoperation were evaluated by Frankel classification and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale.The improvement rate of JOA score at the indicated time was recorded.

Postoperative Frankel classification rating of 16 patients improved obviously.JOA scores at the 1st month, 3rd month, 6th month, and 12th month after surgery were 7.9 ± 2.3, 8.5 ± 1.6, 8.9 ± 2.1, and 12.4 ± 2.5, respectively, and significantly increased compared with that prior to surgery (5.5 ± 0.6). At the end of follow-up period, JOA score was significantly higher than that of pre-treatment (P<0.05). The recovery was relatively rapid during the first 3 months following the surgery, then entered a platform period.

It is effective for patients with dated spinal cord injury to undergo spinal decompression and laminoplasty.
