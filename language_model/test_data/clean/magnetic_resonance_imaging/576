To locate motor functional area of patients who undergone modified anatomical hemispherectomy in order to analysis the plasticity of upper limbs motor.

The patients who undergone modified anatomical hemispherectomy were performed BOLD sequences, to locate functional cortical areas in their residual brain.

6 patients have performed examination of BOLD sequences by 3.0-T MRI.5 of them obtained contralateral upper limb motor areas in their residual brain, and 3 of them obtained ipsilateral and contralateral upper limb motor area map in cortex. The ipsilateral upper limb motor areas in the M1, SMA and posterior parietal cortex.

The patients who undergone modified anatomical hemispherectomy is an excellent model to investigate mechanism of plasticity in the developing brain. Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) provided fine spatial detail of brain responses, would describe the motor functional area of cortical maps. These patients exist ipsilateral motor areas in their residual mono hemisphere. The study indicated there maybe have somewhat extent of correlation between the surgical procedure and the outcome of neuroplasticity.
