Desmoid tumours are benign fibrous neoplasms originating from musculoaponeurotic structures throughout the body. These tumours are rare in the mandible and the literature is limited to case reports and retrospective reviews and to date there is no agreed protocol for the management of these lesions in the paediatric mandible. The definition, diagnosis and management of juvenile fibromatosis still presents a challenge to the modern surgeon, radiologist and pathologist. We describe a case of paediatric mandibular infantile fibromatosis which presented a diagnostic dilemma, and review the currently available literature.
