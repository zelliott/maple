Advances in deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery have been achieved through the use of stereotactic targeting of key tracks in patients undergoing awake surgery. Intraoperative detection of track location has been useful in interpreting physiologic results, has limited the number of brain penetrations, and has decreased the incidence of reoperations. Alternatively, some centers are gaining experience with placement of the lead under general anesthesia using a purely anatomic approach, for which both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have proved useful. In this article, the use of image guidance with both the anatomic and physiologic approaches is described.
