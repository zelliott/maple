Two patients with central pontine myelinolysis who presented with dystonia are described. In one, it was associated with cerebellar ataxia which spontaneously improved. In the second, dystonia progressively disappeared 6 months later. In both cases magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed characteristic pontine lesions. Extrapontine myelinolysis involving the putamen was also observed in one patient. Even when the basal ganglia seem to be spared on MRI, dystonia is probably due to their involvement by myelinolysis. Cerebellar ataxia may be related to peduncular or cerebellar lesions or both.
