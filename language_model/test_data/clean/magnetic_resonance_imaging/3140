An elderly women presenting with transient ischemic events underwent transesophageal echocardiography, which detected an aneurysm of the interatrial septum. A tumor protruding from the right atrial aspect of the aneurysm also was found incidentally. Not only was magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging helpful in better characterizing the aneurysm, but also the use of gadolinium diethylaminetriamine pentaacetic acid permitted differentiation between the tumor and adherent thrombus. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report of a tumor arising from an atrial septal aneurysm.
