Studies of unilateral finger movement in right-handed subjects have shown asymmetrical patterns of activation in primary motor cortex. Some studies have measured a similar asymmetry in the supplementary motor area (SMA), but others have not. To shed more light on the symmetry of function in the SMA, we used path analysis of functional MRI data to investigate effective connectivity during a unilateral finger movement task. We observed a slight asymmetry in task activation: left SMA was equally active during movement of either hand, while right SMA was more active for left-hand movement, suggesting a dominant role of left SMA. In addition, we tested for a corresponding asymmetry in the influence of SMA on sensorimotor cortex (SMC) using a path model based on the well-established principle that SMA is involved in motor control and SMC in execution. We observed that the influence of left SMA on left SMC increased during right-hand movement, and the influence of left SMA on right SMC increased during left-hand movement. However, there was no significant hand-dependent change in the influences of the right SMA. This asymmetry in connectivity implies that left SMA does play a dominant role in unilateral movements of either hand in right handers. The experiment also provides a basis for further studies of motor system connectivity in healthy or patient populations.
