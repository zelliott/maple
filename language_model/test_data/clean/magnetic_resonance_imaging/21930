We report the findings in a 21-month-old girl who had a noninfiltrating mass in the left cheek, just anterior to the masseter muscle, which, at surgery, proved to be a sialoblastoma. Sialoblastoma has a histologic appearance reminiscent of a primitive state of salivary gland development; that is, it shows an arrested state of salivary maturation. MR imaging in this case showed that the lesion was isointense with muscle on T1-weighted images, had a high-intermediate signal intensity similar to that of fat on T2-weighted images, and enhanced sparsely and nonhomogeneously.
