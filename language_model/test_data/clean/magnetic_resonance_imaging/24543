Osteoarthritis is a common joint disorder that is most prevalent in the knee joint. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) can be characterized by the gradual loss of articular cartilage (AC). Formation of lesion, fissures and cracks on the cartilage surface has been associated with degenerative AC and can be measured by morphological assessment. In addition, loss of proteoglycan from extracellular matrix of the AC can be measured at early stage of cartilage degradation by physiological assessment. In this case, a biochemical phenomenon of cartilage is used to assess the changes at early degeneration of AC. In this paper, a method to measure local sodium concentration in AC due to proteoglycan has been investigated. A clinical 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with multinuclear spectroscopic facility is used to acquire sodium images and quantify local sodium content of AC. An optimised 3D gradient-echo sequence with low echo time has been used for MR scan. The estimated sodium concentration in AC region from four different data sets is found to be ~225Â±19mmol/l, which matches the values that has been reported for the normal AC. This study shows that sodium images acquired at clinical 1.5-T MRI system can generate an adequate quantitative data that enable the estimation of sodium concentration in AC. We conclude that this method is potentially suitable for non-invasive physiological (sodium content) measurement of articular cartilage.
