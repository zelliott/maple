Use of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) for diagnosis of hepatic tumors has been previously reported. Fat-saturated 3D T1-weighted gradient echo sequence (TIGRE) imaging using a breath-hold technique is usually used for dynamic studies and hepatobiliary phase Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In cases where the patient has difficulty holding their breath, this scanning method can be difficult.

To investigate the usefulness of a fat-saturated T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) sequence using a radial read-out (radial acquisition regime-SE, RADAR-SE) during free breathing for hepatobiliary phase Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI.

Images were acquired at 1.5â€‰T. First, a phantom with diluted Gd-EOB-DTPA was scanned using the TIGRE sequence and the RADAR-SE sequence. Contrast ratios of the sequences were compared. Next, the hepatobiliary phase was imaged in 62 patients using the TIGRE sequence with breath-hold and the RADAR-SE during free breathing. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations were compared.

In the phantom study, RADAR-SE had a higher contrast ratio than TIGRE. In the clinical study, artifacts were more conspicuous in RADAR-SE compared to TIGRE images in the qualitative evaluation. However, RADAR-SE images were equal to or better than TIGRE images in patients who had difficulty holding their breath. The signal intensity ratio of the liver was statistically higher using RADAR-SE than TIGRE.

RADAR-SE can be useful for hepatobiliary phase Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI in patients who have difficulty holding their breath.
