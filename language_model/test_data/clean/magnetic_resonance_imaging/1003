An increase in number of silent adrenal tumors is being observed by frequently using computer tomography and other modern diagnostics. All these tumors have to be diagnosed for their malignancy potential and hormonal activity to perform timely and curative treatment. The author has analyzed the results of treatment of 90 patients with malignant non-hormone producing adrenal tumors. As for the adrenal incidentaloma, the decisive criteria of malignant nature and accordingly direct operation indication are tumor size, computer tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging data. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is justified for diagnostics in case of suspicion of metastases to adrenals. The single most effective method for the treatment of malignant adrenal tumors is an open retroperitoneal lumbotomical adrenalectomy.
