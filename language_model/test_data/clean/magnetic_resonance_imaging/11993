The authors investigated the real contribution of low-field MR imaging in the follow-up of pneumonectomized patients. Literature on the subject is surprisingly poor, even though MR diagnostic capabilities seem to be great in these patients. Because of the peculiar anatomical features of pneumonectomized patients, low-field MR imaging yields high-quality images. The operated hemithorax, with the postpneumonectomy space full of fluid, in the absence of respiratory movements is free of movement artifacts. The latter are known to worsen image quality in thoracic MR imaging, especially without respiratory gating. In the study of mediastinum and operated hemithorax MR imaging provides the highest diagnostic contribution. In the mediastinum MR images demonstrate enlarged lymph nodes and tumor recurrences and is superior to CT especially when great vessels are involved. In the study of the operated hemithorax, MR imaging is preferable to CT to identify parietal lesions, because of its higher spatial resolution. Moreover, MR imaging allows tumor recurrences to be differentiated from normal muscular tissue and from fibrous tissue on the basis of their different signal intensities as observed on the various pulse sequences.
