Aortic aneurysm and stenosis are the most severe post-interventional complications after angioplasty of CoA and require regular follow-up. Twenty children (4 2/12-13 11/12 years old) underwent MRI within 3 months to 5 7/12 years after dilatation. All children were in a good state of health and showed no signs of heart failure. Three patients suffered from arterial hypertension; seven children showed hypertension on exertion. In six children, a resting gradient (minimal 20 mm Hg, maximal 40 mm Hg) between the upper and lower extremities could be measured. Four children showed pathological changes of the ascending aorta, three had a moderate ectasia, one had severe dilatation of more than 5 cm in diameter. In three cases, a circumscript aneurysm of the descending aorta was found. In many cases, there were mild changes in the aortic wall in the region of dilatation. In 12 children, there was a moderate spindly dilatation distal to the aortic isthmus, which, however, could be seen in the pre-dilatation angiography. After dilatation of CoA, several patients continue to have hypertension and pathological changes of the thoracic aorta. With regard to adequate therapy, regular controls are necessary. Besides routine examinations, MRI is an effective non invasive imaging method for the initial investigation and short-time follow-up evaluation of CoA.
