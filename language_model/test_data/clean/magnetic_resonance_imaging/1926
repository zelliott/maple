We report a complete imaging study of an exceptional developmental anomaly of the internal carotid artery in a 42-year-old man presenting with a few days history of left visual blurring. MRI and conventional angiography demonstrated unilateral cervical and petrous agenesis of the left internal carotid artery, with an intercavernous anastomosis. CT-scan revealed total absence of the bony carotid canal. We briefly review the embryological hypotheses and discuss clues to correct diagnosis.
