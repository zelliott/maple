In the diagnosis and treatment of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease, noninvasive methodologies for assessing myocardial perfusion have been invaluable. Clinically, nuclear techniques such as single photon emission tomography thallium and sestamibi have predominated. They are limited, however, by the radiation burden, relatively poor spatial resolution, and attenuation artifact caused by soft tissue. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is notable for its anatomic detail, sharp tissue contrast, excellent spatial and temporal resolution, versatility, and lack of ionizing radiation. It is therefore a potentially attractive alternative to nuclear imaging for the assessment of myocardial perfusion. This review summarizes the principles of MRI myocardial perfusion measurement, discusses recent clinical applications, and highlights future developments in the field.
