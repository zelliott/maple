Xanthoma formation is frequently seen over the subcutaneous tissue of extensor surfaces and tendons that have received minor trauma or friction in patients with hypercholesterolemia. However, temporal bone xanthomas with intracranial extension are uncommon. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the second report in the literature in which bilateral extension of a xanthoma is described. Xanthomas of the temporal bone are benign lesions, and complete or even partial removal is effective. The predisposing cause of the lesion should also be treated.
