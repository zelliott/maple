To demonstrate the efficacy of positron emission tomography (PET) for examining multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with hemianopia.

A 20-year-old man visited us with a complaint of left homonymous hemianopia and headache.

The patient's visual acuity was 1.2 (n.c.) OD and 0.9 (1.0) OS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass in the temporoparietal lobe. A pathological diagnosis of MS was made by brain biopsy. Low glucose metabolism in the lesion and visual cortex was observed by PET with (18)F-fluorodeoxy glucose. PET with (11)C-flumazenyl revealed a reduction of (11)C-uptake in the demyelinated optic radiation, and only a slight reduction of (11)C-uptake in the primary visual cortex. The results of (11)C-flumazenyl PET suggested a slight reduction of neuronal density. In 2 years, the visual field recovered to the normal state.

PET can be a useful tool for estimating the visual outcome of patients with hemianopia in MS.
