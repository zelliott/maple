Obesity is an epidemic in the United States and Western World with an associated increasing impact on radiology departments. The increased prevalence of obesity in conjunction with the growing use and success of bariatric surgery results in an influx of obese patients into the health system in need of hospital services and care. Imaging services in particular are in demand in this patient population. Obese patients place special needs upon facilities and imaging equipment and also create technical challenges. This manuscript will address problems and potential solutions for imaging obese patients, specifically with regards to the modalities of radiography, fluoroscopy, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.
