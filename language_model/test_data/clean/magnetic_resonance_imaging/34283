Magnetic resonance imaging has had a dramatic effect on the means by which we diagnose ligament injuries. Tears resulting from either acute trauma or overuse can be detected noninvasively, directing appropriate therapy be it conservative or surgical. For the elite athlete, earlier diagnosis leads to earlier intervention, or alternatively, a normal MRI examination can result in an earlier return to play. While MRI is accepted for the diagnosis of certain injuries such as complete tears of the cruciate ligaments of the knee, other injuries, such as partial cruciate ligament tears or tears of the intercarpal ligaments of the wrist, remain controversial.
