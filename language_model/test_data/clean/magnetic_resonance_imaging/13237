We retrospectively defined the rate and clinical features of tendon entrapment in 693 consecutive patients with 701 distal radius fractures treated in a single hospital. Eight extensor tendons and one flexor tendon were entrapped. All fractures with extensor tendon entrapment were palmarly displaced (Smith type) or epiphyseal. Flexor tendon entrapment was seen in dorsally angulated (Colles type) epiphyseal fracture. The rate of tendon entrapment in acute distal radius fractures was 1.3%. Extensor tendon entrapment in palmarly displaced fractures is more common.
