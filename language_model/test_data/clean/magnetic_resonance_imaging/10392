We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of an eight-row multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography (MDCT-CA) in detecting high-grade (>50%) stenoses in the three main coronary arteries in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Side branches were excluded. We correlated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the myocardium with MDCT-CA of the coronary arteries.

Fourteen CAD patients underwent conventional coronary angiography (CCA), MDCT-CA, and MRI. We determined the calcium burden with non-enhanced MDCT scan. Then MDCT-CA was performed after intravenous contrast injection during a single breathhold. The left ventricular (LV) MR cine imaging was assessed at rest and perfusion defects were observed during pharmacologic stress after contrast administration. Delayed contrast-enhanced MRI was performed to picture infarctions.

MDCT-CA had sensitivity 82%, specificity 94%, positive predictive value 79%, and negative predictive value 95% of stenoses of more than 50% in the main coronary arteries when compared with CCA. LV wall dysfunction, perfusion defects, and infarctions were detected in 50%-78% of sectors assigned to calcifications or stenoses, but also in sectors supplied by normally perfused coronary arteries.

CCA and MDCT-CA revealed comparable results in evaluating stenotic lesions above 50% in the main subepicardial coronary branches. There were no significant correlations between the degree of stenosis or calcification at MDCT-CA and the MR findings, but the combined information of MDCT-CA and MRI showed the variability of myocardial changes in regions perfused by significantly stenosed, calcified, and normal main coronary arteries.
