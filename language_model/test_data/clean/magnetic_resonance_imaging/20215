The aim of the study was to determine the neurodevelopmental outcome of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) in children who underwent double volume exchange transfusion (DVET). The 25 referred newborns of â‰¥ 35 weeks gestation with total serum bilirubin >20 mg dl(-1) and signs of ABE were enrolled and followed up at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Denver Development Screening Test (DDST), Neurological examination along with MRI at discharge and brain stem evoked response audiometry (BERA) at 3 months were done. Abnormal neurodevelopment was defined as either (i) cerebral palsy or (ii) abnormal DDST or (iii) abnormal BERA. The mean bilirubin at admission was 37 mg dl(-1). MRI and BERA were abnormal in 61% and 76%. At 1 year, DDST and neurological abnormality were seen in 60% and 27% and 80% had combined abnormal neurodevelopment. MRI had no relation (P = 0.183) but abnormal BERA had a significant association (P = 0.004) with abnormal outcome. Intermediate and advanced stages of ABE associated with significant adverse outcome in spite of DVET.
