Post-thoracotomy paraplegia after thoracic surgery is a catastrophic complication. We present one such case following resection of a benign posterior mediastinal tumour. Paraplegia was caused by spinal cord compression due to epidural migration of haemostatic agent i.e. bone wax through the spinal canal. Timely intervention leads to the successful outcome.
