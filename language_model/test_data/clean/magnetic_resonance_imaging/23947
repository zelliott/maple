Differential diagnosis of malignant and beign lymph nodes is still a problem in lymphographic imaging modalities. Plain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are inadequate for detecting metastases in normal-sized lymph nodes and for differentiating enlarged nodes. Therefore it is important to have a contrast agent that accumulates in healthy lymphatic tissue but does not accumulate in metastatic deposits.

The lymphographic contrast agent Gadofluorine 8 (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) is a lipophilic but water-soluble gadolinium complex. Lymphographic effects were investigated in guinea pigs, dogs, and tumor-bearing rabbits after interstitial (subcutaneous or intracutaneous) injection. MR imaging was performed using T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences until 120 min after administration.

After interstitial injection Gadofluorine 8 accumulates in regional lymph nodes, resulting in a pronounced increase in signal intensity in the lymph nodes. Differentiation between normal and metastatic lymph nodes was achieved.

Gadofluorine 8 is an innovative contrast agent that can distinguish between normal and tumorous lymph nodes in interstitial MR lymphography.
