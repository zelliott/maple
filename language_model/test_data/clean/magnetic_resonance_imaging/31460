The use of MRI for intervention and real-time imaging has seen many changes since its inception in the late 1980s. Initial interventional MRI researchers made great strides in building this new specialty, creating devices, sequences, and applications to push the field forward. More recently, researchers have gained more access to the systems themselves, and have taken advantage of this situation to create truly interactive interventional systems. Techniques such as fully interactive scan adjustments and device tracking can be accomplished in real time due to increased transparency between vendors and researchers. Additionally, pulse sequences have undergone an evolution as well, with the constant emergence of novel acquisition schemes to generate image contrast quickly, increase temporal resolution and cover k-space with nonrectilinear trajectories. We will look at both emerging system interface concepts and novel pulse sequences that we believe will continue to push innovation in the field of interventional MRI.
