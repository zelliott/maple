The aim of the present study was to determine the significance of different SEP techniques and parameters in clinical evaluation of cases of lumbar and cervical root lesions and stenosis of the spinal canal. Using a qualitative rating scale, 92 cases were analyzed retrospectively whose primary diagnosis was questioned because of conflicting data from clinical, neuroradiological and neurophysiological testing. In conclusion SEP techniques proved to be a useful tool in exclusing other e.g. demyelinating diseases. Except for the time-consuming method of segmental stimulation, the demonstration of the functional deficit itself by SEP techniques in general was frequently disappointing. The contribution of the different SEP parameters to clinical decision making and the clinical consequences are briefly discussed.
