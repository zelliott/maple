The Brugada syndrome is characterized by a distinct ECG pattern consisting of ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads and right bundle branch block, a propensity for life-threatening arrhythmias, and an apparently structurally normal heart. The authors describe the case of a patient with an aborted sudden cardiac death and the typical ECG signs of Brugada syndrome. Nevertheless, magnetic resonance imaging displayed signal enhancement in the left ventricular myocardium. Additionally, histologic examination, in-situ hybridization, and PCR revealed evidence of a locally restricted inflammation due to parvovirus B19. Brugada syndrome is regarded as a primary electrical disease due to dysfunction of distinctive ion channels, but focal myocarditis may serve as a trigger for ventricular arrhythmias in this patient. Further morphologic studies will be helpful to establish the possible role of structural changes in the pathophysiology of this syndrome.
