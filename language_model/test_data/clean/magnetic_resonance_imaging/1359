Evolving magnetic resonance (MR) procedures were utilized to validate one-dimensional ultrasonic (US) Doppler profiles in vivo on the basis of this alternative noninvasive method of assessing blood velocity. Corresponding velocity profiles were acquired by both US and MR in the abdominal aorta of 10 healthy volunteers. The ultrasound velocities recorded throughout a cardiac cycle along the anterio-posterior aortic diameter were compared to their spatial and temporal MR counterparts. Correlation coefficients ranging from 0.92 to 0.97 and regression slopes from 0.86 to 1.13 indicate a high degree of correspondence between the two modalities and increase the confidence in the fidelity of velocity profiles obtained with both procedures.
