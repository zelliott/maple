Examination with magnetic resonance imaging of 176 patients with multiple sclerosis showed that corpus callosum (CC) atrophy is common. The thinning of the CC depends on the extension of the coalescent periventricular white matter changes. A highly significant association was found between CC-atrophy and, the severity of organic mental disorder.
