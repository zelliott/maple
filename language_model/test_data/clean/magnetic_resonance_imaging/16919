A theoretical method for direct imaging of neural activity is presented here. It is based on a mechanism of random spin-lock along the magnetic field generated by active neurons. Lock conditions are fulfilled in a rotating frame whose properties are determined by the amplitude and frequency of neural field fluctuations. This technique can be implemented on scanners commonly used for blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging.
