The American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (AAOMR) has reviewed the implant imaging literature and issues this position paper for preoperative assessment of the dental implant site. The history of dental implant radiology and basic imaging principles are reviewed. An overview is presented of anatomically salient features in the maxilla and mandible germane to implant imaging, specifically to cross-sectional or transverse imaging for endosseous implants. All current modalities, including intraoral, panoramic, cephalometric, tomographic, and computed tomography, are discussed in light of the imaging data needed to select optimum implant solutions. After reviewing the current literature, the AAOMR recommends that some form of cross-sectional imaging be used for implant cases and that conventional cross-sectional tomography be the method of choice for gaining this information for most patients receiving implants.
