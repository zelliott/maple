Using fMRI, the relationship between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes during visual stimulation and the prevailing baseline global and regional flow levels was evaluated in 22 volunteers. The absolute increase in rCBF was not correlated with baseline rCBF values (r = 0.01, p = 0.8); however, the percentage change in rCBF showed a negative correlation (r=-0.78, p<0.001). Both absolute and relative changes in rCBF were independent of baseline global CBF values. These results indicate that caution should be exercised when comparing relative flow changes during focal brain activation, especially in functional neuroimaging studies dealing with altered baseline flow values.
