Magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) is a useful pre-operative investigation for patients with clinical signs and symptoms of femoroacetabular impingement. Our aim was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of MRA in detecting labral tears and chondral wear in this context. Sixty nine hips were included in the study after exclusions. All patients underwent pre-operative MRA and then subsequent hip arthroscopy. The findings at MRA were compared to those found intraoperatively. For labral tears, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 81%, 51% and 58% respectively. For chondral wear these figures were 17%, 100%, and 55% respectively. In our institution, MRA was therefore not as accurate as previously published work suggests.
