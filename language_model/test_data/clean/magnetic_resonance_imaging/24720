The effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on psychopathological symptoms and resting state brain activity was assessed in a patient with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). tDCS and rTMS had no effect on OC symptoms. tDCS, however, improved depression and anxiety. Functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline showed an interhemispheric asymmetry with hyperactivation of the left and hypoactivation of the right anterior neural circuits. A reduction of interhemispheric imbalance was detected after tDCS but not after rTMS. tDCS seems to be more effective than rTMS in restoring interhemispheric imbalance and improving anxiety and depression in OCD.
