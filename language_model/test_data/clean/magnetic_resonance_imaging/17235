Much of the interest in angiogenesis and hypoxia has led to investigating diagnostic imaging methodologies and developing efficacious agents against angiogenesis in gliomas. In many ways, because of the cytostatic effects of these agents on tumor growth and tumor-associated endothelial cells, the effects of therapy are not immediately evident. Hence finding clinically applicable imaging tools and pathologic surrogate markers is an important step in translating glioma biology to therapeutics. There are a variety of strategies in the approach to experimental therapeutics that target the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway, the endogenous antiangiogenic and proangiogenic factors and their receptors, adhesion molecules, matrix proteases and cytokines, and the existing vasculature. We discuss the rationale for antiangiogenesis as a treatment strategy, the preclinical and clinical assessment of antiangiogenic interventions and finally focus on the various treatment strategies, including combining antiangiogenic drugs with radiation and chemotherapy.
