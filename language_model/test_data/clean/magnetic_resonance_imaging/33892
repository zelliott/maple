An integrated computer aided design/computer aided manufacture system has been used to model the complex geometry of blood vessel anastomoses. Computer models are first constructed with key dimensions derived from radiological images of bypass grafts, and from casts of actual blood vessel anastomoses. Physical models are then fabricated in one of two ways: the surface geometry data can be used to control the movement of a three-axis milling machine; alternatively, the same data can be exported in a form that can be interpreted by a stereolithography apparatus. Both methods produce geometrically defined solid investments that can be used in a multistep casting process that yields high-quality physical models for vascular fluid dynamic studies. This technique is useful for parametric studies.
