Investments in diagnostic imaging in European countries range between 2.2 and 5.4 % of gross national product, a figure which, in view of new imaging modalities and increased radiological density, is considered to be wholly inadequate. Despite the fact that radiological examinations contribute more than laboratory tests and other diagnostic modalities to the final clinical diagnosis, and that MR is of increasing clinical relevance, economic constraints mean that the number of new MRI installations in Europe is decreasing relative to the situation elsewhere. The present article discusses the current state of radiological imaging in Europe with particular emphasis on present and expected future trends in MRI.
