A pulse sequence that enables simultaneous acquisition of T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated images is presented. This sequence is referred to as FASCINATE (Fluid-Attenuated Scan Combined with Interleaved Non-ATtEnuation). In this new technique, the inversion pulse of conventional fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is replaced with a fast spin echo (FSE) acquisition that has an additional 180(y)-90(x) pulse train for driven inversion. By using appropriate scan parameters, the first part of the sequence provides T2-weighted images and the second part provides fluid-attenuated images, thus allowing simultaneous acquisition in a single scan time comparable to that of fast FLAIR. FASCINATE was compared with conventional scanning techniques using a normal volunteer and a patient. A signal simulation was also conducted. In the human study, both T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated images from FASCINATE showed the same image quality as conventional images, suggesting the potential for this technique to replace the combination of fast FLAIR and T2-weighted FSE for scan time reduction.
