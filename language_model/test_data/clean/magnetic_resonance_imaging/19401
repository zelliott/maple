We report a case of a persistent cloaca and pseudoexstrophy associated with congenital pouch colon in a native-born American female child. This unusual anomaly occurs in two clinical settings. It has been reported in India as an isolated anomaly occurring primarily in males. Pouch colon also occurs in female patients with pseudoexstrophy or closed cloacal exstrophy. The typical anatomic features of this anomaly are discussed.
