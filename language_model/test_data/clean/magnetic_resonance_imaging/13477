A technique for spectroscopic imaging based on a new concept of dual encoding (i.e., both phase and frequency encoding) of position along the direction of the read-out gradient is proposed. The phase encoding is produced by changing the amplitude of the dephasing gradient as in conventional phase encoding. High-resolution spectroscopic images of a normal human thigh obtained by a 2.0 Tesla whole body MR imaging system are presented.
