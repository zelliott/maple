In hearing preservation surgery for the treatment of vestibular schwannoma (VS), one of the important factors is the determination of the origin of VS. In this study, we investigated the diagnostic significance of using an MRI obtained by the three-dimensional Fourier transform fast spin-echo technique (3D-reconstructed MRI) in order to determine the origin of VS. The subjects consisted of 20 patients with mainly intra-canalicular sized VS who underwent tumor removal at our hospital. The origin of VS was determined from the 3D-reconstructed MRI findings and the results of the caloric test. These findings were then compared with the surgical findings. In 15 out of 20 patients, the MRI findings closely corresponded to the surgical ones, while the origin of VS hardly could be detected when a tumor filled up to the fundus acoustics on the MRI findings of the axial sections. On the other hand, 6 out of 15 patients (40%) whose tumor originated from the inferior vestibular nerve showed canal paresis. In conclusion, 3D-reconstructed MRI is considered to be helpful in obtaining more precise information regarding the origin of VS compared to the caloric test.
