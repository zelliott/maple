The case of a 56-yr-old patient with polycythemia vera who was initially seen with jaundice is reported. Compression of the common bile duct by choledochal varices was found to be the cause of the obstructive jaundice. This compression was successfully treated with placement of a plastic endoprosthesis across the stenosis during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The significance of choledochal varices in the evaluation of obstructive jaundice is emphasized.
