Prepubertal boys' greater aerobic fitness (peak V O(2)) has been attributed to their larger lean body mass (LBM); this bestowing a greater heart size and consequent larger maximum cardiac output. No difference in peak arterio-venous (A-VO(2)) difference is thought to exist. However other work indicates that boys' aerobic fitness remains 5% higher even after controlling for differences in LBM. Consequently the purpose of this study was to investigate whether peak V O(2), heart size, peak cardiac output and peak A-VO(2) difference would be comparable between a group of boys and girls with a similar LBM. A group of 9 prepubertal boys and 9 prepubertal girls with a similar mean LBM (27.0+/-1.4 boys vs. 27.0+/-2.0 kg girls) were selected. Left ventricular mass (LVM) and end diastolic volume (LVEDV) were measured using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Peak V O(2) was determined on a cycle ergometer following an incremental exercise protocol to exhaustion, and cardiac output was recorded using thoracic bioimpedance. Boys' peak V O(2) (1.41+/-0.18 L min(-1) vs. 1.23+/-0.08 L min(-1)) and A-VO(2) difference (14.8+/-2.1 mL 100mL(-1) vs. 12.6+/-1.6 mL 100mL(-1)) were significantly (p<0.05) higher than girls' values, but there were no significant sex differences in peak cardiac output (10.0+/-1.4 L min(-1) vs. 9.9+/-1.40 L min(-1)), LVM (97+/-13g vs. 93+/-20g) or LVEDV (77+/-8 mL vs. 70+/-13 mL). Central factors of heart size and peak cardiac output are proportional to the LBM of the individual and sex independent. Sex differences in peripheral factors such as muscle fibre type profile, may affect A-VO(2) difference and underlie prepubertal boys' higher peak V O(2).
