Neurobiological models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) assume abnormalities in corticostriatal networks involving cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices, but the connectivity within these systems is rarely addressed in experimental imaging studies in this patient group. Using an established monetary reinforcement paradigm known to involve the cingulate cortex and the ventral striatum, the present study sought to test for altered corticostriatal coupling in OCD patients anticipating potential punishment. The anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), a region integrating negative emotion, pain, and cognitive control, was chosen as a seed region due to its particular relevance in OCD, representing the neurosurgical target for cingulotomy, and showing increased responses to errors in OCD patients. Results from psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that significantly altered, inverse coupling occurs between the aMCC and the ventral striatum when OCD patients anticipate potential punishment. This abnormality links the two major contemporary neurosurgical OCD target sites, and provides direct experimental evidence of altered corticostriatal connectivity in OCD. Noteworthy, an abnormal aMCC coupling with cortical areas outside of traditional corticostriatal circuitry was identified besides the alteration in the cingulostriatal pathway. In conclusion, these findings support the importance of applying connectivity methods to study corticostriatal networks in OCD, and favor the application of effective connectivity methods to study corticostriatal abnormalities in OCD patients performing tasks that involve symptom provocation and reinforcement learning.
