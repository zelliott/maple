Four children with choanal polyps are presented. Their age and/or the site of origin of the polyps are unusual. At the time of diagnosis, the two boys were respectively 3 years 9 months and 4 years 6 months. The two girls were aged 9 and 10. In one of the patients the polyp originated from the sphenoidal sinus, in another from the inferior turbinate. The age of the child complicates diagnosis, endoscopic sinus surgery and postoperative care.
