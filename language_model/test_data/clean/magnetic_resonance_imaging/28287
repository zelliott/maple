We report a patient with herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis (HSE) who showed abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals in the basal ganglia. The lesions were asymmetric and became apparent with relapse of the neurological symptoms, but they completely disappeared, concomitantly with improvement of the illness.
