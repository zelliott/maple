Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a proliferative disorder that affects synovium-lined joints, bursae, and tendon sheaths. It appears in both diffuse and localized forms, depending on the extent of synovial involvement. PVNS rarely involves the temporomandibular joint (TMJ); when it does, it manifests clinically as a slowly growing and painless preauricular mass that resembles a parotid tumor. TMJ dysfunction, paresthesia, and/or hearing loss can result. We present a case of a large extra-articular PVNS of the TMJ, and we review the literature.
