PHACE syndrome is a neuro-cutaneous syndrome characterized by malformations of the Posterior fossa, facial Hemangiomas, Arterial anomalies, Cardiac anomalies, and abnormalities of the Eye. The arterial abnormalities usually involve the cervical and cerebral vasculature and include congenital abnormalities and progressive cerebral vasculopathy. The progressive cerebral vasculopathy leads to increased risk for arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in patients with PHACE syndrome. Here we described the clinical neurological sequelae, the malformation of brain, the cervical and cerebral vasculopathy in a 23-year-old female of PHACE syndrome. Besides, she presented AIS with limb-shaking transient ischemic attack, a rare clinical presentation of AIS in patients of PHACE syndrome.
