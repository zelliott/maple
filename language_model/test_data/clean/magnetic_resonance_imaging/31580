Studies investigating the structure, neurophysiology and functional outcomes of white matter among type 1 diabetes patients have given conflicting results. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between type 1 diabetes and white matter hyperintensities.

We assessed white matter integrity (using magnetic resonance imaging), depressive symptoms and neuropsychological function in 114 type 1 diabetes patients and 58 age-matched non-diabetic controls.

Only Fazekas grade 1 and 2 white matter hyperintensities were found among 114 long-duration, relatively young diabetes patients; the severity of lesions did not differ substantially from 58 healthy controls. White matter hyperintensities were not associated with depressive history or with clinical characteristics of diabetes, including retinopathy, severe hypoglycaemia or glycaemia control.

Our data do not support an association between diabetes characteristics and white matter hyperintensities among relatively young type 1 diabetes participants.
