Isolated ischemia of the cervical spinal cord is an uncommon but increasingly recognized complication of vertebral artery dissection (VAD). The authors report a young patient with congenital afibrinogenemia, who developed VAD with extensive unilateral spinal cord infarction, probably caused by local compression of spinal radicular feeders at their origin by vertebral artery hematoma.
