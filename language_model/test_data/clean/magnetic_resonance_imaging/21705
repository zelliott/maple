The author reviews some important publications dealing with treatment of multiple sclerosis (m.s.) with the most commonly used immunosuppressive agents i.e. steroids and cyclophosphamide. He emphasises the methodology referring to group selection as well as placebo group and the way of the therapy results verification. The author concludes that many studies on the effective treatment with immunosuppressive agents are not sufficiently proved from the methodological point of view as well as the evaluation of the therapeutical effects in comparison with the placebo group is not convincing. The author appreciates the use of MRI in evaluation of the treatment effects. In the authors opinion the effectiveness of immunosuppressive therapy has not been so far sufficiently proved.
