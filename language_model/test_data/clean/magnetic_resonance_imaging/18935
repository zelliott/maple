The aim of the present paper was to assess the utility of Levovist in defining the pathology of liver masses. Levovist is a new ultrasound contrast agent consisting of galactose microparticles, air bubbles and palmitic acid. Prospective studies were performed in patients referred for further evaluation of known liver masses. Levovist was peripherally injected and colour Doppler ultrasound studies were performed. Findings were correlated with clinicopathology and three other imaging modalities: biphasic spiral CT, CT arterial portography and contrast MRI. Twenty-five patients were studied (15 male and 10 female) in the age range 25-74 years. Liver masses ranged from 0.5 to 7 cm in maximum diameter. Thirteen lesions were benign and 12 were malignant (four hepatomas (HCC) and eight metastases). Levovist enhancement occurred in 18 lesions. Of these, six were benign (four focal nodular hyperplasias (FNH) and two haemangiomas). All 12 malignant lesions demonstrated enhancement. The HCC showed a mosaic pattern of central and peripheral enhancement, and the FNH demonstrated a spoke-wheel pattern. It was not possible to distinguish between haemangiomas and malignant lesions. Non-enhancing lesions may well be benign, with all malignancies showing some enhancement. Characteristic enhancement patterns were found for HCC (mosaic) and FNH (spoke-wheel). It was not possible to distinguish between metastases and benign lesions (haemangiomas) when the pattern of enhancement was peripheral.
