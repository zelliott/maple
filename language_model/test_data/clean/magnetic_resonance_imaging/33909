Multifocal fibrosclerosis (MF) is a rare disease that may be misdiagnosed as Graves' orbitopathy. The combination of localisations of MF presented here has not been reported before.

A 44-year-old man was referred with progressive bilateral exophthalmos. CT of his chest and abdomen revealed an intrathoracic and retroperitoneal peri-aortal soft-tissue process with hydronephrosis. Histological examination of orbital masses showed a fibrous process with low inflammatory activity. Later the sella was found to be involved as well. A diagnosis of MF was made.

MF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bilateral exophthalmos.
