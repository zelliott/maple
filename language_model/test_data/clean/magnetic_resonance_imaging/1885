The ability to continuously acquire simultaneous EEG and fMRI data during seizures presents a formidable challenge both clinically and technically. Published ictal fMRI reports have so far been unable to benefit from simultaneous electrographic recordings and remain largely assumptive. Unique findings from a Continuous EEG-correlated fMRI experiment are presented in which a focal subclinical seizure was captured in its entirety. For the first time dynamic and biphasic Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal changes are shown using statistical parametric mapping time-locked to the ictal EEG activity localizing seizure generation and propagation sites, with millimeter resolution, to electroclinically concordant gray matter structures. Though presently of limited clinical applicability, a new avenue is opened for further research.
