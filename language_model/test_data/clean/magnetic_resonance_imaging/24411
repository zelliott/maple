In the past 12 years, during the process of imaging congenital heart disease (CHD), Asian doctors have not only made every effort to adhere to established magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols as in Western countries, but also have developed Computed tomography (CT) as an alternative problem-solving technique. Databases have shown that Asian doctors were more inclined to utilize CT than MRI in evaluating CHD. Articles in the literature focusing on CT have been cited more frequently than articles on MRI. Additionally, several repeatedly cited CT articles have become seminal papers in this field. The database reflects a trend suggesting that Asian doctors actively adapt to new techniques and flexibly develop unique strategies to overcome limitations caused by the relatively limited resources often available to them.
