Detection of focal liver nodules in patients with cirrhosis continues to be a radiologic challenge despite progressive advances in liver imaging in the past 2 decades. Patients with hepatic cirrhosis have a high predisposition to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the early detection and diagnosis of this tumor is very important because the most effective treatment is surgical resection, transplantation, or local ablation therapy when the tumor is small. Cirrhotic livers are mainly composed of fibrosis, together with a broad spectrum of focal nodular lesions ranging from regenerative nodules to premalignant dysplastic nodules to overt HCC. Awareness of such lesions and interpretation of imaging studies in these patients requires a critical review to detect subtle tumors, and a thorough understanding of the imaging appearance of the malignant and benign masses that can occur in the cirrhotic liver. Although the recent advances in liver imaging techniques, especially computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR), have facilitated the detection and characterization of focal liver nodules in cirrhotic patients, discriminating between HCC and precancerous nodules remains problematic with all available imaging techniques. Nevertheless, MR imaging appears to have more potential than other imaging techniques in the study of cirrhotic patients and MR may be more appropriate than the other imaging modalities for the detection of small HCCs. In this article we review the imaging characteristics of nodular focal lesions that arise in cirrhotic livers, with special attention to MR imaging features.
