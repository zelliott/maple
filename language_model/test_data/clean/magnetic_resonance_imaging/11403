To describe the potential complication of intracranial abscess in the setting of orbital abscess.

We retrospectively reviewed case reports and the literature. Three patients were found to have pansinusitis progressing to subperiosteal abscess of the orbit and subsequent intracranial abscess.

Three patients, ages 14, 26, and 57 years, with concurrent pansinusitis, subperiosteal abscess of the orbit, and intracranial abscess were treated with intravenous antibiotics and surgical drainage of the orbital abscess and sinuses. Two of the three patients required drainage of the intracranial abscess.

Although rare, intracranial abscess is a life-threatening complication of orbital abscess. It requires aggressive intervention by a multidisciplinary team.
