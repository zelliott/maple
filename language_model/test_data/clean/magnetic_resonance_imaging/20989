Acute myocarditis is one of the less common extra-intestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). It may reveal IBD or occur during the follow-up.

We report two patients who presented an acute myocarditis associated with ulcerative colitis that reveal the disease in one of them. Clinical features at presentation were non specific and both patients presented with chest pain. Diagnosis was obtained with cardiac MRI. Outcome was favourable in the two patients.

Etiologies of myocarditis are various and the diagnosis of extra-intestinal manifestations related to IBD remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Cardiac MRI is an important diagnostic tool. Colchicine and ac√©tylsalicylic acid are commonly prescribed in a first therapeutic approach.
