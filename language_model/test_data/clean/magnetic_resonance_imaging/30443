The authors report a case of bilateral division of the carpal scaphoid in a 36-year-old man. In the right wrist, all the clinical and radiological signs suggested a bipartite scaphoid, but in the left wrist the presence of pain and pan-radial osteoarthritis rather suggested a pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid. This raises the possibility of osteoarthritis occurring overtime in a bipartite carpal scaphoid.
