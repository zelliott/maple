For optimizing MR imaging of the joints, a sophisticated knowledge of MR system hard- and software conditions and coil technologies, sequence and contrast preparation techniques, and the use of paramagnetic contrast agents is necessary. This review article discusses the basic principles of the appropriate use of surface coils as well as the different conventional and fast imaging sequences, including three-dimensional (3D) MR imaging. In addition, the applications of contrast agents as well as the most important contrast preparation techniques are reviewed.
