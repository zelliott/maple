Charcot neuroarthropathy is a devastating consequence of diabetes, requiring early identification and immediate management. A differentiation should be made from osteomyelitis and other pathologies. The authors describe a case of Charcot foot with radiological findings of complete fragmentation of the calcaneum. Further investigation with magnetic resonance and white cell-labeled imaging revealed osteomyelitis. Below-knee amputation was the only therapeutic option in this hindfoot collapse complicated with osteomyelitis.
