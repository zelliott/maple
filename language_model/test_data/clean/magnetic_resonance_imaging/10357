Kluver-Bucy syndrome is a rare neurobehavioral condition characterized by visual agnosia, excessive oral tendencies, hypermetamorphosis, placidity, altered sexual behavior, and changes in dietary habits. This description of a 14-year-old boy presenting with complete Kluver-Bucy syndrome after Mycoplasma pneumoniae bronchitis is the first such case report. MRI revealed left temporal horn dilation and asymmetry of both temporal lobes. We hypothesize that the pathophysiology of our case is immune-mediated damage by M. pneumoniae resulting in vasculopathy.
