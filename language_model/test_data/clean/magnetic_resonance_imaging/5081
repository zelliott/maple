Epileptic myoclonus is generally treated by valproate monotherapy, and this therapy has confirmed efficacy. However, almost 30% of patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) are valproate-resistant.

A 23-year-old man with a diagnosis of JME had resistance to multiple antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Stepwise synchronization of bilateral spikes on electroencephalography (EEG) was found shortly before the clinical myoclonus. The anterior two thirds of the corpus callosum were divided. Desynchronization of spikes by the corpus callosotomy arrested the patient's myoclonus.

Interhemispheric recruitment of epileptic spikes through the corpus callosum may induce synchronization of spikes and myoclonus.
