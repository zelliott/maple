Malignant lymphoma is the second-most common malignancy in the head and neck region. Waldeyer's ring is the most common site of extranodal Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in that region, and a small percentage of primary extranodal NHL occurs in the oral cavity. The most common sites of extranodal NHL in the oral region are the palate and maxilla, and nearly half of extranodal NHL cases arise from bone. It is difficult to diagnose extranodal NHL because of the variety of its radiological features. We report a case of primary extranodal NHL of the maxilla in a 68-year-old female patient with atypical imaging findings, along with the results of analysis of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
