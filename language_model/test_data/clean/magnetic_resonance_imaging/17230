Hemodialysis has considerably prolonged the life of patients suffering from terminal renal failure. However, long-term hemodialysis leads to new bone complications and spinal disorders such as destructive spondyloarthropathy (DSA). At the present time DSA is reported in 8% to 18% of the dialysed patients. Diagnosis is based on severe narrowing of the intervertebral disk, erosions and geodes of the adjacent vertebral plates simulating infectious spondylitis. Lesions progressively involve posterior joints and may lead to severe destruction of the spine. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is still unknown. Several factors have been implicated, including microcrystal deposition, amyloidosis, inflammatory and foreign body reactions and suggest that the pathogenesis of erosive spondyloarthropathies of hemodialysed patients is multifactorial. Spinal instability inducing myelopathy and radiculopathy were observed in 8% of the cases. Treatment must be accorded to the natural disease course and to the quality of the bone. We report the case of a chronic dialysed patient with destructive spondyloarthropathy involving the cervical and thoracic spine. Pathogenesis, radiological datas and therapeutic approach are discussed.
