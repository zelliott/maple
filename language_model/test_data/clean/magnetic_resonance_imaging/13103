It has been suggested, based on rodent studies, that levodopa (L-dopa) induced dyskinesia is associated with a disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB). We have investigated BBB integrity with in vivo neuroimaging techniques in six 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) lesioned primates exhibiting L-dopa-induced dyskinesia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed before and after injection of Gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) revealed an intact BBB in the basal ganglia showing that l-dopa-induced dyskinesia is not associated with a disrupted BBB in this model.
