To date there are potential chronology-based but not conclusive reasons to believe that at least some of the gadolinium complexes play a causative role in the pathophysiology of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) or nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD). Still, the exact pathogenesis and the risk for patients is unclear beside the obvious connection to moderate to severe renal insufficiency. So far, MR imaging with Gd-enhancement was regarded as the safest imaging modality in these patients--the recent development creates tremendous uncertainty in the MR-community. Nevertheless, one should remember that, despite the over 200 cases of NSF and about 100 with proven involvement of Gd(3+), the vast majority of over 200 million patients exposed to gadolinium since the 1980s have tolerated these agents well. Importantly, NSF is a rare disease and does not appear to occur in patients without renal impairment. Many patients and researchers have undergone MR investigations with Gd exposure in the past. For those, it is essential to know about the safety of the agents at normal renal function. We can hope that pharmacoepidemiological and preclinical studies will allow us to better understand the pathophysiology and role of the various MR contrast agents in the near future.
