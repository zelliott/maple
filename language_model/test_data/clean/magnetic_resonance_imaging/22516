A 32-year-old female patient underwent surgical synovectomy in the right distal radioulnar joint because of local recurrence of pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) after previous surgery. 7 weeks after her second surgery she received fractionated radiation therapy (RT) to a total dose of 36.0 Gy given in five weekly fractions of 2.0 Gy. Apart from a mild skin erythema the patient had no early morbidity related to the use of RT. After a follow-up of 36 months no local recurrence was detected.

In accordance with literature data the hitherto course of the presented case corroborates that RT is a safe and effective treatment option for the prevention of PVNS recurrence.
