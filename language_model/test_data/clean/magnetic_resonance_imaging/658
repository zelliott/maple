We report 12 cases of transient osteoporosis in 10 patients. The presenting symptoms, diagnostic investigations and management are considered here as well as a discussion on the aetiology and the pathology. Arthroscopic surgery was carried out in some of the patients to exclude intraarticular pathology. Resolution of symptoms occurred in all patients within 6 months and the MRI findings returned to normal.
