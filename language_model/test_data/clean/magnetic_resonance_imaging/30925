S100B protein plays a role in promoting the maturation of a variety of neurons in many different CNS regions. Behavioral dysfunction in S100B over-expressed transgenic mice and the chronic elevation of S100B in Down's syndrome and in schizophrenia suggest that S100B over-expression is related to abnormal brain function. Therefore, we believed that the over-expression of S100B protein might be implicated in developmental brain dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the serum S100B protein levels in patients with developmental brain dysfunction, such as cerebral palsy and delayed development, and to determine the clinical relevance of serum S100B protein in these patients. The mean values of serum S100B protein were significantly increased in both conditions. Patients with cerebral palsy had a S100B protein level of 3455.8 +/- 5004.6 ng/L and those with delayed development of 2557.0 +/- 2321.0 ng/L, compared with a normal control level of 583.8 +/- 483.0 ng/L (P < 0.05). The over-expression of S100B (defined as the normal mean plus three standard deviations) was found in 47.1% of the total patient group (delayed development (47.5%) and cerebral palsy (47.0%)). The frequency of over-expression was not significantly related to clinical diagnosis, disease severity or to brain MRI findings. However, patients who had periventricular leukomalacia by brain MRI showed a wide range and very high levels of S100B exceeding 10,000 ng/L in some cases. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis implied by the over-expression of S100B protein during brain development may play a role in developmental brain dysfunction.
