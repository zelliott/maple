It is well known that giant cell tumours of the bone rarely occur below the age of 20 years. Many radiologists and orthopaedicians do not even consider giant cell tumours as a differential diagnosis from a lytic lesion before epiphyseal closure. This is a rare case report of a 14-year-old girl with proven giant cell tumour of the epiphysis of the distal femur.
