To evaluate MR imaging of the hip in patients with a clinically suspected impacted fracture of the femoral neck in cases where conventional plain films show negative or equivocal findings.

Twenty-seven such patients were prospectively examined by MR imaging with a 1.0 T unit, within 24 hours of admittance to hospital. A coronal T1-weighted turbo spin-echo sequence (n = 27), and a coronal STIR sequence (n = 25) or a coronal T2-weighted turbo spin-echo fat saturation sequence (n = 2) were used. The evaluations were made by 2 radiologists with experience in musculoskeletal radiology.

There were 6 patients with a pertrochanteric fracture, 2 without and 4 with slight displacement. Five patients had an impacted fracture of the femoral neck, and 3 had a fracture of the superior pubic bone. Of 2 patients with advanced arthrosis, 1 had an impacted femoral neck fracture and the other a nondisplaced intertrochanteric fracture. There was 1 patient who had sustained a nondisplaced acetabular fracture with increased joint fluid and muscle contusions. Three patients had muscle contusions only. Two patients had bone marrow contusions only, while 2 others with advanced coxarthrosis had increased joint fluid only. Three patients showed normal findings. Our findings led to emergency surgery in 13 cases, and conservative measures directed to the specific MR findings in 14 patients.

MR imaging should be the first modality of choice in examining patients with a clinically suspected impacted fracture of the femoral neck where conventional films show negative or equivocal findings.
