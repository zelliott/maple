The occurrence of tremor after thalamic lesions is well known. Delayed rubral tremor secondary to bilateral thalamic infarction is a rare finding and has not been reported previously in childhood. We present two children with a combined resting-postural-kinetic tremor caused by bithalamic infarction. The first child was a male 14 months of age, and the second was a male 9 years of age. These children come from unrelated families. On hospital admission of the first patient, generalized seizures and routine electroencephalogram (EEG) findings with diffuse spike-wave discharges predominantly over the left frontal area were clinically observed, leading to the initial diagnosis of epilepsia partialis continua. However, clinical observation and video-EEG monitoring of the movements revealed nonepileptiform accompaniments, favoring the diagnosis of rubral tremor. In the second patient, EEG revealed no paroxysmal activity and was within normal limits for age. In both patients, cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed ischemic lesions in thalami bilaterally but failed to reveal any mesencephalic lesion. These patients demonstrate that thalamic infarction can cause rubral tremor in childhood.
