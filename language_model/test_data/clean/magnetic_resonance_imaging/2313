We describe the case of a man with intrahepatic arterioportal fistulae located in the left lobe, whose left lateral segment was transplanted into his son who was suffering from severe acute hepatitis B.

A male infant with severe acute hepatitis B was considered to be a candidate for liver transplantation. The father was willing to be the donor. Preoperative evaluation of the donor revealed intrahepatic arterioportal fistulae, however, duplex ultrasonography showed normograde portal blood flow. A living-related liver transplantation was performed.

The postoperative course for both the donor and recipient was uneventful. The recipient is free of recurrent hepatitis B and has normograde portal blood flow.

The present case suggests that there may be a symptomless population with intrahepatic arterioportal fistulae, which cause various degrees of disruption of the portal blood flow. Duplex ultrasonography might be helpful in the evaluation of candidates for liver donation.
