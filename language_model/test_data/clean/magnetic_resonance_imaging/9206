There is still a paucity of information about the clinical presentation, treatment and imaging findings of latissimus muscle tears. Only one study has specifically described the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of latissimus tendon tears. We describe a case of a high-grade tear in the latissimus muscle tendon in an active water skier with no significant prior medical history. MRI demonstrated at least a 50% tear of the latissimus tendon, manifesting as increased signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences and surrounding edema, as well as a diminutive tendon at the humeral insertion.
