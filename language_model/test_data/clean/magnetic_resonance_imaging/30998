Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is an immune-mediated demyelinating disorder usually encountered in children or adolescents and characterized by multifocal neurologic deficits of rapid onset. It is often preceded by various infectious diseases or vaccination, but acute disseminated encephalomyelitis developing after hepatitis A virus infection is rare. We present such a case in a 9-year-old patient who illustrates the importance of considering acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in patients who develop multifocal neurologic signs after hepatitis A virus infection. We suggest that patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis be screened for hepatitis A virus because of the occurrence of asymptomatic hepatitis A virus infection.
