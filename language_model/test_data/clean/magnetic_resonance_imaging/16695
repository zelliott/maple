Malignant metastases to the heart and pericardium, which occur far more often than do primary cardiac neoplasms, typically lead to fatal outcomes. The phyllodes tumor is a rare, predominantly benign fibroepithelial breast neoplasm with variable malignancy potential. Herein, we describe the case of a 35-year-old woman who, 3 years after undergoing a simple mastectomy for a rapidly enlarging breast neoplasm, presented with cardiogenic shock and was found to have a large right ventricular tumor that obstructed the right ventricular outflow tract. Despite successful resection of the ventricular mass and a right atrial mass of organized thrombus, the patient died 8 days postoperatively of multiorgan failure due to severe right ventricular dysfunction. Histopathologic analysis determined that the right ventricular mass was a malignant, metastatic phyllodes tumor. To our knowledge, this is only the 2nd reported case of a phyllodes tumor that metastasized to the heart and presented as an intracavitary mass with cardiogenic shock. In addition to discussing our patient's case, we review the pertinent medical literature.
