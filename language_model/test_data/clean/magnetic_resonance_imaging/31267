Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is today the most popular method to assess perfusion in the body. Unfortunately, the technique is mostly used to determine semiquantitative parameters like time to peak enhancement. Perfusion quantification remains challenging using DCE-MRI. The method suffers from two major limitations. First, no standardized imaging technique is available. Secondly, no standard evaluation technique for perfusion quantification has been established which accurately describes the tracer kinetics of available contrast agents. Different imaging techniques using spoiled gradient echo sequences and the basics of the evaluation are presented. To assess perfusion changes due to hyperthermia using DCE-MRI one has to take into account the systematic variation of the arterial input function required for perfusion quantification. Hyperthermia modifies the contrast agent bolus in that a shorter and more highly concentrated bolus appears earlier in the tissue.
