Avulsion of the distal biceps tendon is a clear indication of operative therapy. Different techniques have been described. From 10/97 till 4/02 we have treated 25 patients with avulsion of the distal biceps tendon by anatomic reinsertion at the radial tuberosity with suture anchors by using a limited anterior approach. 24 patients underwent a clinical follow-up of at least 3 months, the average follow-up was 15.8 months. All patients were men with a mean age of 46 years (32-64 years). Surgery was performed within 9 days (1-28 days) after trauma. No wound healing complication was observed. 2-3 suture anchors have been used in each patient. After 3 months, most patients reached a free range of motion and full strength with unlimited recreational and professional activity. In three cases (12.5 %) a heterotopic ossification occurred, two of them (8.3 %) underwent surgical revision. In one case (4.2 %) we observed a rerupture after 6 weeks. 6 patients (12.5 %) described an intermittent disturbance of sensitivity in their radial forearm, in two cases (8.3 %) the lack of sensitivity persisted. Each patient would choose the same procedure in case of injury.
