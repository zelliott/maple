Vertebral involvement is a common complication of brucellosis in adults. However psoas abscess related to brucellar spondylitis have rarely reported. The purpose of this report is to describe three cases of bilateral psoas abscess identified during workup for brucellar spondylitis. Medical imaging was helpful in confirming diagnosis of these fluid collections. Epidemiological, clinical, radiological and serological findings were consistent with melitococcal etiology. Treatment was based on a combination of antibiotics (rifampicine-doxycycline) and abscess evacuation by percutaneous drainage, needle aspiration or open surgery. Outcome was favourable. Brucellar psoas abscess is uncommon. Most caseare discovered coincidentally during investigation of melitococcal spondylitis. Management usually consists of fluid drainage and appropriate antibrucellar therapy. Prognosis is favourable.
