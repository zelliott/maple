A 25-year-old woman presented at 12 weeks gestation, with symptoms and laboratory investigations consistent with pheochromocytoma. Imaging modalities available during pregnancy were limited and MRI scan of the abdomen and the neck failed to localise the tumour. Postpartum imaging, including 131-metaiodobenzylguanidine and octreotide scans, cardiac CT, cardiac MRI and cardiac catheterisation, allowed accurate localisation of the tumour and helped plan for successful surgical removal.
