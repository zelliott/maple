A study was conducted to determine the possibility of evaluating the blood flow in cases of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by employing dynamic MRI with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SH U 555 A), which can be rapidly injected via an intravenous route.

Six patients with hypervascular HCC (23 nodules) served as the subjects. Dynamic MRI includes images obtained at precontrast and at 10 (perfusion phase), 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 600 s after the start of injection of SH U 555 A. CT hepatic arteriography (CTHA) and CT during arterial portography (CTAP) were used as the standards of reference, and these were performed in all patients three days after dynamic MRI. The signal changes were evaluated at each phase, especially at the perfusion phase from the viewpoints of a lesion-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and visual examination.

A total of 23 hypervascular HCC were detected on CTHA and CTAP. Of the 23 lesions, 17 were detected on SH U 555 A enhanced MRI. Incorrect timing during acquisition of the perfusion phase was considered in two cases with three lesions. Of 14 lesions, excluding two cases with incorrect timing, a reduction in the transient signal in the lesions at the perfusion phase was visually recognized in 10 lesions (71%). Significant differences were seen in tumor size between visible and non-visible tumors involving transient signal reduction (p< 0.05). CNR gradually increased after rapidly decreasing in the perfusion phase.

SH U 555 A enhanced MRI is valuable in limited cases. Evaluation of tumor blood flow employing dynamic MRI with SH U 555 A is affected by tumor size and requires optimal timing of the perfusion phase.
