Cysticercosis is the most common parasitic infection of the central nervous system. Cysticercosis infrequently affects the spine, but when it does, it can present with symptoms similar to other more common spinal diseases. Here, the authors report a case of disseminated cysticercosis, with simultaneous involvement of brain and the spinal cord. Initially, the patient was misdiagnosed as tuberculoma on the basis of cerebrospinal fluid examination and CT scan of brain and was being treated with antitubercular therapy. Later on the patient developed quadriparesis which was investigated and diagnosed to be disseminated neurocysticercosis.
