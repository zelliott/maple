The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of femoral marrow MR imaging as predictor of outcome for hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in beta-thalassemia major. MR imaging of the proximal femur, including T1- and T2-weighted spin echo and short-tau inversion recovery and in-phase and out-of-phase fast field echo images, was prospectively performed in 27 thalassemia major patients being prepared for HSCT. The area of red marrow and its percentage of the proximal femur were measured, and the presence of marrow hemosiderosis was assessed. Age-adjusted multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between red marrow area percentage and marrow hemosiderosis and HSCT outcome. Red area percentage were less in patients with successful (90.25 +/- 4.14%) compared to unsuccessful transplants (94.54% +/- 2.93%; p = 0.01). Red marrow area percentage correlated positively with duration of symptoms(r = 0.428, p = 0.026) and serum ferritin (r = 0.511, p = 0.006). In multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analyses, red marrow area percentage was significantly inversely associated with successful HSCT (OR = 1.383, 95% CI: 1.059-1.805, p = 0.005). Marrow hemosidersosis and duration of sympotms and serum ferritin were not associated with HSCT outcome(p = 0.174, 0.974, 0.762, respectively). Red marrow area percentage of proximal femur on MR imaging is a useful predictor of HSCT outcome.
