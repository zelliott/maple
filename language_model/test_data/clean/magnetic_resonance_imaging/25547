Congenital cavernous angioma is a very rare tumor that occurs in young adolescents. We describe a rare case of congenital cavernous angioma of the temporal bone in a neonate. Ultrasonography (US) and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were helpful in its diagnosis.

US and MRI of the fetus in the 32nd week of gestation revealed a large extra-axial tumor with intra- and extracranial extension. After the birth, US and dynamic MRI studies were performed in addition to conventional CT and MRI. These findings were compatible with cavernous angioma. The mass was totally removed on the fourth day of life and was found at surgery to originate from the skull. Histopathological diagnosis was cavernous angioma. The usefulness of US and dynamic MRI are also discussed.

US and dynamic MRI are useful, less invasive techniques for diagnosing this rare type of tumor. They provide useful information to differentiate calvarial mass lesions in neonates.
