This work deals with dynamic anatomy of human body explored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recent development of MRI pulse sequences allow very fast data acquisition. Using an 1,5 Tesla system (General Electric--CGR, Signa), different body segments have been explored, in two different ways. The first approach consisted in a cinematographic display of anatomical sections of an articulation obtained in different positions. The result shows the movement of the articulation. The second approach consisted in the examination of a single slice several times, with cardiac synchronization ("gating"). the result is the evaluation of phase desynchronization, measuring the flow directions and the velocity of circulating fluids. The results are shown as a video tape with commentary. It starts with the joints: the ankle, the knee, the wrist, the hand, the cervical spine, de cervico-occipital junction, the temporo protrusion during deglutition and the ocular movements (normal and pathological), according to different planes, are successively proposed. Finally, flow kinetics are shown: cardiac movements and supra-aortic arterial flow, the intracranial cerebro-spinal fluid circulation, in normal and pathologic (intra-cranial hypertension) cases. The exposition is concluded by showing a work in progress on urine flow during micturition.
