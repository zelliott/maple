A 57-year-old male was urgently carried to our hospital because of sudden loss of consciousness, lasting about 10 minutes. He had resumed consciousness before he arrived at our hospital. Neurologically, he had mild muscle weakness of the right arm. Deep tendon reflexes in the right upper extremity were reduced. In high level functions, speech disturbance, dysgraphia (disturbed ability to write Hiragana), and constructive apraxia were noted. A brain MRI upon admission showed a poorly demarcated, high signal intensity area in the cortical and subcortical layers of the left temporal and parietal lobes. This was visible on T 2 weighted images(T 2 WI), although no abnormalities were visible on T 1 weighted images(T 1 WI). No contrast enhancement was effected by Gd-DTPA. The patient was therefore suspected of having a tumor or degenerative disease and was monitored closely. About 4 months later after onset, his symptoms became aggravated, and brain MRI disclosed a marked low signal intensity area on T 1 WI and a heterogeneous high signal intensity area on T 2 WI. The abnormal signal intensity area was surrounded by extensive edema and mass effect. Ring-shaped, irregular, contrast enhanced areas were also visible. Cerebral angiography revealed a poorly demarcated tumor stain in the area supplied by the middle cerebral artery. The tumor was removed surgically and was histopathologically rated as glioblastoma multiforme(GBM). Because this case represents a valuable example of early stage of GBM, it will be discussed in this paper, along with differential diagnoses.
