Traumatic pontine and cerebellar damage originating from ocular injury has been documented in the past; however, no report has been made about an orbital trauma causing injury to the pons and cerebellum with associated neurological symptoms while leaving the globe, visual pathway, and ocular controls intact.

Chart review of a single case of a traumatic antenna injury.

A traumatic antenna injury that penetrated the orbit and injured the pons and cerebellum without involving the visual pathway and its controls.

Pontine and cerebellar injury can occur from trauma that originated in the orbit and traveled posteriorly through the cranium without causing any overt damage to ocular structures but still causing other associated neurological problems.
