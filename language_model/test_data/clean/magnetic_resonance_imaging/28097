Using a 1.5 T MR imaging unit, T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained before and after i.v. administration of chondroitin sulfate iron colloid (CSIC) in order to differentiate hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 20) from adenomatous hyperplasia without atypia (n = 16). Differentiation was made from the tumor-liver contrast to noise ratio (CNR) and visual evaluation of the nodule, with reference to signal intensity relative to that of the surrounding liver. The CNR of adenomatous hyperplasia was on T1-weighted images significantly decreased after CSIC administration (p < 0.01). On T2-weighted images, there was no significant difference in CNR after CSIC administration. On the other hand, the CNR of hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly increased after CSIC administration on both T1- and T2-weighted images (p < 0.01). CSIC reflects intratumor reticuloendothelial cellular functions, and is therefore useful in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma from adenomatous hyperplasia without atypia.
