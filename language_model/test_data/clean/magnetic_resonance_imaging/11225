Ovarian metastases represent 10% of all ovarian malignancies. They are characterized by their ability to occasionally reproduce mimicking the clinical and morphological appearance of primary tumours, making diagnosis difficult. Most of these tumours originate in the digestive tract, the best known being Krukenberg's tumour in the stomach. Cholangiocarcinomas are rare neoplasias that very rarely affect the ovary. Their retroperitoneal location and low histological specificity in the ovary may lead to a misdiagnosis. This makes it necessary to accurately assess all clinical, radiological and morphological symptoms so as to avoid inappropriate treatments in affected patients.

Two cases of biliary cholangiocarcinomas simulating an ovarian neoplasia are reported.
