Neuroanatomical and electrophysiological studies of albino visual pathways have demonstrated that retinogeniculate axons arising from the temporal retina decussate abnormally in the optic chiasm to synapse in the contralateral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Anomalies in the LGN secondarily disrupt normal geniculo-cortical and interhemispheric cortico-cortical (callosal) visual connections. It is not known whether retinogeniculate misrouting affects the size or configuration of the afferent visual pathways in human albinos. We used T1-weighted coronal and sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the prechiasmatic intracranial optic nerves, optic chiasm, and corpus callosum in 10 human albinos. In all subjects, these structures were normal in size and configuration. Despite the complex cascade of aberrant central neuronal connections, the human albino visual pathways and their interhemispheric connections appear normal in size and configuration when viewed with MRI.
