The paper gives a detailed characterization and describes the importance of instrumental methods for examination of patients in the diagnosis of thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Provides a differentiated protocol of the examination of patients as dependent on the clinical course, disease stage and nemodynamic stability of the patient's status. Delineates the tactics of the examination of patients with acute and chronic dissection of the proximal and distal segments of the aorta as dependent on hemodynamic stability. Emphasis is laid on the key role of computed tomography and magnetic resonance tomography in the diagnosis of aortic aneurysms.
