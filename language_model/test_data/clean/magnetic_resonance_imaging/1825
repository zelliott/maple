To report a rare case of cervical cord injury caused by spinal manipulation in a Chinese patient.

A 46-year-old man suffered from acute tetraplegia immediately after spinal manipulation by a bonesetter. There was nothing abnormal in the plain X-ray but Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of his cervical spine demonstrated cervical cord oedema at the level of C1/2.

The patient was treated with high doses of methylprednisolone. Coupled with intensive rehabilitation, the patient made a nearly complete recovery 6 months after injury. Repeated MRI demonstrated syrinx formation at the previous location of cervical cord oedema.

Spinal manipulation may cause cervical cord injury. MRI is useful in the documentation of this injury and exclusion of other pathology.
