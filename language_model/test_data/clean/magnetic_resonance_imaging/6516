This is a case report of a unique presentation of a mild form of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) (type IA) in a 9-year-old African-American boy who presented with simultaneous bilateral tibial tubercle avulsion fractures. The boy presented to the authors' emergency room complaining of acute bilateral knee pain. He could not perform a straight leg raise. Other than his orthopaedic examination, significant findings included blue sclera and irregular teeth. Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed bilateral tibia tubercle avulsion fractures. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his fractures, and postoperative genetic testing confirmed that the patient was heterozygous for OI. The authors present the fourth reported case of simultaneous bilateral tibial tubercle fractures. To their knowledge this is the first case of OI presenting with these fractures, the youngest reported case, and the first case with MRI documentation.
