A Navy helicopter pilot was found to have a suprasellar mass during evaluation for primary infertility and mildly elevated prolactin level. Extensive evaluation revealed no other abnormalities. After 1 year of followup without radiographic tumor enlargement, he was returned to flying duties with continuing medical monitoring. Aeromedical considerations for tumors in the juxtasellar region are reviewed, including neuroendocrine disorders, neuro-ophthalmologic defects, and neurological impairment. The impact of improved diagnostic capabilities on aeromedical disposition is discussed.
