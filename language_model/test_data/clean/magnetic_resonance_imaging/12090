Magnetic resonance imaging (MR) has been shown to be valuable in defining cardiac anatomy in a variety of cardiac abnormalities. The article describes the technique and results of MR in 32 children with congenital heart disease. MR clearly depicts the anatomy of the great vessels, and may be used for the evaluation of palliative systemic-pulmonary artery shunts. In postoperative controls, MR may replace or postpone angio-cardiography. MR is also a promising technique for the evaluation of myocardial and valvular function. Especially in small children, the non-invasive nature of MR is of great importance.
