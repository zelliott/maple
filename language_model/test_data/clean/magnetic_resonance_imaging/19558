Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders in organ allograft recipients are most commonly of B-cell origin and only occasionally of T-cell origin. We present here a case of nasal natural killer cell lymphoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus that occurred in a recipient of a renal transplant 4 years posttransplantation. Immunohistochemically, the lymphoma cells showed CD2-, surface CD3-, cytoplasmic CD3E+, CD56+, CD57-, CD16-, and CD43+ phenotype. Analyses of T-cell receptor beta and gamma genes showed germ line configurations. EBER-1 was detectable in the lymphoma cells. The patient was diagnosed as having natural killer cell lymphoma and was treated with six courses of combination chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma He has been in remission for more than 3 years thereafter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a posttransplant NK cell lymphoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus.
