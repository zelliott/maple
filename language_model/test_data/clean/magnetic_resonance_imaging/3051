The authors present the MRI findings of two children with insidious walking difficulties, signs of corticospinal tract involvement, and signs and symptoms of extrapyramidal dysfunction such as rigidity and generalized dystonia, the latter with predominance of oromandibular involvement. In one child, MRI revealed prominent hypo-intensity in the globus pallidus and in the substantia nigra on T2-weighted spin echo images, consistent with iron deposition and thus with previous post-mortem findings of Hallervorden-Spatz disease. In the other case, the hypo-intensity was restricted to the globus pallidus, in which a small area of hyperintensity in its internal segment was demonstrated--the so called 'eye-of-the-tiger' sign. The authors propose that a combination of previously mentioned neurological signs with these specific MRI findings is highly suggestive of an in vivo diagnosis of the late infantile type of HSD.
