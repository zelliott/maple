In craniomandibular disorders the diagnosis of internal derangements plays an important role. Findings from the history and the examination of active movements mostly lead to a working diagnosis. Additional orthopedic tests and radiological examination (e.g. arthrography) give more precise information. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a new technique with which the temporomandibular soft tissues can be imaged in a non-invasive way without the use of radiation. The position and configuration of the disc can be visualized both in the intercuspidal position and with various degrees of mouth opening.
