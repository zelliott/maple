Previous studies have suggested combining magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and biopsy in patients with lymphoma but association between MR results and clinical symptoms have never been investigated. The purpose of this retrospective study was to better delineate patients profiles requiring bone marrow (BM) imaging in lymphoma.

50 MR studies and blind biopsies (BB) were reviewed in 40 patients with lymphoma. MR results were compared to clinical, laboratory-based and BM follow-up data to determine potential associations between MR results and these parameters.

46% of MR studies were abnormal with a normal BB; 2% were normal with an abnormal BB. Abnormal MR results were significantly associated with subsequent bone marrow involvement (p < 0.01). Abnormal MR studies were significantly associated with constitutional symptoms, bone pains (p < 0.05) and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (p < 0.01). MR imaging excluded malignancy in three patients and caused therapy to be modified in three.

Abnormal clinical and laboratory-based data should be used to screen patients with normal BB for MR imaging, especially in patients with Hodgkin's disease and high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
