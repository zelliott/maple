Multiple stress fractures in the same bone are a rare occurrence. This paper presents an unusual case of a 19-year-old, healthy man who sustained a pathologic fracture of the proximal tibia through a stress-fracture site. The radiographic examination of the tibia also revealed multiple stress fractures inferior to the pathologic fracture. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to rule out neoplasm and to confirm the stress-fracture diagnosis. Multiple stress fractures in the same bone can be treated with cast immobilization.
