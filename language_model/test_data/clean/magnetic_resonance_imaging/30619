To report the magnetic resonance appearance of hypotonus maculopathy.

Observational case report.

A 48-year-old man with a long history of glaucoma and subsequent trabeculectomy in the right eye developed hypotonus maculopathy. Visual acuity continued to decrease in both eyes of a relatively young individual with severe primary open angle glaucoma. A magnetic resonance image was requested to look for a compressive optic neuropathy.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed an abnormal plaquelike thickening of the macula and flattening of the posterior globe.

To our knowledge, this is the first case report of the magnetic resonance appearance of hypotonus maculopathy.
