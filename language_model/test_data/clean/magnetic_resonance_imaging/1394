Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic aorta, including cine-MRI, was performed in 25 patients suspected of having dissection of the thoracic aorta. MRI was correlated with echocardiography, CT and angiography. The sensitivity of MRI (100%) was most closely followed by CT and angiography (83% and 77% respectively). The specificity of MRI and angiography was equally good, at 100% each. MRI was able to demonstrate the intimal flap in all 9 cases of aortic dissection, and there were no false-positive results. Differentiation of thrombosis and slow flow was possible on proton density images, gradient echo images permitted detection of the entry and re-entry sites. The nature of the dissection was determinated correctly in 8 out of 9 cases. MRI is capable of providing all the relevant parameters necessary to decide appropriate treatment of dissecting aneurysms of the thoracic aorta.
