Xenon-CT cerebral blood flow determinations in 20 children and young adults (age less than 40) who presented with cerebral ischemia were retrospectively reviewed for evidence of unifocal or multifocal ischemic disease. These results were compared with the findings of conventional CT and magnetic resonance (MR) examinations in the same patients. Xenon-CT revealed additional lesions or added significant pathophysiological information in 80% of patients scanned by noncontrast CT, 89% scanned by postcontrast CT, and 58% scanned by MR. Xenon-CT is a useful adjunct to MR and conventional CT in the evaluation of cerebral ischemia in children and young adults.
