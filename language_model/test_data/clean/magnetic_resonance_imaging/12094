The authors report a prospective and comparative study of the pre-operative staging of 90 laryngeal carcinomas by CT and MRI, with blind analysis of each examination. The radio-anatomic correlations and the inter-method correlations (CT versus MRI) are reported. According to the authors MRI seems to be the method of choice because of its capabilities in soft tissues differentiation and because of its multiplanar representation. The motion artefacts are resolved by the fast imaging technique and the spatial resolution is optimized by special surface coils.
