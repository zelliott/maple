When spatially segregated visual stimuli are presented in alternation, subjects may perceive a single stimulus moving between the two positions (apparent motion). By adjusting spatial and temporal parameters, an ambiguous condition can be created in which perception of back-and-forth motion alternates with the perception of two stationary blinking stimuli. We presented subjects with such ambiguous stimuli, asked them to signal periods of perceived motion and blinking, and measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple regression analysis revealed that early visual areas responded with equal strength during both perceptual conditions, whereas hMT+(V5) (the human motion complex that includes the human homolog of MT and its satellites) was more active during the perception of apparent motion. These results indicate that neurons in hMT+ participate in the constructive process that creates a continuous motion percept from a discontinuous visual input.
