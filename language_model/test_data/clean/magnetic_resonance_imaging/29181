Spondylitis is one of the more frequent osteoarticular complications of Brucella infection, but cervical spine involvement is rare. We report here a case of cervical Brucella spondylitis with paravertebral anterior epidural abscess which resulted in neurological deficits. The diagnosis is based on clinical history supported by Brucella serology, radiological findings and histological evidence.
