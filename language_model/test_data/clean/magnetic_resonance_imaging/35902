Eighteen consecutive patients with spinal cord symptoms of sudden or relatively sudden onset were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The examinations were performed on a 0.3 tesla permanent/resistive imaging system using solenoidal surface coils. MRI revealed epidural tumour in five patients, intramedullary tumour in one, epidural abscess in one, myelitis in two, spontaneous intraspinal epidural haematoma in two, disc herniation in two, traumatic lesions in four and no abnormality in one patient. MRI was found to be capable of non-invasively and painlessly detecting and exactly defining the extent of intraspinal and paraspinal lesions. In some cases the nature of the lesion could be inferred from specific signal characteristics, which is a unique property of MRI. The results strongly suggest that MRI is superior to myelography and other imaging methods and should be regarded as the examination of choice in the emergency examination of patients with spinal cord symptoms.
