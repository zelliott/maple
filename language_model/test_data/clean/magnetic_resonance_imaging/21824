Schwannomas involving the jugular foramen are rare lesions, and no consensus exists on their management. This paper reports on 20 such cases treated in our centers. Nineteen cases were operated on for removal of the tumors, and the remaining case is being managed by watchful expectancy. Fifteen cases were operated on by the petro-occipital trans-sigmoid approach with or without labyrinthectomy, 2 by the infratemporal fossa approach, 1 by the modified transcochlear approach, and 1 by the jugulo-petrosectomy approach. The petro-occipital trans-sigmoid approach allowed single-stage, total tumor removal with preservation of the facial nerve and of middle and inner ear functions. Lower cranial nerve paralysis was the major complication and seemed to be inherent to the disease rather than to the approach used. No cerebrospinal fluid leak or meningitis occurred in the present series. So far, no recurrence has been detected.
