In this study, the coronal and sagittal heights of the pituitary glands were measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique in 201 individuals. There was no sellar or parasellar region pathology in the study group. The data were evaluated according to age and sex groups. In all cases the coronal and sagittal heights of the pituitary glands were equal. The mean values of the coronal and sagittal heights in females (6.1 +/- 0.1 mm, 6.1 +/- 0.1 mm respectively) were higher than in males (5.7 +/- 0.2 mm, 5.6 +/- 0.2 mm respectively). The highest values for the coronal and sagittal heights were in the 11-20 years age group in both sexes. A gradual increase in the coronal and sagittal heights of the pituitary glands in the 0-10, 11-20 age groups was present in both sexes. Decrease in the heights of the pituitary glands was noted after 20 years of age onwards. Nevertheless there was a conspicuous increase in the mean value of the pituitary glands' heights in the 51-60 years age group in males. In females, a minimal increase in the mean value of the pituitary glands' heights was observed in the 61 years and over age group.
