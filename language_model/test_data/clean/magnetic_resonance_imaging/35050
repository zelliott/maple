To analyse and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of pituitary microadenoma.

Eighty cases of pituitary microadenoma treated with transsphenoidal approach in our department were analysed retrospectively during the last 2 years.

During following-up of 13.0+/-3.2 months, neither remained tumor was found except one patients with microprolactinoma, nor recurrence. Diabetes insipidus occurred in 19 patients, among which 15 patients recovered in 1 week, three in 1 month and one in 7 months. The adrenocorticotrophic hormone deficiency was found in nine of 63 patients with PRL-, GH- and non-functioning microadenoma (12%), but hypoadrenalemia recovered in all patients. Among these nine patients, seven recovered in 3 months and two in 6 months. Dysosphesia occurred in 32 cases: 30 recovered in 1 month and two in 4 months. Thirteen of 15 patients (86.7%) with ACTH-secreting microadenoma achieved chemical remission judged by plasma cortisol levels<or=2 microg/dl within 72 hours of surgery. During the mean 13.0 months of follow-up, the symptoms of amenorrhea, galactorrhea, headache, obesity and sexual disturbance were improved greatly. In total, 93.7% (45/48) of patients had normal post-operative PRL levels in the patients who had no pre-operative treatment history of long time medical therapy and large dose medical therapy in short time.

(1) Transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) is safe and effective treatment for pituitary microadenoma; (2) TSS is considered to be definitive treatment for ACTH- and GH-secreting microadenoma once the diagnosis is established; (3) in order to obtain better effects, TSS could be offered as first-line treatment for patients with locally non-invasive PRL-secreting microadenoma (tumor larger than 3 mm in diameter) and non-functioning microadenoma.
