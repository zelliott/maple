Multiple gliomas are uncommon and may be classified according to: a) the time of presentation in early (at diagnosis) or late (during treatment); b) the characteristics of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) in multifocal (with evidence of spread) and multicentric (without evidence of spread). From 212 patients with histopathologic diagnosis of glioma evaluated from March/90 to September/99, 15 (7%) had multiple lesions. We describe 4 patients: early multicentric, late multicentric, early multifocal and late multifocal, with emphasis on characteristics of CT/MRI and possible differential diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of multiple lesions in the central nervous system includes mainly infectious/inflammatory diseases and metastasis, however multiple gliomas should always be considered, even in patients with known systemic cancer, as described by others. Considering that CT/MRI features are not definite, the diagnosis should always be confirmed by histopathologic examination.
