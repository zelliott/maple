A 51-year-old woman developed a slowly progressive spastic paraparesis and diminished vibration sense beginning at age 38. Intellectual capacity was normal. Krabbe disease was confirmed by markedly reduced leukocyte galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity, typical inclusions in Schwann cell cytoplasm, and an identification of the homozygous point mutation T1835C (Leu618Ser) in the GALC gene. T2-weighted MRI of the brain showed symmetric high-signal-intensity lesions in the bilateral frontoparietal white matter, the centrum semiovale, and the posterior limb of the internal capsule with sparing of the periventricular white matter. This case is unusual because of the late onset, protracted clinical course, and MRI findings of demyelination confined to the corticospinal tracts.
