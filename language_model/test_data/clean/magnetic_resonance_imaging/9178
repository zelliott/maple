Prenatal ultrasound has led to the early diagnosis of major anomalies. However, the ready availability of this technology has led to increasing challenges for physicians counseling affected parents, which is all the more difficult in a twin pregnancy with only one affected fetus. This paper reviews the medical and ethical considerations in twin pregnancies discordant for a serious cardiac condition.

Six recent twin pregnancies discordant for a serious cardiac condition and their outcomes are presented. Options considered in the management of the pregnancy were to continue or terminate the pregnancy, selectively terminate the affected twin or to decide whether to treat the affected twin once delivered. An approach to decision making in such situations has been formulated after critical analysis of the factors involved.

Four of the six pregnancies were monochorionic twins. Two sets of parents decided to terminate the pregnancy. In the four that continued, two opted for the affected twin to be appropriately managed once delivered. A further two considered selective termination but opted to continue the pregnancy because of the risk of premature labor and/or cerebral hypoxia following such intervention. They sought a commitment, however, that they be given the option whether to treat the affected twin following delivery. Eventually both elected to have their babies treated, one of whom died in the postoperative period.

Medical considerations included the risks of continuation of the pregnancy for the mother and her twins, the safety of termination (total or selective), and the risks to the unaffected fetus. Ethical issues revolved around concepts of autonomy, beneficence and justice from the standpoint of the family and the twins. The gestation and the viability of the twins played an important role in decision making and approaches, taking into account the local legal and other considerations.

Attention is drawn to the complexities of the issues involved in twin pregnancies complicated by a serious cardiac condition in one of the twins. Optimal counseling requires sound clinical knowledge about the medical risks to the mother and her twins, and a clear understanding of the key ethical considerations. Such an approach will assist parents in their very difficult decision making.
