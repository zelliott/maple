A 10-year-old boy presented with fever, headache, vomiting, and hypersomnolence. An akinetic-rigid syndrome with tremor, dysphagia, dysphonia, and sialorrhea, as well as pyramidal signs, developed. Slightly elevated protein content was found in the cerebrospinal fluid and serological investigations were suggestive of a primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed massive bilateral hyperintense striatal and punctiform periventricular lesions. After 2-month treatment with steroids and antiparkinsonian drugs, all features resolved without sequelae. Control MRI demonstrated only minimal residual lesions in both putamina. Strongly resembling the encephalitis lethargica-like syndrome, this case is an unusual presentation of parainfectious acute disseminated encephalitis.
