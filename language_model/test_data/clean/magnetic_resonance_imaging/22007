Examinations of a new needle system for localisation and core biopsies of suspicious breast lesions, detected by MRI alone, were performed. It was investigated whether this new needle system could reduce and avoid artifacts.

The new needle system was examined by Spin Echo Sequence and a Fast Gradient Echo Sequence on Magnetom Impact, 1.0 Tesla (in vitro-examinations). The sizes of the coaxial needle system on the MR images were examined on various slice thicknesses and with several wires in this needle system.

In the Spin Echo Sequence the measured size of the coaxial needle is the same as its real size. In the Fast Gradient Echo Sequence the measured size is about double that of the real size.

The presented coaxial system will allow improved visualisation for both preoperative localisation and core biopsy.
