Four years after resection of a supratentorial pilocytic astrocytoma this 16-year-old boy displayed widespread leptomeningeal seeding. Although the primary tumor lacked contrast enhancement, the multiple metastatic nodules were markedly contrast enhancing. Both the initial and disseminated tumor were consistent with a pilocytic astrocytoma. He was treated with vincristin and carboplatinum and the tumor was stable up to Dec. 1998. Dissemination of low-grade intracranial astrocytoma in children occurs in only 4%. It is not a sign of malignancy. The present case is similar to previously published cases. The prognosis of these patients might be quite favorable when treated with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.
