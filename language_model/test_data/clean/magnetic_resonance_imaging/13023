In this paper we propose a novel hybrid three-dimensional phase-unwrapping algorithm, which we refer to here as the three-dimensional best-path avoiding singularity loops (3DBPASL) algorithm. This algorithm combines the advantages and avoids the drawbacks of two well-known 3D phase-unwrapping algorithms, namely, the 3D phase-unwrapping noise-immune technique and the 3D phase-unwrapping best-path technique. The hybrid technique presented here is more robust than its predecessors since it not only follows a discrete unwrapping path depending on a 3D quality map, but it also avoids any singularity loops that may occur in the unwrapping path. Simulation and experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms its parent techniques in terms of reliability and robustness.
