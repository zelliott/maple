We sought to describe a range of in vivo observations of glycosaminoglycan distribution in knee cartilage using the delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage technique.

The index of glycosaminoglycan distribution, T1(Gd), can exceed 500 msec (denoting high glycosaminoglycan) or can be less than 300 msec, with focal areas as low as 240 msec. Compartmental differences, as well as focal defects within the knee, were observed in patients who had sustained injuries to the ligaments and menisci of the knee or who had chronic osteoarthritis. Overall, these results suggest the need for further research into the biochemical changes seen during disease progression and the effects of therapeutic interventions.
