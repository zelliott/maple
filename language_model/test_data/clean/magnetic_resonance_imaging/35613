To gain information on the predictive and prognostic value of magnetic source imaging (MSI), 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET), and ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as compared with intracranial electroencephalography (ICEEG) localization in epilepsy surgery.

This work was part of a cohort study of epilepsy surgery candidates not sufficiently localized with noninvasive studies. Of 160 patients enrolled over 4 years, 77 completed ICEEG seizure monitoring. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values relative to ICEEG were computed for each modality.

Seizures were not captured in five patients. Of the 72 diagnostic ICEEG studies, seizure localization results were 74% localized, 10% multifocal, and 17% nonlocalized. Sixty-one percent were localized to neocortical regions. Depending on patient subgroup pairs, sensitivity ranged from 58 to 64% (MSI), 22 to 40% (PET), and 39 to 48% (SPECT); specificity ranges were 79 to 88% (MSI), 53 to 63% (PET), and 44 to 50% (SPECT). Gains in diagnostic yield were seen only with the combination of MSI and PET or MSI and ictal SPECT. Localization concordance with ICEEG was greatest with MSI, but a significant difference was demonstrated only between MSI and PET. Moderate redundancy was seen between PET and ictal SPECT (kappa = 0.452; p = 0.011).

Conclusively positive MSI has a high predictive value for seizures localized with ICEEG. Diagnostic gain may be achieved with addition of either PET or ictal SPECT to MSI. Diagnostic values for imaging tests are lower than "true values" because of the limitations of ICEEG as a gold standard.
