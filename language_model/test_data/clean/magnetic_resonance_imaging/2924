Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) using YACHIYODA SZI was performed on 12 patients with renal stones and the effect on the kidney and adjacent tissue was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after treatment. Some changes were seen in 6 of the 12(50%) patients; perirenal fluid collection in 2 of the 12 (16.7%) patients, subcapsular hematoma in 2 of the 12 (16.7%) patients, renal enlargement in 5 of the 12 (31.3%) patients, increased signal intensity in perirenal tissue in 6 of the 12 (50%) patients, and loss of the corticomedullary junction 2 out of 9 patients (22%). These findings indicated fewer changes in the kidney after ESWL using YACHIYODA SZI than in the other reports. MRI is also concluded to be effective to detect the changes of the kidney after ESWL.
