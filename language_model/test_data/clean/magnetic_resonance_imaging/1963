The imaging evaluation of patients with spinal trauma has evolved over the past decades, and there has been particular interest in the concept of instability, to predict which a series of criteria have been proposed. We retrospectively evaluated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in 50 patients with post-traumatic spinal instability according to Denis's three-column method, Daffner et al.'s radiographic criteria, and Oner et al.'s categorization of MRI findings; additionally, we evaluated the cord, the prevertebral tissue, and the epidural space. We suggest that an integrated panel of MRI information might be standardized in order to provide a more complete evaluation of spinal injury in an individual case and help planning surgical treatment.
