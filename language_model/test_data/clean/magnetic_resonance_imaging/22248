The effects of RF pulse parameters on magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) were investigated using a magnetization prepared segmented fast gradient echo sequence. MTC was found not to be uniquely determined by the specific absorption rate (SAR). RF pulse parameters (RF amplitude, number of RF pulses and RF duration) also affect MTC. There can be 40% variation in MTC due to differences in RF parameters at SAR = 1 W/kg for a 70-kg subject. Increasing the number of RF pulses is a more efficient way to increase MTC than increasing RF amplitude. This phenomenon is likely caused by the fact that the time scale for magnetization transfer between the free and restricted proton pools is on the same order or longer than the duration of the MT pulse. Accordingly, increase in the MT pulse duration by increasing the number of RF pulses in the MT pulse allows more effective magnetization transfer. Such information can be used as a guide to select RF pulse parameters for a magnetization transfer (MT) pulse. An off-resonance MT pulse designed under this guide for coronary MR angiography improved the depiction of distal vessels.
