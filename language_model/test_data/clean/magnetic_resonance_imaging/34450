The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) parameters and left prefrontal volumes in both patients with schizophrenia and healthy subjects. 31P MRS parameters and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric data were collected in the left prefrontal region in 10 patients with schizophrenia and 10 healthy subjects of comparable age, handedness, sex, educational level, and parental educational level. No correlations were found between any MRS parameter and grey matter volumes in the combined subjects. Phosphomonoester (PME) and grey matter volumes, however, were both correlated negatively with age. PMEs were found to be decreased, and calculated intracellular magnesium ([Mg2+]intra) was found to be increased in the patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy subjects after adjusting for left prefrontal grey and white matter, total brain volume, and age. These findings suggest that cortical grey and white manner volumes are not directly related to PME and [Mg2+]intra abnormalities in schizophrenia patients.
