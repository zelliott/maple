A sterile inflammation in the cavernous sinus was hypothesized to underlie cluster headache (CH). Neurogenic inflammation is accompanied by the extravasation of plasma proteins in the surrounding tissue. We tested the hypothesis of an inflammatory process in the cavernous sinus in CH patients using 99mTc-human serum albumin (HSA) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Six patients with episodic CH were enrolled. After baseline imaging, CH attacks were induced by IV injection of nitroglycerin. The patients remained untreated for 20 min. A second SPECT was performed after successful treatment. Region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed on the basis of coregistered MRI/SPECT data. There was no statistical difference between the 99mTc-HSA uptake in the ipsilateral cavernous sinus before and after induction of an acute CH attack. There was no evidence for 99mTc-HSA extravasation in the cavernous sinus during the active episode as compared with the remission phase. Our results do not support the hypothesis of an inflammation in the cavernous sinus.
