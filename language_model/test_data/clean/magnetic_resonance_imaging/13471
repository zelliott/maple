We performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), before and after the administration of gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA), in 23 patients with medically refractory partial epilepsy who subsequently had surgical treatment for their seizure disorder. In most patients, 61%, unenhanced and enhanced MRI studies were negative. In 26% the unenhanced image was positive, and the abnormality enhanced with Gd-DTPA. In 13% the unenhanced MR image was positive, but the abnormality did not enhance with Gd-DTPA. Gd-DTPA does not appear to increase the diagnostic yield of MRI in the presurgical evaluation of patients with partial epilepsy if the unenhanced MRIs are normal.
