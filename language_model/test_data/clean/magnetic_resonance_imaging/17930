To compare the diagnostic accuracy of contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Ce-MRI) and (18)F-fluorodopa ((18)F-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) for detecting recurrent glioma.

In this prospective study, 35 patients (age, 36.62 ± 0.86 years; 80 % male) with histopathologically proven glioma with clinical suspicion of recurrence were evaluated using Ce-MRI and (18)F-FDOPA PET-CT. (18)F-FDOPA PET-CT images were evaluated qualitatively and semi-quantitatively. Combination of clinical follow-up (minimum 1 year), repeat imaging and/or biopsy (when available) was taken as the reference standard.

Based on the reference standard, 26 patients were positive and nine were negative for recurrence. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of Ce-MRI were 92.3 %, 44.4 % and 80 % respectively, whereas those of (18)F-FDOPA PET-CT were 100 %, 88.89 % and 97.1 % respectively. Results of Ce-MRI and (18)F-FDOPA PET-CT were concordant in 74.3 % (29/35) and discordant in 17.1 % of patients (6/35). On McNemar analysis the difference was not statistically significant overall (P = 0.687), for high-grade tumour (P = 0.5) or low-grade tumours (P = 1.0). However, (18)F-FDOPA PET-CT was more specific than Ce-MRI overall (P = 0.0002), for high-grade tumour (P = 0.006) and low-grade tumours (P = 0.004).

F-FDOPA PET-CT shows a high but comparable diagnostic accuracy to Ce-MRI for the detection of recurrent glioma. However, it is more specific than Ce-MRI.

• Recurrent glioma in the postoperative site remains a diagnostic dilemma. • (18) F-FDOPA PET-CT shows high diagnostic accuracy for detecting recurrent glioma. • Diagnostic accuracies for (18) F-FDOPA PET-CT and contrast enhanced MRI are comparable. • However, (18) F-FDOPA PET-CT is more specific than Ce-MRI for recurrent glioma.
