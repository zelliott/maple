To explore effects of chewing-side preference (CSP) on cerebral cortical response during clenching task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Seven patients with left CSP and 7 patients with right CSP were selected to perform the maximum voluntary clenching in intercuspal position, and block designed blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI scan covering the whole brain was carried out.

There was activation in the parahippocampal gyrus in the four patients among seven with left CSP. But there was no activation in the parahippocampal gyrus among the patients with right CSP.

This research shows that the parahippocampal gyrus, which is associated with human memory and study, is activated during clenching task in the patients with left CSP.
