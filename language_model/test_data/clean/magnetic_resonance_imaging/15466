We present a case showing the development of a Schmorl's node from its acute to chronic stage by serial MRI. In contrast to the mature Schmorl's node, imaging characteristics of the acute Schmorl's node have not been well-illustrated, particularly by contrast-enhanced images at various stages of development.
