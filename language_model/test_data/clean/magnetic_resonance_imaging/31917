A wide range of pathology involving the external, middle, and inner ear contribute to conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Diagnostic imaging plays a critical role in the evaluation and management of hearing loss. High resolution computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the preferred imaging modalities to evaluate the ear structures for causes of hearing loss, with the specific type of hearing loss and location of defect dictating which type of imaging is preferred. In general, the external auditory canal, middle ear space, mastoid, petrous apex, and otic capsule are best visualized with CT, whereas suspicion of retrocochlear pathology warrants MRI.
