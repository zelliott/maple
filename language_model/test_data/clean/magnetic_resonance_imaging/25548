Choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs) are rare intracranial neoplasms, especially in the third ventricle. We report a patient with a posterior third ventricular CPP extending into the pineal that radiographically and clinically presented as a pineal region lesion.

In a 51-year-old female with headache and upward gaze impairment radiological examination showed a mass in the pineal region obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius and causing hydrocephalus. After ventriculoperitoneal shunting the tumor was approached through the infratentorial-supracerebellar approach and pathological examination revealed a typical CPP.

This case represents an unusual presentation of an intracranial CPP. This entity should be considered an extremely rare cause of a lesion in the pineal region.
