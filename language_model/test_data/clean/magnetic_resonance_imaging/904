Biological research about dyslexia has been conducted using various neuroimaging methods like functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or Electroencephalography (EEG). Since language functions are characterized by both distributed network activities and speed of processing within milliseconds, high temporal as well as high spatial resolution of activation profiles are of interest: "where" can dyslexia specific activations be detected and "when" do language processes start to diverge between dyslexics and controls? Due to the network character of language processing, fMRI-constrained distributed source models based on EEG-data were computed for multimodal data integration. First single-case results show that this method could be a promising approach for the understanding of a repeatedly described experimental finding for dyslexia like that of an overactivation in inferior frontal language areas. Multimodal data analysis for the subjects presented here could probably demonstrate that inferior frontal overactivations are the consequence of a phonological deficit and could represent ongoing articulation processes used to solve phonologically challenging tasks.
