Mechanical forces play an important role in the rupture of vulnerable plaques. This process is often associated with cardiovascular syndromes, such as heart attack and stroke. In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based models were used to investigate the association between plaque wall stress (PWS) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Ex vivo MRI data of coronary plaques from 12 patients were used to construct 12 three-dimensional (3D) fluid-structure interaction (FSI) computational models. Six of the patients had died from CAD and six had died from non-CAD causes. PWS was assessed using all nodal points on the lumen surface of each plaque. The maximum PWS from all possible vulnerable sites of each plaque was defined as the 3D critical plaque wall stress (CPWS). Mean 3D CPWS in the CAD group was 94.3% higher than that in the non-CAD group (265.6 vs. 136.7 kPa, P=0.0029). There was no statistically significant difference in global maximum plaque wall stress (GMPWS) between the two groups (P=0.347). There was also no statistically significant difference in plaque burden between the CAD group (84.4±5%) and the non-CAD group (82.0±8%, P=0.552). The results indicate that plaques from patients who died from CAD were associated with higher CPWS compared with those from patients who died from non-CAD causes. With further validation, analysis of CPWS may prove to be an important component in assessment of plaque vulnerability.
