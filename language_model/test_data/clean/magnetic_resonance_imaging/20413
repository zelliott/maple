Juxta-articular osteoid osteomas of the ankle are rare and tend to have an atypical presentation. Because of the proximity to the joint, patients experience symptoms that may delay or mislead the diagnosis. This article presents a 33-year-old man with juxta-articular osteoid osteoma of the talar neck. The correct diagnosis was delayed for 2 years; the patient was initially misdiagnosed and treated for ankle sprain and anterior ankle impingement. Surgical excision of the lesion was performed with excellent results. Juxta-articular osteoid osteomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent ankle pain in teenagers and young adults who do not respond to treatment directed at more common conditions.
