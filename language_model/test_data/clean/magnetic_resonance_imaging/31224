Intra- and extraforaminal disc herniations can be treated via a lateral approach. The far-lateral approach is a muscle-splitting approach that allows surgeons to reach the disc herniation without any facet bone removal. The target of the surgical exposure is the isthmus. Good knowledge of the anatomic features of the intervertebral foramen and intertransverse space is mandatory. The transmuscular approach is discussed. We provide illustrations and a video to emphasize some operative aspects.
