The aim of this study was to describe the clinico-pathological characteristics of malignant biliary papillomatosis and the diagnostic and therapeutic approach adopted in this case, which extended from the left hepatic biliary duct to the bifurcation of the 2nd and 3rd segments. The patient was studied with ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), CT scan and MRI cholangiography, which showed the morphological characteristics and the extent of the disease in the biliary tract. The malignancy of the disease was confirmed by preoperative cytological analysis of bile collected via a nasobiliary probe. The surgical treatment, preceded by intraoperative ultrasonography, consisted in a left hepatectomy, sparing the 1st segment, and a right intrahepatic jejunostomy. The final pathological analysis revealed a malignant biliary papillomatosis. Preoperative ERCP clearly documented the exact distribution of the biliary tract lesions and allowed both treatment of the cholestasis and diagnosis of the nature of the lesion through cytological analysis of the bile. Surgical treatment must be carried out and guided not only by the preoperative diagnosis, but also by perioperative ultrasonography. Finally, owing to the rarity of such cases and consequently our very limited knowledge of the disease, an intensive follow-up is recommended.
