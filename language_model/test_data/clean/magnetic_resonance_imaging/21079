In cases of severe osteoporosis vertebral body fractures of the thoracolumbar spine can occur without any relevant trauma. Initially, a standardized diagnostic algorithm is recommended to detect acute vertebral body fractures and to be able to interpret the individual fracture stability. Aim of the therapy is to assure a relatively pain-free mobilization while maintaining vertebral spine alignment. A conservative therapy concept is initiated in patients with stable fractures. In cases of persistent pain, reduced mobility or increased kyphotic misalignment minimally invasive cement augmented therapy strategies are chosen. In cases of unstable fracture morphology a more complex therapy concept has to be chosen such as hybrid stabilization. A great deal of experience is needed for revision surgery. In such cases reconstructive, multi-segmental techniques might be necessary and the instrumentation should surpass the apex of kyphosis.
