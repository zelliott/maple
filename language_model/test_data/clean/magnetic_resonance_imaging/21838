We used a nested polymerase chain reaction assay to quantitate the number of viral copies in cells of CSF of eight patients with herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE). The viral load was monitored in serial CSF samples during the course of disease and correlated to clinical symptoms, radiologic manifestations, efficacy of acyclovir treatment, and overall clinical outcome. Before treatment, HSV type 1 (HSV-1) copies were detected at a mean value of 1,786/10(5) (range, 5 to 8,333/10(5) cells; median, 81/10(5) cells). During therapy, HSV-1 DNA decreased gradually to a mean value of 6 copies/10(5) cells (range, 0 to 33 copies/10(5) cells; median, 0 copies/10(5) cells) within 6 to 21 days and disappeared or was barely detectable before treatment completion in most cases. The HSV-1 burden in the CSF did not clearly correlate with the severity of clinical signs or the degree of cranial imaging findings and overall outcome. Quantitation of HSV-1 copies allows rapid and reliable monitoring of antiviral therapy. The absence of a clear correlation between viral load in the CSF and morbidity may suggest a role for indirect mechanisms of brain injury in HSVE.
