To characterize the brain pathology in relation to long-term outcome after pediatric head injury, 55 children were studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at least 3 months after sustaining moderate to severe closed head injury (CHI). Thirty-nine of the patients had abnormal signal intensity consistent with residual brain lesions, including 28 children with lesions involving the frontal lobes. The clinical features of children with frontal lesions, extrafrontal lesions, and diffuse injury were compared. The analysis disclosed that children with frontal lobe lesions were more frequently disabled than children who sustained diffuse injury. Our MRI findings indicate that residual brain lesions are more common after moderate to severe CHI in children than previously thought and that the frontal lobes are most frequently involved. Further investigation is indicated to elucidate whether distinctive cognitive and behavioral sequelae are associated with frontal lobe lesions in children.
