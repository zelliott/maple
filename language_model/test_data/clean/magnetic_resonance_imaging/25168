In addition to their deficit in overt face recognition, patients with prosopagnosia also have difficulties in matching sequentially presented unfamiliar faces. Here we assessed the possibility that covert matching of faces was present in a case with prosopagnosia using event-related potentials (ERPs). The participants (patient FE and normal controls) were challenged with a face-identity matching task, in which they decided whether two sequentially presented photographs of unfamiliar faces represented the same person. Only internal face features were used and the two faces in a pair differed in emotional expression. FE failed to overtly match these stimuli. In contrast, the ERPs revealed evidence of covert matching. If the two faces within a pair of stimuli depicted different posers, then the response to the second face contained an enhanced N300 compared to the situation where the identity of the faces was the same. The latency of the N300 was the same as a similar component found in controls. These results suggest that some cases with prosopagnosia have a covert ability to match unfamiliar faces, with similar temporal dynamics as controls, which in contrast with the idea that a generalized slowing of face processing occurs in all cases of prosopagnosia.
