A series of 22 patients under the age of 15 years with cavernomas were treated at the Section of Paediatric Neurosurgery of the Catholic University of Rome between 1981 and 1995. The most common symptoms at presentation were epilepsy, in 12 children, and intracranial hypertension, in 9 children; seizures were present on admission in 14 patients; no patient had a family history of cerebro-vascular malformations, two had multiple lesions. Radiological signs of significant acute and subacute haemorrhage were found in 17 cases. The supratentorial compartment was the most frequent location of the lesions, with only three subtentorial cavernomas. The post-surgical results were good: only four children had a persistence of pre-surgical neurological signs, even though they were ameliorated by the treatment. No patient showed a progression of pre-operative neurological signs, nor the onset of new deficits. Only one child died, but his clinical condition was critical before surgery, because of deep coma, with bilaterally dilated and fixed pupils, and no response to any stimulation. Our results suggest that the younger children present significant haemorrhage more frequently than the older ones; this is demonstrated by the analysis of the mean age of the patients with macro-haemorrhage (= 7 years) and the average age of those without macro-haemorrhage (= 11 years). The removal of cavernomas was always able to control the seizure disorders of our patients, proving that in these cases lesionectomy alone may be sufficient to resolve epilepsy.
