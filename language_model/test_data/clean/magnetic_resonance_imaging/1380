Three cases of long-standing intranasal cocaine abuse were associated with orbitopathy or optic neuropathy. All three cases were characterized by chronic sinusitis. Histopathologic examination of involved sinus and orbital tissues revealed chronic and acute nonspecific inflammation, with no evidence of unusual infections or of idiopathic midline destructive disease. In two of the cases, there was radiographic evidence of contiguous orbital inflammation associated with sinusitis. The inflammatory orbital process in these two cases was steroid responsive, but in one case recurrent inflammation occurred in response to steroid tapering. One patient suffered a complete loss of vision in the involved eye due to fulminant orbital inflammation and optic nerve dysfunction.
