Meningiomas involving the jugular foramen are rare lesions, with approximately 34 cases reported in the English literature. Clinically, these tumors mimic the more common glomus jugulare tumor. After surgical resection, meningiomas have worse cranial nerve outcomes and higher recurrence rates than glomus tumors. There is controversy regarding the selection of surgical approach, particularly with regard to management of the facial nerve. A reliable means of accurate preoperative diagnosis would help surgical planning and patient counseling.

We present a series of six consecutive large jugular foramen meningiomas resected by a single surgeon from 1996 to 2002.

Retrospective case series (chart review).

The preoperative diagnosis was correct in nearly all (6/7) cases on the basis of the characteristic imaging findings seen with a combination of temporal bone dedicated computed tomography and high-resolution enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Five of six patients had lateral facial nerve rerouting (infratemporal fossa Fisch type A), and three patients also had posterior rerouting (transcochlear approach with division of greater superficial petrosal nerve). Total tumor removal was accomplished in 83%. One patient suffered recurrence over a mean follow-up period of 2.5 years. New postoperative vocal cord palsies occurred in 50% of patients, and all required vocal cord medialization. At 1 year, 50% of patients had normal or near normal (House-Brackmann I or II) facial function. Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leaks occurred in two patients, and both eventually required ventriculoperitoneal shunts.

Meningiomas involving the jugular foramen are surgically challenging tumors that pose unique diagnostic issues. The majority of these lesions can be completely resected. A relatively high postoperative complication rate, which can be controlled with appropriate intervention, is seen with these surgeries.
