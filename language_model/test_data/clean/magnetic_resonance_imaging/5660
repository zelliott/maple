Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Hypertension is a well-recognized, common side effect of VEGF blocking agents. The reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) has been described as a rare but serious consequence of bevacizumab administration. We present a case of a 6-year-old child with refractory hepatoblastoma who developed hypertensive crisis, seizures and MRI changes consistent with RPLS while receiving bevacizumab with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. Findings completely resolved without neurologic sequelae with stringent blood-pressure control. Better understanding of risk for RPLS, prompt recognition and aggressive management will be required as bevacizumab gains wider use in pediatrics.
