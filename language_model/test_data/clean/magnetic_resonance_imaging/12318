Infantile hemangioma (IH), a representative vascular liver tumor, usually occurs in infancy or early childhood but rarely in adults. In this study, we describe a case of IH in a 47-year-old female and we also review the literature. A plain computed tomography (CT) image revealed five hypoattenuating masses in the liver. A dynamic study revealed the masses appeared to be well-enhanced in the arterial phase, and were considered to be high-flow hemangiomas. The tumors appeared as hypointense tumors on the T1-weighted images and as hyperintensities on fat-suppression T2-weighted images. Following the administration of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA), tumors appeared to be well-enhanced in the arterial phase. In the portal phase, tumors demonstrated isointensity compared with the surrounding liver parenchyma, and hypointensity in the equilibrium and hepatobiliary phases. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values ranged from 2.0 to 2.4x10(-3) mm2/sec. Microscopically, the tumors were composed of numerous capillary-like small vessels lined with plump endothelial cells, arranged in a single layer without mitoses, and small bile ducts were trapped and scattered within the tumor. These findings were considered to be characteristic of IH. To the best of our knowledge, this case is the third report on IH in adults.
