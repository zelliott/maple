We report a case of cholesterol granuloma of the petrous apex which was surgically treated via an endoscopic trans-sphenoidal approach.

Case report and review of the literature concerning cholesterol granulomas of the petrous apex and their management.

The lesion was approached endoscopically via a bilateral sphenoidotomy with removal of the vomer. A large cholesterol granuloma was evacuated and marsupialised. The patient made an uneventful recovery.

Trans-sphenoidal access to the petrous apex represents an alternative route for the drainage and ventilation of cholesterol granulomas. This approach is the technique of choice when the cholesterol granuloma abuts the posterior wall of the sphenoid sinus. The trans-sphenoid approach, unlike other lateral approaches to the petrous apex, spares cochlear and vestibular function and allows post-operative endoscopic follow up.
