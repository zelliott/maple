To assess the correlation of diffusion-weighted (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) findings with the severity of acute neurologic deficit and their ability to predict short and long-term clinical outcomes of stroke. The ability of DWI and PWI to predict the outcome was compared with the ability of clinical stroke scales to predict the outcome.

Forty-eight patients with acute stroke underwent diffusion DWI and PWI on the first and eighth day after the ictus. Clinical and functional scales were carried out before each scan and 3 months after the stroke.

The volumes of both the DWI and the PWI lesions correlated well with the acute neurologic deficit and the final outcome. The first day PWI (r = 0.64) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (r = 0.70) correlated well with the final outcome. However, in logistic regression analysis, only the NIHSS score at the acute stage was the only independent predictor of the long-term clinical outcome.

While the PWI and DWI lesion volumes correlated well with the outcome of the stroke, the imaging measurements did not improve the prognostic power over plain clinical stroke scale scores.
