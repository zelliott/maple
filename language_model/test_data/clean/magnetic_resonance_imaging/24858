A 26-year-old male with large intraventricular meningioma developed acute hydrocephalus postoperatively, which was difficult to manage. After a repeated course of dilated and slit-like ventricle, he gradually presented a disturbance of consciousness, which was recovered by the use of bromocriptine, suggesting akinetic mutism. At the chronic stage, he suffered from symptoms of hydrocephalus again. Time-slip MRI revealed the stasis of CSF flow around the third ventricle. Neuroendoscopy disclosed that the foramen of Monro was occluded with membrane. After endoscopic third ventriculostomy as well as penetration of the foramen, the symptoms disappeared and hydrocephalus was resolved. This is a rare case of akinetic mutism after complicated management of hydrocephalus associated with intraventricular meningioma.
