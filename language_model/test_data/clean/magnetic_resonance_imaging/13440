A case of neurobrucellosis misdiagnosed at the onset as multiple sclerosis (MS) is presented. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple periventricular areas compatible with demyelinating lesions of possible vasculitic origin. Myelin basic protein was elevated in the CSF. The immunological CSF study was consistent with a chronic intrathecal inflammatory process. The modification of these parameters during specific treatment is also presented.
