We report a case of gastric lipoma which manifested with an episode of acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Preoperative diagnosis was based on the US, CT, and MRI findings, as the results of gastrointestinal endoscopy were inconclusive. The role of current imaging methods, and particularly of MRI, is discussed.
