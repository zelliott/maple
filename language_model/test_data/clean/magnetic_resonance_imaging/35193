Griscelli syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. It is characterized by pigment dilution and variable immune deficiency leading to increased susceptibility to certain infections and a tendency to develop a life-threatening hemophagocytic syndrome known as the accelerated phase. Griscelli syndrome is now classified into 3 types based on the genetic and molecular features. Primary neurological presentation without the accelerated phase is rare in type 2. In this article, the authors report a boy who was presented with seizures and diffuse white matter involvement unaccompanied by the other features of the accelerated phase. Mutation analysis in family members revealed the presence of a missense mutation in Rab27a gene. In addition to the rare presentation, this is the first case of Griscelli syndrome to be reported from Jordan.
