The currently required surgical procedure for implantable defibrillator implantation is a limiting factor and several groups are therefore investigating transvenous approaches. Our electrode system consists of a nondistal right ventricular catheter electrode and two or three subcutaneously (SC) placed electrodes. An optimal location for these SC electrodes is important to obtain the lowest possible defibrillation threshold (DFT) by allowing a more homogeneous current distribution within the thorax. An empirical approach consists of placing randomly the SC electrodes to find out the lowest possible DFT. A mathematical approach is to calculate the SC electrode locations for an optimal electric field distribution by using magnetic resonance images of thorax cross-sections and a specially designed computer program. Our recent experimental results are based on a series of 15 pigs weighing between 60 and 102 Kg. DFT ranged between 10 and 26 joules. We conclude that an electrode system with a right ventricular electrode and two or three subcutaneous electrodes can be optimized to reach a DFT for pigs with human-near body weights which is compatible with the energy capabilities of our implantable device.
