The objective of this retrospective study was to identify clinical and EEG features in children with occipital epilepsy that predict MR imaging abnormalities and seizure outcome.

Patients with clinical and/or EEG features indicating occipital lobe involvement were identified from the epilepsy database at a tertiary children's hospital. The clinical and EEG features were analyzed to identify the most important predictors of abnormal MR imaging and seizure outcome.

Sixty-six patients were identified: 21 had symptomatic epilepsy with abnormal MR imaging; 12 patients had probable symptomatic epilepsy based on an abnormal neurological exam; 33 patients had normal neurological development, normal neurological examination and normal neuroimaging. Twenty-two of these 33 patients satisfied criteria for idiopathic occipital syndromes: Panayiotopoulos syndrome (9 patients), Gastaut type idiopathic childhood occipital epilepsy (12 patients) and idiopathic photosensitive occipital epilepsy (1 patient). Eleven patients could not be classified. Early age of seizure onset and an abnormal neurological examination were significant predictors of abnormal MR imaging. None of the variables examined were strong predictors of seizure outcome.

Early age of seizure onset and an abnormal neurological examination are the best predictors of abnormal MR imaging in children with epilepsy with occipital features.
