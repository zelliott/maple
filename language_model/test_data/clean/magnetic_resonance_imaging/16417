Inflammatory pseudotumor is a rare non-neoplastic mass that may clinically and radiologically mimic a spectrum of benign and malignant neoplasms. It is uncommon in the head and neck and particularly rare at the skull base. We present a case of pseudotumor originating from the trigeminal nerve in a patient who presented with headache and facial numbness. A high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose this benign but locally aggressive entity.
