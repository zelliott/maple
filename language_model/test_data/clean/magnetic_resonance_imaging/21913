We report a case of a child with Noonan phenotype and incidental radiographic findings of mediastinal neuroblastoma. Recent studies have reported an increased association of Noonan syndrome with some malignancies, and the case we present here is the first reported case to our knowledge of an association of neuroblastoma with Noonan syndrome.
