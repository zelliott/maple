The role of magnetic resonance imaging in evaluating shoulder arthropathies is evolving. This article reviews 4 of the major arthropathies: septic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) deposition disease, and hydroxyapatite disease (HAD), with special attention to their magnetic resonance imaging features. Comfort with identifying these entities allows appropriate and prompt treatment, which is critical for joint preservation in the case of infection, for maximal therapeutic efficacy of disease-modifying drugs in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, and for expediting symptomatic relief in the cases of CPPD deposition disease and HAD.
