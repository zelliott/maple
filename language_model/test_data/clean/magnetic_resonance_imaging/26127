We used a free vascularized small periosteal bone graft to treat scaphoid nonunion. The graft consisted of periosteum, full-thickness cortex, and the underlying cancellous bone and was harvested from the supracondylar region of the femur. The graft was nourished by the articular branch of the descending geniculate artery and vein. Unlike the currently used vascularized bone grafts, this graft can be easily harvested and shaped to accommodate the bone defect of the scaphoid without disturbing its vascularity and can then be transferred with microvascular anastomosis of the nutrient vessels to the radial artery and its venae commitantes. Ten patients with longstanding nonunion of the scaphoid secondary to avascular necrosis, confirmed by radiologic and intraoperative findings, were treated with this vascularized bone graft. Union was achieved in all 10 patients at an average of 12 weeks after surgery. The average follow-up period for all fractures was 3.5 years. The scores for overall outcome, according to the Mayo wrist scoring system, were excellent in 4 patients, good in 4, and fair in 2. Two unsatisfied patients had preoperative signs of early periscaphoid osteoarthrosis. This free vascularized small bone graft from the supracondylar region of the femur is an attractive alternative to the conventional vascularized bone grafting procedures.
