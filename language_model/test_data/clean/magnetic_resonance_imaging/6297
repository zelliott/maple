Gradient echo images of coronal sections through the brains of normal rats have been recorded at 2.0 T both before and at various times after intravenous bolus administrations of a superparamagnetic iron oxide suspension. The decrease in NMR signal due to the transit of the contrast agent has been quantified as a function of time. The image immediately following the injection can be subtracted from that pre-contrast to reveal regional differences related to blood flow.
