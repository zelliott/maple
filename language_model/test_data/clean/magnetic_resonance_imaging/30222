The central nervous system's (CNS) involvement is uncommon in Hodgkin's disease (HD) and usually occurs in patients with relapsing disease many years after the initial diagnosis. An isolated involvement of the CNS is extremely rare and therefore, difficult to diagnosis. We report the case of a 27-year-old woman with seizure and a left cerebrodural mass on the cerebral imaging; secondarily, she developed cervical lymph node swelling; histological examination of the node revealed HD of the nodular sclerosis type. The dural lesion resolved after chemotherapy for HD.
