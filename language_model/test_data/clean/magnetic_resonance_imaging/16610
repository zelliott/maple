Physical and rehabilitation medicine physicians commonly see patients with chronic functional ankle instability. The main anatomical structures involved in ankle stability are the peroneus (fibularis) brevis and peroneus longus muscles. Several anatomical muscle-tendon variations have been described in the literature as being sometimes responsible for this instability, the peroneus quartus muscle being the most frequent. The objective of this clinical study is to discuss the implication of the bilateral peroneus quartus muscle in functional ankle instability.

This 26-year-old patient was seen in PM&R consultation for recurrent episodes of lateral ankle sprains. The clinical examination found a moderate hyperlaxity on the right side in bilateral ankle varus. We also noted a bilateral weakness of the peroneus muscles. Additional imaging examinations showed a supernumerary bilateral peroneus quartus. The electroneuromyogram of the peroneus muscles was normal.

In the literature the incidence of a supernumerary peroneus quartus muscle varies from 0 to 21.7%. Most times this muscle is asymptomatic and is only fortuitously discovered. However some cases of chronic ankle pain or instability have been reported in the literature. It seems relevant to discuss, around the clinical case of this patient, the impact of this muscle on ankle instability especially when faced with lingering weakness of the peroneus brevis and longus muscles in spite of eccentric strength training and in the absence of any neurological impairment. One of the hypotheses, previously described in the literature, would be the overcrowding effect resulting in a true conflict by reducing the available space for the peroneal muscles in the peroneal sheath.
