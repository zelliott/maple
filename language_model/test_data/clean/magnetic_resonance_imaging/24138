The objective is to present our initial experience with the combination of three-dimensional time-resolved contrast-enhanced MR angiography and T1-weighted spin-echo imaging for investigation of vascular compression related to thoracic outlet syndrome.

In patients with clinical signs of thoracic outlet syndrome suggesting vascular elongation or compression, this technique proves to be robust, and its results are comparable to those of conventional catheter angiography. Our results allow precise identification of the anatomic structure(s) responsible for the clinical symptoms and show the effect of arm hyperabduction on the patency of the subclavian vessels.
