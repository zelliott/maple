PARACEST redox sensors containing the NAD(+)/NADH mimic N-methylquinolinium moiety as a redox-active functional group have been designed and synthesized. The Eu(3+) complex with two quinolinium moieties was nearly completely CEST-silent in the oxidized form but was "turned on" upon reduction with Î²-NADH. The CEST effect of the Eu(3+) complex containing only one quinolinium group was much less redox-responsive but showed an unexpected sensitivity to pH in the physiologically relevant pH range.
