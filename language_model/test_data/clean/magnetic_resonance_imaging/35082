Nodular fasciitis is a benign reactive proliferation that is frequently misdiagnosed as a sarcoma. This article describes a case of nodular fasciitis of 6-month duration located in the cheek, which degenerated and spontaneously regressed after biopsy. The nodule was fixed to the zygoma but was free from the overlying skin. The mass was 3.0 cm in diameter and demonstrated high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. A small part of the lesion was biopsied. Pathological and immunohistochemical examinations identified the nodule as nodular fasciitis with myxoid histology. One month after the biopsy, the mass showed decreased signal intensity on T2-weighted images and measured 2.2 cm in size. The signal on T2-weighted images showed time-dependent decreases, and the mass continued to reduce in size throughout the follow-up period. The lesion presented as hypointense to the surrounding muscles on T2-weighted images and was 0.4 cm in size at 2 years of follow-up. This case demonstrates that nodular fasciitis with myxoid histology can change to that with fibrous appearance gradually with time, thus bringing about spontaneous regression. Degeneration may be involved in the spontaneous regression of nodular fasciitis with myxoid appearance. The mechanism of regression, unclarified at present, should be further studied.
