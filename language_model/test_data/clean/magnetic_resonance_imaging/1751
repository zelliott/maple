Dissemination of primary cutaneous nocardiosis is a rare event. An interesting case of a 20 year old female labourer with progressive weakness in both the lower limbs and large multiple subcutaneous abscesses over the back, since 4 years, is presented. MRI showed an epidural abscess compressing the cord. Histopathology of skin lesions suggested a chronic suppurative lesion. Microbiological tests on the aspirate from the skin lesion identified the causative organism as Nocardia brasiliensis.
