Choroid plexus papillomas represent approximately 0.5% of all intracranial tumors, but they are found in the third ventricle only infrequently. We report a case of choroid plexus papilloma in the third ventricle which is difficult to differentiate from a pineal region tumor. A 4-month-old female presented with bulging fontanelle and sunset phenomenon. A CT scan and MRI showed marked hydrocephalus caused by a tumor extending from the posterior third ventricle to the peneal body. Preoperatively, we diagnosed the lesion as a pineoblastoma. The tumor was totally removed through the occipital transtentorial approach. Pathological examination of the tumor revealed a typical choroid plexus papilloma. The operation was uneventful, and she has grown normally without recurrence of the tumor for three years since the operation. A sagittal gadolinium-enhanced MRI was useful in our case to differentiate a choroid plexus papilloma from a pineal region tumor, because the former extended into the aqueduct forming the shape of the letter V while the latter compressed the aqueduct downward.
