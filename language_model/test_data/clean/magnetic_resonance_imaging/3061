Hemangiopericytomas (HPs) are rare tumors, about 10% of which occur in children. Since 1988, 2 children with intracranial HP have been seen at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The patients presented at ages 2 weeks and 1 month. Both were treated with surgery alone. We also review 4 cases previously reported in the literature; at presentation, those patients were ages 2 days to 9 months. Infantile HPs have a better prognosis than do those that occur in adults, and an improved outcome is also evident for intracranial lesions. Tumors that occur in the neonatal period may be treated with surgery alone; however, those that occur after the neonatal period may be more likely to recur.
