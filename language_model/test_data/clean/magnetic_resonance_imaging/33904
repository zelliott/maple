We describe a case of articular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with malignant lymphoma cells observed in synovial fluid. Bone involvement in NHL is common, but an English language Medline search revealed only 14 reported cases of synovial NHL. Although NHL is a well recognized complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, this is the first report of synovial NHL in an HIV infected patient.
