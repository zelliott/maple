A 76-year-old patient with chronic and severe spinal cord compression secondary to cervical stenosis, a cervical osteophyte, and a herniated intervertebral cervical disk had lasting resolution of symptoms after completing a specific, martial art-based, physical therapy program. We wanted to determine if there were structural changes in the cervical spine that could account for the prompt resolution of symptoms.

A 76-year-old female completed 8 weeks of a specific, martial art-based, physical therapy. The pretherapy and posttherapy cervical magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were compared. A follow-up evaluation was done at 1 year.

The patient was symptom-free within 8 weeks of the start of therapy. She remained symptom-free at 1 year follow-up evaluation. There were no obvious structural differences in the pretherapy and posttherapy MRI studies.

Resolution of symptoms was directly related to the specific martial art therapy. However, there were no changes in the pretherapy and posttherapy MRI studies, suggesting a significant adaptation to the spinal compression had occurred. These data suggest a viable option to surgery in elderly patients with chronic and severe cervical spinal stenosis.
