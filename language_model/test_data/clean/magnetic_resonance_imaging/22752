A 15-year-old boy presented with a dermoid cyst in the left temporal lobe manifesting as complex partial seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a tumor with mixed signal intensity in the left anterior temporal subdural area, but no evidence of rupture. Intraoperatively, the tumor was located mainly in the deep sylvian fissure, adjacent to the amygdala, and had compressed the hippocampus. Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) showed sporadic interictal spikes in both the adjacent areas of the tumor and over the anterior segment of the hippocampus. Total removal of the tumor and gliotic area of the surrounding tissue including the amygdala was performed. The hippocampal epileptic region was treated by transection of the pyramidal layer to preserve verbal memory function. Histological examination showed the dermoid tumor was closely attached to the brain parenchyma. The complex partial seizures ceased completely after surgery. Intraoperative recording of ECoG from the hippocampus and other limbic structures was very important to determine the epileptogenic area even if the tumor did not directly invade the hippocampus.
