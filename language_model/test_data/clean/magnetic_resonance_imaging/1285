Aneurysm formation may complicate aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass grafts. Because of multiplanar imaging capabilities and the potential for flow evaluation, magnetic resonance (MR) is useful as a noninvasive diagnostic technique. Two cases of pseudoaneurysm formation were evaluated by MR and demonstrate the clinical value of this modality.
