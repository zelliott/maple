We report a case of mixed squamous-cell carcinoma with adenocarcinoma of the female urethra. A 37 year old women who presented with a 3-month' history of obstructive voiding symptoms. Clinical investigation showed a urethra tumor of 2.5 x 3.5 cm. Needle biopsy revealed a grade 3 carcinoma. Staging resulted in local cancer disease, a 2.5 x 3.5 cm tumor surrounding the whole urethra with protruding the trigonum. We performed urethrectomy with resection of the bladderneck and cystoneostomy. During bladderneck resection we performed regional staging lymphadenectomy of the obturator lymph nodes. Histological investigation revealed a mixed squamous-cell carcinoma with adenocarcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma of the urethra. Periurethral tissue showed lymphangiosis carcinomatosa with negative lymph nodes. To exclude involvement of regional superficial lymph nodes we subsequently performed modified inguinal lymphadenectomy without evidence of advanced cancer disease.
