To determine the role of MR imaging in the assessment of pancreatic transplant rejection, we prospectively obtained 13 MR scans in nine transplant patients. The presence of rejection was verified pathologically by pancreatic transplant biopsies in five patients. In two additional patients, rejection was proved by concordant renal transplant biopsy as well as by compatible clinical and laboratory data. In the remaining two patients, in whom no biopsy was done, clinical and laboratory data showed no evidence of rejection. The mean T2 of the seven pancreata undergoing rejection was significantly elevated (86 msec) compared with the mean T2 of the two transplants not undergoing rejection (59 msec) (p less than .002). These preliminary results suggest that MR may be useful in the noninvasive diagnosis of pancreatic rejection.
