Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumour in adults. Since 2005 surgery followed by radiotherapy with concomitant Temozolomide (TMZ) is the standard care for patients with a GBM. Despite these improved treatment strategies, survival of GBM-patients remains poor; and there are very few patients who survive for a long time. Also there is no standard therapeutic strategy after six cycles of TMZ, and further treatment is at the physician's discretion. We report a case of a young patient with a glioblastoma who, not only showed dramatic clinical and radiological improvement after TMZ treatment but who now also (under continued TMZ therapy) survives over 6 years, with complete remission clinically and radiologically. Up till now there are no studies describing TMZ treatment in GBM patients for as long as 6 years.
