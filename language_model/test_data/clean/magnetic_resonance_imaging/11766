Pain in all three divisions of the trigeminal nerve is in over 65% of all cases the first symptom of a tumour in Meckel's cave. Tumors in this location make up only 0,5% of all intracranial tumours. The most common are trigeminal schwannomas and meningeomas. A metastases as a cause of trigeminal pain is a rare description in the literature so far. We describe a patient with trigeminal pain and a tumour in Meckels's cave shown in the MRI, who were operated in our department. The histological examination of the tumour resulted in the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma of an until then unknown oesophaguscarcinoma. - Although metastatic tumours are rare, we could show with our case, that they have to be included in differential dignostic considerations.
