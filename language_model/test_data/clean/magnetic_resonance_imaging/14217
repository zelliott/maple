The authors present a case report on a cartilage producing tumor of bone. Because of its rare nature and atypical form afflicting the foot, diagnosis is a challenge. Often baseline examinations such as xerograms, radiographs, and blood values will not present all of the information necessary for diagnosis. However, when coupled with magnetic resonance imaging, CT scan and/or bone scan, information important to the staging and preparation for definitive treatment can be secured, although many lesions of bone cannot be definitively diagnosed until such time that a histologic examination is performed.
