Ankylosing spondylitis is a systemic rheumatologic disorder of adults that results in disease-specific inflammation and eventual ossification at the site of ligamentous insertion into bone. The resulting spinal ankylosis causes biomechanical alterations that predispose the patient to serious spinal injury even in the presence of minor trauma. With the loss of spinal flexibility and increased bone fragility, there is a propensity for vertebral fracture, instability, and increased neurologic complications. Illustrative examples of the imaging modalities are presented, as they contribute to the detection of fractures and spinal cord injuries in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.
