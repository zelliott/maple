We report a case of complete unilateral anomalous connection of the left pulmonary veins to the coronary sinus with unroofed coronary sinus syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was a useful diagnostic method in our case. At operation, a cut was made from the orifice of the coronary sinus to the unroofed portion of the coronary sinus, and part of the lower atrial septum was excised. The resulting defect was closed with a Dacron patch, diverting the left pulmonary venous blood into the left atrium.
