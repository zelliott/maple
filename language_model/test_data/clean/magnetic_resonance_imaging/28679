To assess the ability of bone scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict the outcome of transtrochanteric rotational osteotomy (TRO) for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH).

This study was a prospective evaluation of imaging techniques.

MRI and bone scintigraphy were performed on 20 hips in 18 patients at 3 months after TRO. The radiographic findings at 3 months after TRO, and the MRI and bone scintigraphic findings, were compared with the radiographic findings at final follow-up (mean 39 months).

On MRI a low-intensity area or a low-intensity band in the new weight-bearing area extending over the acetabular edge on T1-weighted images was related to the presence of collapse on the radiographs at final follow-up. In hips with an area of absent activity in the new weight-bearing surface on bone scintigraphy, collapse was seen more frequently on radiographs at final follow-up than in hips without this feature. Bone scintigraphy was no more specific than radiography in predicting the outcome after TRO. We consider MRI to be superior to bone scintigraphy in predicting the occurrence of collapse, which is one of the major short-term problems after TRO.
