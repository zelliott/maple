Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the modality of choice for evaluating the soft tissues of the thigh and leg because of its superior soft tissue contrast resolution, multiplanar imaging capability, and lack of ionizing radiation. The superb image quality facilitates learning normal imaging anatomy, which ultimately forms the foundation of diagnostic interpretation. The purpose of this article is twofold: (1) depict normal MR anatomy throughout the thigh and leg using representative MR images, emphasizing a compartmental approach; and (2) describe and explain the rationale of standard imaging protocols.
