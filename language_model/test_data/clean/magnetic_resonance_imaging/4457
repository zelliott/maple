The value of MRI for the detection of knee osteophytosis was determined in an animal osteoarthritis model.

10 dogs with experimentally induced unilateral osteoarthritis of the knee were investigated with MRI including 2-D-spin echo (SE) and 3-D-gradient echo (GE) imaging. The results were correlated with gross and histopathologic findings and with radiography.

Osteophyte formation appeared early in the osteoarthritic process. Pathological analysis yielded 65 osteophytes. With 3-D-GE imaging, 91% of the osteophytes were detected, while 68% were visible on 2-D-SE images. With two-level radiography, 43% of the osteophytes were diagnosed. Additional use of tunnel view and conventional tomography increased the detection rate to 65%. Independent of the imaging technique, MRI revealed three different signal patterns of the osteophyte bone structure. Compared with the histologically evident fat marrow content and the grade of bone sclerosis, best agreement was achieved with 2-D-SE sequences. However, a discrepancy remained in 22%. A fibrocartilaginous layer at the osteophyte surface could be delineated especially on 3-D-GE images.

MRI provides the highest standard in non-invasive diagnosis of osteophytes in the knee. 3-D-GE imaging in particular can demonstrate early and small osteophyte formation.
