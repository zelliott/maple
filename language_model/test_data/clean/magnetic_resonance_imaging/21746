We present here magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography with 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP-SPECT) of a patient suffering from Klinefelter's syndrome with various neuropsychiatric symptoms. He was a 30-year-old male, who showed impaired consciousness seizures, auditory hallucination, delusion of reference, delusion of grandeur, psychomotor excitement and intellectual impairment. Although no focal lesion was detected by computed tomography or T1-weighted MRI, T2-weighted MRI provided a heterogeneous high-signal-intensity lesion of the inferior part of the left temporal lobe, which was not enhanced with Gd-DTPA. In addition 123I-IMP-SPECT exhibited focal hypoperfusion in the left temporal lobe on the early images. We suggest that the neuropsychiatric symptoms of this case are associated with the focal organic brain dysfunction which was revealed by MRI and 123I-IMP-SPECT.
