To determine the effects of intravenous natalizumab and intramuscular interferon beta-1a (IFNβ-1a) on the volume of white-matter (WM) lesions and normal appearing brain tissue (NABT) undergoing voxel-wise (VW) increases in magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) suggestive of remyelination in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis.

This prospective, open-label, single-blinded study enrolled patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (RSPMS) as well as a group of age/sex-matched healthy controls (n=22). Patients with multiple sclerosis were assigned to receive natalizumab monotherapy (n=77; RRMS/RSPMS) or intramuscular IFNβ-1a (n=26) as either monotherapy (RRMS) or combined with pulsed i.v. methylprednisolone, as needed (RSPMS). The primary endpoint was the two-year change in volume of NABT VWMTR, by quantifying the number of voxels that increased (suggesting remyelination) or decreased (suggesting demyelination) in their MTR value.

The volume of tissue undergoing increases in VWMTR was significantly larger in natalizumab compared with IFNβ-1a-treated patients (year 1: p=0.001 in NABT and p<0.006 in WM lesions; year 2: p=0.008 in NABT) and compared with healthy control subjects (year 1: p=0.05 and year 2: p=0.007 in NABT). The larger volume within NABT undergoing decreases in VWMTR was detected in multiple sclerosis patients compared with healthy controls (p<0.001), and in the IFNβ-1a group compared with the natalizumab group (year 1: p=0.05; year 2: p=0.002). One patient on natalizumab died from progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy eight months after completing the study.

Natalizumab may promote remyelination and stabilize demyelination in lesions and NABT in relapsing multiple sclerosis, compared with intramuscular IFNβ-1a.
