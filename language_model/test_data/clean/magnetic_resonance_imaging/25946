Intraosseous neurinoma is very uncommon tumor. Its location in the skull is extremely rare. A 4-year-old boy presented with a lump in the right occipital region. Computed tomography revealed a soft tissue mass with bony erosion in the right occipital bone. The solid, nontender, and immobile mass was totally removed. The pathological examination showed that it was an intraosseous neurinoma. Total resection of intraosseous neurinomas is sufficient treatment and is not followed by recurrence.
