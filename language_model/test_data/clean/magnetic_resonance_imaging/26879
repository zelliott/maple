Marinesco-Sj√∂gren syndrome (MSS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, congenital cataracts, mental retardation, primary hypogonadism, skeletal abnormalities and myopathy, and patients with MSS are considered to be at risk of falls and bone fractures. We report a patient with MSS who received testosterone replacement therapy and risedronate administration. Muscle strength and the MRI features of the skeletal muscles were not changed, but low bone mass was improved by these treatments, and improvement has continued after risedronate treatment alone. This case suggests that treatment of MSS-related low bone mass using bisphosphonates is likely beneficial.
