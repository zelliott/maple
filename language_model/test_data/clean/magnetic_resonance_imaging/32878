The aim of this study was to gage the magnitude of changes of the apparent renal medullary transverse relaxation time (ΔT(2)) induced by inhalation of pure oxygen (O(2) ) or carbogen (95% O(2) , 5% CO(2) ) versus baseline breathing of room air. Eight healthy volunteers underwent 2D multi-gradient echo MR imaging at 1.5 T and 3.0 T. Parametrical T(2) relaxation time maps were computed and average T(2) was measured in regions of interest placed in the renal medulla and cortex. The largest T(2) changes were measured in the renal medulla, with a relative ∆T(2) of 33.8 ± 22.0% (right medulla) and 34.7 ± 17.6% (left medulla) as compared to room air for oxygen breathing (p > 0.01), and 53.8 ± 23.9% and 53.5 ± 33.9% (p < 0.01) for carbogen breathing, respectively at 3 T. At 1.5 T, the corresponding values were 13.7 ± 18.5% and 24.1 ± 17.1% (p < 0.01) for oxygen breathing and 23.9 ± 17.2% and 38.9 ± 37.6% (p < 0.01) for carbogen breathing. As a result, we showed that renal medullary T(2) times responded strongly to inhalation of hyperoxic gases, which may be attributed to the hypoxic condition of the medulla and subsequent reduction in deoxyhemoglobin.
