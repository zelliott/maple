Since considerable expansion of hematopoietic marrow occurs in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA), magnetic resonance images of 20 hips in 10 patients with known homozygous SCA were reviewed to determine a) if low signal hematopoietic marrow extended into the femoral capital epiphysis and b) if the MR characteristics of avascular necrosis (AVN) differed depending on the type of epiphyseal marrow. Our results revealed variable epiphyseal marrow type; mixed (fatty and hematopoietic) marrow (42%), fatty marrow (32%), hematopoietic marrow (16%) and hemosiderotic marrow (10%). AVN occurred irrespective of the underlying marrow. Segmental areas of low signal intensity in variable shapes (ring, band, crescent or large homogeneous area) was the most consistent MR manifestation of AVN in SCA. A low signal intensity peripheral rim surrounding a central zone, isointense with epiphyseal marrow on T1 and T2 weighted images, was most frequently observed similar to that described in patients without hemoglobinopathy. The notable difference, however, was of segmental areas within the same femoral head that demonstrated variable central zone signal on T2 weighted images. Further, while an increase in hip joint fluid is commonly seen with both early and advanced AVN in patients without hemoglobinopathy; it was increased in only one hip in patients with SCA. The observed differences in MR characteristics may be due to different pathophysiology of AVN in patients with SCA.
