The outcome of liver resections depends on complete removal of all detectable foci. Our aim was to determine the value of preoperative routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for complete detection of hepatic lesions.

We compared 271 lesions seen on MRI in 182 patients to intraoperative findings (including intraoperative ultrasonography) and histology.

The overall rate of lesions was 7% each for segments 2 and 3, as compared to 14-17% each for segments 5, 6, 7, and 8. Twenty-three additional lesions were found intraoperatively, two thirds of them in the left lobe (mean size: 1.4 cm; mean total number of lesions in those patients: 2.2). In segments 2 and 3, the relative frequency for intraoperative diagnosis of additional lesions was 17% and 20%, respectively. On the other hand, most of the 15 MRI lesions not verified intra- or postoperatively had been described in the right hepatic lobe (maximum: segment 6).

MRI provided reliable preoperative lesion detection. Special attention should be paid to segments 2 and 3, which showed a lower total number of lesions but an elevated relative frequency of intraoperatively detected additional foci.
