A 43-year-old man with a primary leiomyosarcoma of the left sphenoid sinus is presented. To our knowledge, this is an unusual case of leiomyosarcoma, which has never been reported in the literature. Accurate and safe diagnosis was obtained by an endonasal endoscopic approach with minimal tissue invasion.
