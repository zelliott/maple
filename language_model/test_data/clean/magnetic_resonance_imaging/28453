Since the beginning of bone marrow conversion presents with substantial differences as shown by anatomical or magnetic resonance studies, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate via MRI an age-dependent bone marrow conversion of the tibia in children of up to two years of age.

We studied the bone marrows of the tibia in 24 children ranging from one month to two years by means of MRI. T1-weighted SE-sequences were used. Children who suffered from diseases affecting the bone marrow were excluded. A retrospective analysis of the MR images was performed.

A gradual increase of signal intensity could be demonstrated in the epiphyses and the diaphysis of the tibia beginning shortly after birth. During the first two years of life a further increase of signal intensity could be observed in these regions, progressing through metaphyses up to the growth plates.

First signs of bone marrow conversion can be detected in the tibia shortly after birth. Bone marrow infiltration in the tibia is expected to be recognised by MRI from this time onward.
