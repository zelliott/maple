Mucolipidosis type III (ML-III) is a lysosomal storage disease often presenting with joint involvement. We report the MRI appearance of the hips in two siblings with ML-III showing abnormal signal intensity within the hips with increased synovial thickness. Although the etiology is uncertain this may reflect a fibrous response to ML-III.
