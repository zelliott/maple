We describe three cases of central diabetes insipidus, each with a different pathogenesis, in which unexpected hyperintensity of the posterior pituitary gland was seen on T1-weighted MR images obtained at the time of presentation. In the first case (idiopathic), the posterior pituitary signal persisted more than 10 years; in the second case (Langerhans cell histiocytosis), the signal disappeared within 3 months, despite early specific chemotherapy with etoposide; and in the third case (transient), the posterior signal disappeared within 1 year, but it was documented at the time of spontaneous reversal of polyuria and polydipsia.
