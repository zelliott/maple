A technique for posterior cervical hemilaminectomy reconstruction is described.

To describe a technique for reconstruction of cervical hemilaminae in an adult that resulted in osseous fusion and to suggest modifications for use in children.

Although uncommon, cervical hemilaminectomy can result in spine deformity. Re-establishment of the osseous and ligamentous structures should minimize this problem.

After excision of an intraspinal neurenteric cyst, removed cervical hemilaminae at C2 and C3 were reconstructed with metal plates, and posterior ligaments were reapproximated with suture.

Radiologic evidence of osseous fusion was present at 1 year after surgery.

The advantages of this technique are restoration of normal anatomy, technical ease, and simplicity. A modification of this technique in children by using absorbable rather than metal plates should allow for normal spine growth.
