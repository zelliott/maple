We report two patients with refractory epilepsy who developed unilateral painful gynecomastia and lower extremity pain (one of them localized and the other one diffuse), shortly after receiving Pregabalin (PGB). Neither of them had previous endocrinologic problems or complaints about pain on their medical history. PGB was stopped in one patient and reduced in the other one, with complete disparition of the symptoms in the following weeks in both patients. This supports the hypothesis that gynecomastia could be a drug-induced and easy to manage secondary effect of PGB, with a higher incidence than observed on previous clinical trials.
