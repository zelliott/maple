The anterior iliac crest is the harvest site preferred by many surgeons because of the quantity and quality of bone obtainable and the simplicity of harvesting techniques. Avulsion fracture of the iliac crest following bone grafting is an extremely rare occurrence. We present a case report of avulsion fracture of the anterior iliac crest following bone graft harvesting for anterior cervical fusion in a 63-year-old man. Non-operative treatment was the method of our treatment in the patient. By means of the presented case, iliac crest bone grafting techniques, risk factors of avulsion fracture, and treatment options were reviewed.
