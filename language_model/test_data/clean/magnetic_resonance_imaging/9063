This report concerns a 26-year-old Italian woman who was given the diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis after the incidental identification of an ovarian tumour. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and hyperkinetic movements are very commonly seen as initial symptoms of paraneoplastic encephalitis. Interestingly, our patient showed stereotypical movements predominantly located to lower limbs, mimicking a psychogenic seizure. This latter feature further extends the clinical spectrum of dyskinetic movements of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
