Differentiation between solitary metastatic lesions and glioblastomas, two of the most common malignant brain neoplasms, is often a diagnostic challenge. The purpose of this review is to emphasize the potential roles of advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, including diffusion-based techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), exponential DWI, and diffusion tensor imaging, MR perfusion, and MR spectroscopy, as well as conventional MRI, in making a distinction between glioblastomas and solitary metastases in peritumoural regions. Integration of advanced MRI features with conventional MRI, may provide valuable information for differentiating glioblastoma from solitary metastatic lesions.
