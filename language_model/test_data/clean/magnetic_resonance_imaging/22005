To determine whether contrast-enhanced and fat-suppressed sequences contribute to the MR imaging diagnosis of parametrial invasion.

21 patients with carcinoma of the cervix were prospectively examined with a phased-array coil and a 1.5T MR-scanner using the following sequences: transverse T2-weighted turbo spin echo (T2-TSE), T1-weighted spin echo (T1-SE) and fat suppressed T1-weighted SE sequences before and after Gd-DTPA. The sequences were evaluated separately for the presence of parametrial invasion. Image quality and diagnostic confidence were classified on a scale of 0-10 (nondiagnostic-excellent). Findings were compared to the results of the pathohistological examination.

Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy were highest for T2-TSE sequences (100%, 79% and 86%, respectively). Contrast-enhanced T1-SE sequences with fat-suppression (71%, 79%, and 76%) showed no improvement compared to T2-TSE. Unenhanced fat-suppressed T1-SE (100%, 30%, and 56%) and unenhanced T1-SE (100%, 7%, and 38%) as well as contrast-enhanced T1-SE (86%, 20%, and 47%) were significantly worse than T2-TSE. With similar image quality (p < 0.05) diagnostic confidence was higher on T2-TSE than on any of the other sequences (p < 0.001).

Considering the cost-effectiveness of the examination, for the MR diagnosis of parametrial invasion the use of fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced sequences can be abandoned in favour of T2-weighted TSE sequences.
