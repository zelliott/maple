We report on a 46-year-old athletic patient, previously treated with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, with large degenerative chondral lesions of the medial femoral condyle, trochlea and patella, which was successfully treated with a closing-wedge high tibial osteotomy and the implant of a newly developed biomimetic nanostructured osteochondral bioactive scaffold. After 1 year of follow-up the patient was pain-free, had full knee range of motion, and had returned to his pre-operation level of athletic activity. MRI evaluation at 6 months showed that the implant gave a hyaline-like signal as well as a good restoration of the articular surface, with minimal subchondral bone oedema. Subchondral oedema was almost non-visible at 12 months.
