In this report, a rare case of a child with cerebellar infarction (CI) confirmed by vertebral angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and N-isopropyl-p123-I-iodoamphetamine single photon emission tomography (IMP-SPECT) is presented. It was concluded that although all imaging modalities could demonstrate CI, MRI is superior to the other methods because of its fine display of anatomical detail, its lack of bony artifacts and its ability to show infarction in early stages.
