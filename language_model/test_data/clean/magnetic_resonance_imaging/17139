High-resolution analyser-based X-ray imaging computed tomography (HR ABI-CT) findings on in vitro human breast cancer are compared with histopathology, mammography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. The HR ABI-CT images provided significantly better low-contrast visibility compared with the standard radiological images. Fine cancer structures indistinguishable and superimposed in mammograms were seen, and could be matched with the histopathological results. The mean glandular dose was less than 1 mGy in mammography and 12-13 mGy in CT and ABI-CT. The excellent visibility of in vitro breast cancer suggests that HR ABI-CT may have a valuable role in the future as an adjunct or even alternative to current breast diagnostics, when radiation dose is further decreased, and compact synchrotron radiation sources become available.
