This study reviewed the clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Taiwanese patients from 1993 to 2001. Of the 75 MS patients with a mean age of onset of 35.6 +/- 12.6 years, the female-to-male ratio was 4.4 (61/14). In 42 (56%) optico-spinal MS (OS-MS) patients, the age of onset (37.6 +/- 11.1 years) tended to be older than conventional MS (C-MS) patients (33.1 +/- 14.1 years, P = 0.08). In 60 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens, raised IgG index (>0.7) and oligoclonal bands were noted in 26 (43.3%) and two (3.3%) cases, respectively. The frequency of raised IgG index was lower in OS-MS (31.3%) than in C-MS (57.1%, P = 0.07). The CSF total protein concentrations were significantly higher in OS-MS (64.5 mg/dL) than in C-MS (46.6 mg/dL, P = 0.047). The mean annual relapse rate was 54.1%, and was significantly higher within the first year (59.7%, P < 0.001). The mean annual relapse rate in OS-MS (62.7%) was significantly higher than in C-MS (41.2%, P=0.01). The differences in the annual relapse rate and total protein concentration in CSF between OS-MS and C-MS suggest probably two distinct immunopathogenesis. The higher first year relapse rate of MS patients in Taiwan may address the importance of early intervention with immunomodulatory therapy.
