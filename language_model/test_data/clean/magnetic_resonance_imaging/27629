Nodular fasciitis (NF) is a pseudosarcomatous lesion typically involving the subcutaneous tissue and fascia; rarely, it has been observed within a parotid gland. We report a case of NF in an 8-year-old boy who presented with a rapidly growing nodule in the right parotid gland. A preoperative fine-needle aspiration suggested a diagnosis of nodular (pseudosarcomatous) fasciitis. After fine-needle aspiration, the surgical excision of nodule with a conservative approach was made. Intraparotid NF was diagnosed by histopathologic examination confirming the former cytologic diagnosis. This case demonstrates that NF, although rarely may occur in unusual site as parotid gland, in cases of rapidly growing tumor masses in the parotid, a correct cytologic diagnosis in the fine-needle aspirate might spare unnecessary aggressive surgical treatment.
