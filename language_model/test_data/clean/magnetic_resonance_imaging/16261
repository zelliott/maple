We describe a patient in whom dysnomia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, sensory impairment, and severe gait imbalance resulted from an isolated left lentiform nucleus-posterior limb of internal capsule lacunar stroke. Each of these deficits has been described as a consequence of unilateral basal ganglia or internal capsule infarction in prior reports, but the combination of these findings in one patient is unusual. Accurate localization of the lesion to the anterior circulation has potential therapeutic implications.
