Parry-Romberg syndrome is a rare condition characterized by progressive, hemifacial atrophy, hair loss, enophthalmos, retinal vasculopathy occasionally associated with hemicranial pain syndrome (secondary trigeminal neuralgia). The cause of the condition is unknown; however, substantial evidence suggests that vasculopathy plays a significant role in the genesis of the neurologic damage and facial lipodystrophy. Herein describes a case of Parry-Romberg syndrome treated with repetitive botulinum type A toxin injections, with almost complete resolution of severe chronic pain.
