After five young women were exposed to pyralene and its thermal degradation products all developed a rich functional syndrome which could be explained by the traumatic effect of the accident. Nevertheless, in 3 of the women, abnormal somesthetic evoked potentials were observed including 2 with neurological lesions detectable radiologically. Polychlorobiphenyl derivates are toxic for the peripheral nervous system as has been observed in several recent exposure situations. Inversely, any effect on the central nervous system is still under debate.
