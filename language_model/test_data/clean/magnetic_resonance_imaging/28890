We report a case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the bladder in a 29-year-old woman with gross hematuria that was considered as embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma on biopsy specimens. MRI demonstrated a polypoid tumor covered by clot, which disrupted the low intensity of the bladder wall. The lesion exhibited an intermediate signal on T1-weighted images and prominent high intensity on T2-weighted images and was markedly enhanced. A pathologic study revealed a tumor of myxoid stroma invading into the deep muscular layer of the bladder wall.
