Cerebrospinal fluid leaks from defects in the anterior cranial fossa present a difficult management problem. Particularly when the defects are large, conventional techniques may not be sufficient to close them. We describe a new technique for treating such CSF leaks using a composite mucochondral flap from the nasal septum.

We treated five patients with the composite mucochondral flap. All patients were women aged 29-60 years. Two patients had an encephalocele, one had an esthesioneuroblastoma, and one had adenocarcinoma; one leak was spontaneous.

The CSF leak was successfully closed in all five patients. No patients have experienced recurrence; the longest follow-up has been 39 months. The donor site on the septum healed without complication in all patients.

The composite flap is useful for repairing large defects or after radiotherapy or trauma. The advantage of skeletal support to counter the pressure exerted by CSF seems clear.
