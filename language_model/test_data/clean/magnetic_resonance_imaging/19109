Benign lymphoepithelial cysts (BLCs) of the parotid gland are associated with human immunodeficiency virus infections in both children and adults. These cysts may become painful and unsightly, often initiating a request for therapeutic intervention. There are several treatment options described in the literature. We report the use of doxycycline sclerotherapy in the treatment of a child with BLCs of the parotid.
