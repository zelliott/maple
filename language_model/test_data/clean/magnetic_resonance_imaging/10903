A large solitary amyloidoma in the cervical epidural space without bony connection and with minimal spinal cord compression and no myelopathy, as a first manifestation of disseminated amyloidosis in a multiple myeloma patient, has not been reported previously; this case is thereby distinct from the seven prior reports in the world literature, of a solitary amyloidoma of the cervical spine.

A 72-year-old male, recently diagnosed with multiple myeloma, presented with a neuropathy that prompted a screening MRI of the cervical spine. This disclosed a large mass in the upper cervical epidural area felt to pose a high morbidity/mortality risk, leading to successful surgical removal of the amyloidoma mass. This then led to further testing that showed previously unsuspected widespread amyloidosis, which was subclinical up to that time.

In patients with a newly discovered amyloidoma, whether or not in the setting of known multiple myeloma, further evaluation should be done to detect the presence of amyloidosis. If the mass is discovered de novo, then an investigation should be carried out to determine if multiple myeloma, as well as amyloidosis, is present.
