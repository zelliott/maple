To evaluate the characteristics of MR imaging of hepatic lesions using measurement of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value of hepatic lesions on diffusion weighted imaging.

MR diffusion weighted images were obtained in patients with 97 hepatic lesions (22 hepatocellular carcinomas, 21 metastatic tumors, 28 hemangiomas, 26 cysts). ADC values were evaluated with different sequences. The ADC ratio of lesion/liver was estimated.

Average ADC values of hepatic lesions were as follows: carcinomas (0.91 +/- 0.07) x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, metastatic tumors (1.13 +/- 0.27) x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, cavernous hemangiomas (1.94 +/- 0.37) x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, cysts (3.26 +/- 0.30) x 10(-3) mm(2)/s. The ADC ratio of lesion/liver was significantly different between primary carcinomas and metastatic tumors (P < 0.05).

Quantitative study in hepatic lesions using ADC values and the ADC ratio of lesion/liver, would improve the accuracy in diagnosing hepatic lesions.
