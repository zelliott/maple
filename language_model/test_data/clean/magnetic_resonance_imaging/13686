Focal nonhemorrhagic lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum in a patient with epilepsy treated with antiepileptic drugs was observed with MRI imaging. We have found only one such case during the past 2 years (series of MRI examinations of approximately 500 patients with various forms of epilepsy).
