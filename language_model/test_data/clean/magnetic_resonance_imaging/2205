We present a case of spontaneous spinal epidural haematoma (SSEH) with a rare clinical course of repeated spontaneous recovery and relapse. The patient suffered three episodes of upper-back pain of sudden onset followed by sensory and motor dysfunction after weight lifting. In the first two episodes, the neurological deficits recovered spontaneously and completely. In the last episode, paraplegia persisted even after emergency surgery. Serial studies with computed tomographic (CT) myelography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the remitting and relapsing course of the SSEHs. The possible causes of the SSEHs and the mechanisms of spontaneous recovery are discussed.
