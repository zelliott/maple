Objective evidence for coronary lesion significance can be obtained with ischemic stress testing. Since flow-limiting stenoses have already undergone compensatory vasodilatation to maintain flow, the response to vasoactive stimulation is dampened. The degree of response limitation is reflected by the coronary flow reserve (CFR). Absolute volume flow rates can be accurately and noninvasively measured with MRI techniques. The purpose was to assess the ability to measure coronary volume flow rate noninvasively, and characterize the effect of pharmacologic stress on coronary flow quantitatively by using ultrafast, breath-held segmented k-space phase-contrast-MR imaging (PC-MRI). Ten healthy volunteers were examined by using ultrafast breath-held PC-MRI. Coronary volume flow rates were measured in the anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) at rest and following intravenous administration of dipyridamole. CFR was determined based on these data. Mean LAD volume flow rates increased from 38 +/- 11 ml/min before application of dipyridamole to 169 +/- 42 ml/min. The mean CFR amounted to 5.0 +/- 2.6 (median = 4.15). This study demonstrates the feasibility of breath-held PC-MRI to noninvasively quantify coronary volume flow rates over the cardiac cycle. Pharmacologically induced changes in volume flow rate and thus CFR can be quantitated.
