To analyze cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) predictive factors in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).

Two hundred thirty-seven patients who visited for low back pain, lower limb pain and/or lower limb numbness and who were diagnosed with LSS were enrolled in this study. The ratio of males to females was 117-120, and the mean age was 68.8 years (range 45-87 years). LSS and CSM were diagnosed by characteristic symptoms, physical findings and MRI. We examined gender, age, Torg-Pavlov ratio (TPR), spondylolisthesis or spondylosis, LSS symptom types and number of stenosis segments with LSS to clarify predictive factors for CSM.

There were 21 (8.86%) patients with coexistent CSM among 237 LSS patients. CSM morbidity was significantly more common among males compared with females. TPR was 0.71 ± 0.09 in the CSM patients and 0.81 ± 0.10 in the non-CSM patients. TPR of the CSM patients was significantly smaller than that of the non-CSM patients. We analyzed to determine the predictive factors of CSM and TPR was identified. The predictive value of TPR for CSM was 0.78.

Torg-Pavlov ratio was the most important predictive factor of CSM in patients with LSS.
