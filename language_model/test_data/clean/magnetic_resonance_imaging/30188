Previous research suggests that genetic variations regulating serotonergic neurotransmission mediate individual differences in the neural network underlying impulsive and aggressive behaviour. Although with conflicting findings, the monoamine oxidase-A (MAOA) and the serotonin transporter (5HTT) gene polymorphisms have been associated with an increased risk to develop impulsive and aggressive behaviour. Double knock-out mice studies have also demonstrated that MAOA and 5HTT genes strongly interact in the metabolic pathway leading to the serotonergic inactivation; however, their potential interactive effect in human brain remains uninvestigated. We used blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the independent and interactive effects of both MAOA and 5HTT polymorphisms on the brain activity elicited by a response inhibition task in healthy volunteers. Multivariate analysis demonstrated an individual effect of both MAOA and 5HTT polymorphisms and a strong allele-allele interaction in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a key region implicated in cognitive control and in the pathophysiology of impulsive and aggressive behaviour. These findings suggest that the MAOAx5HTT allelic interaction exerts a significant modulation on the BOLD response associated with response inhibition and contribute to validate haplotype models as useful tools for a better understanding of the neurobiology underlying complex cognitive functions.
