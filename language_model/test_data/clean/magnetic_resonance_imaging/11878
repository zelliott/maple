The relatively rare fractures of the hamate bone are the most common osseous injuries of the distal carpal row, whereby fractures of both the body and the hook of the hamate occur. We present a hamulus ossis hamate fracture that was caused by direct trauma in a high-level game of underwater rugby. Although this was diagnosed by conventional x-ray, the precise position of the fracture was clearly imaged using thin-layer CT, while additional multiplanar MRT revealed further sequelae of the trauma. A CT follow-up after 10 weeks of conservative therapy did not show any osseous consolidation, which indicated the need for surgical revision with extirpation of the hamulus.
