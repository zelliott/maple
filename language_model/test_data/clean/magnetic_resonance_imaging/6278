The pattern of preserved learning abilities is described in a severely amnesic patient after bilateral thalamic infarction. Experimental findings cannot be accounted for both by the view that only episodic memory is impaired in amnesia, while semantic memory is spared, and by the theory that what is spared in amnesia is procedural learning contrasted with impaired declarative memory. In agreement with Warrington and Weiskrantz (1982), diencephalic amnesia is considered to be a disconnection syndrome between the frontal and temporal lobes. The conditions for showing spared and impaired memory in amnesics are specified on the basis of the performance of the patient and of the data available in the literature. This allows us to derive practical suggestions for programmes aimed at remediation of memory defects.
