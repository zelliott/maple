Isolated ventricular non-compaction (IVNC) is a rare, congenital, unclassified cardiomyopathy characterized by prominent trabecular meshwork and deep recesses. Major clinical manifestations of IVNC are heart failure, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and thrombo-embolic events. We describe a case of a 69-year-old woman in whom the diagnosis of IVNC was discovered late, whereas former echocardiographic examinations were considered normal. She was known for systolic left ventricular dysfunction for 3 years and then became symptomatic (NYHA III). In the past, she suffered from multiple episodes of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Electrocardiogram revealed a wide QRS complex, and transthoracic echocardiography showed typical apical thickening of the left and right ventricular myocardial wall with two distinct layers. The ratio of non-compacted to compacted myocardium was >2:1. Cardiac MRI confirmed the echocardiographic images. Cerebral MRI revealed multiple ischaemic sequellae. In view of the persistent refractory, heart failure in medical treatment of patients with classical criteria for cardiac re-synchronization therapy, as well as the ventricular arrhythmias, a biventricular automatic intracardiac defibrillator (biventricular ICD) was implanted. The 2-year follow-up period was characterized by improvement of NYHA functional class from III to I and increasing in left ventricular function. We hereby present a case of IVNC with favourable outcome after biventricular ICD implantation. Cardiac re-synchronization therapy could be considered in the management of this pathology.
