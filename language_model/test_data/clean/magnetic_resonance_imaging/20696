Although seizures are rarely encountered in Wilson's disease (WD), seizures related to hypocupremia have not been reported before. We report a patient presenting with partial status epilepticus who was on strict low-copper diet and chelating therapy for WD. Despite other rare causes of seizures in WD including penicillamine-induced pyridoxine deficiency, cerebral copper deposition and metabolic encephalopathy, the most probable cause of resistant status epilepticus in this patient was found as hypocupremia from overzealous treatment. This case exemplifies that hypocupremic states should be kept in mind as a risk factor for resistant seizures.
