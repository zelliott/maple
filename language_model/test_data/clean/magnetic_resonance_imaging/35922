The utility of magnetic resonance imaging vis-a-vis insect morphology and development was investigated. MRI is a noninvasive technique that distinguishes between tissues based on proton content and proton 'environment'. At present a resolution of 100 micron is achievable. The technique avoids fixation artifacts and allows the detection of motion within the organism.
