Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) using 111In-octreotide has proven useful in patients suspected of having meningiomas. Delayed imaging is regularly performed up to 24 h postinjection. However, this procedure is time consuming and expensive. Therefore, we investigated whether 24-h imaging may be omitted in these patients.

After clinical examination and standard MRI, 71 patients were suspected of having 92 meningioma lesions. Before surgery, all patients underwent SRS after intravenous injection of 200 MBq (5.4 mCi) 111In-octreotide. Planar whole-body images were obtained at 10 min and 1, 4 and 24 h, and SPECT was performed at 4 and 24 h. Results of SRS in all lesions were evaluated with respect to histology and time of image acquisition.

SRS yielded 58 true-positive, 20 true-negative and 14 false-negative results, with the false-negatives all less than 5 mL (2.3+/-2.1 mL) in volume. In 52 of 58 true-positive lesions (89.7%), diagnosis could be established by 4-h imaging without further information by 24-h imaging. In 10 of the 52 lesions, SPECT was necessary to confirm planar findings. Imaging at 24 h was necessary in only 6 of 58 true-positive lesions (10.3%): 3 patients who had intracranial relapse of meningioma (volume < 5 mL) and 3 who had spinal meningioma. Thus, a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma could be established in 52 of 55 lesions (95%) using a 4-h imaging protocol.

With a 4-h acquisition protocol that includes SPECT imaging, SRS yields sufficient information in patients suspected of having intracranial meningiomas. Delayed imaging at 24 h is recommended only for patients who have small meningiomas (volume < 5 mL), spinal localizations or negative SRS at 4 h.
