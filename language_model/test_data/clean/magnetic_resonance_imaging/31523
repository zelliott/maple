Among the hepatic haemangiomas with atypical features when studied radiologically, the multicystic type is extremely rare. We report a case of multicystic hepatic haemangioma in a 62-year-old woman, which was found incidentally during ultrasound screening. Because the tumour showed atypical features on ultrasonography, CT and MRI, the correct diagnosis was not made until the surgery. In this report, the atypical radiological findings are illustrated and correlated with pathological findings.
