The first intermolecular zero-quantum coherence (iZQC) MR images of the human brain at 4T are presented. To generate iZQC images, a modified echo-planar imaging pulse sequence was used which included an additional 45 degrees RF pulse and a correlation gradient. The observability and nonconventional contrast of human brain iZQC images at 4T is demonstrated. Axial images are presented for various pulse sequence parameters, and a zero-quantum relaxation map is obtained.
