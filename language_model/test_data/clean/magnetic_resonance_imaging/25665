Renal damages after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including Gd-DTPA-enhanced dynamic MRI in 37 patients with renal stone by spin echo methods (T1 and T2-weighted scan) and small tip angle gradient echo method (T2-weighted scan). Sixty-eight percent of the patients had changes in the MRI findings after ESWL. The frequently observed findings were perirenal fluid collection (38%), loss of corticomedullary junction (35%), and increased signal intensity of muscle and other adjacent tissue (34%). Preoperative Gd-DTPA-enhanced dynamic MRI showed low intensity band which suggests Gd-DTPA secretion from the glomerulus into the renal tubulus. In all cases the low intensity band became unclear after ESWL because of renal contusion due to ESWL. MRI, including Gd-DTPA-enhanced dynamic MRI, is considered to be a good procedure for evaluation of renal damages due to ESWL.
