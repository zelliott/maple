Young patients with endometrial cancer who desire to preserve their fertility often decline hysterectomy in favor of conservative progestin therapy. Proper candidates should have disease confined to the uterus and a well-differentiated tumor. One of the evolving techniques to evaluate the extent of the disease and myometrial or cervical invasion is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

A young patient with early-stage endometrial cancer initially declined surgery and was treated with megestrol. MRI suggested myoinvasion, and the patient consented to surgical staging. The final pathology revealed no residual carcinoma.

The accuracy of MRI in detecting myoinvasion is limited, and as such results should be interpreted with caution when this information is used in counseling a young patient regarding surgical staging for endometrial cancer.
