Arachnoid cysts account for only 1% of all intracranial space-occupying lesions. In adults suprasellar cysts represent 9% of all the arachnoid cysts while in pediatric population this percentage reaches 15%. In spite of being a problem relatively common in daily neurosurgical practice there are still a number of questions to be solved concerning pathogenesis and evolution, natural history and treatment. Located in the suprasellar cistern and closely related to the ventricular system, suprasellar arachnoid cysts conform a perfect indication for endoscopic treatment. The development and spreading of neuroendoscopic techniques have surpassed the standard microsurgical approaches as an elective treatment. However there is still controversy on the management of associated hydrocephalus, need for cystoperitoneal shunt after endoscopic fenestration or the superiority of ventriculocystocisternostomy over simple ventriculocystostomy. The authors present a serie of seven consecutive patients with "de novo" diagnosis of suprasellar arachnoid cyst. In every case the treatment consisted in endoscopic fenestration and removal of the cyst membranes, with or without associated ventriculostomy of the IIIrd ventricle. Preoperative symptoms improved in all the patients and five out of seven remain shunt free. One patient maintains a cystoperitoneal shunt and another one, previously shunted, remains shunt dependent. The clinical presentation and postoperative evolution are commented with discussion on the alternative therapeutic options from the endoscopic point of view.
