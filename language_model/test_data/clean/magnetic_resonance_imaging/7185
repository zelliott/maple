The use of magnetic resonance imaging as an adjunctive aid to determine the amount of bone available and the anatomic limitations for the placement of endosseous dental implants is introduced. Advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The results suggest that magnetic resonance imaging can provide, without the need for a reformatting software program, adequate information concerning the amount of bone and anatomic limitations for placement of endosseous implants in the mandible and maxilla.
