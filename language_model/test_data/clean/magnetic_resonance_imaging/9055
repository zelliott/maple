A 15-year-old Asian male was referred to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) for evaluation of a radiolucent lesion on the posterior left mandible. The patient was initially evaluated by his primary dentist for pain of two months' duration associated with teeth #17 and 18. Radiographic examination was performed and the panoramic radiograph revealed a radiolucent lesion involving the left mandibular body and ascending ramus, along with resorption of the roots of the predetermined teeth. Considering odontogenic infection, the patient was placed on antibiotics and referred to TUSDM for further evaluation and treatment.
