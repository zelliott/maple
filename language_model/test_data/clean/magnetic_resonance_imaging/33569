Regional cerebral blood flow was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) in normal subjects while performing simple aimless proximal and distal arm movements. The aim of the experiment was to compare the somatotopic organization of precentral and mesial (the so called supplementary motor area, SMA) motor cortices and to evaluate whether in man, as in the monkey, the rostral and caudal sectors of SMA are functionally different. The results showed that proximal and distal arm movements are to a large extent segregated in the precentral motor cortex, but not in the SMA. They also showed that the SMA is made of at least two functional sectors. Only the caudal one is activated during simple aimless movements.
