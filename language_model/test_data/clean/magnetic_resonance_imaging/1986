Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) involvement occurs in 10 to 40 percent of patients presenting with sarcoidosis. Axonal polyneuropathies and mononeuropathies are the most frequently reported whereas acute or chronic polyradiculoneuritis are rarely described. We report the case of a 54 year-old-woman admitted for a progressive sensorimotor deficit of the lower limbs. Bilateral ocular redness corresponding to an uveitis was also observed. Neurological examination and electrophysiological data were consistent with a chronic polyradiculoneuritis. The neurological status of the patient improved after six months of treatment with oral corticotherapy associated with immunosuppressive treatment. Our case allows a review of the literature concerning PNS involvements and treatments in sarcoidosis.
