We report a case of a primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the distal radius in a 46-year-old man. Treatment involved en bloc resection, reconstruction with a nonvascularized free fibular autograft, and wrist arthrodesis combined with adjuvant chemotherapy. At the 2-year follow-up evaluation the patient had a satisfactory outcome with complete radiographic union and no evidence of a local recurrence or metastasis. Resection combined with autogenous fibular grafting and adjuvant chemotherapy appears to be an acceptable method for treating malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the distal radius in this patient.
