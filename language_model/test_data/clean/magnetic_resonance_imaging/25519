Bone pain, especially back pain, is a common presenting feature of myeloma patients. We report three multiple myeloma patients with exacerbations of back pain and referred shoulder pain resulting from vertebral infections. Two patients were treated with surgery, and one patient had computerized tomography-guided percutaneous needle aspiration for diagnostic purposes. All three patients received a prolonged course of antibiotics. Vertebral infection resolved with this treatment in all three patients without any recurrence. Previous dexamethasone therapy, together with an episode of bacteraemia, appears to be a predisposing factor for vertebral infection. Magnetic resonance imaging enabled the diagnosis in all three patients.
