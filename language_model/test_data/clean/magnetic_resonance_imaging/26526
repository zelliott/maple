(1) To compare clinical outcome and symptomatology of rheumatoid cervical myelopathy between patients managed conservatively and surgically. (2) To determine if surgical outcome has improved since the series published from this unit in 1987. (3) To examine the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of cervical myelopathy.

Patients undergoing MRI of the cervical spine between 1991 and 1996 were identified. Case records were reviewed retrospectively.

111 patients with RA underwent 124 MRI scans. The median age at onset of cervical spine symptoms was 58 years (range 16-87) with median disease duration of 16 years (range 1-59). 18 (16%) required surgery immediately after MRI. 93 (84%) were managed conservatively, 9 of whom (10%) later required surgery. 2/7 deaths in the conservative group were directly related to cervical myelopathy. Patients requiring surgery were more likely to report paraesthesia, weakness, unsteadiness and to exhibit extensor plantar reflexes, gait disturbance, and reduced power. MRI findings did not correlate with clinical features. When compared with the 1974-82 cohort, fewer patients had severe myelopathy (Ranawat grade IIIB) before surgery (34% versus 7%). Early postoperative mortality improved from 9% to 0% and surgical complication rate fell from 50% to 22%. 89% of patients in the 1991-96 cohort reported subjective improvement in overall function.

In this series surgical outcome has improved. The major factor in this more favourable outcome is probably that patients presenting with rheumatoid cervical myelopathy are now referred for surgery at an earlier stage of disease. Clinical findings correlate poorly with MRI findings, therefore clinical history should remain the key to determining the need for MRI.
