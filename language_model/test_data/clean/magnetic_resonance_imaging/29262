Metastasising chordomas are extremely rare and only four cases with drop metastases have been reported. We report a patient with an intracranial chondroid chordoma, typically involving the clivus, treated by repeated resection, percutaneous transluminal embolisation and radiosurgery. During follow-up with MRI asymptomatic intradural drop metastases were observed throughout the spine, with transgression of the intervertebral foramen, forming a "dumbbell".
