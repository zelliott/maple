An 18-year-old female patient was hospitalized with headache and disturbance of consciousness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tumor in the left parieto-occipital lobe. The tumor was totally removed, and postoperative radiation therapy was administered locally at 50 Gy. Ten months later, she experienced sudden onset of unconsciousness and headache. Computed tomography (CT) and MRI demonstrated multiple mass lesions in the whole brain. Following the systemic chemotherapy, removal of the largest tumor was performed. Histological examination proved all excised tumors to be oligodendroglioma without evidence of malignant change.
