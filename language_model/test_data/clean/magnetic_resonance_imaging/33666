Superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIOs) are usually referred to as T2 MR contrast agents, reducing signal intensity (SI) on T2-weighted MR images (negative enhancement). This study reports the original use of SPIOs as T1-enhancing contrast agents, primarily assessed in vitro, and then applied to an in vivo investigation of a myocardial perfusion defect. Using a strongly T1-weighted subsecond MR sequence with SPIOs intravenous (IV) bolus injection, MR imaging of myocardial vascularization after reperfusion was performed, on a dog model of coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion. Immediately after the intravenous bolus injection of 20 mumol/kg of SPIOs, a positive signal intensity enhancement was observed respectively, in the right and left ventricular cavity and in the nonischemic left myocardium. Moreover, compared to normal myocardium, the remaining ischemic myocardial region (anterior wall of the left ventricle) appeared as a lower and delayed SI enhancing area (cold spot). Mean peak SIE in the nonischemic myocardium (posterior wall) was significantly higher than in the ischemic myocardium (anterior wall) (110 +/- 23% vs. 74 +/- 22%, Mann-Whitney test alpha < 1%, n1 = 6, n2-n1 = 0, U > 2). In conclusion, the T1 effect of SPIOs at low dose, during their first intravascular distribution, suggests their potential use as positive markers to investigate the regional myocardial blood flow and some perfusion defects such as the "no-reflow phenomenon."
