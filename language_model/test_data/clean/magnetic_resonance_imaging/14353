Four patients with idiopathic transient osteoporosis of the hip were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI clearly showed low signal intensity in the affected femoral head on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. After regression of hip pain, MR images became normal. MRI was a useful method for diagnosis and follow-up study of idiopathic transient osteoporosis of the hip.
