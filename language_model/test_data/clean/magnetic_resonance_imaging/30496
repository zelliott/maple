Cysticercosis, a parasitic disease caused by encysted larvae of the tapeworm Taenia solium, is commonly seen in developing countries and in immigrant population of developed countries. The most common presentation is as neuro cysticercosis, but rarely may have an extra cerebral muscular presentation.

A case of cysticercosis of the biceps brachii is presented in a 17 year old male, leading on to posterior interosseous nerve syndrome.

The patient was completely cured by 6 months with medical management with albendazole.

Cysticercosis is not uncommon in developing countries and immigrant population of developed countries. The muscular presentation of cysticercosis may mimic a tumour leading to posterior interosseous nerve palsy. The management in such cases could be medical line of treatment or surgical excision.
