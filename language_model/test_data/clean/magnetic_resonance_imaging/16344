An image patch can be locally decomposed into sinusoidal waves of different orientations, spatial frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. The local phase information is essential for perception, because important visual features like edges emerge at locations of maximal local phase coherence. Detection of phase coherence requires integration of spatial frequency information across multiple spatial scales. Models of early visual processing suggest that the visual system should implement phase-sensitive pooling of spatial frequency information in the identification of broadband edges. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation to look for phase-sensitive neural responses in the human visual cortex. We found sensitivity to the phase difference between spatial frequency components in all studied visual areas, including the primary visual cortex (V1). Control experiments demonstrated that these results were not explained by differences in contrast or position. Next, we compared fMRI responses for broadband compound grating stimuli with congruent and random phase structures. All studied visual areas showed stronger responses for the stimuli with congruent phase structure. In addition, selectivity to phase congruency increased from V1 to higher-level visual areas along both the ventral and dorsal streams. We conclude that human V1 already shows phase-sensitive pooling of spatial frequencies, but only higher-level visual areas might be capable of pooling spatial frequency information across spatial scales typical for broadband natural images.
