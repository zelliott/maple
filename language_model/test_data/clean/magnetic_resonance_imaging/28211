A patient with a T1-T2 disc herniation, operated on via the anterior approach, is presented. In a search of the literature we found 18 reported cases, all operated on by posterior or posterolateral approaches. The feasibility of the anterior discectomy in our case was established by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging of the upper thorax. We think that an anterior discectomy at the level of the upper thoracic spine can be easily performed in selected cases. The clinical picture of T1 root compression is described.
