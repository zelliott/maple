We report on the development of transient parkinsonism after progesterone injection in a pregnant patient with a risk of abortion. Etiological possibilities are discussed, including pregnancy itself, possible toxic effects of the dead fetus, and progesterone injection. Progesterone-induced parkinsonism seems the most likely diagnosis in this case.
