A still photograph of an object in motion may convey dynamic information about the position of the object immediately before and after the photograph was taken (implied motion). Medial temporal/medial superior temporal cortex (MT/MST) is one of the main brain regions engaged in the perceptual analysis of visual motion. In two experiments we examined whether MT/MST is also involved in representing implied motion from static images. We found stronger functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation within MT/MST during viewing of static photographs with implied motion compared to viewing of photographs without implied motion. These results suggest that brain regions involved in the visual analysis of motion are also engaged in processing implied dynamic information from static images.
