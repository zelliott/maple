Recent advances in micro-magnetic resonance imaging (microMRI) now allow noninvasive assessment of mechanical properties of trabecular bone (TB) in vivo by micro finite-element analysis. The first aim of this work was to address the implications of limited resolution and signal-to-noise ratio on elastic properties of TB derived under conditions of in vivo imaging via simulation at various resolutions and noise levels on the basis of models derived from microCT images at 21 microm isotropic voxel size from cores of cadaveric human TB (n = 13) from three anatomic sites. The second aim was to compare how elastic constants derived from actual MR images at 9.4 Tesla at 50 microm isotropic voxel size compare with those from high-resolution microCT. Elastic moduli computed from simulated in vivo microMR images were highly correlated with those obtained from microCT (R(2) = 0.99) and the data were relatively immune to noise. Correlations of similar strength were obtained between estimated moduli from microCT and acquired high-field MR images. Systematic errors manifesting in significant deviations of the slopes from unity are caused by higher apparent bone-volume fraction of the MR images but can potentially be corrected with appropriate histogram-standardization techniques.
