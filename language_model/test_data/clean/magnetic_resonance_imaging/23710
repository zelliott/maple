A series of nine patients with neurologic complications of hepatitis C virus infection is reported. Seven patients presented a combination of chronic sensory polyneuropathy, multineuropathy, and encephalopathy related to cryoglobulinemia. The noncryoglobulinemic symptoms consisted of an anterior optic neuropathy and a restless legs syndrome with small-fiber neuropathy. Corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide were useful in controlling vasculitic episodes. Interferon-alpha caused remission in half of the treated patients.
