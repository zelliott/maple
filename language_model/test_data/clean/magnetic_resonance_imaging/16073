We report on a remarkable diagnostic work up of suspect rectal palpation results in a 54-year-old patient. According to a transrectal ultrasound-guided punch biopsy the patient was suspected of having a carcinoma of the seminal vesicles and an aggressive operational approach was considered. After a median laparotomy a generalized peritoneal carcinomatosis was found. A goblet cell carcinoid of the vermiform appendix was identified as the primary tumor. This case report deals with metastazation of a primary goblet cell carcinoma into the seminal vesicles on both sides as an extremely rare reason for suspicious rectal palpation results. The tumor valency, diagnostic work up, therapy and further differential diagnoses are described.
