Isolated neurosarcoidosis involving the optic nerve meninges is extremely rare and is often indistinguishable from a meningioma in its anatomic site and MR imaging presentation. Characteristic findings include enhanced perineural encasement and thickening of the affected optic nerve on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted cranial MR imaging studies. We present the case report of a patient with isolated necrotizing neurosarcoidosis of the left optic nerve, with clinical and MR imaging findings strongly suggestive of a preoperative diagnosis of a meningioma.
