Cartilage development has a profound impact on musculoskeletal growth. The objective of this article is to offer insights about the maturation of hyaline cartilage through MRI. We begin by briefly describing the molecular make up of hyaline cartilage. We will then follow with a discussion of the basic principles to apply to optimize hyaline cartilage imaging. The remainder of the article will focus on the MR appearances of the distinct histologic types of hyaline cartilage, normal variations in cartilage development, and the sequelae of cartilage injury on normal skeletal development.

Knowledge of the normal and abnormal appearances of hyaline cartilage on MRI of pediatric patients will allow readers to avoid mistaking the changes associated with skeletal maturation for pathologic findings.
