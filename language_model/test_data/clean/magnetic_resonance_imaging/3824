Prenatal depiction of brain dysgenesis in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) deficiencies has been infrequently reported. As PDHc plays a critical role in the brain that obtains all of the energy from the aerobic oxidation of glucose, its deficiency is a severe inborn disorder of metabolism, which predominantly affects the nervous system. This report describes a case of PDHc deficiency with antenatal brain dysgenesis depicted in detail by fetal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. This is the first case report clearly demonstrating the developing mechanism and time course of antenatal brain lesions in a patient with PDHc deficiency.
