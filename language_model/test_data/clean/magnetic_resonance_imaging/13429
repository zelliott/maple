A method to assess the average percentage of fetal fat with respect to other fetal tissue is described. This method was then used to assess the percentage of fat in 13 normal fetuses who had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination late in pregnancy (38-41 weeks). The scans of a further 13 fetuses of diabetic mothers and one case of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), all of whom had MRI examinations in the last 3 years, were reviewed and similar calculations were carried out. Whilst the percentage fat range in the normal group was large, it was still possible to discern a difference between the normal, diabetic and IUGR cases.
