We measured pre- and postprandial changes in the portal flow of normal volunteers and patients with liver cirrhosis using MR imaging and examined how to quantify portal flow to evaluate liver function.

Three groups were selected: middle aged normal volunteers (mean age 37.2 yrs., 5 persons), aged normal volunteers (mean age 61.5 yrs., 6 persons), and patients (mean age 67.6 yrs., 7 persons). We used cine-PC and the spin-echo method to measure portal flow velocity (PV) and vertical sectional area (PA), respectively. We repeated measurements of PV and PA in turn for about 60 minutes after a meal.

There were no significant differences in PV between the three groups before the meal. Study after the meal also indicated no significant difference between the two normal groups. In the normal group, PV and portal flow volume (Pvol.) increased by about 77% and 127%, respectively. In the cirrhotic liver group, PV and Pvol. increased by about 14% and 32%, respectively. A significant difference was seen between the normal and patient groups after the meal. We, therefore considered that the changing rate of Pvol. might be a sensitive parameter for evaluating liver function, including reserve.
