We measured the variation of end-systolic wall stress and its relation to regional ejection fraction in short-axis planes through the left ventricle in normal subjects and in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) by cine magnetic resonance imaging. There was a gradual increase in end-systolic wall stress but a gradual decrease in ejection fraction from apex to base in normal subjects (14 +/- 6 to 52 +/- 15 kdyne/cm2, 78% +/- 12% to 62% +/- 8%) and in patients with DCM (49 +/- 28 to 130 +/- 30 kdyne/cm2, 40 +/- 18 to 23% +/- 9%). The end-systolic wall stress in patients with DCM was higher than in normal subjects at every level (p < 0.01). We conclude that there is a variation in end-systolic wall stress in both normal subjects and patients with DCM with regional ejection fraction inversely related to regional end-systolic wall stress.
