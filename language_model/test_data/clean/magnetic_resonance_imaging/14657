The neurocutaneous syndrome known by the acronym PHACE consists of the association of a segmental facial hemangioma with, among other entities, posterior fossa anomalies, cerebrovascular anomalies, cardiac involvement/aortic coarctation, and eye abnormalities. When ventral developmental defects are also present, the syndrome is referred to as PHACES. We report the prenatal and postnatal MRI findings in a case of PHACES with involvement of the right posteroinferior cerebellar artery. This case is exceptional because, to our knowledge, it is the first to report the findings at both prenatal and postnatal MRI and because of the unique vascular anomaly that widens the spectrum of possible intracranial arterial anomalies in this syndrome.
