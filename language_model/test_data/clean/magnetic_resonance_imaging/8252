Statins inhibit the production of 2,3-dimethoxy,5-methyl,6-polyisoprene parabenzoquinone also known as ubiquinone or coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which is required for mitochondrial electron transport. Idiopathic or primary CoQ10 deficiencies have been known to cause mitochondrial encephalomyopathy.

We present the case of a patient with mitochondrial syndrome, consisting of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), whose symptoms were temporally related to statin therapy.

Statins may provoke symptoms related to MELAS in susceptible individuals.
