Previous reports of patients with Langerhans' cell histiocytosis have shown characteristics of osteolytic lesion, visceral involvement and organ dysfunction. We report a 2-year-old boy who was diagnosed as Langerhans' cell histiocytosis with a prominent hepatomegaly. X-Radiogram, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the osteolysis of the right iliac bone, the absence of the left eighth rib as well as the right mandible, and an enhancing mass in the left cerebellum. The data of radiography were highly suggestive of Langerhans' cell lineage. The presence of large CD1a-positive mononuclear cells associated with inflammatory cells in peripheral blood smear and bone marrow aspirate further confirmed the diagnosis. In addition, expressions of S100, CD25, CD68, CD80, CD86, and Fas ligand were identified on these cells by immunocytochemical staining. The results indicate that although these cells are activated Langerhans' cells, progression of the disease and the bone destruction could be mediated by the overt FasL expression of the cells.
