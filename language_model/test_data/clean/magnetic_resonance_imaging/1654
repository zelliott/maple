We report a case of a 30-year-old, previously healthy man who presented at our clinic with complaints of increasing dysphagia and globus sensation for about 2 years. In addition, he noticed an increasing submental swelling. On examination, the patient revealed a massive swelling of the floor of the mouth, which had displaced the tongue cranially. MRI imaging showed the lesion to be a homogeneous, cystic lesion, clearly at a distance from the surrounding mucous tissue. Surgery was performed, and the tumor was resected completely. Histologic examination of the resected tissue was consistent with a dermoid cyst located in the floor of the mouth. Although dermoid cysts are rarely located in the oral cavity, it should be included in differential diagnosis. Surgery is the treatment of choice.
