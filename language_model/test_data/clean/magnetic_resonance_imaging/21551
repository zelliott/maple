A 72-year-old woman presented a sudden onset isolated sensory deficit of medial lemniscal type in the right half of the body. MRI showed a small lacune in the left paramedian pontine tegmentum corresponding to the location of the medial lemniscus. MRI appeared to be most valuable in the topographic delineation of lacunar infarctions which were responsible for pure sensory stroke.
