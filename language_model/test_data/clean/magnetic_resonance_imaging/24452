Pyridoquinazolines have been synthesized, characterized, and tested for their in vitro epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. The compounds were prepared from alkylideno/arylideno-bis-ureas. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of elemental analyses and spectral studies (infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance [1H NMR], fourier transform infrared spectroscopy [FTIR], and electron ionization mass spectrometry [EI-MS]). Three of the new compounds had IC50 values in the range of 4.5-11.0 nM. The cellular EGFR internalization response of selected compounds was evaluated using HeLa cells. Three halogenated derivatives had a pronounced effect in inhibiting EGFR internalization.
