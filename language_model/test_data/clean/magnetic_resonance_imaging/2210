In this study we present a case of schwannoma of the trachea investigated with computer tomography (axial, precontrast) and magnetic resonance (1 Tesla, sagittal T1w before and after Gadolinium, sagittal T2w, coronal and axial after Gadolinium). The topographic abilities of MR allowed us to determine the exact location and extension of the tumor in the trachea. As far as we know, this study, based on magnetic resonance, is the first of the kind in the radiologic literature.
