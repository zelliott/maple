We investigated the effect of concomitant intracranial meningiomas on perioperative and postoperative complications after cardiac operations. Also studied was the intraoperative and perioperative management and long-term outcome of such patients.

We retrospectively evaluated 16 cardiac surgical patients with intracranial meningiomas between January 1996 and July 2007. Neurologic outcome, incidence of transient neurologic deficits, and long-term follow-up focusing on freedom from any cardiac or neurosurgical intervention were assessed.

Five men and 11 women with a concomitant diagnosis of intracranial meningioma underwent cardiac operations using extracorporeal circulation. One patient received additional edema prophylaxis by intravenous dexamethasone. All patients were discharged home in good physical condition. Data on long-term survival were available on 14 patients, with 12 alive. Postoperatively, 2 patients died from myocardial infarction at 26.8 months and 2 from metastatic colon cancer at 57.9 months. Perioperative neurologic disorders were observed in 2 patients, comprising one stroke after intervention for aortic dissection and one thromboembolic event 2 weeks after biologic mitral valve replacement due to anticoagulation disorders. No meningioma-related adverse event was observed.

The presence of intracranial meningioma does not appear to be a risk factor for patients undergoing cardiac operations. No meningioma-related neurologic sequelae were documented postoperatively. Neurosurgical consultation should be obtained in all patients preoperatively.
