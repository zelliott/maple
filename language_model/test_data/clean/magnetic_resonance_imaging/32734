The HVS on FLAIR imaging is a useful marker of acute ischemic stroke. We investigated whether prior administration of gadolinium-based contrast hindered detection of this sign on images from subjects with acute nonlacunar ischemic stroke <4.5 hours after onset. Both blinded and comparative unblinded analyses showed significantly reduced HVS detection on postcontrast images. We suggest that assessment for this sign should be performed on images acquired prior to contrast administration.
