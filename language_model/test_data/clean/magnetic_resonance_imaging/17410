A major concern in the neuroendoscopic approach to an intraventricular tumor is the histological confirmation from a limited biopsy. However, the effort to excise the whole bulk of the tumor should be made for the minimally invasive management of selected intraventricular tumors. The case of an adult male with focal aqueductal ependymoma who presented with the clinical syndrome of hydrocephalus is reported. This may be of particular interest because it represents the first case of aqueductal ependymoma that has been successfully treated with endoscopic surgery.
