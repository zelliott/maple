A rare case of a 60-year-old man with a right aortic arch and aberrant left innominate artery is presented. This case had an unusual clinical presentation. The dysphagia appeared suddenly in adulthood, whereas vascular rings, when symptomatic, usually manifest early in childhood. To our knowledge, MR imaging findings of this anomaly have never been reported. The diagnosis was made by MR imaging and confirmed by surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging can replace angiography in the assessment of the aortic arch anomalies.
