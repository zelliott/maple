Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, Magnetom 0.5 Tesla) using a high-resolution surface coil was performed on 10 healthy volunteers, 16 patients with bladder tumours, 2 patients with cystitis and 15 patients with bladder tumours and cystitis. Lesion delineation versus urine, bladder wall and surrounding organs was evaluated in plain and contrast-enhanced (IV Magnevist, 0.1 mmol/kg) T1-weighted, plain proton-density and T2-weighted spin-echo images. Surface-coil MRI proved very sensitive since all lesions were found in plain scans. Cystitis and 27 of 31 tumours exhibited contrast enhancement, however, differentiation of tumours and cystic lesions was not improved. Plain T2 and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images demonstrated bladder wall disruption and perivesical tumour spread with equal sensitivity. Post-contrast images permitted unequivocal visualisation of perivesical tumour spread in surrounding peritoneal fat. The authors conclude that T2-weighted imaging may be restricted to non-enhancing bladder tumours thus significantly reducing imaging time.
