A case of a female child of six years of age with a plexiform neurofibroma of the larynx caused by von Recklinghausen's disease is presented. Laryngeal involvement in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is rare and only 19 paediatric cases have been reported. The tumour was biopsied and lateral pharyngotomy with supraglottic hemilaryngectomy was performed in order to relieve obstructive symptoms. Problems related to this unusual tumour localization are discussed and a review of the literature is presented.
