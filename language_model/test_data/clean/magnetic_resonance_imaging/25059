Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common adult malignant brain tumor but is notably less common in children. The authors describe the case of a child who presented for evaluation and treatment of neurologic signs caused by a brain stem glioma. Response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide was initially positive, but later extensive leptomeningeal metastasis developed. Biopsy proved the lesion to be glioblastoma multiforme. During salvage irradiation to the spine and unirradiated brain, the patient complained of hip and femur pain. Subsequent radiographs demonstrated multiple bony metastases. This pattern of spread is uncharacteristic and emphasizes the importance of adequate metastatic evaluation.
