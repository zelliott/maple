A 44-year-old man was examined for marked edema and ptosis of the right upper eyelid after grease from high-pressure hydraulic machinery penetrated his right orbit 20 days earlier. The diagnosis of residual grease in the injured orbit was confirmed by CT and MRI, and the clinical presentation. During orbital exploration, the grease was removed completely. Among the wide variety of orbital foreign bodies, grease is rarely reported. We present the sixth case of grease-gun injury to the orbit to be reported in the English language literature since 1964.
