We report a case of immunotactoid glomerulopathy (ITG) with cerebral hemorrhage and hypocomplementemia, with successful therapeutic outcome following the corticosteroids and antihypertensive treatment. A 70-year-old man presented with facial edema in October 2006. One day prior to his referral, he experienced speech disturbance, headache, and vomiting, and on the next day he was referred to our hospital. The laboratory examination revealed massive proteinuria (11.3 g/day) and hematuria. The total serum hemolytic complement (CH50) was decreased to 23 U/ml and C4 component was decreased to 7.5 mg/dl, whereas C3 component remained within normal limits (82 mg/dl). Brain computed tomography scan showed high-density lesions in the left parieto-occipital area suggesting subcortical cerebral hemorrhage. Renal biopsy revealed diffuse subendothelial PAS-positive depositions. Immunofluorescence studies revealed intensive deposition of IgG, IgA, C3, C1q, Fibrinogen, and kappa light chain with granular pattern in the capillary and mesangial area. Electron microscopic examination revealed regularly arranged microtubular deposits, appearing as 21-33 nm in diameter. Based on these findings, this patient was diagnosed as ITG complicated with cerebral hemorrhage and hypocomplementemia. He received oral prednisolone (30 mg/day), resulting in reduction of proteinuria, improvement of hypocomplementemia, and prevention of renal functional deterioration. This case demonstrates that accurate diagnosis of ITG may result in successful therapeutic outcome.
