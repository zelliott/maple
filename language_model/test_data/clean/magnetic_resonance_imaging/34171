To describe a 14-year-old boy with a 1-month history of a rapidly growing, nontender, lower eyelid mass.

The specimen was studied using light microscopy.

Although magnetic resonance imaging suggested a chronic vascular lesion, histopathologic analysis after excisional biopsy was consistent with nodular fasciitis.

Nodular fasciitis is a relatively common soft-tissue lesion and represents a benign, reactive process. Lesions in the head and neck develop more frequently in children and adolescents than in adults, but periorbital lesions are uncommon. This is the first reported case of nodular fasciitis of the lower eyelid in a pediatric patient.
