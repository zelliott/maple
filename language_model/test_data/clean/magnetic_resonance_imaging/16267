A 34-year-old female had been suffering from pain in her left ankle for more than 6 years. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than a rigid subtalar joint. Using a CT scan and an MRI scan the diagnosis tarsal coalition was established. This condition is a fairly frequent cause of ankle pain, with a prevalence of 1-2%. However, it is easily missed by treating physicians. In this article the clinical and radiological pointers for establishing the diagnosis are described, and information about the treatment of tarsal coalitions is provided.
