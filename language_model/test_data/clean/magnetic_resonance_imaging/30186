The authors report their experience with doxycycline sclerotherapy as primary treatment of head and neck lymphatic malformations (LMs) in children.

A retrospective chart review was used to collect data on 11 patients treated with doxycycline sclerotherapy for LMs of the head and neck at our institution since 2003. Radiographic imaging allowed classification of patient LM as macrocystic, microcystic, or mixed according to previously published guidelines. Only patients with macrocystic or mixed lesions were offered doxycycline sclerotherapy. Radiographic imaging and physical examination were used to determine efficacy of treatment. After each treatment, the clinical and radiographic response was characterized as excellent (> or = 95% decrease in lesion size), satisfactory (> or = 50% decrease in volume and asymptomatic), or poor (< 50% decrease in volume or symptomatic).

Eleven patients underwent a total of 23 sclerotherapies with an average of 2 treatments per patient (range, 1-4). All 7 patients with macrocystic lesions achieved complete clinical resolution with an average radiographic resolution of 93%. The 4 patients with mixed lesions achieved only partial clinical resolution and an average of 73% radiographic resolution. No patient experienced any adverse effects related to the treatment. At a median follow-up of 8 months, 2 patients (18%) experienced lesion recurrence in the setting of concomitant infection.

Doxycycline sclerotherapy is safe and effective as a primary treatment modality for macrocystic and mixed LMs of the head and neck in the pediatric population.
