Acute cerebellitis constitutes a clinically isolated syndrome, and is a frequent condition in childhood, with either viral or autoimmune etiologies. The disease is reported to run a variable course, and is usually benign. Acute cerebellitis with cerebellar swelling, hydrocephalus, and brainstem compression is an exceptional but life-threatening condition. We report a 9-year-old boy in whom death resulted from acute fulminant cerebellitis because of brainstem involvement. Serial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated rapid progression of the disease. The etiologies, clinical course, and therapeutic interventions regarding this potentially life-threatening condition are briefly reviewed.
