The clinical presentation of metastatic disease to the cavernous sinus includes ophthalmoplegia, pain and sensory deficit along the optic or maxillary branches of the trigeminal nerve. The role of a CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis is discussed. It was found that magnetic resonance imaging is superior to CT scan in demonstrating the cavernous sinus and pontine borders, especially in lymphomatous involvement of these structures.
