The optimal treatment of low grade intramedullary spinal cord tumours remains controversial. In many cases the tumours continue to progress even after surgery and radiation. Effective chemotherapy may be an important therapeutic adjunct in this setting. Temozolomide is widely used for brain gliomas, yet its role in the management of spinal cord tumours has not been reported.

Two paediatric patients with low grade spinal cord astrocytomas were diagnosed to have progression of the tumour in spite of surgery and radiotherapy. They received temozolomide, 200 mg/m2 daily for five days every four weeks for 10 cycles, and were followed serially.

Stabilization of the spinal tumour in both patients was observed at 18 months of follow-up. One of the patients developed haematological toxicity requiring platelet transfusion and dose reduction.

Based on our findings in two paediatric patients, temozolomide may be a useful agent in the management of progressive recurrent low grade spinal cord astrocytomas.
