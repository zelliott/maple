To determine the effect of surgical implants on the depiction of canine stifle anatomy in magnetic resonance (MR) images, three canine cadaver limbs were imaged at 1.5 T before and after tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO), tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA), and extra-capsular stabilization (ECS), respectively. Susceptibility artifacts associated with implants were identified in MR images as a signal void and/or signal misregistration, which obscured or distorted the anatomy. Using the preoperative images as a reference, articular structures of the stifle in postoperative images were graded using an ordinal scale to describe to what degree each anatomic structure could be evaluated for clinical purposes. The TPLO implant, which contains ferromagnetic stainless steel, produced marked susceptibility artifacts that obscured or distorted most stifle anatomy. The titanium alloy TTA implants and the stainless steel crimps used for ECS produced susceptibility artifacts that mainly affected the lateral aspect of the stifle, but allowed the cruciate ligaments and medial meniscus to be evaluated satisfactorily. Susceptibility artifact was significantly less marked in images obtained using turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences than in sequences employing spectral fat saturation. Clinical MR imaging of canine stifles containing certain metallic implants is feasible using TSE sequences without fat saturation.
