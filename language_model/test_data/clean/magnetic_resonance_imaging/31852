Osteoporosis and cancer patients may suffer sudden severe back pain due to vertebral body osteolysis, microfractures and/or compression fractures. These patients need immediate restabilisation of the vertebral body to eliminate the pain generator, to prevent further crushing, and to reduce the comorbidity of prolonged immobilisation. Vertebroplasty combined with pedicular instrumentation is presented as a therapy for a selected group of such patients. Eight patients with an average age of 69.1 years experienced significant relief from disabling back pain. The ability to ambulate increased significantly. The risks associated with prolonged bed rest and hospital stay were reduced. There were only minor surgical complications. Follow-up was short because of the limited life expectancy of these severely ill patients. Disabling back pain was successfully treated and ongoing vertebral body collapse was prevented by vertebroplasty combined with pedicular instrumentation in the eight selected osteoporosis and cancer patients.
