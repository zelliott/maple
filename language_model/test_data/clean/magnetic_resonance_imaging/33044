Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that accounts for 3% of all primary brain tumours. No clear risk factors for PCNSL in immunocompetent patients are known. The disease is more common in men and in elderly persons. Patients with AIDS who have low CD4+ counts are at the greatest risk for PCNSL. Virtually all PCNSLs in patients with AIDS express an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related genome. PCNSL is less frequently associated with EBV in patients without AIDS. A 42 years old gentleman diagnosed with primary CNS lymphoma with negative serological test for human immunodeficiency virus was initially treated with Modified De Angelis protocol relapsed after treatment. He underwent gamma knife stereotactic surgery which lead to further deterioration clinically and progression of disease on imaging. Later, he was treated with salvage high dose methotrexate, but after completion of six cycles there was a radiological progression of disease. Relapsed disease was further treated with a single agent temozolomide and the disease went in remission.
