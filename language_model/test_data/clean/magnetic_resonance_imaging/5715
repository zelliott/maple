The objective of this study was to validate a deformable image registration technique, termed Hyperelastic Warping, for left ventricular strain measurement during systole using cine-gated, non-tagged MR images with strains measured from tagged MRI. The technique combines deformation from high resolution, non-tagged MR image data with a detailed computational model, including estimated myocardial material properties, fiber direction, and active fiber contraction, to provide a comprehensive description of myocardial contractile function. A normal volunteer (male, age 30) with no history of cardiac pathology was imaged with a 1.5 T Siemens Avanto clinical scanner using a TrueFISP imaging sequence and a 32-channel cardiac coil. Both tagged and non-tagged cine MR images were obtained. The Hyperelastic Warping solution was evolved using a series of non-tagged images in ten intermediate phases from end-diastole to end-systole. The solution may be considered as ten separate warping problems with multiple templates and targets. At each stage, an active contraction was initially applied to a finite element model, and then image-based warping penalty forces were utilized to generate the final registration. Warping results for circumferential strain (R(2)=0.75) and radial strain (R(2)=0.78) were strongly correlated with results obtained from tagged MR images analyzed with a Harmonic Phase (HARP) algorithm. Results for fiber stretch, LV twist, and transmural strain distributions were in good agreement with experimental values in the literature. In conclusion, Hyperelastic Warping provides a unique alternative for quantifying regional LV deformation during systole without the need for tags.
