The clinical case of a patient suffering AIDS who presented a progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), diagnosed by CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebral biopsy, is here described. A therapeutic trial was carried out with zidovudine (200 mg/4 hours p.o.) during 75 days. Although this treatment diminished the number of infections, a progression of PML was clinically observed, as well as the appearance of new lesions in the cerebral white matter in the MRI. The inefficacy of zidovudine in PML associated to AIDS is discussed.
