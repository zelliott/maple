In this paper, the anatomical structures of rat jaws are studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with high spatial resolution. In vivo microimages of teeth from 3- and 12-week-old (young and adult) rats have been performed. A 2 T nuclear magnetic resonance microscope was used to collect, with multiple orientations, non-invasive 2D data images using the spin-echo technique. MRI appears well suited to give images of the oral area and may represent a useful tool for diagnosis of dental diseases and more particularly of pulp pathologies.
