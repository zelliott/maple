This study reports the experience of one treatment centre with routine surveillance MRI following excision of musculoskeletal sarcoma. The case notes, MRI and histology reports for 57 patients were reviewed. The primary outcome was local tumour recurrence detected on either surveillance MRI in asymptomatic patients, or interval MRI in patients with clinical concern. A total of 47 patients had a diagnosis of soft-tissue sarcoma and ten of a primary bone tumour. A total of 13 patients (22%) had local recurrence. Nine were identified on a surveillance scan, and four by interval scans. The cost of surveillance is estimated to be pound4414 per recurrence detected if low-grade tumours with clear resection margins are excluded. Surveillance scanning has a role in the early detection of local recurrence of bone and soft-tissue sarcoma.
