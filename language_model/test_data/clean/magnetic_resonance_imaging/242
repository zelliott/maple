We report a case of intestinal malrotation without any associated GI tract complications diagnosed antenatally by fetal MRI. Antenatal US revealed a midline stomach. Subsequent fetal MRI confirmed the midline stomach and, in addition, revealed all loops of small bowel to the right of the midline and all large bowel to the left. All these features were consistent with intestinal malrotation. There was no abnormal bowel wall thickening, bowel dilatation, ascites or polyhydramnios. To our knowledge, this is a unique case of intestinal malrotation without associated GI tract complications diagnosed antenatally on fetal MRI.
