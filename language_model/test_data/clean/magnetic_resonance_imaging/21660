Involvement of the deep grey matter is unusual in Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is disease of the white matter. Basal ganglia involvement is usually secondary to extension from lesions of adjacent white matter and easy to recognize. We report a biopsy-proven case of PML in which lesions were mainly thalamic.
