We report here 38 Japanese patients with hemimegalencephaly collected by a national survey study. All the patients were sporadic. There was no familial occurrence or sex difference. Some patients had basic diseases: hypomelanosis of Ito in 3 cases and organic nevus syndromes in 8. Most patients had hemiparesis, and 11 were bed-ridden. All except for 3 patients had mental retardation, being profound in half of them. There was no correlation between the side of hemimegalencephaly and clinical symptoms. All patients had epileptic seizures, which first appeared within 24 hours after birth in 4 cases, within 7 days in 7, within a month in 2, within 6 months in 10, and within a year in 4. Antiepileptic drugs were not very effective for controlling seizures. In 7 patients, however, functional hemispherectomy resulted in seizure control and improved development. The patients whose epileptic symptom occurred earlier tended to be more severe in clinical symptoms.
