Malignant germ cell tumors of the ovary are relatively rare, making up less than 10% of all ovarian cancers. However, although they represent only a small fraction of ovarian cancers overall, they frequently affect adolescent women of reproductive age, making fertility sparing treatment of paramount importance. Malignant germ cell tumors are subdivided into dysgerminoma and nondygerminomatous tumors. The most common types of nondysgerminomatous tumors are yolk sac and immature teratoma. Mixed germ cell tumors with embryonal carcinoma, nongestational choriocarcinoma, and polyembryoma are less common. Embryonal carcinomas, though rare, are one of the most malignant cancers arising in the ovary.

A 19-year-old female with abdominal pain and massive ascites was found to have a malignant mixed ovarian germ cell tumor with a large embryonal component which was treated via surgical resection and chemotherapy.

Malignant germ cell tumors frequently affect adolescent women of reproductive age. Management of these tumors requires consideration of fertility sparing surgical techniques and chemotherapy management. Using these techniques, the vast majority of patients will maintain their ovarian function and the ability to bear children after their recovery.
