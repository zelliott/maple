A 6 year-old child was admitted for a recurrent bacterial meningitis at Proteus Morganii. She was treated with antibiotics. The C.T. Scanner showed a midline low-density lesion, with a mild annular contrast uptake in the posterior fossa. M.R.I. showed the lesion and revealed a skin-bone-dura fistula. The surgical resection was complete. It was an epidermoid tumor. Intracranial epidermoid tumors constitute about 1% of brain tumors and are considered to be congenital. Epidermoid tumors of the 4th ventricle are exceedingly rare in childhood. The authors reviewed the literature and discuss the pathogeny, the radiographic diagnosis and the treatment of these tumors.
