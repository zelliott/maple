Sclerosing hemangioma is an uncommon tumor of unknown histogenesis that generally develops in the lung. We report on a 48-year-old woman with a sclerosing hemangioma that was apparently isolated to the mediastinum. To our knowledge, sclerosing hemangioma arising in the mediastinum has not been previously reported. Potential mechanisms explaining the isolation of sclerosing hemangioma in the mediastinum are discussed.
