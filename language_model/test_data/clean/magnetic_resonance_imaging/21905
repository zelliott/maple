Glomus tumours involving the middle ear and the cerebellopontine angle are reported with emphasis on audiological findings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), angiographic and pathological results are presented. Audiological tests, including impedance audiometry, evoked otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem responses, are valuable in evaluation of the effect of glomus tumours on the auditory system as well as their pathological extent.
