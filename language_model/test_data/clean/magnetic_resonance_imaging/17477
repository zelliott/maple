Sixty-nine patients with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) have been studied using complex assessment of clinical, cognitive, imaging and sonographic characteristics at different stages of the disease. The ratio of venous return from the brain to arterial inflow, an integral parameter of cerebral hemodynamics, has been also investigated. The results revealed that the most severe clinical, cognitive and imaging changes were typical for cases with disturbances of both arterial and venous cerebral blood flow. VCI progression was followed by the deterioration of cognitive and imaging characteristics. The advanced stage of VCI was featured by the most significant clinical, cognitive and imaging changes, on one hand, and moderate sonographic characteristics, on the other. Disorders of both arterial and venous cerebral blood flow components contribute to VCI pathogenesis.
