The pericardium is well visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because of the superb contrast resolution and multiplanar capability of the technique. This article highlights some of the clinical uses of MRI in evaluating the pericardium and provides comparison with echocardiography and computed tomography (CT) scan. Specific pericardial diseases that are described include pericardial effusion, constrictive pericarditis, neoplastic pericardial disease, congenital abnormalities of the pericardium, and paracardiac masses. The value of MRI in differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy is emphasized. The article discusses the impact of newer MRI techniques such as cine MRI on the assessment of pericardial disease.
