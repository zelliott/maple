Newly developed ferromagnetic catheters (Fe-Caths) are more conspicuous than conventional radiographic catheters (Rad-Caths) on magnetic resonance (MR) images because they produce recognizable ferromagnetic signal patterns (FSPs). To determine how MRI parameters influence these patterns, the imaging characteristics of nine Fe-Caths (ferromagnetic concentration 0.01 to 1.0 weight/weight %) were studied systematically and compared with three Rad-Caths. All catheters were studied in stationary and moving phantoms at mid-field (0.38 T) and high-field (1.5 T) strength using spin-echo and gradient-echo pulse sequences. Rad-Caths always produced a signal void. Fe-Caths produced FSPs, the size of which depended on the orientation of the catheter with respect to the main magnetic field, the concentration of ferromagnetic agent in the catheter, and the direction and strength of the frequency encoding gradient. When Fe-Caths were positioned perpendicular to the main magnetic field, they produced FSPs; however, when they were parallel to the main magnetic field, Fe-Caths produced no FSP, thus having a similar appearance to the Rad-Caths. Ferromagnetic catheters produce conspicuous patterns on MR images that depend on catheter orientation in the main magnetic field and vary predictably with the MRI parameters.
