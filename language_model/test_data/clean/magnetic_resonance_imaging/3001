To demonstrate the high sensitivity of high definition MRI and particularly "Constructive Interference in Steay State" (Ciss) imaging sequence, in depicting neurovascular conflicts in the CP angle cistern, cisternographic imaging and high definition T1 weighed (Turbo flash), contrast enhanced imaging were used to investigate hemifacial spasm (72 patients) and tinnitus with abnormal BER (5 patients). The study was complemented with Angio MR in 25 patients. The results were compared with findings in a control group of 200 patients, and with the surgical observations in 57 operated cases. In hemifacial spasm, the morphology of the neurovascular conflict was determined, as well as the site of compression (lateral medullary fossa 38 cases; nerve 9; both 15 cases), and the vessel involved (VA 25 cases; PICA 16 cases; AICA 10 cases; VA and PICA 8 cases; VA and AICA 3 cases; lateral medullary vein 1 case). In tinnitus (5 cases), the AICA was involved in every case in the IAM. Among 57 operated cases, only one false negative was observed. In the asymptomatic control group, a nerovascular conflict was observed in 3, 5% of the cases only.

CISS imaging is the single most efficient technique, but the combined used of the 3 types of imaging brings the highest diagnostic efficiency, for identifying a neurovascular conflict in the CPA cistern.
