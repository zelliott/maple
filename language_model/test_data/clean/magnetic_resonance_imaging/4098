Short-term changes of magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of a symptomatic lesion in a patient at presentation with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) are presented. These changes strictly correlated with the evolution of the corresponding clinical symptomatology. This suggests that following changes of individual strategically located lesions might be useful to monitor evolution of demyelinating white matter diseases.
