The severity of Friedreich's ataxia was graded in ten patients by clinical examination and in five by use of posturography. These data were compared with neuroradiology findings. CT-confirmed infratentorial atrophy occured only in advanced cases of Friedreich's ataxia; the correlation with the clinical score was poor. On mid-sagittal MRI planes the diameters of fourth ventricle, brain stem at the level of the inferior olive and spinal cord at the levels of the foramen magnum and C3 were measured. Patients with Friedreich's ataxia had significant MRI-confirmed atrophy of the cranial spinal cord as compared with a normal, age-matched control group. This was also observed in patients with Friedreich's ataxia in the early stages. A reliable correlation between atrophy of the cranial spinal cord and the clinical score, however, could again not be found. MRI exploration of the cranial spinal cord may be recommended as an additional diagnostic marker in Friedreich's ataxia.
