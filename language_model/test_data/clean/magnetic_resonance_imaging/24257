Intracranial tumours occur relatively frequently in dogs, and less commonly in cats. With the availability of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, more accurate determination of the location and extent of brain tumours in companion animals has become possible. Following these advances in imaging, precise CT-guided stereotactic techniques for both tumour biopsy and intratumoral drug delivery have been developed for use in cats and dogs. Also, tumour identification methods, such as crush preparation examination, have facilitated rapid tumour identification. The use of improved diagnostic techniques has resulted in an increasing demand for effective therapies for brain tumours. While surgical removal and irradiation remain important treatment considerations in the management of brain tumours of cats and dogs, the development of gene therapy strategies for treatment of intracranial tumours offers much promise, although research in this area is still at an early stage.
