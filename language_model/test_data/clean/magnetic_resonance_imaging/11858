The incorporation of multiple imaging modalities into radiotherapy treatment planning offers the potential to improve identification of regions of pathology. This work outlines and evaluates a methodology for registration of magnetic resonance images (MRI) and spectroscopic images (MRSI) to computed tomography (CT) images, and visualization of the multimodality data on the treatment planning workstation. Volumetric magnetic resonance images were acquired during an examination prior to the initiation of radiotherapy. Registration between these images and the treatment planning computed tomography images was performed using an automated alignment routine, and was improved manually using an interactive registration tool. The parameters of the alignment were then used to transform the spectroscopic images into the same reference frame. The spectroscopy data were represented in terms of a statistical measure of abnormality, and embedded within the MRI data as overlaid contours. These images were sent via DICOM transfer to the treatment planning workstation. An analysis of the reproducibility of the
