We have developed a new operational method for stereotactic functional neurosurgery using MRI stereotaxy combined with microelectrode recording. MRI stereotaxy shows us the individual variations of thalamic configurations. The tentative target points were determined using the MRI stereotaxy assisted software system which revised the distortion of MRI images. Consequently, the accuracy and safety of the microelectrode recording were increased. This, in turn, increased the accuracy of stereotactic thalamotomy while producing encouraging operational outcomes. The effectiveness of stereotactic thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease was confirmed by these excellent operative results. The symptoms improved and the dosage of medications, including L-DOPA, decreased. Furthermore, our results indicate that the distributing area of deep sensory neurons in the thalamus extended more posteriorly and upward than previously expected. Therefore, the functional and anatomical similarity between the human and monkey thalamus was reaffirmed. In this report, based on the above data, we reevaluated the neural mechanism of tremor and the role of stereotactic functional neurosurgery for Parkinson's disease.
