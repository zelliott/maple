Neurocysticercosis is endemic in certain parts of the world, is rare in Europe and has never previously been described in the Irish healthcare setting. We report the case of a healthy male, originally from Guatemala, who presented to our hospital with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure presumed secondary to neurocysticercosis.
