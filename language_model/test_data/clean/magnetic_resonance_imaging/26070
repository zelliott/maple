Seven months after a quadrupled semitendinosus anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, a 44-year-old active-duty soldier reported symptoms consistent with a medial meniscus tear. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed an intra-articular bioabsorbable interference screw within his intercondylar notch. The screw was retrieved arthroscopically. The graft was intact and functional except for a small portion of the anterior fibers, which were debrided. The patient returned to full activities without complaints.
