This study aims to investigate gadolinium-based nanoparticles (Gd-HNP) for in vitro labeling of human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (HuPDC) to allow for in vivo tracking and HuPDC quantifying using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following parenteral injection. Human plasmacytoid DC were labeled (LabHuPDC) with fluorescent Gd-HNP (Gd-FITC-HNP) and injected via intraperitoneal and intravenous routes in 4-5 NOD-SCID Î²2m(-/-)mice (treated mice = TM). Control mice (CM) were similarly injected with unlabeled HuPDC. In vivo 7 T MRI was performed 24 h later and all spleens were removed in order to measure Gd and fluorescence contents and identify HuPDC. Gd-FITC-HNP efficiently labeled HuPDC (0.05 to 0.1 pg per cell), without altering viability and activation properties. The magnetic resonance (MR) signal was exclusively due to HuPDC. The normalized MR splenic intensity for TM was significantly higher than for CM (p < 0.024), and highly correlated with the spleen Gd content (r = 0.97), and the number of HuPDC found in the spleen (r = 0.94). Gd-FITC-HNP allowed for in vivo tracking and HuPDC quantifying by means of MRI following parenteral injection, with very high sensitivity (<3000 cells per mm(3)). The safety of these new nanoparticle types must be confirmed via extensive toxicology tests including in vivo stability and biodistribution studies.
