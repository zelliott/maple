Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a condition characterized by significant chronic inflammatory thickening of the cranial dura mater, frequently presenting with symptoms such as headache and cranial neuropathy. In this report, we describe a very rare case of hypertrophic pachymeningitis, considered to be attributable to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which was diagnosed in a patient who visited our hospital with a complaint of ongoing severe headaches. The diagnosis was based on positive specific serum EBV antibody titers, with VCA-IgM levels of less than 1:10, VCA-IgG levels of 1:160, and EBNA levels of 1:40, as well as on the results of magnetic resonance imaging of the head with contrast media.
