We report on a 61-year-old man who presented with new negative T-waves in V3 to V5. Coronary heart disease with a nonsignificant stenosis of the anterior interventricular artery was known for three years without any symptoms of heart failure. Harvested endomyocardial biopsies of the left ventricle during catheterization showed a chronic parvovirus B19-associated myocarditis. A magnetic resonance imaging was carried out and showed a 6 x 3 x 3-cm mass in the right ventricle extending from the apex. The tumor could be completely resected using cardiopulmonary bypass. Histopathological diagnosis was consistent with a benign fibroma.
