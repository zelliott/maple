The present method enables the noninvasive assessment of mean pulmonary arterial pressure from magnetic resonance phase mapping by computing both physical and biophysical parameters. The physical parameters include the mean blood flow velocity over the cross-sectional area of the main pulmonary artery (MPA) at the systolic peak and the maximal systolic MPA cross-sectional area value, whereas the biophysical parameters are related to each patient, such as height, weight, and heart rate. These parameters have been measured in a series of 31 patients undergoing right-side heart catheterization, and the computed mean pulmonary arterial pressure value (Ppa(Comp)) has been compared with the mean pressure value obtained from catheterization (Ppa(Cat)) in each patient. A significant correlation was found that did not differ from the identity line Ppa(Comp) = Ppa(Cat) (r = 0.92). The mean and maximal absolute differences between Ppa(Comp) and Ppa(Cat) were 5.4 and 11.9 mmHg, respectively. The method was also applied to compute the MPA systolic and diastolic pressures in the same patient series. We conclude that this computed method, which combines physical (whoever the patient) and biophysical parameters (related to each patient), improves the accuracy of MRI to noninvasively estimate pulmonary arterial pressures.
