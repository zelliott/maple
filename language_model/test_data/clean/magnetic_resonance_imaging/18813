Nodular fasciitis is an unusual benign reactive process of the soft tissues related to the fascia and characterized by fibroblastic proliferation. Clinical findings and radiologic aspects of six cases are described [four computed tomography (CT), two ultrasonography (US), one magnetic resonance (MR)]. They were located in the infrahyoid anterior triangle (n=3), prevertebral space (n=2), and masticator space (n=1). Most of these lesions showed moderate to strong enhancement on CT or MR imaging, and were partially embedded in the adjacent muscle with preservation of smooth margin of the muscle. Most cases showed a benign nature, except one case in the prevertebral space which showed aggressive nature with jugular fossa destruction and intracranial extension.
