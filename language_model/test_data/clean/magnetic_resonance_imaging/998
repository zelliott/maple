Successful development and use of biomarkers will improve the productivity of oncology drug development. Recognition of the importance of biomarkers for speeding drug development is reflected in the precise definitions and concepts proposed by an NIH Working Group to standardize terminology and promote a more coherent and systematic approach to the development and use of biomarkers. Potential clinical biomarkers of drug efficacy are often identified through pre-clinical studies or basic research. Identification of potential biomarkers for use in oncology is moving rapidly forward through continuing advances in clinical imaging technologies, especially molecular and functional imaging. Other rapid advances are a product of the growing availability of new scientific reagents for established technologies and of high-throughput genomic and proteomic technologies that can generate hundreds of potential biomarkers for further evaluation. In certain cases, conventional clinical diagnostic techniques or assays can be adapted for use in pre-clinical models to evaluate their ability to serve as biomarkers for predicting clinical responses to new drug candidates. Evaluation (pre-clinical and clinical) of a potential biomarker is often the longest stage of biomarker development, and standards for evaluation or validation depend on the intended use and stage of clinical development. Biomarkers verified for use in preclinical studies can be used to help select appropriate animal models and lead compounds. Biomarkers verified for use in clinical trials can confirm a drug's pharmacological or biological mechanism of action, guide protocol design, aid patient and dose selection, and help to minimize safety risks. Oncology drug development can be optimized by using a tiered set of clinical biomarkers that predict compound efficacy and safety with increasing confidence at each rise in tier thereby aiding corporate decision-making about advancing compounds. In oncology, a special class of extensively evaluated biomarkers of efficacy (surrogate endpoints) that generally correlate with desired clinical outcomes can be used as a basis for corporate decisions as well as for gaining accelerated provisional regulatory approval of a drug.
