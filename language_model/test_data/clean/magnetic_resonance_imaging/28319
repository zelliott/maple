The Mansfield and Issa model of voxel pair coupling is extended using electrical circuit simulation to interacting voxel clusters comprising all configurations of contiguous voxels up to and including four voxels. This information is used to simulate flow through porous rock samples by calculating the expected velocity distributions found in porous rocks using the PEPI rapid NMR imaging technique.
