A 30-year-old man who developed acute blurred vision in the right eye and right periocular pain on eye movement proved to have a bilateral optic neuropathy and imaging evidence suggestive of bilateral optic nerve sheath meningiomas. This is an unusual presentation for optic nerve meningioma but a reminder that this entity may mimic optic neuritis.
