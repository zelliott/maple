We report three cases of spinal angiolipoma, two intramedullary and one epidural, and review their MRI features. Diagnoses were established preoperatively in all cases. Specific MRI features including the importance of postgadolinium fat-saturated T1-weighted images and presence of vascular flow-voids are discussed with histopathological correlation. A characteristic morphological appearance of intramedullary angiolipoma has been suggested.
