Pituitary abscess is a rare disorder. However, preoperative diagnosis is important to prevent a cranial approach leading to severe meningitis. A case of a 55 year-old woman with pituitary abcess is reported. The patient was admitted with a several-week history of frontal headache and no signs of inflammation. Computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a slightly low-density suprasellar expanding mass lesion with an enhanced thin wall in the pituitary region. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a homogenous high-intensity signal relative to brain parenchyma on T1-weighted images with an enhanced thin wall and a homogenous low-intensity signal on T2-weighted images. This was histologically shown to be a pituitary abscess. Our case and review of the available literature suggest that pituitary abscess generally shows a homogenous low-density on CT scan and a homogenous low- to iso- and high-intensity signals or homogenous high- and low-intensity signals on T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively, with a cystic appearance and enhanced smooth wall.
