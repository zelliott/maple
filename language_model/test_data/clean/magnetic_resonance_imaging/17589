We report a case of a 25 year old man presenting with acute headache, vomiting and nuchal rigidity. Computed Tomography (CT) scan and MRI without contrast showed a right ventricular hemorrhage surrounding a mass lesion. The tumor and hematoma were completely removed by neurosurgical transcortical-transventricular approach. Anatomopathological analysis revealed a central neurocytoma. Central neurocytoma seldom present with hemorrhage. We review 16 cases of neurocytoma with hemorrhage. It is important to recognize central neurocytoma as a cause of intraventricular hemorrhage, especially in adolescents and young adults. Outcome is often favorable when the tumor is completely removed. In some patients the clinical course is more aggressive and additional treatment such as radiotherapy, radiosurgery or chemotherapy is needed.
