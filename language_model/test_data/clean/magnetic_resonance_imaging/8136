Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently used in the diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscal injuries. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the reliability and value of MRI in our management of ACL and meniscal tears. 138 patients who had undergone a MRI to confirm or refute the clinical diagnosis of an ACL or meniscal tear were identified. Those who had subsequently undergone arthroscopy were selected. MRI findings and clinical diagnosis were compared with those at arthroscopy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and overall accuracy of clinical diagnosis and MRI were then calculated. The overall accuracy for MRI was 91, 68 and 86% for detecting ACL, medial meniscal and lateral meniscal tears, respectively. Accuracy for clinical diagnosis was 90 and 64% for ACL and meniscal tears, respectively. In contrast to other series, our results indicate a lower accuracy of MRI in detecting pathology, especially of the ACL and medial meniscus. We noted a low sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value but a high negative predictive value rendering MRI most useful as a negative diagnostic tool. We suggest that where symptoms and clinical findings support one of these diagnoses and arthroscopic therapeutic intervention is contemplated, that MRI scanning is not always beneficial. Our current practice of requesting scans to routinely confirm the diagnosis should be altered. Unnecessary MRI scanning increases the financial burden and delays patient treatment.
