Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the knee is a robust method for the evaluation of internal derangements. A knowledge of the well known technical and anatomical pitfalls avoids, in most cases, diagnostic errors. However, the differentiation between meniscocapsular separation and normal anatomy remains challenging. The high prevalence of abnormal MR findings, especially meniscal tears with up to 63% on the asymptomatic contralateral side, has to be considered in patient management.
