This article provides a literature review of the use of MRI in monitoring the treatment response of soft tissue sarcomas. The basic classification and physiology of soft tissue tumors are introduced. Then, the major treatment options for soft tissue sarcomas are summarized with brief coverage of possible responses and grading systems. Four major branches of MRI techniques are covered, including conventional T(1) - and T(2) -weighted imaging, contrast-enhanced MRI, MR diffusion and perfusion imaging, and MRS, with a focus on the tumor microenvironment. Although this literature survey focuses on recent clinical developments using these MRI techniques, research venues in preclinical studies, as well as in potential applications other than soft tissue sarcomas, are also included when comparable and/or mutually supporting. Examples from other less-discussed MRI modalities are also briefly covered, not only to complement, but also to expand, the scope and depth of information for various kinds of lesions.
