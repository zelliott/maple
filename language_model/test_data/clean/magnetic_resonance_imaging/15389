We report on the case of a patient with breast cancer with diffuse cranial nerve and cauda equina lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging of the patient's brain and spinal cord showed diffuse abnormal enhancement and slight enlargement of the cranial nerves and cauda equina. Although the results of subsequent testing for two antineural antibodies were negative, paraneoplastic sensorimotor neuropathy associated with breast cancer was considered to be the most likely clinical diagnosis.
