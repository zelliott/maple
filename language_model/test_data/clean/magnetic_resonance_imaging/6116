Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection generally induces lipodystrophy. For targeted treatment a better understanding of its development is necessary. The utility of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is explored.

The present study presents a way to visualize the adipose tissue architecture in vivo and to inspect modifications associated with the atrophy.

High-resolution MRI scans with surface coils were performed on the calf and at the lumbar region of three groups of patients: HIV patients with lipoatrophy, HIV patients without lipoatrophy and healthy volunteers. All patients underwent a clinical examination. In addition, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measurements were taken. On the MRI scans adipose tissue thickness and adipose nodule size were measured. Results High-resolution MRI enabled identification of a clear disorganization of adipose tissue in patients with lipoatrophy. In addition, these patients presented a very small adipose tissue thickness on the calf and a very small nodule size.

led to the hypothesis that adipose tissue disorganization appears before changes in DEXA measurements or clinically visible modifications.

High-resolution MRI enabled visualization in vivo of precise changes in tissue organization due to HIV lipoatrophy. This imaging technique should be very informative for better monitoring of the atrophy.
