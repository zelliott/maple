By using a neonatal rat hypoxia-ischemia (HI) model, we studied the relationship between lesion volume-measured by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) at an early time point-and irreversible infarct volume. We also evaluated the optimal apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) threshold that provides the best correlation with irreversible infarct size.

Twenty-three neonatal rats underwent right common carotid artery ligation and hypoxia. MR imaging was performed 1-2 hours post-HI by using DWI and T2WI and at day 4 post-HI by using T2WI. Lesion volumes relative to whole brain (%LV) were measured on ADC maps by using different relative ADC thresholds 60%-80% of mean contralateral ADC and T2WI. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were used to study the relationships between ln(%LV) at MR imaging and %LV at histopathology.

At 1-2 hours post-HI, all lesion volume measurements on DWI were significantly correlated with the infarct volume on histopathology, with the best correlation attained at the 80% ADC threshold (r = 0.738; P < .001). The estimated regression formula was %LV on histopathology = 20.60 + 3.33 ln(%LV on 80% ADC threshold) (adjusted R(2) = 0.523; P < .001). Lesion volume at 1-2 hours post-HI tended to underestimate the final infarct volume.

Early post-HI MR imaging by using DWI correlates moderately well with the size of irreversible infarct, especially when measured by using a relative ADC threshold of 80% mean contralateral ADC.
