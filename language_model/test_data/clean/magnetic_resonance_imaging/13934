The authors performed this study to determine whether, on the basis of the vascular profile, low-grade siderotic dysplastic nodules are premalignant lesions.

The authors used a monoclonal antibody specific for smooth muscle actin to stain 18 siderotic low-grade dysplastic nodules (mean size, 0.7 cm) from nine patients. Two pathologists counted the number of unpaired arteries per high-power field in siderotic dysplastic nodules and background siderotic regenerative nodules by using two techniques (conventional and hot spot).

The number of unpaired arteries seen with the conventional counting technique in low-grade siderotic dysplastic nodules (range, 1-14; mean, 3.8) was significantly greater (P = .004) than that seen in background siderotic regenerative nodules (range, 0-3; mean, 1.2). Similarly, the number of unpaired arteries seen with the hot spot technique in low-grade siderotic dysplastic nodules (range, 0-14; mean, 5.2) was significantly greater (P = .005) than that seen in background siderotic regenerative nodules (range, 0-6; mean, 1.9).

On the basis of the vascular profile, low-grade siderotic dysplastic nodules should be considered premalignant lesions. Further research is needed to help differentiate these lesions from siderotic regenerative nodules with magnetic resonance imaging.
