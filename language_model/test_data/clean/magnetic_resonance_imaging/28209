The appreciation that brainstem tumours do not comprise a homogeneous pathological group and that up to 20% of the preoperative radiological diagnoses of brainstem lesions prove at operation to be wrong, has established the need for a firm histological diagnosis prior to treatment. Current neuro-imaging modalities may have increased the diagnostic accuracy and the detection rate of intrinsic brainstem lesions, but open exploration in cases without an exophytic component is still associated with a low diagnostic yield and considerable morbidity. A series of 72 brainstem lesions approached stereotactically with CT or MRI guidance is presented. A transcortical frontal precoronal trajectory was used in 58 and a suboccipital transcerebellar route in 14. Haematoma was diagnosed preoperatively in 16 cases and therapeutic aspiration was planned. In 56 cases the diagnosis was uncertain, although intrinsic tumour was suspected. A histological diagnosis was established in 52 cases, although in the remaining four cases a tumour was excluded. Unexpected findings occurred in over 15% of the cases. There were no operative deaths and the morbidity was low. In no case was there a permanent neurological deterioration directly related to the procedure, although there was a transient deterioration in two patients and another patient required early re-aspiration of a haematoma.
