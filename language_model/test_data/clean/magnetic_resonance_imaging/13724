While electron paramagnetic resonance imaging (EPRI) enables spatial mapping of free radicals in the whole body of small animals, it solely visualizes the free-radical distribution and does not typically provide anatomic visualization of the body. However, anatomic registration is often required for meaningful interpretation of the EPRI-derived free-radical images. An approach is reported for whole-body, EPRI-based, free-radical imaging along with proton MRI in mice. EPRI instrumentation with a 750-MHz narrow band microwave bridge and transverse oriented electric field reentrant resonator, with automatic coupling control and automatic tuning control capability, was used to map the spatial distribution of nitroxide free radicals in phantoms and in living mice, while low-field proton MRI at 16 MHz was used to define the anatomic structure to register the EPR images. Small capillary tubes containing an aqueous radical label were used as markers to enable image superimposition. With this coregistration technique, the EPRI free-radical images were precisely registered, enabling assignment of the location of the observed free-radical distribution within the organs of the mice. This technique enabled differentiation of the distribution and metabolism of nitroxide radicals within the major organs and body sites of living mice.
