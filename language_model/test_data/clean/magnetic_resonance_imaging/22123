Pulmonary edema is a debilitating effect of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The ability to measure it noninvasively with high sensitivity and in three dimensions could be useful in not only detection but also in assessment and guidance of treatment. To this end, a three-dimensional MRI pulse sequence to measure the formation of edema was developed and tested. Another sequence was tested to measure blood flow in distal pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary edema was induced in nine dogs via venous injections of oleic acid. Edema was verified by wet-to-dry weight ratio (5.30 +/- .38) and extra-vascular lung water at baseline (2.03 +/- 1.12 ml/g dry lung weight) versus postinjury (3.00 +/- 1.45 ml/g) (P < .005). The signal-to-noise ratio within the lungs increased from 5.47 +/- 1.00 at baseline to 7.51 +/- 1.96 (P < .005), and the time course of edema formation was resolved. Results from MR phase-contrast blood flow measurements were variable. The authors conclude that the three-dimensional scan provides a sensitive relative quantification of pulmonary edema formation without the use of contrast agents or ionizing radiation.
