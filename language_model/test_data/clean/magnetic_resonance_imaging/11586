Recent evidence suggests that multiple sclerosis (MS) is a continuously active neuropathologic process, even during the subclinical relapsing/remitting phase of the disease. Patients commonly feel well and function without disability for many years, experiencing only occasional relapses and nondisabling symptoms. In time, many evolve into a pattern of continuously progressive neurologic disability termed secondary progressive MS (SP-MS). SP-MS is hypothesized to occur once disease severity has exceeded a threshold. Above that threshold, compensatory mechanisms are inadequate to maintain normal function, and further disease progression is accompanied by progressively worsening disability. Inflammation dominates the early stage of disease. Progressive axonal pathology may underlie clinical disease progression in later stages. These concepts have important implications related to the diagnosis, methods for patient follow-up, type and timing of disease therapy, and the testing of neuroprotective drugs in MS.
