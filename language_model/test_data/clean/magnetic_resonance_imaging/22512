Overview of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in staging of lung cancer.

Currently available methods of imaging lung cancer, lymph node and distant metastases by MRI are explained. At present, MRI is mainly used in the detection of cerebral metastases and assessment of infiltration of the thoracic wall and of the mediastinum. The capabilities of T2-weighted single-shot TSE (HASTE) and T1-weighted 3D gradient echo techniques (VIBE) are demonstrated.

With the advent of new fast sequences like HASTE and VIBE the spatial resolution comes close to that of computed tomography but with an outstanding soft tissue contrast and without radiation exposure. The introduction of lymph node specific contrast media will improve sensitivity and specificity in N staging. Additionally, whole-body MRI is capable of detecting distant metastases, in particular in the organs at risk, i.e. brain, upper abdomen and musculoskeletal system.

MRI is gaining importance as part of a multimodal imaging approach for staging of lung cancer.
