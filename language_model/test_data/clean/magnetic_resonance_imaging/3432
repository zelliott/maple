There have been reports of various etiologies associated with reversible splenial lesions manifested as obviously restricted diffusion. We describe for a 27-year-old woman suffering from late postpartum preeclampsia associated with reversible splenial lesions. This association has not been reported to date. Awareness that profound late postpartum preeclampsia can rarely result in abnormalities of the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) may help clinicians avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions. Moreover, it must be stated that prediction of the clinical course based on DWI and ADC values should be used with caution.
