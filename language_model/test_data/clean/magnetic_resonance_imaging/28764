Arthroscopic surgery using the lysis and lavage technique was performed on 30 temporomandibular joints (TMJs) of 26 patients with the clinical and radiological (pseudodynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging) diagnosis of static disk (SD). Parameters of condylar movement, position of the disk in relation to the condyle in open and closed mouth positions and mobility of the articular disk were evaluated both clinically and radiologically using pseudodynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) before and after surgery. Subjective parameters of pain and functional limitation were also evaluated clinically. The results showed that all the clinical and radiological parameters analyzed improved significantly in all the patients included in the study. In view of the results, the authors concluded that SD should be added to the existing categories of TMJ internal derangements. Pseudodynamic MRI is the diagnostic technique of choice in these cases and arthroscopic surgery with lysis and lavage followed by active physical therapy is an effective treatment modality in this type of pathology.
