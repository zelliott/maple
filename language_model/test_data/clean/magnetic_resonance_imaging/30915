The authors report on two patients with spinal meningeal melanocytoma and review the literature on this lesion. One case is particularly interesting because of the lesion's thoracic intramedullary localization. Meningeal melanocytoma is a benign but locally aggressive lesion and is very rarely associated with spinal localizations. This patient presented with paraparesis. Clinical and radiological examinations suggested the possibility of an intramedullary solid tumor. Thoracic laminectomy, posterior myelotomy, and tumor resection were performed; the mass was totally removed. The patient suffered no additional neurological deficit. During a 3-year follow-up period in which radiotherapy was not performed, the lesion did not recur. Total excision of the tumor is the best therapeutic option.
