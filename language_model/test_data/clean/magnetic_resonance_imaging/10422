The objective of this study was to implement a three-dimensional (3-D) T1 mapping sequence (3DLL) at 3.0 T for dGEMRIC based on the Look Locker scheme.

Because all current reports on dGEMRIC are at 1.5 T and mostly using 2-D IR fast spin echo (FSE), data were acquired at 1.5 T and 3.0 T with both 3DLL and 2-D IR-FSE sequence. Phantoms with different concentrations of Gd(DTPA) were used and seven subjects (three asymptomatic, four symptomatic) were scanned using the dGEMRIC technique.

The T1 measurements obtained on the phantom with 3DLL show very good agreement with those acquired with 2-D IR-FSE. Using a two-tailed paired t test, the T1 (Gd) measurements in two sections obtained in all subjects with both sequences were found to be statistically indistinguishable at either field strength (P = 0.07 at 1.5 T and P = 0.07 at 3.0 T).

The preliminary data presented here suggest that the 3DLL sequence provides accurate T1 values with sufficient in-plane resolution and allows full joint coverage in less than 10 minutes.
