Seventeen patients underwent a neuroendocrinological function test at a mean 6.3 years following a severe craniocerebral trauma (CCT) accompanied by midbrain syndrome. An insulin hypoglycaemia test (IHT) and the combined pituitary anterior lobe test (CPALT) were applied. Whereas the IHT as maximum stimulator of the hypothalamo-pituitary system (HPS) showed an adequate reserve capacity, the CPALT yielded a partial limitation of the secretion dynamic in the somatotropic, adrenocorticotropic axis as well as a dysfunction in the FSH secretion. Neuroradiological tests could not establish substantial injury in the regio hypothalamica in any patient.
