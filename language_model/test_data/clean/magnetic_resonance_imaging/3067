We investigated the relationship between electrocorticography (ECoG), quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and surgical outcome in 165 patients with intractable nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy (NLTLE). A standard mesial temporal resection was performed in all patients. Patients with an operative follow-up < 1 year were excluded from the study. The extent of the lateral temporal neocortex resection (LCR) was guided by ECoG and the side of surgery. The extent of the LCR was not predictive of seizure outcome in patients with or without hippocampal formation atrophy (p > 0.5). Patients undergoing a right anterior temporal lobectomy had a larger LCR (p < 0.0001), but the side of surgery was not of predictive value in determining seizure outcome (p > 0.1). The topography of the acute intracranial spikes did not correlate with operative outcome (p > 0.5) and was independent of hippocampal volumetric studies (p > 0.5). The postexcision ECoG was also shown not to be of prognostic importance (p > 0.5). Our results indicates that the extent of the lateral temporal cortical resection and the ECoG findings are not important determinants of surgical outcome in patients with NLTLE.
