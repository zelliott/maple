Since the life span of our society is increasing and the expectation of high functional demands is growing more and more older people take part in sports activities emphasises the necessity of early diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions and their correct treatment. The goal of any diagnostic means should be a proper treatment of rotator cuff lesions according to the detected pathology. New arthroscopic techniques to surgically reconstruct rotator cuff tears have brought the operative repair techniques another step further. In cases of large and complex cuff tears the surgeon can individually select an adequate reconstruction procedure which includes anatomical-, partial-, tendon-transfer and muscle-transfer repairs. In cases of irreparable tears with cuff-tear arthropathy and consecutive superior migration of the humeral head hemiarthroplasty or the inverse deltoid prosthesis have to be considered. Based on clinical, radiological and arthroscopic findings we developed algorithms that will lead to the best suited procedure for a given lesion.
