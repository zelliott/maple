A 46 year old man was referred for severe left cruralgia and multiple vertebral cystic defects on CT-scan. He was treated by hemodialysis since 1987 for chronic renal failure secondary to focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, diagnosed in 1960 on renal biopsy. Dialysis schedule consisted of 3 x 4 h/week with a polysulfone dialyser and 1.75 mMol Ca containing bicarbonate dialysate. On early 1995, the patient complained of back pain and cruralgia, which gradually worsened. Vertebral column CT-scan and MRI showed multiple lytic lesions expanding into the medullary canal. Biological hyperparathyroidism was present. To differentiate between hyperparathyroidism with brown tumors, malignancy and amyloid deposition, an iliac biopsy and a biopsy of a corporeal vertebral cyst were done. They showed florid hyperparathyroidism and brown tumors. The patient was submitted to surgical parathyroidectomy. Six months after surgery, cruralgia resumed, CT-scan and MRI showed refilling of the cysts by calcic material.
