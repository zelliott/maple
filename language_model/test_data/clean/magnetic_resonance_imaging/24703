We report a case of a 14-year-old boy who presented with the inability to independently move fingers on either hand. On physical examination, simultaneous flexion of the index, middle and ring fingers was noted when he actively flexed the distal joint of the thumb. A surgical exploration was performed and anomalous tendinous interconnections between the flexor pollicis longus-index flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and index FDP-middle FDP were observed and removed. The middle- and ring-finger FDP were adhered by thickened tenosynovium and divided. The patient was able to flex the thumb and fingers independently after surgery.
