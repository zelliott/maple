In this study, diffusion-weighted images of the human prostate were successfully obtained, enabling quantification of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) in normal and pathologic regions. A dual acquisition fast spin-echo sequence was used for accurate T2 calculation. T2 values were significantly higher in the peripheral zone than the central gland (P = 0.015). No significant correlations were found in either normal or pathologic tissue between ADC values and relaxation rates for all three gradient directions and the orientationally averaged water diffusion coefficient. Evidence suggesting that diffusional anisotropy is present in normal prostatic tissue is also detailed, with significant differences noted between the z-component and both the x- and y-components of the ADC for peripheral zone (P < 0.040) and central gland (P < 0.001).
