To retrospectively assess the value of endorectal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR spectroscopy combined with the free-to-total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ratio for detecting prostate cancer in men with elevated PSA levels.

The institutional review board approved the study, and all patients provided informed written consent. Endorectal MR imaging and MR spectroscopy were performed in 54 patients with PSA levels greater than 3 ng/mL but less than 15 ng/mL and free-to-total PSA ratio of less than 20%, followed by sextant biopsy in the peripheral zone. For each patient, MR imaging and MR spectroscopic findings, PSA level, and free-to-total PSA ratio were analyzed and compared with biopsy results and/or histopathologic tumor maps with regard to a sextant-modified distribution. The likelihood of cancer in each sextant according to MR and MR spectroscopic findings was graded independently on a scale of 1 (benign) to 5 (malignant). Detection accuracy and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to determine the most accurate combination of imaging, and clinical tests were used to detect prostate cancer according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

The model incorporating MR imaging, MR spectroscopy, and free-to-total PSA ratio (AUC = 97.5%) was significantly more accurate in predicting prostate cancer than models using MR imaging alone (AUC = 85.1%; P = .007), MR spectroscopy alone (AUC = 87.2%; P = .041), or MR imaging and free-to-total PSA ratio combined (AUC = 90.8%; P = .038).

MR and MR spectroscopy combined with free-to-total PSA ratio improves the predictive value for prostate cancer detection.
