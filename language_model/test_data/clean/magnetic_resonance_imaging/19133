The development of a peritumoral oedema is a common radiological sign in preoperative CT- and MRI scans of patients with cerebral metastasis. Large tumours can be accompanied by a marginally extended oedema and vice versa. Several cytokines (VEGF) have been identified as mediators of vascular induction and permeability. Transmitters such as nitric oxide (NO) have been identified as specific mediators of vascular dilation and tumour blood flow in primary brain tumours in which different NOS isozymes (NOS I and III) are induced as a result of the latent hypoxic metabolic scenery. Other authors have considered NO as an endothelial stabilising metabolite. Inducible NOS II is expressed by microglia and macrophages invading during tumour growth. At present, no data exist on NO synthesising enzymes in cerebral metastasis.

Cryosections (N = 96) of metastatic resections were investigated immunohistologically using a 4-step grading evaluation for the expression of NOS I-III, VEGF-receptor FLT-1, a pan-macrophage marker Ki-M1P, and capillary vessel presence by endothelial Von-Willebrand-Factor staining. The tumour and oedema extension was measured in preoperative MRI scans by an image processing device (Kontron) and calculated for the ratios of oedema volumes to total tumour volumes. The data were analysed statistically (Pearson Chi2 and Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variances) and correlated with the clinical data. Inducible NOS II was further investigated by in situ hybridization with a (4x30 mer) DNA oligoprobe cocktail.

Between 1987 and 1996 289 patients in our department suffered from a metastatic disease in the brain or spinal cord. In 96 cases resected tumour material was processed for the immunohistological investigation. The age distribution ranged from 14 to 85 years with a median age of 58 years. The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was estimated as 53 days. The expression of NO synthase was frequently observed. NOS I was detected in 83.6%, gradings 2 and 3 in 40.5% of them. NOS III, the endothelial isoform, was observed in 39.4% (gradings 2 and 3), inducible NOS II in 29.4% (grading 2 and 3) of the specimens. The VEGF receptor FLT-1 could be detected in 70% of them, 24% in higher expression 2 and 3. The pan macrophage marker Ki-M1P was observed in 72% of all cases. Fifty seven percent of the specimens exhibited strong labelling with antibodies against VWF. Coexpressions were statistically significant for the VEGF receptor and NOS I-III (p < 0.01), Ki-M1P and NOS I and II (p < 0.05). A negative correlation was detected for the oedema index (oedema volume/total volume) and the labelling data for NOS III (r = -0.44, p = 0.13) and VEGF-R (r = -0.42, p = 0.022). No correlation existed for Ki-M1P, VWF and NOS I.

The objective of the study was to investigate oedema morphometry, expression of NOS I-III and VEGF-R, presence of capillary vessels and macrophages in cerebral metastasis. A further aim was to investigate a putative oedema induction by NO producing isozymes. Nitric oxide synthase expression was statistically significantly correlated with the expression of the VEGF receptor and the presence of macrophages and microglia. There was a negative correlation between oedema extension and the presence of NOS III and VEGF-R. The results seem to indicate a specific oedema modulating role of NO in cerebral metastasis.
