The aim of this study was to determine the value of a fat suppressed 3D gradient-echo sequence (GRE) data set in comparison to a 2D GRE sequence in direct MR arthrography of the shoulder. For this purpose we examined 50 consecutive patients with subacute or chronic disorders of the shoulder using a 1.5 T scanner: Transverse T1-weighted 2D (slice thickness 4 mm) and 3D GRE (slice thickness 1.5 mm reconstructed from 3 mm), oblique coronal T2- and T1-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) and sagittal T1-weighted TSE with fat saturation were applied. Visual image analysis of anatomical and pathological structures was performed by two independent observers. A correlation to surgical results was available in 21 patients. Transverse GRE sequences were well suited for analysis of the anterior/posterior labrum, the middle glenohumeral ligament, and cartilage. 3D GRE with fat suppression was slightly superior to 2D GRE without fat suppression in the evaluation of the anterior/posterior labrum, and the middle glenohumeral ligament, whereas for cartilage no significant differences were found between both sequences. Concerning pathological findings, in most of the cases 2D delivered the same results as 3D. In conclusion, a T1-weighted 3D GRE data set with fat saturation in transverse orientation may be useful for evaluation of the anterior/posterior labrum, and the middle glenohumeral ligament. However, similar measured slice thickness of 3 mm-even if interpolated to 1.5 mm-compared to a 2D sequence with 4 mm does not provide significant diagnostic advantages.
