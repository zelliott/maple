Animals with a portosystemic shunt (PSS) often have neurologic abnormalities. Diagnostic imaging, including brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, is not performed routinely in these animals. In this study, brain MR images were obtained in 13 dogs and three cats with a PSS, and in 15 dogs and five cats that were neurologically normal and used as controls. All animals with a PSS had widened sulci. In addition, 10 out of 13 dogs with a PSS and one out of three cats with a PSS had hyperintense focal areas in the lentiform nuclei on T1-weighted (T1W) images, which did not enhance after intravenous gadolinium. Following surgical correction of the PSS, MR imaging examinations were repeated in one dog and one cat. The hyperintensity of the lentiform nuclei had decreased. This study indicates that MR imaging findings of widened sulci and hyperintensity of the lentiform nuclei on T1W images may be found in dogs and cats with a PSS.
