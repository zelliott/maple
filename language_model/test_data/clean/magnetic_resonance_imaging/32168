The aim of this prospective study was the evaluation of preoperative three-dimensional ultrasound in detecting meniscal lesions compared to preoperative MRI.

A total of 34 patients with clinical signs of meniscal lesions were examined preoperatively (11.7 MHz linear transducer) using the 3-D technique. Before ultrasound, MRI was performed, the results of which were unknown to the ultrasound examiner. The basis of the MRI result was the radiologist's written report. Arthroscopically the meniscal situation was noted and taken as reference.

At arthroscopy there were 10 lateral meniscal lesions at different locations and 47 medial meniscal lesions at different locations. The sensitivity (0.5-0.78) and specificity (0.75-0.95) of both imaging methods were overall comparable.

Ultrasound with the three-dimensional technique and high-resolution transducer in the hands of an experienced operator gives results comparable to the MRI interpretation by a general radiologist in detecting meniscal lesions.
