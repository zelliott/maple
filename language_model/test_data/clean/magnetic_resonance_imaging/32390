Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is presently either performed using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast or using cerebral blood flow (CBF), measured with arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique. The present fMRI study aimed to provide practical hints to favour one method over the other. It involved three different acquisition methods during visual checkerboard stimulation on nine healthy subjects: 1) CBF contrast obtained from ASL, 2) BOLD contrast extracted from ASL and 3) BOLD contrast from Echo planar imaging. Previous findings were replicated; i) no differences between the three measurements were found in the location of the activated region; ii) differences were found in the temporal characteristics of the signals and iii) BOLD has significantly higher sensitivity than ASL perfusion. ASL fMRI was favoured when the investigation demands for perfusion and task related signal changes. BOLD fMRI is more suitable in conjunction with fast event related design.
