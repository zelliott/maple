We reported two Tc-99m(V) DMSA scintigrams in patients with idiopathic synovial chondromatosis which affected the metacarpo-phalangeal joint and shoulder joint. Tc-99m(V) DMSA accumulated markedly and diffusely in the tumor. Tc-99m(V) DMSA scintigraphy would be valuable for deciding the optimal site for biopsy.
