Seventy-nine magnetic resonance (MR) studies of the knee were reviewed in an evaluation of the ability of MR imaging to demonstrate arthroscopically proved anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. MR findings were also compared with the findings of two commonly applied clinical tests of ACL instability: the Lachman test and the anterior drawer test. The sensitivity of MR imaging was 94% (17 of 18), compared with 78% (14 of 18) for the anterior drawer test and 89% (16 of 18) for the Lachman test. The specificity was 100% for all three. Three MR criteria were applied: irregularity or a wavy contour of the anterior margin of the ligament, high-signal-intensity change within the substance of the ligament on T2-weighted images, and discontinuity of that substance. The sagittal T2-weighted image was especially helpful, producing an "arthrographic" effect, in which the anterior margin of the ACL is outlined by high-signal-intensity joint fluid. By demonstrating ACL and other extrameniscal lesions, MR imaging may help clarify the mechanisms of knee injury.
