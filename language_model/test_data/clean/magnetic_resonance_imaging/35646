Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is known as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In recent years, several experimental and epidemiological studies have suggested that CKD is associated with endothelial dysfunction; thereby, a CKD state may initiate both large and small vessel damage. The association between renal dysfunction and asymptomatic lacunar infarction was reported in a hospital-based study, whereas the relationship between cerebral small vessel disease (SVD)-related lesions and CKD could not be clarified in a community-based study. We performed a cross-sectional study to determine the relationship between silent cerebral SVD-related lesions and CKD in a total of 625 community-based Japanese elderly. In this study, subjects with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate levels tended to have more lacunar infarcts and higher grades of white matter lesions (WMLs). In addition, the mean grades of WMLs or the mean numbers of lacunar infarction in the subjects with albuminuria were greater than those in subjects without albuminuria. In the logistic regression analysis, the association between the presence of CKD and lacunar infarction or moderate WMLs (Fazekas grades 2 and 3) was statistically significant (odds ratio [OR]: 1.86 and 1.50, respectively). Furthermore, as we performed additional analysis, excluding the subjects with stage 2 hypertension (those with casual blood pressure >or=160/100 mm Hg) or diabetes, CKD remained to be an independent risk for cerebral SVD-related lesions. This is the first study showing the relationship between silent SVD-related brain lesions and the presence of CKD, independently of conventional cardiovascular risk factors, in community-based elderly.
