The prognosis for intraventricular neurocysticercosis (IVNCC) is poorer than that for parenchymal NCC, making prompt diagnosis and treatment especially important. Although active, viable intraventricular cysts produce no reaction in the host; they can cause noncommunicating hydrocephalus, the onset of which is frequently abrupt. With the death of the larva comes a local granulomatous ependymitis, generalized ventriculitis, and meningoencephalitis. The authors report on 18 patients with IVNCC (accrued from a larger case series of 62 patients with NCC treated over an 11-year period), detailing clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, treatment, and outcome.

All patients presented with hydrocephalus and/or meningitis. The most valuable diagnostic tests were magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and EITB of serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment included albendazole and steroid therapy in all cases, and when necessary in cases requiring urgent or emergency ventriculostomy and/or surgical removal of the obstructing cyst (followed by shunt placement if indicated).

An extensive review of the literature on IVNCC has been prepared, with the goal of providing the reader with the information necessary to diagnose and treat this complex and potentially fatal disease in a timely and effective manner.
