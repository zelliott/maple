To examine the incidence of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection relative to common genetic etiologies of hearing loss in a pediatric population with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), and to characterize intracranial radiological abnormalities in patients with CMV-associated hearing loss.

Retrospective study.

Academic tertiary care center.

A total of 112 pediatric patients with confirmed SNHL.

The association of congenital CMV infection status with abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and the frequencies of congenital CMV infection, gap junction Î²-2 (GJB2) mutations, and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 1555A>G mutation in children with SNHL.

Of 109 patients, 11 (10%) had positive results for CMV DNA; 10 of the 11 had normal GJB2 sequence and had negative test results for the mtDNA 1555A>G mutation. Brain MRI scans for 97 patients demonstrated a higher proportion of abnormalities in patients with positive CMV test results (80%) compared with those with no detectable CMV DNA (33%) (P = .006). GJB2 mutations and the mtDNA 1555A>G mutation were seen in 10 of 88 patients (11%) and 1 of 97 patients (1%) with SNHL, respectively.

The presence of brain abnormalities in most patients with congenital CMV infection suggests that neurological damage in otherwise asymptomatic patients may not be limited to SNHL. Congenital CMV infection accounted for a significant proportion of patients with SNHL, with an incidence rate comparable with that of GJB2-related SNHL.
