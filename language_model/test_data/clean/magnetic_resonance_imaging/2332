Coronary angiography in a 52-year-old woman with angina-type chest pain showed tumor circulation with feeding arteries arising from the circumflex artery. Transthoracic echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging both failed to show any intracardiac masses. A sessile mass measuring 1.5 cm in diameter attached to the atrial septum was readily detected by transesophageal echocardiography. Histologic analysis confirmed the tumor to be a myxoma. Coronary angiography may provide the first clue to the presence of a small myxoma. Transesophageal echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice for further evaluation.
