A 69-year-old male was diagnosed as having prostate cancer with ureter invasion. His serum prostate specific antigen level was not so high (19.6 ng/ml) before treatment, but clinical stage was D2, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of prostate. He was treated with chemoendocrine therapy. Prostate cancer with continuous invasion to the middle ureter is rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 6th case report of such an unusual invasion of prostate cancer.
