In a previous study from our group [A. Khiat, C. Bard, A. Lacroix, J. Rousseau, Y. Boulanger, Brain metabolic alterations in Cushing's syndrome as monitored by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, NMR Biomed. 12 (1999) 357-363], proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) was used to evaluate changes in cerebral metabolites in patients with Cushing's syndrome as compared to normal subjects. Data recorded in the frontal, thalamic and temporal areas demonstrated statistically significant decreases of the Cho/Cr ratios in the frontal and thalamic areas but not in the temporal area for Cushing's syndrome patients. No statistically significant changes in the NAA/Cr ratios were measured in any of the areas studied. In this follow-up study, MRS data are reported for ten patients after correction of hypercortisolism which demonstrate a statistically significant recovery of the choline levels in the frontal and thalamic areas. No variation in the NAA, Cr and mI metabolite ratios relative to H(2)O could be measured. Results are interpreted as an inhibition of the phosphatidylcholine degrading phospholipases by glucocorticoids which disappears after correction of hypercortisolism.
