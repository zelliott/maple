[March 2008-Cleveland Case Report]. There is a well-described association between the occurrence of developmental tumors and the presence of cortical dysplasia in the neighboring brain tissue. The main surgical approaches in the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy related to such developmental tumors include a lesionectomy versus a tailored cortical resection, often guided by an invasive evaluation. This case report describes the surgical management of a 26-year-old female with olfactory auras evolving into automotor seizures and convulsions, occurring in the context of a right temporo-parietal developmental lesion. It illustrates the pros and cons of various surgical approaches, and discusses some pathophysiological aspects of developmental tumors, dysplasia and epilepsy. [Published with video sequences].
