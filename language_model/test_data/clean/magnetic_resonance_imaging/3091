To investigate the pathology of cervical flexion myelopathy among younger people, clinical, morphological and biochemical studies were performed in six cases (four males and two females) treated by posterior fusion. X-ray films showed, in all cases, scoliosis in the cervical spine as well as a reduction in the sagittal diameter and an anterior deviation in the spinal cord at the time of flexion. Spinal atrophy in the sagittal plane and crescent-shaped high contrast areas posterior to the dural tube were also observed on MRI images. Surgical findings, showed substantial expansion by the veins posterior to the dural tube in five cases with four showing accompanying organization. Morphological studies showed that in the musculus splenius capitis, the type 1 fibers were slightly more than in normal tissues. Moreover in one case, we observed neurogenic lesions such as the predominance and atrophy of type 2 fibers. Biochemical analyses of the collagen from muscles and skin showed immature collagen fibers, which was marked particularly in skin. The above results suggested that abnormalities in the collagen fibers in the soft tissues were related to the pathogenesis of cervical flexion myelopathy.
