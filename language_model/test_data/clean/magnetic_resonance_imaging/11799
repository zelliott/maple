Hemangiomas are tumors. Hemangiomas near the geniculate ganglion or in the internal acoustic meatus are well known but rare. We present two cases of hemangiomas located at the porus acusticus, an even more rare site. MRI showed a millimeter-sized tumor, located in the porus acusticus, developing perpendicular to the axis of the acoustico-facial nerves, surrounding them. They were hyperintense on T1-weighted images, strongly hyperintense on T2-weighted images with a characteristic progressive and marked enhancement after injection of gadolinium DTPA. Similar signal abnormalities were present in the adjacent temporal bone, and CT scan demonstrated a honeycomb appearance with intratumoral bony spicules. These imaging criteria allows differentiation between hemangioma and neurinoma. We hypothesize that this location is related to the presence of a rich vascular plexus of the dura mater in this area.
