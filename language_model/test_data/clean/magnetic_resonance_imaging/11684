In the last years new computer-based imaging techniques, like color Doppler sonography, Computed Tomography, and Magnetic Resonance, have allowed a non-invasive approach to vascular diseases, partially replacing angiography, and increasing the role of radiology in the diagnosis and management of many chronic diseases, such as Takayasu's arteritis. Simultaneous evaluation of luminal and vascular wall changes may now allow a simpler diagnosis of this condition also in its early phase and the effective therapy monitoring. Application of new procedures of interventional radiolgy provides a safer and more conservative correction of late steno-occlusive complications. Familiarity with the different imaging features of Takayasu arteritis will permit a more accurate clinical diagnosis and management of this insidious disorder.
