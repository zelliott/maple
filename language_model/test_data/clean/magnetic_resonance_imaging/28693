Brain responses to eyes and whole face were studied by magnetoencephalography (MEG). We used five different visual stimuli, face with opened eyes, face with closed eyes, eyes, scrambled face, and hand. 1M was evoked in response to all kinds of stimuli but 2M peaking at approximately 180 ms was recorded only for face and eyes. The peak latencies of 1M and 2M and the interpeak latency 1M-2M to eyes were significantly longer than those to face, and there was no significant difference of latency between face with opened eyes and face with closed eyes. The 2M both for face and eyes was generated in the same area, the inferior temporal cortex, around the fusiform gyrus.
