A 13-year-old boy with cervical kyphosis was diagnosed as having juvenile Alexander disease because of the typical MRI findings, abnormally elevated alphaB-crystallin and heat shock protein 27 in the cerebrospinal fluid. Positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose demonstrated hypometabolism in the frontal white matter corresponding to the areas with leukodystrophy. However, the overlying gray matter preserved normal glucose metabolism.
