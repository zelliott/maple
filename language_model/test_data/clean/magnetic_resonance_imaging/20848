Protein-bound contrast: The unusual observation of a heptanuclear gadolinium-oxo cluster on the surface of the cell-adhesion protein Flo5A establishes the basis for directed incorporation of poly-lanthanide clusters into biomolecules. The observed gadolinium cluster might serve as a paradigm for the design of protein-based MRI contrast agents.
