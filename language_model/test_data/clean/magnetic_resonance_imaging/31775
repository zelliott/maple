Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is an autoimmune disease in which macrophages of reticuloendothelial system, mainly in the spleen, remove platelets coated by autoantibodies from the circulation. By removing the spleen, 60-80% of patients can be cured. Partial remission is achieved in 10-20% cases. This case is a typical example of partial remission of idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) when a patient developed a splenunculus years after removal of the spleen. MRI is the investigation of choice for the detection of a splenunculus.
