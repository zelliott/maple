This is a report of the use of endoscopic sinus surgery in the management of three patients diagnosed with rhino-orbital or rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis. A retrospective review was performed of the clinical examinations and imaging studies of three patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery as part of their therapy for mucormycosis. In addition to endoscopic surgery, all patients had aggressive control of underlying risk factors (diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression) and prolonged intravenous amphotericin B therapy. All three patients survived and avoided orbital exenteration. In selected patients with rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis, endoscopic techniques can play a valuable role in diagnosis and management.
