Osseous injuries may be articular, extra-articular, or physeal, and may be related to direct trauma, avulsion forces, or chronic microtrauma. Muscle and tendon injuries about the knee may occur alone or in association with more significant osseous and ligament injuries. Radiographs or computed radiography images remain an important screening technique for patients who have suspected knee injuries. After initial radiographs, MR imaging has become the most common modality for detection and complete evaluation of osseous and soft-tissue injuries about the knee when those radiographs and other techniques do not demonstrate clearly the type and extent of injuries. This article focuses on the usefulness of MR imaging in the detection, classification, and management of bone, muscle, and tendon injuries of the knee.
