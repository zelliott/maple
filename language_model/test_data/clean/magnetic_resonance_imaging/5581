MRI and combined ankle and posterior subtalar MR arthrography in cadavers were used to evaluate the ligaments of the posterior and lateral talar processes. Subsequent anatomic and histologic correlation was performed.

Ten cadaveric ankles were used. Routine radiography and MRI were initially performed. Ankle and posterior subtalar MR arthrography, followed by anatomic and histologic analysis, was then performed to allow better assessment of the ligaments of the lateral and posterior talar process.

In all subjects, MR arthrography provided superior delineation of the articular and periarticular structures, as well as the ligaments. The lateral talocalcaneal and medial talocalcaneal ligaments were best seen in the axial and coronal planes, respectively. The axial plane was best for visualizing the fibulotalocalcaneal ligament, and the sagittal plane was best for evaluating the posterior talocalcaneal ligament. The anterior and posterior talofibular ligaments and the posterior tibiotalar ligament (superficial and deep portions) were best seen in the axial plane. Histologic analysis was correlated to anatomic sectioning and showed the attachment sites of these ligaments.

Combined ankle and posterior subtalar MR arthrography enhances visualization of the ligaments attaching to the posterior and lateral talar processes, including the posterior, lateral, and medial talocalcaneal and fibulotalocalcaneal ligaments.
