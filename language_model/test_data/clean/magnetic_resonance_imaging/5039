Perinatal autopsy provides additional diagnostic information in a significant proportion of cases but parents and relatives frequently decline traditional postmortem (PM) examination, partly due to the unacceptability of the cosmetic effects of large incisions and concerns regarding organ retention. We present a novel minimally invasive autopsy method for fetal and neonatal PMexaminations, which includes PM magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessment of anatomy and endoscopic internal examination to allow direct organ visualization and targeted tissue biopsy.

Descriptive retrospective feasibility report of the first 10 perinatal cases undergoing endoscopic minimally invasive autopsy.

A minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) approach based on postmortem MRI (PM MRI) and endoscopic autopsy with tissue biopsy is feasible and effective with minimal cosmetic consequences compared to traditional PM examination. Endoscopic examination with tissue biopsy provided additional diagnostic information to PM MRI alone in the majority of cases.

Endoscopic MIA is a feasible and potentially more acceptable approach to perinatal autopsy and provides an additional option for parents who do not agree to a traditional PM examination. This approach could result in increased utilization of investigations after death in this group of patients.
