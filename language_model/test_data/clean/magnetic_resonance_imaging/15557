Recent technical progress of MRI and CT made it possible to widen the field of exploration of the noninvasive vascular imaging in the study of supra-aortic, encephalic and medullary vessels. MRI of the carotid plaques, CT angiography in the detection of the intracranial aneurysms, intracranial time-resolved MRA and MRA of the spinal cord took their place in the field of the noninvasive vascular imaging.
