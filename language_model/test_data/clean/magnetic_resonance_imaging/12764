Cardiac transplantation is a life-saving procedure in infants and children with advanced cardiomyopathy. However, it is greatly limited by shortage of paediatric donors and the complications of long-term immunosuppression, including post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). We report the management of an infant who had heterotopic cardiac transplantation for advanced cardiomyopathy with secondary pulmonary hypertension who developed seemingly incurable PTLD.

An 8-month-old girl presented in 1994 with signs of severe heart failure, secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy. At age 11 months, the patient underwent a heterotopic cardiac transplantation.

The patient developed many episodes of PTLD associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection that were resistant to several therapies, including reduction of immunosuppression. Native heart recovery enabled removal of the donor heart 10.5 years after the original operation to allow complete cessation of immunosuppression. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated and the outcome was excellent. 3.5 years after surgery, the patient remains well, in complete remission from her PTLD, and has normal cardiac function.

This case shows several issues relating to the use of heterotopic cardiac transplantation in infants and the capacity of the heart to recover. It also provides new insights into the interaction between the immune system with several aspects of modern management of post-transplantation PTLD.
