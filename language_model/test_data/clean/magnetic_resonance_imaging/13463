To detect abnormal regional myocardial coronary flow reserve, serial spin-echo MR tomograms of four control dogs and six with a partial balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery were acquired before and after dipyridamole infusion and during the paramagnetic effect of a bolus plus infusion of gadolinium-DTPA. Microsphere myocardial blood flow was measured for correlation with serial regional changes in MR signal intensity. Significant difference in gadolinium-enhanced MR signal intensity existed between the hypoperfused LAD and the hyperemic left circumflex perfusion beds (46 +/- 22% vs 78 +/- 29% above baseline, respectively; P less than 0.05). The percentage changes in gadolinium-enhanced MR signal and microsphere myocardial blood flow were significantly correlated (r2 = 0.93).
