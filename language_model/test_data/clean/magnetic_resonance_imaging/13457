The literature on biological effects of weak electromagnetic fields of a frequency of 200 MHz or less is surveyed. The topic has been extraordinarily controversial, in part because of disputed assertions about a role for electromagnetic fields in carcinogenesis or production of abnormalities in growth and development. There is fairly widespread acceptance of certain beneficial effects, particularly the stimulation of healing. An increasing number of reports point to interactions between static magnetic fields and time-varying fields in the production of some effects. Safety implications are noted along with the hypothetical possibility of production of experimental artifacts by electromagnetic fields in MRS research.
