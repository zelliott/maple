Soft tissue perineurioma is an uncommon benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor, although it is the most common subtype of perineuriomas. We present a case of soft tissue perineurioma in the left groin of a 48-year-old man. Precontrast computed tomography showed a homogeneous hypodense mass that showed faint enhancement. The mass appeared with hypointensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and heterogeneous hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR images. Slight contrast uptake was noted on enhanced T1-weighted MR images with fat suppression. Although these CT and MR imaging findings were nonspecific, the overall imaging features are similar to those of schwannomas.
