We describe a 44-year-old woman who was diagnosed in childhood with vitamin D-resistant rickets, and who had paraparesis due to multiple spinal canal stenoses between C5 and L1 with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and the yellow ligament. She was treated surgically with laminoplasty of the C2 through C7 levels and laminectomy from T8 through T11. Four months later, she underwent anterior fusion using an ilium graft by thoracotomy from the T12 to L1 levels. Six months after surgery, her symptoms improved. After 5 years, and with oral vitamin D, no progression of symptoms has been observed.
