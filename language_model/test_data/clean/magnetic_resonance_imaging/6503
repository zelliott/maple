The aim of this study is to report the typical radiographic and MR imaging features of calcific myonecrosis, which help to distinguish this rare entity from other causes of a calcifying calf mass. Ten patients with a final diagnosis of calcific myonecrosis were referred to a specialist orthopaedic oncology service in a 5-year period with the presumptive diagnosis of malignancy based on recent clinical presentation and imaging findings. Radiographs were available for retrospective review in all ten cases and MR imaging in six. All patients presented with a slow-growing painless calf mass. All gave a history of major trauma to the lower leg many years before, but in only two cases did the referring clinician query whether trauma might be a contributory factor. Radiographs showed well-defined fusiform mineralised masses up to 25 cm in length arising within the calf. The calcification was consistently peripheral and plaque-like. Ossification was not present. MR imaging showed the anterior compartment to be involved in four cases and all compartments in two. T1- and T2-weighted images showed peripheral low signal intensity, more prominent on the T2-weighted images, because of the peripheral mineralization. The contents of the masses were variable on T1-weighted images depending on the differing amounts of blood breakdown products and were heterogeneous on T2-weighted images. The latter may be explained by a combination of the mineralisation and T2 shortening due to blood breakdown products. A gadolinium chelate, administered in two cases, failed to show any appreciable enhancement. Calcific myonecrosis has characteristic clinical, radiographic and MR features that should make the condition easy to recognise. Despite its rarity, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of focal mineralisation of the calf.
