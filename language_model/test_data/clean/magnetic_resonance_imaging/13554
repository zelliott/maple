To describe diplopia as the initial manifestation of the Burkitt lymphoma.

Observational case report.

Retrospective chart review.

A 53-year-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive man presented with a severe headache associated with binocular diplopia. Flow cytometric analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a monoclonal B-lymphoid cell population consistent with the Burkitt lymphoma.

Ophthalmologists should be aware that diplopia may be the presenting manifestation of Burkitt lymphoma in an immunocompromised patient.
