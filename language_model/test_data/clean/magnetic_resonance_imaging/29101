A patient presented with right shoulder pain. Imaging studies revealed an apparently solitary soft tissue pleural lesion, accompanied by a very small pleural effusion. On medical thoracoscopy, a diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma was found. Thoracoscopy proved to play an essential part in the diagnostic work-up, avoiding a futile thoracotomy for a presumed solitary soft tissue tumour.
