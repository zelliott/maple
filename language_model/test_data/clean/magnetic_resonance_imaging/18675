Deformable models, originally proposed by Terzopoulos et al. (Artif. Intell. 36 (1988) 91) and Kass et al. (Int. J. Comput. Vision 1 (1988) 321) in 1988, have been widely used in medical image segmentation. However, they manifest two well-known limitations: the lack of an appropriate long-range force to drive the model surface towards the object boundary and poor performance at high curvature boundaries (such as corners) due to the models' intrinsic smoothness constraint. In this paper, a new smoothness force with local control is proposed. The local control is used to devise a long-range force, referred to as the self-zoom force, and a corner fitting force. The self-zoom force enables the model surface to expand and shrink without a limit in range. The corner fitting force propels the model surface to fit high-curvature boundaries. Experiments demonstrate that the model surface is driven to the object boundary by the new forces even if the initial estimate is not close and the object is nonconvex or has a high local curvature.
