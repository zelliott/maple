An elderly Japanese woman presented to our hospital with a 5-month history of a growing mass on her right cheek. She did not complain of local pain, headache, hearing difficulty, or tinnitus. CT and MRI showed a dense calcified mass and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET demonstrated intense accumulation in the mass. Resection of the mass was performed and it was histologically diagnosed as idiopathic tumoral calcinosis.
