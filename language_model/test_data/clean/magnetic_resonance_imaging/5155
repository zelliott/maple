Cardiac haemangioma is an extremely rare, benign vascular tumour. A 42-year-old female patient who was previously very active presented with complaints of exertional chest pain as well as lower extremity oedema. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a large mass in the anterior mediastinum originating from the right atrioventricular groove and abutting the superior vena cava, right atrium, right ventricular outflow tract and aortic root. Open biopsy via right mini-thoracotomy revealed cavernous haemangioma. After the biopsy, the patient was treated with three doses of bevacizumab but symptoms worsened and the mass did not regress. Therefore, the patient underwent median sternotomy and resection of the large tumour that encroached upon the right coronary artery. Final histopathological examination revealed cavernous haemangioma. The patient made an uneventful recovery.
