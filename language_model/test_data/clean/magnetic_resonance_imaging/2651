A 46-year-old man was referred to us for treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; diffuse large immunoblastic B cell type), which had initially developed in the breast. He was treated with five courses of chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisolone) and achieved a complete response. One year later, he noticed a gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed multiple nodules. A few abnormal cells were found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). He was treated with high-dose etoposide (1,350 mg/ m2/course). After two courses, both the multiple nodular lesions in the brain and the abnormal cells in the CSF were resolved. High-dose etoposide is effective for CNS involvement by NHL.
