Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a heart syndrome associated with transient contractile dysfunction. It is also referred to as "broken heart syndrome" or "transient left ventricular apical ballooning." Leading symptom is a sudden onset of chest pain, often accompanied by dyspnoea. Clinical features include new electrocardiographic changes (ST-Segment elevations, T wave inversions), moderate elevation of the cardiac enzymes and transient wall motion abnormalities in absence of significant coronary artery obstruction. Although causal treatment has not been established, TTC has a favourable prognosis with a low mortality and a complete recovery of the contractile function in nearly all cases. Although several mechanisms have been proposed, the pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. However, emotional and physical stress followed by excessive release of catecholamines might play a pivotal role in the development of TTC.
