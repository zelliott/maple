A 38-year-old male presented with a cystic lesion at the foramen magnum due to intracranial dissemination from a pituitary adenoma. The primary tumor had required reoperation for regrowth twice. The tumor at the foramen magnum was removed surgically. Two smaller solid tumors were located in the left parietal convexity and the right temporal lobe. The former tumor was also removed surgically and the latter was observed. Histological examination showed the typical characteristics of pituitary adenoma in both surgical specimens. Immunohistochemical staining with MIB-1 and p53 antibodies showed low (< 1%) and negative reaction. Patients with pituitary adenoma, even benign tumors, must be carefully followed up for signs of metastasis.
