Retrospective analysis of 155 liver angiographies and the literature data was carried out to appraise the current relevance of liver angiography in digital subtraction technique (i.a. DSA) for diagnosis of focal liver changes. A focal liver lesion was detected by angiography in 58 out of the 80 patients (72.5%) we investigated with a confirmed hepatic space occupation; an angiography correlate of the tumour type diagnosed was shown in 41 out of 69 (59.4%) of malignancies confirmed by surgery or biopsy histology; in the benign lesions, the angiographic diagnosis was consistent with the histological result in five out of six cases. DSA is thus usually clearly inferior to the tomographic sonography, CT and MRI in detection and qualification of the tumour type. However, it is still indispensable for planning operations or chemoembolization and for exact imaging of the portal perfusion conditions because of the frequent vascular anomalies in the anatomy of the liver.
