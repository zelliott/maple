NMR-tomography data and clinical topographic parallels were followed up in 27 multiple sclerosis patients on treatment. Primary NMR tomography identified disseminated foci of more intensive signal in the brain and spinal cord of 78% of the patients. In 6 patients the diagnosis was not confirmed, in 21 patients there was tomographic evidence of various disorders: foci of hyperintensity associated with ventricular system enlargement, cerebral atrophy, hyperintensity zones. The number of more intensive signal foci correlated with the disease severity. Hemispheric foci of hyperintensity were clinically most important. Most of the foci were localized in periventricular region. Changes in the above parameters were observed only 1-2 years after the treatment. It is inferred that NMR tomography is both diagnostic and follow-up tool in multiple sclerosis.
