Magnetic resonance images were performed using a gradient recalled echo sequence with acquisition of images every 30 s in anesthetized rats before and after intravenous bolus injections of 100 microns/kg GdDTPA, 60 microns/kg albumin-(GdDTPA), and 60 microns/kg Gd2O3 colloid. All three agents caused significant enhancement of the renal cortex, and even greater enhancement of the spleen. GdDTPA showed an early peak at 11 s followed by a wash-out as blood concentrations fell, whereas albumin-(GdDTPA) and Gd2O3 showed sustained tissue enhancement. The enhancement in each organ was equivalent for albumin-(GdDTPA) and Gd2O3 which stay intravascular; but 30% less for GdDTPA which enters the interstitial space. In addition GdDTPA showed an initial enhancement of the renal medulla but then a subsequent loss of signal, whereas albumin-(GdDTPA) resulted in a greater enhancement of the medulla as compared to the cortex. We conclude that time-intensity studies of local tissue response to MR indicators reflect tissue physiological parameters such as perfusion, blood volume, and concentrating ability in a semiquantitative manner.
