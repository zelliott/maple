Although conventional MR imaging allows direct visualization of major anatomic structures, smaller intraarticular structures, including the glenoid labrum, glenohumeral ligaments, and articular surface of the rotator cuff tendon can be difficult to evaluate in the absence of a joint effusion. The authors review the techniques employed in performing MR arthrography, imaging characteristics of MR arthrography, and diagnostic utilization of the technique. Suggested indications are provided.
