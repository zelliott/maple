The aim of the study was to investigate if the stretch reflex of the soleus muscle was useful in quantifying upper motor neuron lesions. The soleus stretch reflex was recorded in 10 healthy subjects and 20 patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and correlated to the number of MRI lesions in cerebrum and clinical scores (expanded disability status scale and regional functional scoring system). The short latency stretch reflex was elicited by rotating the left ankle joint 4 degrees with a rise time in the interval of 40-640 ms. The amplitude of the stretch was larger in multiple sclerosis patients being 88.5 microV in patients and 12.8 microV in controls, P = 0.007. The sensitivity of the stretch reflex expressed as the slope of the best linear fit was increased in MS patients to 2.6 microVs/degree compared with 0.6 microVs/degree (0.1-2.2) in controls, P = 0.009. There was no correlation between amplitude of the stretch reflex and number of MRI lesions (r = -0.03). In conclusion, the soleus stretch reflex might be useful to quantify spasticity but is not useful in detecting dysfunction of upper motor neurons in MS.
