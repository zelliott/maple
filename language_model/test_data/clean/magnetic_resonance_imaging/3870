Stemocleidomastoid tumor of infancy (SCMTI) is a rare cause of benign neck masses in neonates and infants. It has to be differentiated from other congenital space-occupying lesions in the cervical region.

The files of 13 infants with a mean age of 6 weeks, presenting with a lateral neck mass at Sahloul University Hospital in Sousse (Tunisia) between 2007 and 2009 were retrospectively studied. All of them underwent physical and ultrasonographic examination. MRI was performed in only one case.

Ultrasonography (US) showed a soft tissue mass of sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCMM), or a homogenously enlarged muscle without any focal mass. MRI revealed a fusiform enlarged muscle. Diagnosis of SCMTI was established in all cases. Conservative treatment was recommended in all cases with physiotherapy in 2 cases.

US is the best imaging modality for the diagnosis of SCMTI and the first one to be performed. Additional diagnostic imaging modalities are unnecessary in most of the cases.
