Gangliogliomas of the optic nerve are extremely rare. The case is reported of a 38-year-old man who presented with a visual field deficit and was discovered to have an optic nerve ganglioglioma. The possible embryological origins of this neoplasm, its histological and immunohistochemical features, and its appearance on magnetic resonance imaging are examined. The prognoses of optic nerve glioma and of gangliogliomas occurring elsewhere in the nervous system are compared.
