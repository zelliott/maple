We present a case of a neuroendocrine tumor of the urinary bladder. A 81-year-old-man presented with macrohematuria and difficult voiding. Cystoscopy, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed non-papillary broad-based bladder tumor, benign prostatic hyperplasia and three bladder stones. Histological diagnosis was neuroendocrine tumor of the urinary bladder and he underwent two courses of trans-arterial infusion (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. After two courses of chemotherapy, pelvic CT scan revealed partial response and then the patient underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, simultaneously with TUR-P and cystolithotripsy. Examination of the resected specimen indicated pathological complete remission and he discharged. Although the patient was followed-up postoperatively because of pathological complete response, the tumor recurred in the bladder three months later.
