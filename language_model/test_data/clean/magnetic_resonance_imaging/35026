The purpose of our study was to describe the characteristic MRI appearance of cerebral infection with Schistosoma japonicum.

Cerebral infection with S. japonicum can cause a characteristic MRI pattern of a large mass comprising multiple intensely enhancing nodules, sometimes with areas of linear enhancement. The typical appearance may be useful for diagnosis in endemic regions and may potentially be useful in cases imported into countries in which the disease is not endemic.
