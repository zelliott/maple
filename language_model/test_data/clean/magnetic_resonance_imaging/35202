A 20-year-old woman with progressive leukoencephalopathy developed mental and motor disabilities and fell into a coma after suffering head trauma and febrile episodes from infancy. Brain imaging showed massive abnormal signals in the white matter. The electron spectroscopic imaging of biopsied brain tissue confirmed the electron-dense deposits to be associated with aluminum accumulation in the myelin sheath. Her brain pathology, which showed ferritin- and naphtochrome green-positive deposits, supported the imaging analysis. The clinicopathological features indicate a new form of progressive leukoencephalopathy.
