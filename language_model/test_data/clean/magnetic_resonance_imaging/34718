We describe the MR findings in a case of chondroma arising from the falx. At MR imaging, the mass appeared well defined, lobulated, hypointense to isointense on T1-weighted images, and very heterogeneous with marked hyperintense areas on T2-weighted images. After contrast administration, this tumor enhanced slightly on delayed images.
