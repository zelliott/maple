The development of new non-ionic magnetic resonance (MR) contrast media as gadodiamide injection increased the choice of paramagnetic contrast agents available in MR of the central nervous system (CNS). The purpose of our paper was to compare at the dose of 0.1 mmol/kg b.w. the safety of gadodiamide (Gd-DTPA-BMA) to gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) and to gadoterate meglumine (Gd-DOTA) in two multicentric double-blind studies. A total of 551 patients were enrolled with 143 patients in the Gd-DTPA group, 132 patients in the Gd-DOTA group and 276 patients in the Gd-DTPA-BMA group. Safety was assessed by recording the adverse events up to 24 hours after the injection. One or more adverse events were recorded in 14% of the Gd-DTPA patients, in 15.1% of the Gd-DOTA patients and in 11.6% of the Gd-DTPA-BMA patients. These reactions were related to the contrast media in 9.1%, 13.6% and 8.7% of the cases respectively. Their intensity was defined as mild in 8.4% of the patients in the Gd-DTPA group, in 13.6% of the patients in the Gd-DOTA group and in 8.3% of the patients in the Gd-DTPA-BMA group. No severe reaction or death were recorded. An injection-site reaction (heat, coldness, pain) has been observed in 43% of the cases although an adverse event other than local reactions (headache, dizziness, nausea) has been noticed in 57% of the cases. No significant statistical difference was observed between the groups. Gadodiamide is a safe and effective contrast agent in MRI of the CNS in comparison with Gd-DTPA and Gd-DOTA currently in routine use.
