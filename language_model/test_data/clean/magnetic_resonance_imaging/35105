Epilepsy associated with multiple lesions requires a detailed preoperative evaluation. We report on a patient with 9 cavernous malformations associated with medically intractable seizures who became seizure free after a selective resection of two adjacent cavernous resection. The importance of a detailed neuroradiological and electroencephalographic analysis is stressed.

The patient was a right-handed 56-year-old woman with a 26-year history of complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures. A non-invasive video EEG monitoring revealed the epileptogenic zone was temporal anterior on the left. A detailed MRI-analysis showed an intact hippocampal formation. An extended lesionectomy of 2 adjacent cavernomas was done. The patient has been free of seizures for 24 months after surgery.

Medically intractable seizures associated with multiple cavernous malformations can be diagnosed by non-invasive preoperative monitoring and controlled by single resective procedures.
