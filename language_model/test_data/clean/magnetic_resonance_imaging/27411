Malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are rare, poorly defined spindle cell sarcomas, and they are accompanied by heterologous elements in some cases. Among them, a fibroblastic element is one of the rarest and has been mentioned in some organs in several publications, but not in the orbit. The authors report a case of fibroblastic low-grade MPNSTs in the orbit. The mass was removed surgically, and the patient has been under close observation without evidence of disease recurrence for 2 years.
