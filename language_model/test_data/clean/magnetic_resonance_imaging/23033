Image fusion software creates composite images from computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images.

CT-MR fusion studies between August 2004 to July 2005 were reviewed. CT scan images (1-mm axial) were obtained on a multi-detector CT scanner. MR images (1-mm axial) were obtained with a T1-weighted, volume acquisition technique. CT-MR fusion images were created on the Instatrak 3500 Plus or CBYON Suite.

A total of 25 patients had 27 CT-MR image fusion studies. CT-MR fusion accuracy was 2 mm or better. During preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation, CT-MR fusion facilitated the delineation of the anatomic relationships between the lesion and the skull base.

CT-MR image fusion yields composite images that combine features of each component imaging modality. Image fusion, when combined with surgical navigation, further enhances potential skull base applications for minimally invasive endoscopic surgery.
