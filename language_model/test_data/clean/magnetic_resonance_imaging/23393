Extracranial metastasis of a malignant glioma is rare, possibly due to the lack of lymphatic drainage in the brain and because these tumors are unable to penetrate blood vessels. Extracranial metastasis of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma (ODG) is exceptionally rare. We present a 55-year-old male patient with diffuse extracranial metastases from a temporal anaplastic ODG, 11 months after cranial surgery. Anaplastic ODG, may spread to the other parts of the body. If patients with these tumors have neck or back pain, spinal metastasis should be included in the differential diagnosis and further investigated.
