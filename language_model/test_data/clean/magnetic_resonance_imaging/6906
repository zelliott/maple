Although advances in immunosuppressive therapy have led to increased survival of renal transplant recipients, there are greater risks of developing infectious complications. Because of its rarity and the lack of medical awareness, aspergillus spondylitis is often misdiagnosed as tuberculous spondylitis, especially in its early stages. We report a case of aspergillus spondylitis in a renal transplant followed by cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.

A 59-year-old woman was admitted due to general weakness and abdominal discomfort. She had undergone renal transplantation 3 years previously. One month before admission, she was diagnosed with CMV retinitis and treated with IV ganciclovir. On admission, she suffered from lower abdominal pain. Colonoscopy revealed multiple circular or patchy ulcers with surrounding severe mucosal edema in the sigmoid colon findings consistent with intestinal tuberculosis. On hospital day 30, she complained of lower extremity paresthesia and weakness. An MRI of the spine revealed a well-demarcated paraspinal mass around the L2-4 body; tuberculous spondylitis was initially considered. But despite antituberculosis medication, the patient progressed to spastic paraparesis and sensory changes in both lower legs, requiring urgent surgical decompression. At hospital day 60, she suffered persistent fever and developed thrombocytopenia. Wound discharge continued and paraparesis became denser. A CT of the spine showed progression of the paraspinal abscess from the L2 body to the iliac crest. CT-guided psoas muscle drainage was performed. Fungal culture showed Aspergillus species. Despite antifungal therapy, the patient died after a prolonged hospital stay due to fungal sepsis and septic shock from aspergillosis.
