Four macromolecular contrast agents are synthesized to visualize small vessels by MRI using generation-3 (G3D), -4 (G4D), -5 (G5D), and -6 (G6D) polyamidoamine dendrimers conjugated to chelated gadolinium (Gd). The pharmacokinetics, enhancement patterns, and the ability of these constructs to visualize fine vessels is evaluated by dynamic MRI in relationship to their size. Gd-G6D and -G5D exhibit a prolonged high vascular (ventricular) signal intensity (SI) with high ventricle-to-organ SI ratios. The initial high vascular SI with Gd-G4D decreases to a value as low as that obtained with Gd-G3D and Gd-dimeglumine-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). Gd-G5D, -G4D, and -G3D show high renal SIs, and Gd-DTPA prominently enhances the skin. Gd-G6D and -G5D present fine vasculature significantly more clearly than Gd-G3D and -DTPA (P < 0.005). As the molecular size increases, the excretion of the 153Gd-conjugates is retarded. In conclusion, Gd-G6D and -G5D are retained in the blood and present fine vessels with high quality and detail, and should be adequate for visualizing small tumor vasculature.
