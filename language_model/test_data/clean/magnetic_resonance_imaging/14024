We present a case of retrocaval ureter and its MR appearances. This is the first case in reported literature. The findings on i.v. urography are correlated with the MRI findings. So far CT has been the procedure of choice to confirm the diagnosis of retrocaval ureter. However, we believe MRI is likely to replace CT in the diagnosis of retrocaval ureter.
