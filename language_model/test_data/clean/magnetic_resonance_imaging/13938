To assess the reduction in size of fibroids following uterine artery embolisation and to analyse women's views of the success of treatment.

An uncontrolled case series of 114 consecutive women who underwent uterine artery embolisation for the treatment of fibroids over two years.

The Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology Department at The Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, UK.

Bilateral uterine artery embolisation was performed for the treatment of symptomatic fibroids. Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out before and six months following embolisation. Women completed outcome questionnaires following their treatment.

The sites. imaging signal characteristics and percentage reduction in the volume of three dominant fibroids were determined from the magnetic resonance scans. Outcome was measured by questionnaire. Women were asked whether their symptoms resolved completely, improved, remained unchanged or deteriorated.

One hundred and sixty-five fibroids of 114 women (mean age 42) were analysed. Forty-five percent of women had complex fibroid masses and 50% had fibroids > or =8.5cm in diameter. The median reduction in the fibroid volume was 58%. The median reduction of the volume of complex fibroid masses, submucous fibroids, fibroids > or =8.5cm and fibroids with high and low signal on T2 weighted sequences were 58%, 63%, 50%, 62% and 51%, respectively. Ninety-one percent of the women's symptoms had resolved or improved following embolisation.

The majority of women were satisfied with their outcome. We have shown that uterine artery embolisation is a successful treatment for symptomatic fibroids of all types, sizes and signal characteristics.
