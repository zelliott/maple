The usefulness of 1.5-T high-field intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging during transsphenoidal surgery for functioning pituitary adenomas was retrospectively evaluated based on long-term endocrine remission from the records of 14 patients who underwent transsphenoidal surgery with iMR imaging for functioning pituitary microadenomas and small adenomas located in the intrasellar region. The maximum tumor diameter was 9.3 ± 2.6 mm. Patients were diagnosed with acromegaly (n = 7), prolactinoma (n = 4), and Cushing's disease (n = 3). If iMR imaging detected tumor remnants after resection, the resection cavity was reexamined and further resection was performed. Postoperative endocrine follow-up period was mean 33.7 ± 13.3 months. Tumor remnants were detected after the first resection in seven patients. Further resection was performed in five of these patients, and three achieved long-term endocrine remission. As a result, the overall long-term endocrine remission rate was 78.5% (11/14), instead of the 57.1% (8/14) that would be expected if iMR imaging had not been performed. Long-term endocrine remission had a tendency to be associated with the absence of tumor remnants on the final iMR images, but this was not significant (p = 0.09). Long-term endocrine remission was associated with presence of tumor remnants in the cavernous sinus on the final iMR images (p = 0.03). High-field iMR imaging is useful for depicting tumor remnants after resection, and increased the long-term endocrine remission rate for patients with functioning pituitary microadenomas and small adenomas.
