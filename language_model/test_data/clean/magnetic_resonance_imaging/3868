Contemporary imaging techniques for renal mass evaluation are essential to clinical management and surgical planning. Ultrasonography can be used to distinguish cystic from solid lesions but is less sensitive and accurate in renal mass characterization than computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multiphase CT imaging before and after administration of contrast is the primary imaging modality for characterization and staging of renal lesions. MRI is increasingly used as a problem solving tool. Advanced MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging are being explored in assessment of renal lesions. These techniques are discussed in this article.
