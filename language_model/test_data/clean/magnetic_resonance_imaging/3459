Giant cell tumors of bone in the hand are rare. We present a case of a recurrent giant cell tumor in the metacarpal 42 years after intralesional excision and autogenous bone grafting. The possibility of recurrent disease should be considered in the evaluation of any patient presenting with new onset of pain at the site of a previously addressed giant cell tumor. Management of these recurrent lesions should include wide excision with digit salvaging procedures or ray amputation owing to the high rates of treatment failures seen with marginal excision.
