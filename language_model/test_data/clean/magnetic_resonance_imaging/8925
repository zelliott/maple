We report a case of schizencephaly diagnosed prenatally at 23 weeks of gestational age with two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) sonography and fetal brain MRI, confirmed by autopsy. The diagnostic method of choice is 2D transabdominal and transvaginal sonography, whereas additional 3D sonography and MRI may provide a better understanding of the pathology and related findings.
