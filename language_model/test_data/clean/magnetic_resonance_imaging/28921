Non-surgical reduction of septal myocardial mass was performed with success in a 48-year-old male with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Angioplasty balloon inflated in the first septal branch of the left anterior descending artery dramatically reduced the pressure gradient across the outflow tract of the left ventricle. Following injections of absolute alcohol into the artery with the balloon kept inflated induced a small septal myocardial infarction. By hemodynamic evaluation, the peak pressure gradient of 108 mmHg before the procedure was decreased to 30 mmHg. Clinical improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class was obtained. At 3-month follow-up, the patient was doing quite well; the gradient was only 10 mmHg at rest and 25 mmHg with Valsalva maneuver.
