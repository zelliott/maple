Epithelioid leiomyosarcoma in the external deep soft tissue is extremely rare. Most epithelioid leiomyosarcomas occur in the uterus. We present a case of epithelioid leiomyosarcoma occurring in the muscle of the thigh of a 78-year-old man. Histologically, the tumor predominantly consisted of round or polygonal cells arranged in sheets with a focal spindle cell component. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor cells expressed vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and alpha-sarcomeric actin. The tumor was negative for desmin, S100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, pan-keratin, epithelial membrane antigen, CAM 5.2, HMB-45, leukocyte common antigen, factor VIII-associated antigen, and CD34. Electron microscopically, some tumor cells contained abundant actin-type filaments in their cytoplasm.
