Brain metastasis from ovarian cancer, a rare and highly dismal event, develops mostly during or after postoperative chemotherapy. This report documents the clinical findings and magnetic resonance imaging of an uncommon case who presented signs of increased intracranial pressure as a first manifestation. Histologic examination of removed brain lesion demonstrated ovarian origin, while no evidence of a locally invasive lesion was found at exploratory laparotomy ('tentative' surgical stage Ia). The possibility of ovarian origin should be always considered in a woman with brain involvement.
