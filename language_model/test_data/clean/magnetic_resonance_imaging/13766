A 44-year-old white male with an isolated central nervous system relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was treated with intrathecal cytarabine. He developed Staphylococcus epidermidis meningitis, which was treated successfully with intrathecal vancomycin. Four weeks after the initiation of intrathecal cytarabine, the patient developed progressive ascending paralysis to the upper cervical level. Initial magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine were normal, and cerebrospinal fluid evaluation showed no evidence of ongoing infection and clearance of lymphoblasts. Three weeks later, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated marked edema and peripheral enhancement of the spinal cord, consistent with cytarabine toxicity.
