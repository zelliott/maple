Myocardial tuberculosis is an infrequent disease. Until now, the diagnosis has largely been made at necropsy. Only a few reports describe the antemortem diagnosis of myocardial tuberculosis. We describe the MRI features in a 12-year-old boy with myocardial tuberculoma of the right atrium. He also had intracerebral tuberculoma. The diagnosis was later confirmed by biopsy.
