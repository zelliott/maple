To evaluate the value of dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) for classification of endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).

Twenty-eight patients, between 2 days and 54 months after EVAR, were evaluated with CTA, MRI and dynamic CE-MRA. The additional diagnostic value of the dynamic 3D CE-MRA was evaluated by determining the ability of the dynamic series in pinpointing the site of inflow of an endoleak.

An endoleak was detected in 23 patients. Seventeen of the 23 dynamic series were technically successful (no disturbing artifacts limiting the diagnostic value). Using MRI our findings were: 2 type I, 6 type II, 1 type III, no type IV endoleaks and in 14 cases classification could not be made. The classification results for MRI plus the dynamic CE-MRA were: 2 type I, 12 type II, 1 type III, no type IV endoleaks and in eight cases classification could not be made. In six cases the dynamic MRA allowed classification of the endoleak, which was not possible with the non-dynamic images alone (p=0.091, Fisher exact).

This pilot study shows that dynamic CE-MRA can have additional value in the classification of endoleaks. Dynamic CE-MRA might obviate the need for diagnostic digital subtraction angiography and aid planning for intervention.
