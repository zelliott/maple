Peritoneal tuberculosis can mimic advanced stage ovarian cancer and can lead to the performance of an unnecessary extended surgery. Clinical discrimination between peritoneal tuberculosis and ovarian carcinoma may sometimes be extremely difficult. We report 2 cases of peritoneal tuberculosis mimicking ovarian carcinoma. Diagnosis was made on perioneal biopsy.
