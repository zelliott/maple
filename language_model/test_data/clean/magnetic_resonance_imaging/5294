Understanding of brain structural anomalies seen in children with autism has considerably progressed since the apparition of MRI and functional imaging. All the results are converging toward the description of anatomical and functional anomalies in the regions of the so-called "social brain". Statistical analyses show diminution of gray matter in the region of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Functional studies with PET shows a diminution of brain blood flow at rest in the same region. Brain activation studies show absence of activation of the specialized region in processing human voice and hypoactivation of "social brain" regions in complex tasks of social cognition. At last, abnormal connectivity between the frontal and temporal regions has been showed. Those regions are implicated in processing sensorial inputs necessary for normal social life. All those anomalies could be responsible of the abnormal social behaviour pattern of children with autism.
