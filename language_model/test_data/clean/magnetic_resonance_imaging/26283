Analyzing meniscal abnormalities on MR images depends on a thorough understanding of the normal appearance of meniscal structures and on strict adherence to the MR imaging criteria for meniscal tears. When proper MR imaging technique is followed, meniscal tears can be diagnosed more acutely than with clinical examination alone, even in the presence of associated ligament injuries. The value of MR imaging lies in its ability to reveal details of meniscal tears, including location, morphology, length, depth, and possible stability. If this MR imaging information can be synthesized, it will dramatically affect treatment planning by helping to predict meniscal tears that are potentially reparable and tears that might not need surgical intervention.
