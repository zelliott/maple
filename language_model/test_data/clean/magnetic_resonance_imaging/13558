A case with primary amyloidosis of the liver and spleen is presented. In the liver, ultrasonography showed heterogeneous echogenicity. Portal phase CT showed heterogeneous enhancement, and delayed phase CT showed delayed enhancement with focal hypoattenuating areas. Bone scintigraphy showed diffuse accumulation. In the spleen, arterial phase CT showed the lack of parenchymal enhancement, and T2-weighted MR imaging showed decreased signal intensity. The combination of imaging findings of the liver and spleen was suggestive of amyloidosis.
