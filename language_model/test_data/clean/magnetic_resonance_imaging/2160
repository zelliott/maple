At the time of oviposition, the embryo in the fertilized chicken egg has developed the germinal disc on top of the yolk and contains thousands of blastodermal cells. The germinal disc escapes exact localization because it is surrounded by albumen and shell membranes under a calcified shell. This study investigated whether or not ultrasonography or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are suited to localize the germinal disc and, if so, to estimate the accuracy of localization. Hatchability of treated eggs was also recorded. The ultrasound waves were reflected by the shell. The germinal disc could be seen only after removal of the eggshell and the outer shell membrane. In all, 39 intact eggs, MRI localized the germinal disc within 2 mm thick image slices. The mean position of the germinal disc deviated 3.0+/-2.1 mm from the maximum vertical plane of the egg with a mean distance to the inner surface of the shell of 2.7+/-1.1 mm. Incubation resulted in 84.2 and 77.5% hatched chicks for imaged eggs and controls, respectively. The localization results of MRI were verified manually in 38 open shell cultures. Correlation coefficients for the position of the germinal disc were r = 0.86 to 0.99 for the x-axis, r = 0.75 to 0.89 for the y-axis, and r = 0.63 to 0.76 for the z-axis. The study thus shows that MRI is a reliable tool to localize the germinal disc within the intact freshly laid egg.
