Conservative treatment is reported in a child with atlantoaxial rotatory fixation. Three-dimensional (3D) computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated the degree of dislocation and alar ligament damage. A rigid cervical collar and muscle relaxant agents without any traction allowed full recovery. Control 3D CT scanning and MR imaging findings are reported.
