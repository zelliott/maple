The authors treated a patient with a huge, ventrally located spinal meningioma, extending from the foramen magnum to the second thoracic vertebral body. Vertebral body corpectomies were performed between the bottom of the second cervical vertebral body and the top of the first thoracic vertebral body, and the tumor was completely resected. Neurological symptoms and signs improved postoperatively.
