We aimed to investigate the importance of magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnostic process of the upper motor neuron involvement.

Fifteen patients (Group 1) who were diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the neurology department of the Sisli Etfal Hospital and 20 controls (Group 2) entered the study. Magnetic resonance imaging examinations were performed in the radiology clinic of the same hospital. T2 and proton density weighted axial images were obtained. These images were evaluated by two blind radiologists. The radiologists looked for two signs: the presence of a low signal intensity at the precentral cortex and the presence of symmetrical rounded foci of high signal intensity within the internal capsule on both T2 and proton density weighted images.

For the first sign there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups but for the latter one there was a statistically significant difference.

We think that the presence of the latter sign may make it possible for the radiologists to help the clinicians further in this difficult and confusing diagnosis.
