Apraxia is a well-known disorder of praxis and is caused mainly by damage to the left parietal lobe. We presented two cases of neurodegenerative disease with a distinct disorder of praxis, predominantly involving left parietal lobe. While both patients could understand what they should do, they were not able to initiate action and often stopped during execution of actions. They had no apraxia and no temporal and spatial errors on praxis. Magnetic resonance imaging of both patients showed atrophy of the left parieto-occipital and temporo-occipital lobes, and single photon emission computed tomography showed hypoperfusion in the same lobes. Moreover, one of our cases, using [11C] PIB PET, demonstrated increased uptake in the cerebral cortices, suggesting Alzheimer's disease. The symptoms described are different from other disorders of praxis and similar to bradyphrenia or freezing.
