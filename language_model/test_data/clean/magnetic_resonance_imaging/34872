Multimodality visualization aims at efficiently presenting integrated information obtained from different modalities, usually combining a functional modality (SPECT, PET, functional magnetic resonance imaging) with an anatomical modality [CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]. This paper presents a technique for three-dimensional integrated visualization of SPECT and magnetic resonance brain images, where MRI is used as a framework of reference for the display of the SPECT data.

A novel technique for three-dimensional integrated visualization of functional and anatomical information, called normal fusion, is presented. With this technique, local functional information is projected onto an anatomic structure.

The normal fusion technique is applied to three cases of SPECT/MRI integration. The results are presented, discussed and evaluated for clinical relevance.

The results for three-dimensional integrated display of SPECT and MR brain images indicate that the normal fusion technique provides a potentially comprehensive and diagnostically valuable presentation of cerebral blood perfusion in relation to the anatomy of the brain.
