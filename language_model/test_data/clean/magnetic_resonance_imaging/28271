We report a series of five patients operated on for hindbrain-related syringomyelia with posterior fossa decompression and duraplasty. In all cases an early postoperative MRI was performed (24-36 h after surgery). These images have been compared with the preoperative ones and with those obtained, 1, 3 and 6 months after operation. Both before and after surgery there was not always a tight correlation between clinical and MRI pictures. In all but one patient the early postoperative MR images showed a reduction of syrinx size and were as to those obtained later. We discuss the results observed in our small series and analyze the role of early postoperative MRI studies in patients with hindbrain-related syringomyelia.
