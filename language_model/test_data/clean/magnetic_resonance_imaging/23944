In this paper we discuss novel MR imaging blood pool agents characterized by new pharmacokinetic properties.

The pharmacokinetics of the products were studied in a rabbit model. The potential of these new products was demonstrated in experimental MR imaging.

Three main classes of blood pool agents have been defined and characterized according to their pharmacokinetic properties: low diffusion agents, rapid clearance blood pool agents, slow clearance blood pool agents. Each kind of blood pool agent is expected to have different diagnostic applications.
