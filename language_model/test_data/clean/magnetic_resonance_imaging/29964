Charcot foot is a serious problem that causes considerable morbidity and may lead to limb loss. Arriving at a definitive diagnosis can be challenging. Given the progressive, destructive nature of Charcot's arthropathy, this delay can result advancing deformity, ulceration, infection, and place the limb at risk for amputation. Although clinical signs and symptoms and historical information are crucial, this article focuses on the imaging modalities that can aid practitioners in arriving at an early diagnosis, and how to differentiate Charcot's arthropathy from osteomyelitis of the feet.
