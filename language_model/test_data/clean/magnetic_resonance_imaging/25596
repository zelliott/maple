A cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) has been regarded as an incidental finding of little clinical importance. However, an association between this developmental anomaly and a diagnosis of psychosis has previously been reported. We determined the prevalence of the CSP in parallel studies of brain scans obtained with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and in the post-mortem brains of schizophrenic patients compared with normal controls. We found a significantly increased prevalence of the CSP in both the MR scans and post-mortem brains of schizophrenic patients compared with controls. In the MR study, 17 of 81 (21%) schizophrenic patients but only 1 of 46 (2%) control subjects had a CSP. In the post-mortem study, 17 of 28 (61%) schizophrenic patients and 12 of 39 (31%) normal controls had a CSP. The increased prevalence of a CSP in schizophrenic patients further indicates that anomalous development of the limbic system is an important aspect of this disorder.
