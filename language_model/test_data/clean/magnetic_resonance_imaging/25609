To assess the capability of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to define the presence, distribution, and severity of the hypertrophic process, MR imaging was performed in 20 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in five healthy volunteers. Among the 20 patients, 13 were classified as having asymmetric septal hypertrophy and seven as having apical hypertrophy. The mean myocardial thickness in the four-chamber view obtained in end diastole in asymmetric septal hypertrophy was 23.5 mm +/- 6.8 (mean +/- standard deviation) in the basal septum; the ratio of septal to posterolateral wall thickness was 2.05 +/- 0.44 (P < .05); those values were 10.4 mm +/- 2.7 and 1.01 +/- 0.19, respectively, in five healthy volunteers. The mean myocardial thickness in apical hypertrophy was 25.3 mm +/- 4.1 in the apex, and the ratio was 2.21 +/- 0.51 (P < .05); these values were 9.6 mm +/- 1.5 and 0.95 +/- 0.17, respectively, in five healthy volunteers. Three different subtypes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - resting obstructive (n = 5), latent obstructive (n = 3), and nonobstructive (n = 5) - were classified according to findings at catheterization in the 13 patients with asymmetric septal hypertrophy.
