Artifact in one form or another needs to be contended with in all EEG and EP studies. Various methods have been employed to avoid, eliminate, or minimize artifact. This article has described the methods that have been available for some time and newer methods and their advantages. It is the authors' hope that through the use of these methods the accuracy of all EP and ERP measurements will be improved and promote the validity and general acceptance of EP and ERP recordings. Genuine and valuable data are contained in EPs and ERPs. The challenge is to extract relatively small voltage signals often occurring within a higher voltage background of artifact. The computing power required to perform the artifact removal/reduction procedures now is available with basic laptop and desktop computers, as are the software programs that provide the artifact removal/reduction capabilities. It may be of interest for a prudent researcher to integrate the currently available artifact rejection methods before subjecting the ERP and EP data for further analysis and subsequent publication.
