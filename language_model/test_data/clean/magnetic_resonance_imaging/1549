We report serial MR findings in a middle-aged woman with a neurenteric cyst involving the cerebellopontine angle cistern with xanthogranulomatous changes. On the initial gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MR images, the solid portion of the lesion had homogeneously strong enhancement. Follow-up MR images obtained 6 months later showed that the mass had increased in size; however, the solid portion decreased in size. The enhancing solid portion corresponded to the xanthogranulomatous changes on pathologic correlation.
