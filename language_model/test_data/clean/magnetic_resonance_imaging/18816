To investigate the accuracy of endorectal surface coil magnetic resonance imaging (ecMRI) in a 1.0-T magnetic field for the local staging of prostate cancer, 25 patients were studied. In 14 Stages T1 and T2 tumors, 11 were correctly identified and 3 were overstaged. In 11 Stage T3 neoplasms, ecMRI was accurate in 7 cases, and the other 4 were understaged. The overall accuracy of ecMRI in 1.0 T was 72% and that was comparable to the reported accuracy of this technique in high-field systems.
