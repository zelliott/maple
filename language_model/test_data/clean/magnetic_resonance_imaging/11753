Epidural hematoma is an uncommon but serious complication of epidural anaesthesia. The use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as thromboprophylaxis has increased the occurrence of this pathology. We report the case of a 81-year-old man who underwent an arthroscopy of the knee, with epidural anaesthesia and administration of LMWH. The patient suffered an important pain due to a lumbar epidural haematoma which was diagnosed by magnetic resonance, after withdrawal of the epidural catheter. He improved after surgical evacuation, and no neurological deficit was present. We comment the association of LMWH, epidural anaesthesia and epidural haematoma.
