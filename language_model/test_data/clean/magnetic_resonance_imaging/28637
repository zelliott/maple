Computer assisted education in radiology has been increasingly used during the past ten years and now complements traditional learning resources. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of musculoskeletal anatomy, and particularly of joints, lends itself naturally to learning modules on computer. This paper describes the design, development and use of an interactive computer assisted teaching module of MR joint anatomy on CD-ROM for Macintosh: to date, we have used this atlas for ankle and elbow anatomy. The atlas is divided into three main sections: MR anatomy, traditional anatomy and a quiz. On each MR image, any anatomical detail can be identified clicking on it with the mouse. Buttons allow to visualize cross-reference points and to go directly on the desired image. If the student wants to look at anatomical drawings of the last identified structure, a button retrieves all the cards in the traditional anatomy section containing that structure. Finally, the student can make his own self-assessment, verifying his learning immediately with the exam mode: the software makes a random selection of 10 MR images where an anatomical structure must be indicated: if the answer is wrong, the software gives the right one and shows the misinterpreted structure. Then, the student is given a total score for his performance. The computer assisted teaching modules present some advantages: the images can be viewed in a given sequence (like traditional learning resources) or in any self-paced, customized way; this possibility, together with the friendly interface of Macintosh computers could make learning more active and pleasant.
