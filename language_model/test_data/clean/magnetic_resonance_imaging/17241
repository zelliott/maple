We describe the clinical presentation of a choroidal amelanotic melanoma in a 46-year-old woman with oculocutaneous albinism. Clinical aspects, investigations, and management are presented, and findings from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are described. Microscopic findings and histopathological features, demonstrating a spindle B-cell melanoma of the choroid, are also reviewed.

Magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in diagnosing amelanotic melanoma in patients with oculocutaneous albinism.
