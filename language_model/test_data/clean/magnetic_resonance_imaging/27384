A 58-year-old patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for severe hypercalcemia (total Ca 5.30 mmol/L) complicated with status epilepticus, hypertensive crisis and acute renal failure. Renal replacement therapy was explored as a method for treating medically refractory hypercalcemia.

Because of hemodynamic instability during intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) with high rates of calcium-free replacement fluids was instituted. Epoprostenol rather than citrate was used as anticoagulation to ensure adequate extracorporeal anticoagulation.

CVVH was continued for 40 hours total during which ionized calcium decreased from 2.19 to 1.07 mmol/L. The etiology of the hypercalcemia was from autoinfarction of a parathyroid adenoma.

This is the first case of hypercalcemia treated with CVVH with epoprostenol anticoagulation. This method avoids some of the pitfalls of using intermittent hemodialysis. It is also a rare example of hypercalcemia induced posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).
