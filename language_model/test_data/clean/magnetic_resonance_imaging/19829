Epidermoid cysts are benign epithelial cysts that occur rarely in the neck. In contrast to dermoid cysts,epidermoid cysts do not include dermal attachments such as hair, hair follicles, sebaceous glands and sweat glands. They may be congenital or acquired. Acquired epidermoid cysts are either post-traumatic or iatrogenic. They rarely enlarge markedly.This study discusses epidermoid cysts in a 34-year-old woman and a 35-year-old man, both of which were giant epidermoid cysts in the sublingual space. Both patients were admitted for difficulty swallowing and cosmetic problems. The cysts of both patients had an aetiology of trauma and were documented by pathology sections and pre-operative magnetic resonance images. Both cysts were excised completely, one intraorally and one externally. Such cysts are benign and ought to be borne in mind in the differential diagnosis of oral cavity and neck cystic masses.
