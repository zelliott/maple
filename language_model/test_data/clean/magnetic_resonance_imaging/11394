To identify patients (pts) at risk of late complications, follow-up after surgery for type A aortic dissection is essential. We assessed the value of echocardiography to monitor patients after surgery for type A aortic dissection.

80 out of 108 pts operated between 1989 and 1999 for type A aortic dissection survived surgery. 62 pts with at least one TEE, CT or MRI examinations during follow-up were included in this study. All pts had transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), 53 transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), 51 had CT, and 39 had MRI.

At the first follow-up, 12 of 48 pts with aortic valve sparing surgery presented with aortic insufficiency >I degrees detected using echocardiography. 16 pts evolved a distal aortic aneurysm of over 5 cm, all seen in TEE, CT and MRI. A distal intimal flap was present in 39 pts and could be seen in TEE, CT and MRI in all patients. A new proximal aortic root dissection took place in 5 pts. Progressive aortic pathology led to reoperation in 9 pts. TEE was especially useful in 2 pts to confirm redissection, in 1 pt to rule out redissection assumed by CT, and in 1 with paraprosthetic blood flow after ascending aortic replacement. MRI led to additional information in 1 patient with false aneurysm of the distal anastomosis and 1 with redissection not seen in TEE 6 month before. CT and MRI were superior to TEE in demonstrating aortic arch pathology, whereas TEE was more effective in showing the flow pattern and residual entry sites.

Echocardiography is an effective and cost-saving diagnostic tool to monitor pts after surgery for type A aortic dissection, and should be the method of choice to ascertain aortic pathology initially after surgery. Follow-up intervals and need for additional CT or MRI should be determined afterwards according to specific pathologies.
