Cysticercosis of the optic nerve has been reported only twice in the literature. A case of optic nerve cysticercosis in a 50-year-old woman with atypical optic neuritis is reported. Computerized tomography showed a thickened left optic nerve with a ring-enhancing lesion containing an eccentric nodule. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for cysticercosis further established the diagnosis. The patient was treated with oral prednisolone and albendazole, with no improvement in vision.
