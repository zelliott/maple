Phase-contrast flow measurements have become an established method in cardiac MRI. The quantification of intra- and extracardiac shunt volumes as well as the evaluation of valvular disease and aortic coarctation have proved their clinical usefulness. There are some rules that have to be followed when performing and analyzing phase-contrast flow measurements. With these rules in mind, quantitative phase-contrast flow measurements are a reliable and precise method for clinical use of cardiac MRI.
