Six patients with the classical form of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) were studied with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. While final diagnosis of PMD should be made on the basis of histopathologic findings in the brain, findings in this group support the fact that MRI can be used for tentative early diagnosis when computer tomographic examination is normal or nondiagnostic. All patients had MRI findings reflecting a pattern of diffuse white matter disease that can be considered characteristic in the appropriate clinical setting.
