A case of a 43-year-old man with coexistence of intracranial and spinal cavernous angiomas is presented. The patient had a 2-year history of severe back pain incurred by neck flexion, and he became aware of weakness of the right lower extremity and paresthesia of the left lower extremity. Neurological examinations at the time of the first admission demonstrated incomplete Brown-SÃ©quard syndrome. Myelograph, myelo-CT and contrast enhanced CT showed an intramedullary mass at the Th3-Th5 level. The patient received laminectomy with total removal of the lesion. Pathological diagnosis was cavernous angioma. Six years later, the patient complained of subacute weakness and numbness of the left upper extremity. Head CT demonstrated a high density lesion of about 2cm in diameter in the right frontal lobe. MRI showed a mixed signal intensity lesion with a marked low-intensity rim in the same area. Total extirpation of the lesion was performed. Pathological diagnosis of the intracerebral lesion was also cavernous angioma. Intramedullary cavernous angioma is very rare. Furthermore, bifocal cavernous angiomas involving both the spinal cord and the brain are extremely rare, and, only 5 cases have been reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first case diagnosed by surgical specimens of coexisting intramedullary and intracerebral lesions.
