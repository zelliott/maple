We report a 24-year-old male with pseudohypoparathyroidism and a 6-month history of sensory disturbance in both legs which was associated with difficulty in walking. His physical signs included a short stature, a thick neck, short fourth metacarpals and metatarsals, a spastic paraparesis and sphincteric disturbance. His serum electrolytes included low serum calcium and high serum phosphorus levels. CT reconstruction showed compression of the spinal cord in association with ossified ligamentum flavum at the C2-7 and T9-10 levels. These findings were confirmed by MRI scans.
