We herein report the case of a female with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) complicated with trigeminal nerve palsy. Although her sicca symptoms had been unnoticed, head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detecting brain abnormalities revealed parotid gland changes associated with SS. SS should be considerd as a possible cause of trigeminal nerve disturbances. In addition, parotid gland changes related to SS should be aware in examination of cranial nerve disturbances with MRI.
