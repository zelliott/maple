A migranous cerebral infarct (ICM) has the appearance of an ischaemic cerebral lesion which occurs during a migraine crisis and is shown by neuroimaging techniques to be in the corresponding vascular area. Four young patients are described. They fulfilled the clinical and neuroimaging criteria for compatibility with ICM and the protocol for the aetiological study of stroke was normal. Angiography ruled out other causes of ischaemia (dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, etc.) and showed segmental images of 'vasculitis appearance' similar to these described in Call's syndrome, in 'benign intracranial angiopathy' and in other intracranial vasculopathies or criteria of 'reversible segmental cerebral vasoconstriction'. The pathogenic significance, as with migraine, is still unknown.
