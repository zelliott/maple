In recent years, neurobiological markers of antisocial behavior have frequently been identified in children of the early-starter subtype of conduct disorder (CD, according DSM-IV). Some studies, however, produced inconsistent findings. The present review argues that, given the existing methodological opportunities, we need a more detailed phenotyping of children with CD. In particular, establishing comorbid anxiety in neuroendocrinological studies might constitute an important factor. There also seem to be associations between trait anxiety and alterations of brain function and brain structure. Finally, the impact of trait anxiety on different subtypes of aggressive behavior as well as on prognosis is emphasized. In sum, a more detailed characterization of children with CD might help to improve our understanding of antisocial development and enhance therapeutic options.
