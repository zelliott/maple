Cerebral blood flow and ICP are important neurophysiologic parameters known to be affected by pathology and by trauma. Limited data on the relationship between these parameters following head trauma is inconsistent with regard to whether these parameters are correlated. Data on the relationship between these parameters in the healthy state is not readily available due to a lack of noninvasive means to measure these important parameters. A recently developed noninvasive MRI-based method for simultaneous measurement of total cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure was applied to establish the relationship between ICP and TCBF values in healthy subjects. Seventy-one simultaneous measurements of CBF and ICP were obtained from 23 healthy young adults. These results demonstrated that CBF values span over a much narrower range compared with ICP. The relationship between the inter-individual CBF and ICP measurements suggest that in the healthy state and in rest these parameters are not correlated.
