Automated measures of cerebral magnetic resonance images (MRI) often provide greater speed and reliability compared to manual techniques but can be particularly sensitive to motion artifact. This study employed an automatic MRI analysis program that quantified regional gray matter volume and created images for verification and quality control. Motion artifact was assessed on each image and assigned a rating of none, mild, moderate, or severe. Greater motion artifact was associated with smaller gray matter volumes. Severity of motion artifact is an important, but often overlooked, consideration in the interpretation of automated MRI measures.
