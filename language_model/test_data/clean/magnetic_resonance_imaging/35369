To determine the characteristics of functional magnetic resonance imaging in brain of children with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)when performing an impulsive task and to explore the brain structure of impulsivity.

Ten ODD children and 10 age and sex-matched control children were recruited. The stimulus task with GOSTOP impulsivity paradigm software was used as the mode of stimulus-rest-stimulus. The data of 2 groups were normalized, merged, and averaged, and then the activation regions were compared by SPM software.

More scattered cortex and subcortex regions were activated in the ODD group than in the control group during the performance of an impulsive task. The activated cortex in the control group focused on the frontal pole (including inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and orbital-frontal gyrus) and temporal pole (including inferior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus).

Frontal pole may be an important region related to multiplicity impulsivity, and shows hypofunction in ODD children.
