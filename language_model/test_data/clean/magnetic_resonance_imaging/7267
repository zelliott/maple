Cerebral aneurysms in infants are rare. Of those cases that are reported, only 7 have been identified within the anterior cerebral artery circulation. We report a case of a 7-week-old female who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and seizure secondary to a saccular aneurysm of the distal anterior cerebral artery. At surgery, a 1.5-cm thrombosed aneurysm was excised. Postoperatively the child has done well achieving normal milestones at the age of 1 year. We present this case plus a review of the limited number of similar cases found in the literature stressing the presenting signs and symptoms, surgical considerations and outcomes.
