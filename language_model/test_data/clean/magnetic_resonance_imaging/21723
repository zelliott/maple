A case of huge facial nerve neuroma was reported. The patient was a 59-year-old woman who had 5 years' history of right facial paralysis. A CT study with contrast medium showed extensive destruction of the right temporal bone including the semicircular canals, and with protrusion of the tumor into the cerebello-pontine angle. CT findings with contrast enhancement and MRI suggested a neuroma and its origin. The operation confirmed that the tumor arose from the vertical portion of the facial nerve. Previous papers dealing with this kind of tumor were reviewed to delineate clinical characteristics for diagnosis and treatment of facial nerve neuroma.
