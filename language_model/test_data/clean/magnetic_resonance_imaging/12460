Midgut volvulus is a rare complication of pregnancy with high morbidity and mortality rates. Clinical diagnosis may be difficult in pregnant women. Ionizing radiation imaging modalities are not advised. Ultrasonography (US) is safer but sometimes is unable to reveal the characteristic whirlpool sign of midgut volvulus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contributed to confirm diagnosis in our case. We present here a case of 34-year-old pregnant woman at 14 weeks of gestation who presented with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. US was not conclusive. MRI revealed the typical whirlpool sign of midgut volvulus.
