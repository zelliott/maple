We use multiple MRI modalities to measure cerebral edema and intracerebral hemorrhage quantitatively after TBI in rabbits and to acquire the early prognostic MRI information. Multiple MRI modalities (DCE-MRI, DWI and SWI) were used to assess cerebral edema and intracerebral hemorrhage quantitatively at different time points within a month after TBI in 15 rabbits. The functional outcomes were evaluated at 1 and 30 days after TBI. The relationships between the quantitative MRI information at different time points and functional outcome at 30 days were analyzed. The volume transfer coefficient (K (trans)) in the focal lesion area and the perifocal lesion area at the acute phase correlated with the functional outcome at 30 days (p < 0.05). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value at 7 days in the focal lesion area correlated with the functional outcome at 30 days (p < 0.01) and had a trend to correlate at 3 days (p = 0.08). In the perifocal lesion area, the ADC values at both acute and subacute phase correlated with the functional outcome at 30 days (p < 0.05). The volume of hemorrhage correlated with functional outcome at 30 days (p < 0.05). The cerebral edema assessed by DCE-MRI (K (trans)) and DWI (ADC) and intracerebral hemorrhage assessed by SWI may have predictive values.
