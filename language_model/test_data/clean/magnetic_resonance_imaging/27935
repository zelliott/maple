Twenty-three drug abusers and seventeen controls underwent clinical neurological examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The drug abuse encompassed cannabis, inhalants, opiates, psychedelics, amphetamines, and cocaine but not necessarily all drugs in all persons. The drug abuse was always combined with heavy alcohol consumption. One drug abuser had abnormal neurological findings which consisted of lower limb ataxia and 3 others had mild imbalance. MRI examinations did not show differences in width of the third, fourth or lateral ventricles nor the diameter of the cerebral aqueduct but the drug abusers had significantly smaller vermes cerebelli compared to controls. White matter changes also occurred more often in the drug abuser group. These findings are not consistent with known side-effects of the narcotic drugs but more probably a result of very high alcohol consumptions in parallel with drug abuse. Alcohol is clearly a much more potent brain toxic agent than are the most commonly abused narcotic drugs.
