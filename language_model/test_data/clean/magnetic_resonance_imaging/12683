Mycoplasma cerebellitis though rare, may rapidly progress to hydrocephalus needing surgical intervention. It has not been reported so far in children. We report a 6 year old girl with mycoplasma cerebellitis which progressed to acute hydrocephalus needing an emergency external ventricular drain. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is essential in making the diagnosis of cerebellar swelling as CT scan may be normal. Relapses can occur as in our case. Close monitoring for raised intracranial pressure and investigations to identify the organism including mycoplasma are indicated in all cases. Long-term outcome appears to be favorable if diagnosed and treated early.
