IVIM MR imaging is a method which generates images of diffusion and perfusion in vivo. Until now, intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) images have been obtained using spin-echo sequences with extragradient pulses, resulting in long acquisition times (typically 2 x 8 min 32 s). A new method is proposed here, using steady-state free precession (SSFP), which allows IVIM images to be obtained in a couple of minutes. Phantom studies showed that the sensitivity of SSFP to IVIMs is much greater than that of spin echoes. In vivo images are shown.
