This article presents a technique to automatically measure changes in the volume of a structure of interest in successive 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images and its application in the study of the brain and lateral cerebral ventricles. The only manual step is a segmentation of the structure of interest in the first image. The analysis comprises, first, precise rigid co-registration of the time series of images; second, computation of residual deformations between pairs of images; third, automatic quantification of the volume change, obtained by propagation of the segmentation of the structure of interest through the series of MR images. This approach has been applied to monitor changes in the volume of the brain and lateral cerebral ventricles in a healthy subject and a patient with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Results are consistent with those obtained by application of the boundary shift integral (BSI) and by stereology in the same subjects.
