Uncontrolled head motion during CT/MRI cerebral blood flow (CBF) imaging has been estimated between 3 and 15% of the cases. We present a pharmacological approach which permitted us to maintain the incident at 0.06% with few side effects. The protocol involves the systematic use of general anesthesia (sevoflurane) in children below five years and those with mental retardation. In anxious, claustrophobic or agitated adults, mild sedation with propofol, midazolam or hydroxyzine was used with mild effects on CBF. We strongly recommend the availability of basic cardiorespiratory resuscitation equipment and a recovery room before any sedation or general anesthesia is undertaken.
