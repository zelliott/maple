Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is basically a benign phenomenon in patients without structural heart disease. The focal source of the tachycardia is usually located in the right ventricular outflow tract and more rarely in the left ventricular outflow tract. Aortic sinus of Valsalva (ASV) is a well-known source of atrial and ventricular tachycardias. We report a case with simultaneous existence of sustained atrial and ventricular tachycardias originating from ASV, which was successfully treated with radiofrequency catheter ablation.
