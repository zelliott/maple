A 13-year-old girl with an immunosuppression developed a right hemiparesis and a cerebellar syndrome. She was seropositive for HIV. A progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) was suspected because of white matter lesions (MRI) and established on detection of JC virus in CSF by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In spite of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) and cidofovir, she died three months later.

Late AIDS diagnosis was established during a neurological complication, 13 years after a neonatal transmission. PML caused by JC opportunistic virus still has a poor prognosis.
