This study examined the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas (SPT).

Cases of SPT encountered in our hospital between January 1994 and December 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. The clinicopathological factors in the benign and malignant cases were compared to determine what features of the tumor could suggest malignant potential.

Thirty patients with SPT were identified: 26 females and 4 males with a average age of 30.5 years (range 9-66). The median size of the tumors was 6.2cm (range 1.25 to 15.0). Tumors were located in the head (50%), neck (3.3%), body (16.7%) and tail (30%) of the pancreas. Surgical procedures included a local tumor resection (10 cases) or radical resection, such as a pancreaticoduodenectomy (6 cases), central pancreatectomy (1 case) or distal pancreatectomy (13 cases). There was no recurrence after the surgical resection. All patients were alive at a median follow-up of 58 months (range 6 to 187). Among the clinico-pathological factors, the presence of calcification was associated with the malignant potential (OR=16.000, 95% CI=1.451-176.451, p=0.024).

SPT is a less aggressive pancreatic neoplasm that differs from other pancreatic cancers. The prognosis is favorable after a surgical resection. The presence of calcification is a predictive factor for a malignant SPT.
