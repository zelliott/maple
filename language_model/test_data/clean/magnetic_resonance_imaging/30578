Developmental disorders are a common pathological condition in Neuropaediatrics and do not usually present characteristic anatomical alterations in the different neuroanatomical imaging tests that can be employed, such as computerised axial tomography or magnetic resonance (MR). Positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F] fluorodeoxiglucose (PET FDG), one of the battery of imaging tests currently available, enables us to obtain data about brain activity in a non invasive manner.

A group of 39 patients with developmental disorders from the Hospital del Mar was analysed. They were submitted to PET FDG brain metabolism tests and in some cases hybrid PET MR images were also obtained; findings were then correlated against the clinical progression of the patients.

The alterations that were observed showed predominantly bilateral thalamic, mesial temporal and orbital frontal hypometabolism. This alteration of the limbic system, which has no correlation with anatomical damage, can be a predictor of the clinical progression and of the confirmation of the presence of alterations in the brain functions in this type of patients.
