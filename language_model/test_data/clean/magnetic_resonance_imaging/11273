Abdominal cystic lymphangiomas are a rare pathology that are related to abnormal development of the lymphatic system. They predominate in a children and are very uncommon in adults. Here the authors report a case of a cystic intra-abdominal lymphangioma in a 64-years old woman in which the cyst was situated in the mesentery of the jejuneum, with rapid growth. Ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging led us to evaluate a cystic characterizations and his site. Surgical excision remain the treatment of choice because we can establish an histologic diagnosis. Complete surgical excision of cyst, although it can be difficult, consent a definitive healing.
