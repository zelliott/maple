Localizations were compared for the same human seizure between simultaneously measured MEG and iEEG, which were both co-registered to MRI. The whole-cortex neuromagnetometer localized a dipole in a sphere phantom, co-registered to the MEG sensor array, with an error of 1.4 mm. A focal afterdischarge seizure was induced in a patient with partial epilepsy, by stimulation at a subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) electrode with a known location, which was co-registered to the MRI and to the MEG sensor array. The simultaneous MEG and ECoG during the 30-second seizure was measured and analyzed using the single, moving dipole model, which is the localization model used clinically. The dipole localizations from simultaneous whole cortex 68-channel MEG and 64-channel ECoG were then compared for the repetitive spiking at six different times during the seizure. There were two main regions of MEG and ECoG activity. The locations of these regions were confirmed by determining the location clusters of 8,000 dipoles on ECoG at consecutive time points during the seizure. The mean distances between the stimulated electrode location versus the dipole location of the MEG and versus the dipole location of the ECoG were each about one (1) centimeter. The mean distance between the dipole locations of the MEG versus the dipole locations of the ECoG was about 2 cm. These errors were compared to errors of MEG and ECoG reported previously for phantoms and for somatosensory evoked responses (SER) in patients. Comparing the findings from the present study to those from prior studies, there appeared to be the expected stepwise increase in mean localization error progressing from the phantom, to the SER, to the seizure.
