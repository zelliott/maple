We report the MR findings in two cases of malignant melanoma of the vagina, one arising at the cervicovaginal junction which mimicked squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and the other recurred in the vagina after previous resection. Two cases of malignant melanoma had high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and enhanced after gadopentetate dimeglumine administration.
