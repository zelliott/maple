The use of MRI in the evaluation of cartilaginous lesions is now well established. Thirty patients suspected of presenting such lesions were investigated by MRI with gradient echo sequences. Twelve patients had an arthroscopy either before or after the MRI. The sequences have allowed characterisation of the lesions of chondromalacia and have showed early lesions not visible at arthroscopy, without need for intraarticular contrast injection.
