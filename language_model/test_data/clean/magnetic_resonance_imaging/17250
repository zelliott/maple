The so-called rubral tremor is a clinical diagnosis that involves involuntary shaking limb movements during rest and voluntary motion. We report the cases of 2 patients who developed rubral tremor after cardiac catheterization. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of such an association. In each case, brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed nothing unusual. The onset of tremor after cardiac catheterization may signal the presence of a complex neurologic syndrome, which warrants consultation with a neurologist.
