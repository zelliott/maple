A 40-year-old normotensive man suddenly developed dizziness, vomiting, hoarseness and swallowing disturbance. Neurologic examinations showed bilaterally decreased palatal elevation and gag reflex, upbeat nystagmus and gait ataxia. The diagnosis of medullary hemorrhage was first established by computed tomography (CT). Magnetic resonance imaging study further showed a hematoma in the paramedial medulla oblongata extending dorsorostrally to the pontomedullary junction. It gave the precise anatomic boundary of the intramedullary hematoma and was well correlated with the clinical findings. This patient's subsequent prognosis was good with gradual improvement of the clinical signs and symptoms. A follow-up CT scan showed resolution of the hematoma, and the prognosis was consistent with a good neurologic recovery.
