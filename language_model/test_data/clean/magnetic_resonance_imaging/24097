Even though several non-invasive techniques are available for the assessment of coronary artery disease and the detection of myocardial ischemia, many coronary angiograms yield negative results, thus, warranting higher accuracy for non-invasive tests. The detection of obstructive coronary artery disease is only possible during physical or pharmacological stress. Currently, the assessment of wall motion abnormalities by echocardiography is clinically the most widely used method. However, a significant number of patients yield suboptimal or non-diagnostic images despite improvements with harmonic imaging. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging allows a non-invasive visualization of the heart with high spatial and temporal resolution. Gradient echo CMR images permit an exact and reproducible determination of global and regional left ventricular function, wall thickness and wall thickening and identical pharmacological stress protocols, as currently used for dobutamine stress echocardiography, can be implemented for CMR imaging. A review of the literature on dobutamine stress CMR for the detection of stress induced wall motion abnormalities is presented and the safety of CMR stress examinations is discussed. The results show, that especially in those patients with suboptimal echocardiographic image quality dobutamine stress CMR is superior in comparison with dobutamine stress echocardiography and may replace echocardiography in these patients. Further possibilities by the use of myocardial tagging or intravascular contrast agents are outlined.
