The clinical and laboratory findings in 4 girls with the Rett syndrome are presented. The MRI results at different disease stages with detailed descriptions of the techniques applied-including quantification of T1 and T2 relaxation times in the brain-are reported. There were no pathological signal intensities in T1- or T2-weighted images. Thus, MRI does not provide any significant additional help in the diagnosis of the Rett syndrome. However, it does indicate that disturbances of myelinization or the brain water content are not probable etiologies in this syndrome.
