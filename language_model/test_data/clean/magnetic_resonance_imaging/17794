Epilepsy can develop at any age for reasons that remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a family history of epilepsy (FHE) on the incidence and recurrence of seizures.

This retrospective study was conducted in Aseer central hospital, Abha, Saudi Arabia between January and June 2012. The medical records of 420 patients were analyzed to test the impact of FHE on the risk factors, etiology and diagnosis of epilepsy determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG).

420 patients were studied. Idiopathic epilepsy was seen in 140 patients (33%), symptomatic in 152 (36%), and cryptogenic in 128 patients (30%). FHE was seen in 113 patients (27%), which was associated with younger at the disease onset (15 years vs 20 years, p<0.05). Idiopathic epilepsy was seen more in patients with FHE (43% vs 30%, p value <0.05), and generalized seizures (primary or secondary) were also seen more in patients with FHE (51% vs 36%, p value <0.05). Abnormal EEG was also seen more in patients with FHE (79% vs 66%, p<0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that temporal epileptic discharges were the best predictor for the presence of FHE (p<0.05, OR=3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.8), more than idiopathic epilepsy or younger age at epilepsy onset.

FHE has a significant impact on epilepsy, its classifications, and the EEG findings, and may underlie the presence of a genetic etiology, which could be related to a high incidence of consanguinity seen in our population. Temporal epileptic discharges were the best predictor for FHE, which may suggest the presence of familial TLE.
