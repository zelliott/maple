The sinus tarsi is a cone-shaped anatomical space in the hind foot that is bounded by the talus and calcaneus, the talonavicular and posterior sub-talar joint, and is continuous with the tarsal canal medially. The space courses from posteromedial to anterolateral, with the larger portion of the cone laterally situated. The sinus tarsi consists of fatty tissue, arterial anastomoses, joint recesses posteriorly, nerve endings, and five ligaments. These include the lateral, intermediate, medial roots of the inferior extensor retinaculum, the cervical ligament, and the interosseous ligament. The sinus syndrome is characterized by lateral foot pain, focal pain to palpation over the tarsal sinus, and hind foot instability. This chronic disease is related to a history of inversion trauma in the majority of patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in the evaluation of abnormalities associated with the sinus tarsi syndrome.
