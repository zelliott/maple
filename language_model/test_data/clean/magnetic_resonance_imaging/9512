An 8-year-old boy presented with amblyopia and magnetic resonance imaging examination revealed moderately dilated optic nerve sheath with fluid. The diagnosis of unilateral optic nerve sheath meningocele was made and this case was not associated with type I neurofibromatosis. The authors report an additional case of isolated unilateral optic nerve sheath meningocele.
