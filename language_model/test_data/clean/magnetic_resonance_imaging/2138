A disadvantage of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the high level of noise produced (peaking between 122 dB and 131 dB). We used otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) as a method to quantify the effect of MRI-generated noise on the cochlea. OAEs were measured in 16 patients before and after MRI and in 16 controls. OAEs decreased in patients after MRI, but the controls, who were not exposed to MRI noise, showed no decrease over the same period. The change in OAEs shows a clear effect of MRI noise on cochlear function, despite use of earplugs. The importance of correctly fitted earplugs cannot be underestimated.
