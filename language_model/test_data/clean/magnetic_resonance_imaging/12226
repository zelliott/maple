The radiation-response characteristics of agarose gels prepared with Fricke dosemeter solution have been studied. The response mechanism is an increase in the NMR longitudinal relaxation rate of protons caused by ferric ions. It has been observed that: (i) oxygen saturation assures consistent and maximum sensitivity; (ii) agarose concentrations in the range 1.0-2.0% have no effect upon sensitivity; (iii) the initial G value is 150 Fe3+/100 eV for gels containing 0.5 mM Fe2+ ions; (iv) increasing NMR frequencies only causes a moderate increase in sensitivity; (v) the gel dosemeters are dose rate independent in the range 4.7-24.2 Gy min-1; (vi) sensitivity is pH dependent, being zero at pH 7; (vii) freshly prepared gels are slightly more sensitive than those more than 24 h old; and (ix) the diffusion coefficient for ferric ions in a 1.0% agarose gel containing 0.0125 M H2SO4 is 1.83 x 10(-2) cm2 h-1, and this will require consideration for the NMR imaging of dose distributions.
