The ferromagnetism of various bullets and shotgun pellets was tested in vitro. Magnetic deflection showed that four of 21 metallic specimens tested (all bullets) demonstrated marked ferromagnetism. Three of these four were made outside the United States; two of the four were known to contain steel, and the other two were reportedly either copper or copper-nickel-jacketed lead bullets (indicating that the ferromagnetism was due to impurities in the bullet jackets or cores). Ferromagnetic bullets readily rotated within a gelatin phantom in response to magnetic torque. Nonferromagnetic bullets and pellets demonstrated only mild to moderate metal artifact during spin-echo and gradient-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, all four of the ferromagnetic bullets produced severe MR artifacts and image distortion. MR studies of seven patients with retained bullets, pellets, or shrapnel were reviewed. In six of the seven, only mild MR artifacts were seen. Only intracranial shrapnel (presumably steel) in one patient created significant artifact. All seven patients with retained bullets and shotgun pellets were imaged safely with MR. However, caution should be exercised with MR imaging in the presence of metallic foreign bodies, particularly if they are located near vital neural, vascular, or soft-tissue structures.
