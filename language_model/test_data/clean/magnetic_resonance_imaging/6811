A phantom design method suitable for high-field MRI based on the RF field wave characteristics of sample and experimental validations at 7.0 T and 3.0 T are presented. The RF field distribution in a phantom with a given RF coil system is primarily determined by the sample size relative to the wavelength inside the sample, and the ratio between the displacement and conduction currents. Experimental results demonstrate that the MR image intensity patterns associated with wave behavior in human samples at a given field strength can be reproduced with a phantom at the same or different field strengths once the dimension and penetration constant are scaled by the corresponding wavelength in the sample medium.
