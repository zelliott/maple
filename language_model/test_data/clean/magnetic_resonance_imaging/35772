The ability to diagnose adverse postcraniotomy or postcraniectomy events is essential for proper postoperative care. The importance of identifying postoperative changes on CT has previously been shown. The purpose of this study is to assess the normal and abnormal MR changes that may be seen in the postcraniotomy/postcraniectomy period. The postoperative MR, CT, and medical records of 41 postcraniotomy patients and 26 postcraniectomy patients were reviewed. Reasons for choosing craniectomy over craniotomy included decompression, infected flap, bony involvement by tumor, and posttraumatic skull. In general, the postoperative normal anatomy was better seen with MR. Postoperative events included hemorrhage (two), infection (five), cyst formation (10), and recurrent tumor (five). In general, MR was found to be more useful than CT for the detection of hemorrhage and infection after craniotomy or craniectomy and for the proper localization of postoperative cysts. MR proved to be a useful method for following postoperative sites in the skull.
