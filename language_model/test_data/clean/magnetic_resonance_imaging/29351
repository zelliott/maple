The purpose of this study was to illustrate the spectrum of abnormalities found at endorectal coil magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with hemospermia. Ninety patients aged between 23 and 71 years (mean age 41 years) presenting with hemospermia underwent evaluation with endorectal coil MR imaging at 1.5 T. Duration of hemospermia ranged between 5 days and 4 years (mean 15 months). MR examination protocol included T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) and T2-weighted fast SE MR images obtained in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes. Abnormalities were observed on endorectal-coil MR images in 49 of 90 patients (54%). Blood within the seminal vesicle or the ejaculatory duct was recognized in 23 of 90 patients (25%). Dilatation of the seminal vesicles or the ejaculatory duct was observed in 31 of 90 patients (34%). Cystic lesions were identified in 14 cases, eight of which involved the utriculus and six the ejaculatory duct. Calculi within the seminal vesicles were depicted in seven patients. No malignant disease was demonstrated. In conclusion, despite the evidence that hemospermia is most often a benign and self-limiting condition, we found that endorectal coil MR imaging can detect abnormal findings in more than half of the patients, and may be helpful in assessing the level at which hemorrhage occurred and in defining the cause of the disease.
