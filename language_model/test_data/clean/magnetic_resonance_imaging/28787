Impaired vision and cerebral blindness were observed in a patient who had suffered brain trauma. One year after the trauma, the impairment was characterized by low visual acuity, visual field restricted to central tunnel vision and impaired recognition of objects, line drawings, colors and faces. Vision improved six years after the brain trauma with more rapid recognition of objects and line drawings, increased visual acuity and broadening of the visual field. Reading was possible at this time. However, prosopagnosia remained very severe and was still the primary complaint of the patient. Improvement of visual function continuing for several years after a brain injury is discussed on the basis of cognitive and neurophysiological knowledge. The place of rehabilitation is discussed. Functional improvement is explained by extrastriate cortical afferences and the cortical network of visual pathways.
