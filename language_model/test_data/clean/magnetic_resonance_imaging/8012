We report preliminary results of an ongoing study that assesses the efficacy of tacrolimus on Kimura's disease (KD).

A patient with refractory KD after surgery and treatment with prednisone was treated with tacrolimus. Tacrolimus (FK-506) was administered at an initial dosage of 1 mg every 12 hours, and FK-506 concentration in the blood was monitored monthly. FK-506 blood concentration was controlled within 5 to 15 Î¼g/L. After 6 months, the dosage of tacrolimus was reduced to 0.5 mg daily for another 2 months and then treatment was stopped.

Swelling of the bilateral salivary glands disappeared within the first week. No serious side effects were noted and the disease has not recurred in the 2 years of follow-up.

Tacrolimus may be an effective treatment for patients with KD, but more research is needed to determine its long-term efficacy and safety as well as its mechanism of action.
