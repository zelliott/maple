Dandy-Walker complex is a continuum of developmental anomalies of the posterior fossa which includes vermian rotation. However, vermian rotation alone may be benign. The aim of this study was to describe our experience with sagittal-plane prenatal ultrasound in the diagnosis of rotation of the vermis in cases of suspected enlarged cisterna magna on routine antenatal imaging, and to describe the follow-up of these patients.

Seven women, who were referred to our ultrasound unit for evaluation of an enlarged fetal cisterna magna and suspected agenesis of the vermis on axial-plane imaging, underwent further multiplanar studies of the posterior fossa and measurements of the vermis.

The mean maternal age was 27 (range, 20-33) years and the mean gestational age at diagnosis was 19.5 (range, 18-31) weeks. The standard axial plane image showed a 'direct communication' between the cisterna magna and the fourth ventricle. In the mid-sagittal plane, the vermis was clearly delineated, with posterosuperior rotation. Vermis size was within normal limits for gestational age in all cases. Findings were confirmed by prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in two cases and postnatal MRI and/or sonography in five. During a mean follow-up of 4.5 (range, 1-7.5) years, all children developed normally, with no neurological complications.

The finding of an enlarged cisterna magna on standard- (axial-)plane ultrasound should be evaluated further in the sagittal plane to determine whether the cause is rotation of a normal vermis. This may spare patients unnecessary tests, anxiety and, in some cases, pregnancy termination.
