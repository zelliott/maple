We have performed simple bone grafting in four elderly patients with pain due to unstable pseudarthroses in the osteoporotic spine after compression fracture. At operation, we observed abnormal movement of the affected vertebral body which was covered with a hypertrophic membrane; this seemed to inhibit the blood supply to the lesion. The thick membrane and avascular granulation in the false joint were excised and bone grafting carried out. Symptoms were dramatically improved immediately after operation and bony union was confirmed in the three surviving patients.
