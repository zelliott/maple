Malignant triton tumor (MTT) is a relatively rare, aggressive tumor comprised of both malignant schwannoma cells and malignant rhabdomyoblasts. Because MTT frequently arises in the head and neck, the otolaryngologist must be aware of the nature of the tumor and its response to various treatment modalities.

This article reviews the treatment and outcome of all reported cases of MTT arising in the head and neck.

Although statistical analysis is limited by the short duration of follow-up of many patients, complete tumor resection appears to carry an improved chance of survival. Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy may also improve survival, although a benefit of these therapies was not well demonstrated in this small series.
