Arnold-Chiari type I malformations usually manifest clinically with short-lasting headaches typically involving the occipital-nuchal region and precipitated by the Valsalva maneuver, coughing, sudden postural change, or physical exertion. We describe the case of an adult patient who presented with symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia caused by an Arnold-Chiari type I malformation. Unlike previous cases, the malformation involved the trigeminal ophthalmic division alone.
