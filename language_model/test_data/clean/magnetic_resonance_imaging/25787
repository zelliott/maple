We reported longitudinal cranial MRI studies of a neonate with tuberous sclerosis who presented convulsive seizures on the first day after birth. Cortical tubers were not detected on MRI performed at the age of 1 month, but became evident at 18 months after birth. This finding might reflect the pathological difference between the amount of myelin around the cortical tuber and other white matter lesions, which increased with age. A heterotopic islet was shown as partially stratiform appearance on MRI. This result suggests that the structure of the heterotopic islet might be heterogeneous.
