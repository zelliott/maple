Bevacizumab has provided encouraging results in relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Pre-clinical and clinical investigations also showed that continuous low-dose temozolomide has some antiangiogenic activity. Based on this evidence, a phase II trial was designed to investigate an oral regimen of sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, and metronomic temozolomide for relapsed GBM.

Forty-three patients (median age=60.0 years) naive for antiangiogenic agents received 400 mg sorafenib twice daily plus TMZ 40 mg/m(2)/day until disease progression.

Toxicity, mostly grade 1-2, was manageable. Grade 3-4 toxicities were hand-foot syndrome (n=4), hypertension (n=2), and fatigue (n=3). Five patients (12%) achieved partial response, 18 (43%) stable disease, 20 (48%) showed progression. The median time-to-progression was 3.2 months, 6-month progression-free survival was 26%, and median overall survival was 7.4 months.

This combination of sorafenib and temozolomide was feasible and safe, showing some activity in patients with relapsed GBM.
