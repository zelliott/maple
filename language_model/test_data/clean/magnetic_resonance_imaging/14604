We systematically compared fMRI results for covert (silent) and overt (spoken) versions of a language task in a representative sample of children with lesional focal epilepsy being considered for neurosurgical treatment (N=38, aged 6-17 years). The overt task was advantageous for presurgical fMRI assessments of language; it produced higher quality scans, was more sensitive for identifying activation in core language regions on an individual basis, and provided an online measure of performance crucial for improving the yield of presurgical fMRI.
