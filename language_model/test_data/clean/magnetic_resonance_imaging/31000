Neuroanatomical changes have been identified in patients diagnosed with late-life major depressive disorder (MDD) compared with controls. These primarily comprise a decrease in focal brain volumes and an increase in MRI-determined high intensity lesions that are largely confined to the white matter. The physiological status of normal-appearing white matter in patients with MDD remains unknown. Magnetization transfer (MT) is a relatively new neuroimaging technique that permits us to examine the biophysical characteristics of specific brain regions. Using MT, we studied eight patients with late-life MDD and eight non-depressed controls. MT ratios (MTR), which reflect the integrity of the macromolecular protein pool, were ascertained in normal-appearing white matter and subcortical nuclei. Patients had significantly lower MTRs in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, the right caudate nucleus and putamen, and the occipital white matter compared with controls. The findings indicate that the structure of the macromolecular protein matrix may be compromised in normal-appearing white matter and critical subcortical nuclei in patients with late-life major depression. These changes may provide important substrates to mood disorders and have implications for neuronal connectivity and its role in the pathophysiology of late-life depression.
