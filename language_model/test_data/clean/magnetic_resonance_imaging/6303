The magnetic properties and relaxivities of superparamagnetic, ferromagnetic and paramagnetic iron oxides are presented and compared. The iron in colloids of ferromagnetic iron oxide has a large spin-spin relaxivity and a small spin-lattice relaxivity. The iron in colloids of paramagnetic iron oxide has a low spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxivity. The iron in colloids of highly dispersed superparamagnetic iron oxides has a large spin-spin relaxivity and a large spin-lattice relaxivity. Superparamagnetic colloids with various particle sizes in solution have been made by varying the number of superparamagnetic iron oxide crystals per particles in solution. Superparamagnetic colloids of larger solution particle size have a lower spin-lattice relaxivity than colloids comprised of smaller solution particle sizes.
