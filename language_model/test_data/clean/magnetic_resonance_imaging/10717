We report the case of a 54 years old male diagnosed as ethmoidal epidermoid carcinoma which, after almost 1 year--asymptomatic period, debuted with facial pain (cluster headache) without another associated clinic. Sino-nasal malignant tumours represent about 5%-6% in all ENT carcinomas and they use to be of later diagnosis, with high probability of local recurrence and invasiveness on structures like orbit and skull base. The main treatment for ethmoidal squamous carcinomas is surgery and depending on staging can require radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. A bibliographic review is done at this respect.
