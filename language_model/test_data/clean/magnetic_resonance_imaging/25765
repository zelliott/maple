Intercondylar roof impingement should be suspected in any patient having difficulty regaining knee extension following an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. An arthroscopically performed roofplasty can eliminate the clinical complaints. The extent of bone removal can be planned from studying a lateral radiograph taken with the knee in terminal extension. Extension exercises or passive extension devices should not be used in patients with extension deficits caused by roof impingement because they may further damage the graft.
