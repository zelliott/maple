We have observed a male and a female, sibs of non-consanguineous parents, affected by severe myopia with characteristic retinal defects and Dandy-Walker variant. The peculiarity of the retinopathy consists of pathological myopia with anomalous vitreal fenestrated membranes in the retinal periphery. We suppose that these associations may configure a new genetic syndrome.
