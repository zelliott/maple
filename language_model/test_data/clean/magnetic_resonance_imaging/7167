Internal derangements or disk dysfunctions represent the most frequent pathology of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The radiological study of TMJ dysfunction was, for a long time, restricted to arthrography. More and more MR is used to study the TMJ, because MR, allows non-invasive visualisation of without the use of X-rays. Moreover a "dynamic" MR technique can be used to study disk movements during mouth opening. A lot of the internal derangement problems can be solved with this technique and arthrography can often be avoided. This dynamic MR technique is described and some cases are discussed.
