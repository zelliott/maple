We report the case of a patient with Brucella melitensis osteomyelitis involving non-joint prosthetic implant of the femur. This is the first case published of osteomyelitis by Brucella sp. in a patient with prosthetic implant in bone and the second one with both intra- or extra-articular prosthetic bone implant. Brucella melitensis is a rare organism which causes osteomyelitis in patients with prosthetic hardware, and should be added to the list of suspected organisms responsible for this disease, especially in endemic areas of brucellosis.
