Scleroderma featuring rare connective tissue disease that manifests as skin sclerosis and variable systemic involvement. Two categories of scleroderma are known: systemic sclerosis, characterized by cutaneous sclerosis and visceral involvement and localized scleroderma or morphea which classically presents benign evolution and self-limited, confined to the skin and/or underlying tissue. Recent studies show that the localized form may possibly course with involvement of internal organs and variable morbidity. This study aimed to determine the demographic characteristics, the prevalence of systemic manifestations and laboratory findings, as well as the association with autoimmune diseases, and the evolution of neurological findings, both clinical as brain MRI in patients with scleroderma of the face and its relation with the activity skin.

Patients with localized scleroderma with facial involvement were evaluated and underwent neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging and ophthalmology evaluation. After 3years, the patients were subjected again to MRI.

We studied 12 patients with localized scleroderma of the face. Of this total, headache being the most frequent complaint found in 66.7% of patients, 33.3% had neurological changes possibly associated with scleroderma. As for ophthalmologic evaluation, 25% of patients showed abnormalities. The most frequent parenchymal finding was the presence of lesions with hyperintense or hypointense signal in 75% of patients, followed by ventricular asymmetry at 16.7%. Of the patients who had neurological deficits, 75% also had a change to MRI. In all patients, imaging findings after 3years were unchanged. During this interval of 3years, 25% of patients showed signs of activity of scleroderma.

Patients with localized scleroderma of the face have a high prevalence of neurological and ophthalmological changes. Based on these findings, we suggest that all cases of localized scleroderma of the face should be thoroughly examined for the presence of systemic changes.
