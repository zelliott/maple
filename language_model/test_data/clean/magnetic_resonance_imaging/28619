The aim of the study was to assess MR images of median nerve suture in the distal part of the forearm on fresh cadavers and injured patients. The median nerve was dissected in the distal one-third of the forearm in four fresh cadaveric specimens, divided and repaired in three of them in two cases with 3/0 nylon (one with well-apposed edges and the other with a lateral gap) and, in the third specimen, with 9/0 nylon with well apposed edges. The course of the median nerve was then studied on MR imaging in different planes and the quality of the nerve repair was evaluated. A good correlation was found between the MR images and the type of nerve suture. These findings were applied in management of two clinical cases in whom reexploration and revision of the median nerve repair was carried out.
