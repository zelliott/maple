The benign osteoblastoma is rarely seen as a tumor of the facial bone in infancy or early childhood. Only five cases with nasal involvement have been reported in the literature. The authors present a case of osteoblastoma of the nasal cavity, the nasal bone, the ethmoid sinus, and the anterior cranial base. This 3-year-old girl presented with a tumor surrounding the left medial canthus. Imaging studies, including x-ray films, computerized tomography scans, magnetic resonance images, a (99m)Tc-scintigram, and angiograms, confirmed the location of the tumor. A biopsy specimen of tumor was obtained intranasally and the pathological diagnosis was an osteoblastic tumor suggestive of osteoblastoma. Although the tumor margin was well defined on the radiological images, it was difficult to determine the exact margin during the operation. Therefore, it is important to show how to excise the tumor completely under direct view. With the use of a "dismasking flap," it was possible to resect the benign osteoblastoma completely from the nasal cavity, even though it extended into the orbit, the maxilla, and the anterior cranial base.
