We report a case of traumatic duodenal hematoma. The patient's age (2.5 y.) and the absence of evidence of trauma when the symptoms began led to perform plain films of the abdomen, upper GI series, US, CT, and MR. This excess of imaging modalities emphasize the diagnostic value of plain X Rays of the abdomen and opacification of the duodenum.
