Changes of functional connectivity network of human V5 in different brain activity was investigated by combining spatial independent component analysis with temporal correlation. First, V5 was localized by performing spatial independent component analysis on the data from block design visual motion runs; then low frequency correlations between V5 and other regions were computed in two steady states (resting state and the state with continuous visual motion stimulus) to detect the functional connectivity networks. The results of experiment indicated: The functional connectivity network of V5 was more extensive and was consistent with the known anatomical connectivity during rest; when subjects were viewing motion, the network was limited in the visual cortex, suggesting that V5 was acting in concert with a network specific to the visual motion processing task.
