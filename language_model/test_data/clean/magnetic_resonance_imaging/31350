Fat embolism syndrome is associated with respiratory failure, hypoxia, petechial rash, pyrexia and altered mental state. Signs and symptoms usually begin within 12-72 h after trauma. The pathophysiology, differential diagnosis and therapeutic options of fat embolism syndrome are described and the case of a 29-year-old motorcyclist with fractures of the lower extremities, coma and respiratory failure 24-36 h after an accident is reported. Based on the clinical signs and course, fat embolism syndrome was suspected which was substantiated by ophthalmic fundoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging of the head.
