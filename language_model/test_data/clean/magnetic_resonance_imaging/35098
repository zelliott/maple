The purpose of this study was to determine cerebral metabolic profile changes in response to electric stimulation to the right dorsal hippocampus (HPC) for the establishment of an epileptic rat model. Electroencephalogram measurements and behavioral results indicated that the experimental rats were in an early stage of epilepsy. Metabolites were determined by high-resolution magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS NMR) spectroscopy of the following intact brain tissue: bilateral hippocampi, entorhinal cortices (ECs), and temporal lobes (TLs). The NMR data was statistically analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). Results demonstrated that metabolic profiles were significantly different between the experimental and sham rats in the bilateral hippocampi and the ipsilateral EC. Significant increases in total creatine in the ipsilateral HPC and alanine in the ipsilateral TL were measured (p<0.05). Some metabolite levels were disturbed in the bilateral HPC-EC loops. In the sham group, glutamate and choline concentrations were significantly higher or lower in the ipsilateral EC than bilateral hippocampi, respectively (p<0.01). However, such differences were not observed in the experimental group. In addition, N-acetylaspartate levels in the experimental group were significantly less in the ipsilateral HPC than in bilateral ECs (p<0.05). The level of myo-inositol in the ipsilateral EC significantly increased in the experimental group, compared to the contralateral EC (p<0.05). These results may provide metabolic information about temporal lobe structures to provide more knowledge about epileptic abnormalities at the early stage.
