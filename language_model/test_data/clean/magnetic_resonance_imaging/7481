Hydatid diseases of the pelvic bone are rare, generally incurable, and have high rates of recurrence.

We report nine cases of osseous hydatidosis involving the pelvis. Patients were treated through different surgical options, including simple debridement, bone cement filling with or without internal fixation, reconstruction using a pedicle screw-rod system, and hemipelvic replantation after liquid nitrogen devitalization combined with femoral prosthesis replacement. The therapy was completed by medical treatment or radiotherapy.

The average follow-up was 7.3 years (range 2-19 years). Whilst five patients were symptom-free at the last follow-up, the remaining patients suffered from hip pain or productive sinuses.

Patients must be treated at the early stages of the disease. Total exeresis and individual reconstruction is necessary when osseous and soft tissue involvement is not extensive. Internal fixation should not be used when surgical eradication is uncertain.
