The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with various extrahepatic manifestations, being the Central Nervous System (CNS) rarely involved.

We report a case of a 54 year-old black man with arterial hypertension who presented with progressively worsening headaches, apathy, somnolence and left hemiparesis. Brain MRI showed an acute ischemic lesion in the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and an old ischemic infarct in the right ACA territory. Brain MRI with gadolinium revealed mural thickening and contrast enhancement of the A1 and A2 segments of the ACAs, of the middle and distal basilar artery and of the P1 segment of the left posterior cerebral artery, suggesting active vasculitis. Digital angiography confirmed those irregularities and stenosis. Laboratory evaluation revealed ESR (73 mm/h), transaminase elevation, elevated HCV viral load genotype 2, positive IGRA, negative cryoglobulins, CSF protein elevation with oligoclonal bands (mirror pattern) and no pleocytosis; investigation excluded other infectious causes. Pegylated interferon alpha-2a and ribavirin, corticotherapy and tuberculosis prophylaxis were started with clinical and imagiological improvement.

The typical inflammation signs of the vascular wall demonstrated by the gadolinium-enhanced MRI strengthened the hypothesis of CNS vasculitis. The association with HCV infection is rare but should be investigated once specific therapeutic is required.
