Familial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain are rare. We present two sisters with the same parents who harbored AVMs that were successfully treated.

The elder sister presented with a unilateral migrainous type of headache overlying the right parietal area. The younger one suffered from exercise-induced headaches. Both were neurologically intact. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain and cerebral angiography delineated the lesions. Both sisters underwent endovascular embolization followed by surgical resection.

Postoperatively, aside from a left inferior quadrantanopsia in the elder sister, both were neurologically intact.

We report the rare occurrence of familial AVMs in two siblings and review the literature of 14 reports. No genetic predisposition was found.
