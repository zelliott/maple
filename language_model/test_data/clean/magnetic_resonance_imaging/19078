Brain malformations are important and frequent epilepsy reason in children and adolescents. During the last six years in neurological department of Pediatrics Clinic in Katowice were treated 106 children with brain malformations demonstrated in magnetic resonanse imaging. The main clinical symptoms in these patients were following: mental retardation, epilepsy, abnormalities in neurological examinations, dysmorphic features. Epilepsy were observed in above 3/4 of patients (84 children). In most of them there was intractable epilepsy (55 children). The aim of study was evaluation of selected factors in prognosis of epilepsy intractibility. The children with brain malformations and epilepsy were divided into two groups: with intractable epilepsy and with good response for pharmacotherapy. The type of malformation, the pre- i perinatal history, an age at which the first seizures appeared, abnormalities in neurological examination and IQ were compared in both groups. The differences weren't significant statistically apart two data. Normal pre- and perinatal history and early manifestation of seizures (during the first half of life) were confirmed significant statistically more often in group of patients with intractable epilepsy. There was limited value of most of the analysed parameters in prognosis of epilepsy intractibility. Further accumulating of data and increasing of number of the patients group with different types of malformations as well as progress in diagnostics, particularly molecular genetics, may be helpful in correct prognosis.
