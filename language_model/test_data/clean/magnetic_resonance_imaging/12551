Liver fibrosis is the final common pathway for almost all causes of chronic liver injury. Liver fibrosis is now known to be a dynamic process having significant potential for resolution. Therefore, fibrosis prediction is an essential part of the assessment and management of patients with chronic liver disease. As such, there is strong demand for reliable liver biomarkers that provide insight into disease etiology, diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis in lieu of more invasive approaches such as liver biopsy. Current diagnostic strategies range from use of serum biomarkers to more advanced imaging techniques including transient elastography and magnetic resonance imaging. In addition to these modalities, there are other approaches including the use of novel, but yet to be validated, biomarkers. In this chapter, we discuss the biomarkers of liver fibrosis including the use of invasive and noninvasive biomarkers and disease-specific biomarkers in various chronic liver diseases.
