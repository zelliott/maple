The clinical, biochemical and magnetic resonance imaging findings of two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis are reported. This is a rare hereditary disease. Early recognition of this entity is important in view of the existing treatment possibilities. Magnetic resonance imaging findings typically include a bilateral and almost symmetrical increase of the signal intensity on the T2-weighted images in the cerebellar and periventricular cerebral white matter, the basal ganglia, the dentate nuclei and the brainstem as well as cerebellar and cerebral atrophy.
