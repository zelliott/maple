A 16-year-old male patient presented with a 3-year history of an enlarging right upper eyelid mass. His condition did not improve, and he complained of double vision on leftward gaze. A fixed, nontender, firm subcutaneous mass was clinically noted, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a partially cystic tumor in the right intratemporal and pterygopalatine fossae, which extended into the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure. Mass effects of the tumor and statistical analysis allowed for easy preoperative diagnosis. The tumor was easily removed without any complications by the combined use of coronal incision and lateral orbitotomy. This approach is useful for resection of lateral orbital tumors, including dumbbell-shaped tumors extending intraorbitally.
