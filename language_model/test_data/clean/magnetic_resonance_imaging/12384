Two cases of epithelioid angiomyolipoma of the kidney are reported. A 62-year-old female with incidental left renal tumor underwent laparoscopic leftpartial nephrectomy under a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. A pathological examination revealed epithelioid angiomyolipoma. The second case was that of a 35-year-old female with back pain. A laparoscopic right nephrectomy revealed epithelioid angiomyolipoma. This recently identified variant of angiomyolipoma is sometimes associated with aggressive clinical behavior including local recurrence and metastasis.
