This case describes a patient who presented with chronic low back pain which developed over the course of 1 year. Imaging revealed a 1.1-cm cystic lesion at the L4-L5 vertebral level posterior to the intervertebral disk. Following both magnetic resonance and computed tomography imaging, diagnosis of intervertebral disk cyst was confirmed by both imaging modalities. A computed tomography-guided aspiration of the lesion was performed, and the patient was given a course of steroid injections with complete resolution of the lesion.
