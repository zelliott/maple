Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy remains a major cause of chronic disability in childhood. Early diagnosis and prognosis are necessary for the clinician to adapt the treatment. However, there is yet no reliable test to predict the patient's evolution.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the predictive value of a personal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scoring system and of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

We included 26 term newborns in condition of neonatal brain suffering. MR examination was performed during the first week of life for all patients and MRI and MRS data were collected. Standardised follow-up visits were made for all patients. Finally, prognostic value of the different criteria was evaluated with statistical tests.

Our MRI scoring system proved to be linked to prognosis. A high MRI score, abnormal signal in the internal capsule, white matter or basal ganglia abnormalities with diffusion imaging were associated with unfavourable outcome. These results confirmed the data of the literature concerning the MRI predictive value. Our study also confirmed prognostic interest of MR: particularly, ratios using lactate were significantly linked to prognosis in our study. Specificity of the elevation of these ratios was interesting but sensibility was less optimal.

We suggest using our MRI scoring system which associates standard MRI and diffusion imaging, which is significantly related to outcome. We confirm the prognostic value of MRS in this pathological situation. MR with diffusion sequence and spectroscopy, performed three to four days after birth appears to be an essential tool to manage these patients.
