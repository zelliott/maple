The aim of this study was to review 4 patients with encephalomyeloradiculoneuropathy (EMRN) and assess for autoantibodies against neutral glycolipids.

We studied the progression of clinical, radiologic, neurophysiologic, and CSF findings, as well as anti-neutral glycolipid antibodies in sera.

All patients developed acute or subacute motor weakness and impaired consciousness. Their CSF showed pleocytosis and high immunoglobulin G concentrations. MRI revealed lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Neurophysiologic examinations indicated dysfunction of the spinal cord, nerve roots, and peripheral nerves. Steroid pulsed immunotherapy and/or high dose of IV immunoglobulin replacement therapy resulted in clear and often dramatic clinical improvements. Reactivity to anti-neutral glycolipid antibodies was positive in all patients with acute EMRN but not in the recovery phase. Forty-seven age-matched patients with other neurologic disorders and 28 age-matched healthy volunteers tested negative for reactivity to anti-neutral glycolipid antibodies.

The resolution of radiologic and neurologic abnormalities and altered autoantibody titers against neutral glycolipids after immunotherapy suggest that EMRN is caused by an immune-mediated mechanism. These autoantibodies may be useful biomarkers for EMRN.
