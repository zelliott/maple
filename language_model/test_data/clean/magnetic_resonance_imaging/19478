Knowledge of precise anatomic landmarks and relationships of the distal femur can be helpful in knee surgery, especially primary and revision total knee arthroplasty. We analyzed 104 consecutive routine knee magnetic resonance imaging studies to define useful landmarks and relationships. The epicondyles are described, and the relationship of the epicondyles to the joint line is defined in multiple planes. Some significant gender differences were noted. The distance from the epicondyles to the joint line correlates with the transepicondylar width of the distal femur. This information can be helpful in determining appropriate joint line position intraoperatively. The posterior condylar angle averaged 3.11 degrees for all patients, and a tendency for the posterior condylar angle to increase with age was noted, but further study of this tendency is needed.
