Hyperperfusion syndrome, previously known as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), is a clinico- radiological entity with characteristic features on neuro-imaging. It is believed to be caused by vasogenic oedema, predominantly in the posterior cerebral hemispheres. We report the case of an elderly man who presented with convulsions and was diagnosed to have PRES due to hypertension.
