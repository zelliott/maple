Advances in abdominal imaging technology in the past 20 years and their widespread application have improved the detection of benign liver tumours. The three most common tumours of this type are hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia and haemangioma. Besides these three, other benign tumours of the liver are less important because of their rarity. Diversity of and technical advances in imaging technology make the choice of diagnostic approach difficult. Ideally, a test should be non-invasive, low-risk and commonly available, with high specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, we use sonography as a screening method and MRI as a secondary diagnostic procedure. The value of diagnostic procedures is discussed. Therapy and outcome of each tumour is outlined.
