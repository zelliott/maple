MRI in patients with cervical myelopathy or radiculopathy usually includes T(1) weighted (T(1)W) and T(2) weighted (T(2)W) images. We prospectively examined a hypothesis that T(2)W alone is sufficient to diagnose the cause of cervical myelopathy and radiculopathy and that the T(1)W sagittal images do not provide additional useful information. 30 patients presenting with a history of cervical radiculopathy with or without myelopathy were prospectively assessed by MRI. Those with a history suggestive of intrinsic primary cord disease or who had previously had surgery were excluded. Two neuroradiologists, blinded to the clinical information, separately viewed the sagittal and axial T(2)W images alone, and at a later time, the full set of T(1)W and T(2)W images. Image quality, location and severity of disease and confidence of diagnosis at each level were scored on 4- or 5-point scales. The T(1) sequences did not demonstrate any significant lesions not already seen on the T(2)W images alone. The T(1)W sequence may safely be omitted in patients with radiculopathy.
