A 14-year-old male presented with a one week history of weakness, lightheadedness and vomiting. Bilateral pleural effusions were evident on chest radiography; electrocardiogram revealed decreased voltages. Echocardiogram, abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass in an hepatic vein and the inferior vena cava extending up to and filling the right atrium. Under deep hypothermia and extracorporeal circulation the mass was removed en bloc. It originated from the hepatic vein. Pathology revealed a smooth muscle tumour intermediate between benign and malignant (atypical leiomyoma). This is the first reported pediatric primary leiomyoma of the hepatic vein. It caused the Budd-Chiari syndrome, a rare pediatric entity.
