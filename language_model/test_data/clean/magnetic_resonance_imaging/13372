Thirty-two hypertensive subjects with diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg were treated with ramipril over a period of 3 months. To determine the effective decrease of blood pressure and for reliable and reproducible demonstration of regression of myocardial hypertrophy during ramipril treatment, we performed parallel measurements with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography. Measurements were carried out before treatment, 4 h after the first dose, and after 14 days and 3 months of treatment. MRI slices showed a significant decrease of interventricular septal thickness from 19.57 to 15.20 mm, whereas echocardiography demonstrated an equivalent decrease from 18.78 to 14.57 mm. At each measuring point, quantification of wall thickness was performed three times and the means were calculated. The septum and the posterior wall of the left ventricle were also measured at three different points. The values were obtained with negligible scatter and the changes with ramipril treatment were highly significant (p less than 0.001). A concomitant decrease of blood pressure was also observed. The therapeutic aim to reduce diastolic blood pressures below 90 mm Hg was achieved in all patients. In addition to the significant reduction in blood pressure, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril caused a significant regression of pathologic left ventricular hypertrophy demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography.
