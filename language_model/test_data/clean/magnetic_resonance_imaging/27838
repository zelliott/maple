Acute inflammatory polyneuropathy is an inflammatory demyelinating disease triggered by an autoimmune mechanism. It follows an infection or an immunisation after a free interval of 2-30 days. We report a case of a 14-year-old boy who develops an acute rapidly progressive paraplegia, urine incontinence and positive Lasegue a week after a characteristic chickenpox rash. Spinal MRI showed diffuse thickening and leptomeningeal enhancement of cauda equina nerve roots. Intravenous immunoglobulins were given and yielded a dramatic clinical and radiological improvement. The patient was discharged without any clinical problems 1&emsp14;month after the onset of symptoms. We performed a review of the literature, discussing the different forms of varicella-zoster virus-related central and peripheral nervous system complications and management strategies for acute postinfectious encephalomyelitis/radiculitis.
