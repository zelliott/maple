To study the feasibility of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based virtual endoscopy of the labyrinth to assess subtle inner ear pathology.

A retrospective case review of patient with known inner ear pathology to determine the feasibility and clinical value of MRI-based virtual labyrinthoscopy.

Tertiary referral center.

Ten patients with symptoms of sensorineural hearing loss or vertigo who underwent high-resolution MRI between 1996 and 1999.

Diagnostic image modality with three-dimensional (3-D) postprocessing to assess inner ear pathology.

To evaluate how 3-D rendering with virtual labyrinthoscopy can depict subtle labyrinthine pathology.

Cases with typical 3-D models and virtual labyrinthoscopic views are presented to illustrate this new image processing approach.

The virtual endoscopic view of the labyrinth revealed subtle inner ear pathology. This 3-D postprocessing technique is able to render inner surface changes of tiny structures within the inner ear. It can be performed within a very short time using dedicated hybrid rendering techniques. It allows visualization of pathology in a comprehensive way for clinicians and is able to add 3-D information for troubleshooting in doubtful two-dimensional findings. We suggest the term virtual labyrinthoscopy for virtual intraluminal visualization of the labyrinth.
