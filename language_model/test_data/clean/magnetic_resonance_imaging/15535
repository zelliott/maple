To evaluate the relationship between cerebral T2 hyperintensity on MRI and visual suppression of vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in elderly patients with dysequilibrium symptoms.

Eighty-nine elderly patients with no MRI abnormalities in the infratentorial region aged 60-89 years complaining dysequilibrium symptoms were studied. Cases with whom a definitive diagnosis of peripheral or central disease could be established were not included. T2 hyperintense lesions in the cerebrum: basal ganglia, subcortical white matter and periventricular white matter were evaluated. VOR in darkness and fixation-suppressed VOR using pseudo-sinusoidal rotation stimuli were recorded to calculate visual suppression rate. Correlation between visual suppression rate and semi-quantitative scores for severity of T2 hyperintensity in the cerebrum was investigated.

Patients with T2 hyperintensity in the cerebrum exhibited significantly lower visual suppression rate than those without lesions in the cerebrum. Multiple regression analysis showed that visual suppression rate was significantly and negatively correlated with severity of lesions in the basal ganglia, but not with patient age, severity of subcortical white matter lesions, or that of periventricular white matter lesions.

In elderly patients with dizziness with a non-specific history and otoneurological findings, fixation suppression of vestibular nystagmus was associated with T2 hyperintensities in the basal ganglia.
