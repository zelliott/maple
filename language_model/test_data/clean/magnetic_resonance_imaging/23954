A 25-year-old woman presented with recurrent medulloblastoma. She had been diagnosed with cerebellar medulloblastoma and treated for it at the age of 5 years. The new tumor was partially resected and chemotherapy was begun. However, a disseminated tumor of the spine was discovered and, despite radiotherapy, the patient became comatose and died. Histological examination of the tumor specimen showed characteristics similar to those of the first tumor. Late recurrence of medulloblastoma is rare, and a latency period of 19 years is the longest reported. This case violates Collins' rule and exceeds other proposed periods of risk. Extension of the period of follow-up in patients with medulloblastoma is advocated.
