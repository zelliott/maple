We have developed methods for rapidly generating 3d dermatologic datasets for use in education, training simulations and procedure planning. By compositing local surface features of cutaneous wounds onto patient images and 3d models, one can flexibly generate large patient variability from a small initial 3d library. The wound database is generated from clinically captured photographic images. The wound image is extracted from the image of the surrounding tissue. The 3d anatomy database is generated from MRI scans and from multiple photographic views. Extracted wound images can be moved rotated and scaled and blended in the final composite.
