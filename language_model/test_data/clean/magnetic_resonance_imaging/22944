A case of psammoma body rich gliofibroma is reported. Computed tomography (CT) showed a high-density mass without contrast enhancement in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) demonstrated a mass with a mixture of high- and iso-intensity regions without meningeal attachment on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Pathological examinations revealed a biphasic pattern consisting of tumor cells in sparce cellularity and dense fibrous connective tissue. Numerous psammoma bodies of uniform size were found in the stroma. The tumor cells expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein and S-100, but not p53, vimentin and EMA. This is the first report describing a case of psammomatous gliofibroma.
