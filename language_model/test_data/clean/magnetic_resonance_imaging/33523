A Japanese boy aged 2 years 11 months with late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from his human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical but mixed lymphocyte culture reactive father. Chimerism and increased arylsulfatase A activities of leukocytes had been observed with retarded progression of neurological deterioration during the first 3 months post-BMT. Graft rejection gradually occurred and donor cells were almost completely eliminated from the patient at 1 year after BMT. The process of neurodegeneration progressed clinically and neuroradiologically. Three possible reasons for the pathogenesis of graft rejection are: (i) T cell depletion of donor marrow cells as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis; (ii) a slightly weak conditioning regimen: and (iii) a small number of marrow cells transplanted. It is stressed that as BMT is still a preliminary therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy indications, conditioning, and GVHD prophylaxis for BMT should be considered individually.
