The present review has been compiled to highlight the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS) for the investigation of cerebral ischemia in the animal experimental field of basic research. We have focused on stroke investigations analyzing the pathomechanisms of the disease evolution and on new advances in both nuclear MR (NMR) methodology or genetic engineering of transgenic animals for the study of complex molecular relationships and causes of the disease. Furthermore, we have tried to include metabolic and genetic aspects, as well as the application of functional imaging, for the investigation of the disturbance or restitution of functional brain activation under pathological conditions as relates to controlled animal experiments.
