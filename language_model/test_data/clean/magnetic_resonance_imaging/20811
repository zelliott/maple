Ocular adnexal lymphomas are rare and T cell variants are a minor subset of these lymphomas. We aim to describe a case report which underlines the diagnostic and treatment challenge of this rare pathology.

A 34-year-old gentleman has been shown to have exophthalmos and dysfunction of cranial nerve V andVII unilaterally. Imaging including CT and MRI brain and orbits do not show a CNS component to the disease. It was later identified as an ocular adnexal lymphoma with a central nervous system (CNS) component diagnosed via lumbar puncture.

We highlight the importance of excluding ocular adnexal lymphoma and difficulty of management of the disease where it presents as a masquerade syndrome for orbital cellulitis.
