A 46-year-old male patient was found unconscious in his room. There were remnants of burned-out charcoal briquettes. On arrival to our ER, the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) hemoglobin was detected in 16.2%, and he was diagnosed with CO poisoning based on both his circumstantial evidence and laboratory results. Brain CT obtained on Day 1 revealed low density area in the basal part of the left temporal lobe, and T2-weighted MR images of the brain on Day 8 showed hyperintensity in the same region. MR images on Day 15 showed findings caused by white matter encephalopathy, and signal intensity in the left temporal lobe was decreased. To our best knowledge, it is very rare to see abnormal signal changes in the temporal lobe on radiological imaging of the patients who is suspected CO poisoning in acute phase because it has been reported that white matter encephalopathy after CO poisoning is commonly seen in delayed timing.
