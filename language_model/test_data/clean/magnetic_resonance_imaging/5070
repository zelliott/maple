Electron paramagnetic resonance imaging (EPRI) can be used to noninvasively and quantitatively obtain three-dimensional maps of tumor pO₂. The paramagnetic tracer triarylmethyl (TAM), a substituted trityl radical moiety, is not toxic to animals and provides narrow isotropic spectra, which is ideal for in vivo EPR imaging experiments. From the oxygen-induced spectral broadening of TAM, pO₂ maps can be derived using EPRI. The instrumentation consists of an EPRI spectrometer and 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system both operating at a common radiofrequency of 300 MHz. Anatomic images obtained by MRI can be overlaid with pO₂ maps obtained from EPRI. With imaging times of less than 3 min, it was possible to monitor the dynamics of oxygen changes in tumor and distinguish chronically hypoxic regions from acutely hypoxic regions. In this article, the principles of pO₂ imaging with EPR and some relevant examples of tumor imaging are reviewed.
