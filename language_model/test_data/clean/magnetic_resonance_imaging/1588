We used electroencephalographic (EEG) dipole analysis to investigate the generators of spikes with and without myoclonic jerks in a 12-year-old patient with epilepsia partialis continua secondary to left parietal cortical dysplasia. We recorded EEG and right wrist extensor electromyography (EMG) and collected 42 spikes with jerks (jerking spikes) and 42 spikes without jerks (nonjerking spikes). We applied a single moving dipole model to the individual and averaged spikes. Dipoles at the negative peak of individual jerking and nonjerking spikes were localized in the dysplastic area. At the onset of the averaged jerking spike that preceded the EMG discharges by 20 ms, the dipole was in the motor cortex, whereas for the averaged nonjerking spike, the dipole was in the sensory cortex. The dipole moment at averaged jerking spike onset was twice that of the averaged nonjerking spike. Electroencephalographic dipole analysis of averaged spikes differentiated the generator of jerking and nonjerking spikes in epilepsia partialis continua. Individual dipoles demonstrated the area of epileptogenic cortical dysplasia.
