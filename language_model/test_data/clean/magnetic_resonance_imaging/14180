Six patients presented with acute, simultaneous, bilateral optic neuritis. Five of the six patients admitted to a recent history of a brief upper respiratory or gastrointestinal illness, presumably viral in nature. Visual acuity was severely reduced in all patients. Five of the six patients also demonstrated marked neurologic deficits, including seizure activity and cerebellar dysfunction. Three patients demonstrated enhancing intracranial lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) consistent with demyelinative plaques, whereas lumbar puncture was abnormal in three patients. HLA tissue typing was performed on five of the six patients. All patients were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, followed by a 2-month tapering course of oral prednisone. Each patient experienced a rapid and nearly complete recovery of vision during treatment.
