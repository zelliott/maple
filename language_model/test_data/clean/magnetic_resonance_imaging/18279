Although magnetic resonance imaging is currently only employed to solve diagnostic problems in a few selected patients, the special features of the technique such as its inherent three-dimensional capabilities and the prospect of angiographic noninvasive imaging suggest that this technique will become more important with future technical improvements. This overview summarizes the present status of magnetic resonance imaging in the depiction of coronary arteries and bypass grafts, the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia, the depiction of chronic myocardial infarcts including the detection of residual viable myocardium, and the diagnosis of complications associated with myocardial infarction.
