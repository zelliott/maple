Neuromuscular hamartoma (also referred to as neuromuscular choristoma or benign triton tumour) has not previously been described in the radiological literature. It is a rare benign lesion composed of mature elements of striated muscle and neural tissue. We report a case of neuromuscular hamartoma involving the skull base, nasopharynx, orbit and maxilla in a 2.5-year-old child who presented with facial swelling. The CT and MRI appearances of this unusual soft-tissue tumour are emphasized, together with a discussion of the pathological findings, differential diagnosis and review of the literature.
