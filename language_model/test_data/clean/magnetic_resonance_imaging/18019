Acute hemicerebellitis in childhood is an extremely rare unilateral presentation of cerebellitis mimicking a tumour. Its aetiology is unknown, although an inflammatory or postinfectious origin is presumed. Its clinical outcome is generally good and a self-limited evolution, in the absence of specific treatment, is usually expected. MRI findings can be misunderstood leading to erroneous diagnosis and invasive treatments. Clinical improvement and regression of the pathological findings in serial MRI will help differentiate acute hemicerebellitis from a neoplastic process. Surgical procedures should be performed only in case of clinical deterioration. We present a case of pseudotumoral hemicerebellitis in an eight-year-old girl, presenting with severe headache. This paper provides a review on hemicerebellitis and highlights the clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic features and outcome of this entity.
