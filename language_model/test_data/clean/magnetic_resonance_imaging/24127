To assess the correlation between angiographic findings, tumor stage, tumor size, histological type, and the effect of transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI) chemotherapy in patients with uterine cervical cancer.

Thirty-three patients with untreated cervical cancer underwent two cycles of TAI. Changes in angiographic findings and other clinical and imaging data were assessed using the X2 test, multivariate analysis, and the two-sample t-test.

The group with parametric involvement included more patients with hypervascular tumors (21/24) than the group with no parametric involvement (0/5) (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed no correlation between initial tumor size, histology, or angiographic pattern and the effect of TAI.

The angiographic patterns seen in cervical cancer correlated with tumor stage. However, neither angiographic findings nor other clinical features predicted the effect of TAI.
