A 14-year-old girl presented with dysphagia and weight loss. Barium swallow, computed tomography, and endoscopy showed a polypoid intraluminal mass in the cervical esophagus. The tumor was locally resected and postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy were administered. Histological examination of the surgical specimen established a diagnosis of synovial sarcoma. The patient remains free of discernible disease 30 months after surgery. Esophageal sarcomas are rare tumors. This appears to be the second reported case of esophageal synovial sarcoma in a child.
