Encephalitis and focal neurologic deficits can occur during the acute phase of schistosomiasis. We report two cases in which cerebral imaging showed cerebral vasculitis located in arterial junctional territories. These neurologic complications may be caused by eosinophil-mediated toxicity. Immediate treatment should consist of corticosteroids rather than specific antischistosomal drugs, which may aggravate the disorders.
