To assess the tissue iron concentration of the left ventricle (LV) using a multislice, multiecho T2* MR technique and a segmental analysis.

T2* multiecho MRI was performed in 53 thalassemia major patients. Three short-axis views of the LV were obtained and analyzed with custom-written software. The myocardium was automatically segmented into 12 segments. The T2* value on each segment as well as the global T2* value were calculated. Cine dynamic images were also obtained to evaluate biventricular function parameters by quantitative analysis.

For the T2* global value, the coefficient of variation (CoV) for intra-/interobserver and interstudy reproducibility was 3.9% (r = 0.98), 5.5% (r = 0.98), and 4.7% (r = 0.99) respectively. Three groups were identified based on analysis of myocardial T2*: homogeneous (21%), heterogeneous (38%), and no myocardial iron overload (41%). The mean serum ferritin, liver iron concentration, and urinary iron excretion were significantly different among the groups. We did not find significant differences among groups in biventricular function. There was a correlation between the global T2* value and the T2* value in the mid-ventricular septum (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001).

Multislice multiecho T2* MRI provides a noninvasive, fast, reproducible means of assessing myocardial iron distribution. The single measurement of mid-septal T2* correlated well with the global T2* value.
