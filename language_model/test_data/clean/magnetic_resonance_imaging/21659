Twelve cases of vertebro-spinal hydatidosis were reviewed, over nine years period, to specify its clinical and histological characters. This localization, although rare, is the most common of the bone hydatidosis (44%). The authors develop the imaging methods contribution in positive and differential diagnosis, and underline the modern methods interest (CT scan, MR imaging) notably in spreading assessment and medical supervision.
