We measured brain activation during the perception of fingerspelled letters, printed letters, and abstract shapes (control condition) in six congenitally, profoundly deaf signers and six normal hearing subjects. Normal hearing subjects showed essentially extrastriate activation in the fingerspelled letters and printed letters conditions whereas deaf subjects showed activation of a broader network in printed letters and fingerspelled conditions, comprising supplementary frontal and posterior areas, and the supramarginal gyrus (Brodmann Area 6). These results suggest that, on one hand, different cerebral areas in deaf and hearing subjects mediate processing of printed letters and, on the other hand, common cerebral areas are activated in deaf signers when they are engaged in processing fingerspelled or printed letters.
