To report synovial cysts associated with cauda equina syndrome in 2 dogs.

Clinical cases.

Two German Shepherd dogs.

After magnetic resonance imaging detection, cysts were surgically removed via dorsal laminectomy.

Six and 8 months after surgery, both dogs were free of clinical signs and no pain was elicited on lumbosacral joint manipulation.

Although described in dogs, cysts at the lumbosacral joint might cause compression of the cauda equina nerve roots. Radical excision of the cyst capsule can result in resolution of clinical signs.

Synovial cysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dogs with cauda equina compression syndrome when lumbosacral degenerative joint disease is present.
