Sheehan's syndrome, though rare, is still one of the commonest causes of hypopituitarism in developing countries like ours. The clinical presentation is variable with abrupt or insidiously developing pituitary insufficiency after a heavy intrapartum or postpartum haemorrhage. We present an elderly lady with this syndrome who had slowly progressive panhypopituitarism 24 years after a severe haemorrhage associated with the delivery of triplets.
