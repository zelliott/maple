To report a porencephalic cyst in a child with large optic disc cup but normal-sized discs.

Case report with figures.

Clinical findings of a patient with porencephaly presenting with large cups in normal-sized optic discs are discussed.

Optic disc morphology is not a reliable indicator of the timing of ischemic brain injury. Intracranial pathology should be suspected in children with disc cupping but no other features of glaucoma.
