Magnetic resonance imaging findings of median nerve hamartoma are presented in three patients with palpable wrist masses and median neuropathy. Fat-suppressed T1-weighted images demonstrated adipose tissue separating the neural and fibrous tissue bundles in two of three patients, which results in the distinctive appearance of these tumors on magnetic resonance imaging. Fibrous tissue appeared as enhancing longitudinal bundles within the tumor on gadolinium enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted images.
