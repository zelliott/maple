Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the visual cortex with an in-plane resolution of 0.4 x 0.4 mm2 was performed using a simple visual stimulus resulting in clear maps of activation. A collapsing filter was used to compare these high-resolution images with low-resolution images collected during the same session. A good correspondence between the high- and low-resolution functional maps was found with respect to the center of localization of activation. However, only 20% of the size of activated areas in the low-resolution experiment was observed at high resolution, which was partly caused by the difference in signal-to-noise ratio. The high-resolution images produce signal changes much higher than the low-resolution images due to reduced partial volume effects. Additionally, the high-resolution functional maps were compared with detailed anatomical and venous information. The activated areas were predominantly observed at venous vessels within the sulci with a diameter on the order of the pixel size.
