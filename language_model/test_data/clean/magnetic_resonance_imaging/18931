The nasopharynx, located just below the central skull base, is a difficult area to evaluate clinically. Endoscopic examination provides useful information but cannot delineate submucosal disease. Benign lesions of the nasopharynx are relatively uncommon. They include Thornwaldt cyst, juvenile angiofibroma, haemangioma, haemangiopericytoma, Kimura's disease, branchial cleft cyst, oncocytoma, amyloidoma, and non-ossifying fibromyxoid tumours. The most common malignant lesions are carcinomas and lymphomas. Other malignant neoplasms such as adenocystic carcinomas are rarely seen. The purpose of the present pictorial review is to highlight the salient normal anatomy of the nasopharynx and the spectrum of pathological anatomy.
