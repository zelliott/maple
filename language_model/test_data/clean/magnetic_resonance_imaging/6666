Three cases of cerebral deep venous thrombosis (CDVT) were reported with review of the literature. A 47-year-old female had taken estrogen-derived drug. The other two patients had no specific past history. On MRI, T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed high signal intensity lesions at basal ganglia and thalamus. Diffusion-weighted image (DWI) detected only slightly high signal spots but apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images indicated mild increases of the ADC value. MR venogram and cerebral angiogram revealed obliteration of internal cerebral veins, great vein of Galen, and straight sinus. The two severely impaired patients received systemic heparinization, in which one patient preceded percutaneous transvenous angioplasty of straight sinus. One patient suffered cognitive disturbance and the other two patients fully recovered from their illness. The high signal intensity lesions on both T2-weighted image and FLAIR image disappeared and deep cerebral veins reappeared. The diagnosis of CDVT based on clinical symptoms is not simple but modern technology of MRI is very useful for diagnosis of CDVT. Once CDVT is detected, appropriate therapy should be started as soon as possible to avoid devastating outcome.
