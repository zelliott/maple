Canine intranasal neoplasia is commonly evaluated using computed tomography to indicate the diagnosis, to determine disease extent, to guide histological sampling location and to plan treatment. With the expanding use of magnetic resonance imaging in veterinary medicine, this modality has been recently applied for the same purpose. The aim of this study was to compare the features of canine intranasal neoplasia using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

Twenty-one dogs with confirmed intranasal neoplasia underwent both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The images were reviewed retrospectively for the bony and soft tissue features of intranasal neoplasia.

Overall computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging performed very similarly. However, lysis of bones bordering the nasal cavity and mucosal thickening was found on computed tomography images more often than on magnetic resonance images. Small amounts of fluid in the nasal cavity were more often seen on magnetic resonance images. However, fluid in the frontal sinuses was seen equally well with both modalities.

We conclude that computed tomography is satisfactory for evaluation of canine intranasal neoplasia, and no clinically relevant benefit is gained using magnetic resonance imaging for intranasal neoplasia without extent into the cranial cavity.
