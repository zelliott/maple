Human visual cortex shows retinotopic organization during both perception and attention, but whether this remains true for visual short-term memory (VSTM) is uncertain. In 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, we separated retinotopic activation during perception, attention, and VSTM maintenance. The 2 experiments differed in whether spatial encoding of the VSTM stimuli and prospective attention to the locations of the remembered items was encouraged or discouraged. Using multivoxel pattern analysis to extract a measure of spatial coding in early visual cortex, we saw sensory and attentional retinotopic coding in both experiments. However, significant spatial coding during memory maintenance was only seen where a spatial strategy was encouraged. Furthermore, individual differences in attentional spatial coding predicted performance in both experiments, while individual differences in maintenance spatial coding predicted performance in neither. We conclude that retinotopic coding in the early visual cortex during VSTM maintenance is not obligatory, that attentional processes during stimulus perception modulate memory performance, and that different attentional strategies are used depending on the task in hand.
