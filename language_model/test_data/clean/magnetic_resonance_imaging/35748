The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in supporting the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in 24 South African-born white patients were studied. MRI confirmed the diagnosis in 87.5% of cases. It appears that MRI is useful in strengthening the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in patients with clinically established disease. This study supports the validity of the clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in South African patients and stresses the need for re-evaluation of the incidence and prevalence of multiple sclerosis in this country.
