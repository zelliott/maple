A 76-year-old woman with a longstanding history of right elbow swelling and recurrent joint effusion presented for consultation. There was no history of trauma and conventional radiographs were negative. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging were performed and showed a frond-like fatty synovial mass and joint effusion. Arthrotomy disclosed a lipoma arborescens of the right elbow.
