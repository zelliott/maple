Erectile dysfunction has been successfully treated with penile prosthesis implantation for over 50 years. Ferromagnetic implants or devices may create a potentially hazardous or painful situation during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A modern catalog of the MRI compatibility of penile prostheses is not available.

Evaluate the safety profile of implanted, penile prostheses during MRI.

Review available in vitro safety data and reported patient complications experienced during MRI with a penile prosthesis in place.

A search of PubMedâ„¢ for articles documenting a penile prosthesis present during MRI was performed. Radiology texts and product information from manufacturers' producing a penile prosthesis were reviewed. Direct discussion with product manufacturers was also performed to obtain additional safety and compatibility information.

Nine clinical articles noted the presence of a penile prosthesis at the time of magnetic resonance imaging. No articles documented a complication from MRI of a man with a penile prosthesis. A single patient with an unnamed malleable prosthesis was noted to have twisting of the device during MRI which did not result in discomfort or malfunction of the device. In vitro studies support the safety of most prostheses during MRI.

The available data suggests there is little risk for most patients with a penile prosthesis who undergo MRI. Notable exceptions include Dacomed's Omniphase and Duraphase device and the MRI-conditional Spectra device manufactured by AMS. Current manufacturers of penile implants provide wallet cards and medical letters to support safety when undergoing an MRI. Prior prosthesis implantation should not preclude patients from having an MRI.
