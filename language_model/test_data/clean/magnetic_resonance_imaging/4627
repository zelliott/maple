Aneurysms clips made of a titanium alloy (TiAl6V4) were used in clinical practice for the first time. The design of the clips is identical to the routinely used Yasargil series. In 30 patients, 38 symptomatic and asymptomatic aneurysms were fixed with 45 clips. Metallurgical advantages of the new alloy are better biocompatibility, less magnetic susceptibility, and lower X-ray density. The postoperative imaging results are superior to the conventionally used alloys with respect to artifact reduction in computed tomography, angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging. With a follow-up period of 7 months, a statement on biocompatibility cannot yet be given.
