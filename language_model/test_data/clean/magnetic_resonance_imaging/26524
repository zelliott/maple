A 12-year-old girl had intense abdominal pain that had increased in the past 3 months and was accompanied by weight loss. An ultrasound examination revealed large cystic masses in the abdomen. A computed tomographic scan could not conclusively rule out a malignant condition. The hymen was normal on physical examination, but magnetic resonance imaging confirmed that the abnormalities corresponded to dilated cavities of the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes, with an appearance suggestive of hematometrocolpos. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography was requested concurrently with the magnetic resonance image to assess the metabolic activity of the lesions and to exclude the presence of distant metastases. Large defects without FDG accumulation were noted in the areas corresponding to the cystic masses. Vaginal atresia with hematometrocolpos was confirmed at surgery. This rare case involving F-18 FDG positron emission tomographic imaging in hematometrocolpos illustrates that this diagnosis should be considered in the presence of symmetric hypometabolic masses in the pelvis.
