The purpose of the present study was to clarify the usefulness of the oblique axial scan parallel to the course of the anterior talofibular ligament in magnetic resonance imaging of the anterior talofibular ligament in patients with chronic ankle instability. We evaluated this anterior talofibular ligament view and routine axial magnetic resonance imaging planes of 115 ankles. We diagnosed the grade of the anterior talofibular ligament injury and confirmed full-length views of the anterior talofibular ligament. Associated lesions were also checked. The subjective diagnostic convenience of associated problems was determined. The full-length view of the anterior talofibular ligament was checked in 85 (73.9%) patients in the routine axial view and 112 (97.4%) patients in the anterior talofibular ligament view. The grade of injury increased in the anterior talofibular ligament view in 26Â (22.6%) patients compared with the routine axial view. There were 64 associated injuries. The anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament, posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament, and posterior tibialis tendinitis were more easily diagnosed on the routine axial view than on the anterior talofibular ligament view. An additional anterior talofibular ligament view is useful in the evaluation of the anterior talofibular ligament in patients with chronic ankle instability.
