Clinical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain is typically performed in the standard three orthogonal planes of the magnet, with little regard to head positioning. Multiple sequences with different imaging parameters are performed, and gray-scale images are obtained and displayed separately. The authors have implemented, and currently advocate, the routine acquisition of coregistered transverse images after roll, yaw, and pitch correction to Talairach space. Talairach, anterior commissure (AC)-posterior commissure (PC) referenced, stereotactic space has been widely embraced by the neuroscience community. This standardization should lead to more reproducible and readily interpretable MR examinations. A method is described to obtain direct AC-PC referenced (Talairach space) MR images. Sample protocols are provided. Coregistered T1-weighted, T1-weighted with contrast material administration, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), MR angiography, fractional anisotropy, and functional MR imaging sequences are presented, depicting a wide range of imaging parameters applied to normal brain anatomy in Talairach space. Illustrative examples of pathology are also provided. Color encoding is discussed and exploited to display and integrate multiparameter MR imaging contrast and white-matter-tract direction (anisotropy). The color composites may reduce the number of images needed for review by a factor of three or four and facilitate interpretation.
