There are two major problems for the pituitary adenomas invading the Cavernous Sinus (CS); differentiation of extension and invasion and inability to demonstrate the medial wall via preoperative imaging methods. Two important corridors are defined in endoscopic cavernous sinus approaches; the lateral and medial corridor.

A retrospective analysis was performed in 400 endoscopic transphenoidal approaches and 360 pituitary adenomas underwent endoscopic transphenoidal surgery in our department between September 1997 and December 2010. 48 patients affected by the tumours involving the cavernous sinus were included in this study.

We performed an intraoperative evaluation of cavernous sinus invasion considering visualization of the medial wall defect, intracavernous ICA segments, minor tumour extensions through small focal pit holes of the medial wall of CS or confirming carotid segments of CS by micro-doppler. Cavernous sinus involvement was classified into three types according to the medial and lateral corridor extension of the tumor as 25 isolated medial corridor involvement (Type I), 5 isolated lateral corridor involvement (Type II) and 18 total involvement (Type III).

Our classification depends on fully surgical endoscopic approach supported by neuroimaging techniques and anatomical studies and shows a good predictive value for all cavernous sinus involvement.
