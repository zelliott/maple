To review experience with the imaging features of hamstring injuries.

Imaging findings in 18 male and four female patients with clinically proved hamstring injuries were reviewed. The patients' ages ranged from 13 to 61 years (mean, 26 years). Radiography, conventional tomography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed.

Plain radiographs obtained less than 1 week after injury were normal or showed avulsion of an ischial apophysis. Plain radiographs and conventional tomograms obtained more than 1 week but less than 3 months after injury were confusing, because callus and osteolysis were present. CT helped identify a healing avulsion of an ischial apophysis. MR imaging was helpful no matter how long after the injury it was performed. It provided a means to evaluate muscle, tendon, and bone.

Familiarity with the variable appearance of hamstring injuries over time and with different modalities facilitates accurate characterization.
