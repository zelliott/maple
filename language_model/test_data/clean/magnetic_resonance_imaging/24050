Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a rare brain tumor and typically occurs in the superficial cerebral hemispheres of young subjects. We report a case of PXA in the cerebellum of a 3-month-old infant in view of its unusual location and age. The patient presented with a 1-month history of upward eyeball gazing difficulty. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of occurrence of this neoplasm in the cerebellum of an infant. We report the morphologic and immunophenotypical features, and literature review with regard to the clinicopathologic aspects of a case of unusual PXA.
