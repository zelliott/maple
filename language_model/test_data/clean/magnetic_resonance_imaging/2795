Many modern surgical techniques have been developed to provide exposure or visualization of the surgical field to perform definitive treatment. The actual therapeutic part of surgery is often a small fraction of the procedure. In obtaining exposure, however, morbidity can ensue. This has led to newer techniques that use minimally invasive treatments, thus substantially decreasing overall morbidity and patient costs. By providing physicians with visualization alternatives, MR imaging and computed tomography, when combined with a therapeutic procedure, can reduce the morbidity of surgery.
