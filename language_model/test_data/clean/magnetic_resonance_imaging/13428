Magnetic resonance imaging was performed with a low field strength scanner (0.08 tesla) on 15 bovine eyes into which had been inserted various magnetic and non-magnetic foreign bodies. The precise location of the foreign bodies was determined by dissection. Magnetic resonance imaging was accurate in locating 11 of the 13 non-magnetic foreign bodies in this study. In addition a further five bovine eyes containing 10- to 20-mm long steel needles were scanned and dissected. No ocular damage attributable to movement of the foreign bodies could be seen.
