The feasibility of using the McMaster University in vivo prompt gamma neutron activation analysis system for the detection of gadolinium has been investigated. Phantoms have been developed for the kidney, liver, and the leg muscle. The initial detection limits are determined to be 7.2 ± 0.3 ppm for the kidney, 3.0 ± 0.1 ppm for the liver, and 2.33 ± 0.08 ppm for the lower leg muscle. A few system optimizations have been tested and show significant detection limit reduction from these initial values. The technique is promising and shows feasibility for in vivo studies of gadolinium retention.
