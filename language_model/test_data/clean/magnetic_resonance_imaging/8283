Transverse myelitis is a rare manifestation of hepatitis A virus infection. We report the case of an eleven-year-old girl who presented a progressive flabby paraplegia with sphincter incontinence, superficial hypoesthesia, without deep involvement. Medullar MRI was suggestive of myelitis. Despite the absence of jaundice and hepatic cytolysis, the serology yielded a high rate of anti-hepatitis A immunoglobulin M. Neurological disorders disappeared within 15 days, after treating with a high dose of corticosteroids and physical rehabilitation. 24 months later she was asymptomatic. Screening for hepatitis A virus infection in patients with acute transverse myelitis should be indicated specially in endemic countries were vaccinal prophylaxis is not common practice.
