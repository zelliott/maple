Solitary brain metastases from uterine carcinoma are uncommon. Intracranial metastases from uterus usually occur in widely disseminated disease. We report three cases of solitary brain metastasis from uterine cancer. In one of these patients metastasis was detected prior to diagnosis of primitive cancer. In a review of the literature only seven cases of solitary brain metastasis preceding the diagnosis of uterine cancer have been documented.
