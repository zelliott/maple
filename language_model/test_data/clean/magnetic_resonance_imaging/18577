Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of soft tissue is a rare tumor. We present a case of MFH in the bicipital muscle. Local muscle hypertrophy or lesions of the long tendon of the bicipital muscle may be a difficult differential diagnosis. This case is used for outlining advantages of ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. In conventional radiography MFH is seen as a soft-tissue tumor sometimes involving the bone. CT is the best way to test bone involvement. Tumor extension will be assessed with great accuracy by means of ultrasonics and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
