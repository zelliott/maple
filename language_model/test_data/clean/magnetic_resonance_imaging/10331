We describe and present a videotape of a 57-year-old woman admitted to our Neurological Clinic at 46 years of age due to extrapyramidal manifestations suggesting Parkinson's disease (PD) and with a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan showing multi-infarctual leukoencephalopathy. Various investigations led to the diagnosis of Anderson Fabry's disease (AFD). We discuss the possibility of correlation between the patient's parkinsonism and AFD.
