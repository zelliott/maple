A case of congenital isolated growth hormone deficiency with neonatal giant cell hepatitis is described. Hypoplasia of the pituitary gland was detected by a MR-scan. Values of IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF-BP-3 were low. Birth length and weight were normal; hypoglycaemia, jaundice, and failure to thrive were the most pronounced symptoms and present from the first day. Substitution therapy with growth hormone induced a remission of all symptoms. Growth was normal at follow-up at the age of two and a half years.
