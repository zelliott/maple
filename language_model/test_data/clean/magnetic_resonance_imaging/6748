A thrombosed varix in the orbit is comparatively rare. Clinical examination alone is often inadequate for diagnosis. Radio-logical examination, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbit, is extremely important. Histopathological examination (HPE) after excision biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. The present authors describe a case of proptosis in the left eye of a 45-year-old man. CT-scan and HPE supported the diagnosis of a thrombosed orbital varix. This paper discusses the use of radiological investigations to supplement a clinical suspicion and make the diagnosis. This entity needs to be included in the differential diagnosis of proptosis and requires a coordinated approach for establishment of the diagnosis.
