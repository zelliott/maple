Pituitary adenomas with extensive suprasellar extension are a therapeutic challenge. The efficacy and safety of the endoscopic endonasal approach for non-functioning giant pituitary adenoma was evaluated retrospectively. A total of 43 consecutive patients with pituitary adenomas with a suprasellar extension of >20mm underwent tumor resection with a purely endoscopic endonasal approach, and their surgical outcomes were analyzed. At surgery, irrespective of the size and shape of the adenoma, every effort was made to perform intracapsular resection under direct visual control using an angled-lens endoscope. Gross total removal was achieved in 20 out of 43 patients. Postoperatively, 42 patients showed varying improvement of both visual field defects and impaired visual acuity. In two patients who presented with gait disturbance and cognitive dysfunction due to obstructive hydrocephalus, these symptoms were completely resolved. There were no serious operative complications. The results indicate that intracapsular resection via the endoscopic approach can be a safe and effective treatment for giant pituitary adenomas.
