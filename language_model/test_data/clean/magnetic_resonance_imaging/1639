Frasier syndrome (FS) is characterised by male pseudohermaphroditism, slowly progressing nephropathy and frequent development of gonadoblastoma. The Wilms' tumour suppressor gene (WT1 gene) plays an important role in the development of the urogenital system and the gonads. A splice mutation in intron 9 of the WT1 gene was recently described in patients with FS. We analysed the WT1 gene of a Japanese patient with male pseudohermaphroditism, steroid resistant-nephr-opathy and gonadoblastoma by the polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing and detected a heterozygous point mutation in intron 9.

analysis of the Wilms' tumour suppressor gene in a patient with Frasier syndrome by the polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing detected a + 5G -->A transition at a position of the second alternative splice region of exon 9, important for predicting the risk of the occurrence of Wilms' tumour.
