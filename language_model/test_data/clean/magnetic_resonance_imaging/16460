Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) may be a presenting sign of myelogenous leukemia. Occasionally, an extramedullary neoplasm composed from myelocytic precursor cells occurs in patients without evidence of leukemia. Rarely, undiagnosed leukemia occurs initially manifesting with paralysis to spinal cord GS. We present a case report of 20-year-old girl with an undiagnosed leukemia, initially manifesting as paralysis. En bloc spondylectomy with chemotherapy postoperatively constituted the treatment of choice for this tumor. After two courses of chemotherapy, the patient made a good postoperative recovery with notable bilateral lower extremity improvement.
