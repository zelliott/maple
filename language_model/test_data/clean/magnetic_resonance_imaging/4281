A 52-year-old woman presented with a clinical picture consistent with bacterial meningitis 3 years after functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula was made clinically, and the site of the fistula was confirmed using magnetic resonance cisternography. The utilization of this technique in the diagnosis of CSF disorders is gaining popularity. Its usefulness in the context of other imaging modalities is discussed.
