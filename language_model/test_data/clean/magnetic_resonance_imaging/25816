A multi-slice technique for MRT measurements of the left ventricular volume is much faster than the use of single-slice methods and is therefore better tolerated, leaving time for additional measurements. The end-diastolic left ventricular volume can be reliably measured by this method (123.3 +/- 13.5 ml vs. 124.1 +/- ml). The end-systolic volume is consistently overestimated by 23.7 +/- 18.3% compared with the reference value obtained by single slice measurements (47.9 +/- 8.9 ml vs 39.1 +/- 7.9 ml). Correspondingly, stroke volume and ejection fraction is underestimated on average by 10.6 +/- 9.7% and 10.6 +/- 7.6% respectively).
