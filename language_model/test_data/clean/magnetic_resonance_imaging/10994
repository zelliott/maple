This study used a model for magnetization transfer (MT) to estimate two underlying parameters: the macromolecular proton fraction (f) and the bound pool T2 (T2b) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Sixty patients with clinically definite MS and 27 healthy controls were imaged using: (1) a dual echo fast spin echo sequence, (2) a MT sequence (with ten MT power and offset frequency combinations) and (3) proton density and T1 weighted sequences (for T1 relaxation time estimation). Fourteen normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) regions of interest (ROI) and six normal-appearing gray matter (NAGM) ROIs were outlined in all subjects. Lesions were also contoured in subjects affected by MS. The model was fitted to the data leading to estimates of T2b and f. Results showed that T2b was increased in lesions whereas f was reduced. In NAWM, f was decreased while T2b was only increased in secondary progressive MS. NAWM f correlated modestly with disability. Further studies are needed to investigate the pathological basis of the abnormalities observed.
