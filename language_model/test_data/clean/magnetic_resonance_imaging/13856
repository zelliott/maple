Software was developed to correct for lung motion to improve the description of hyperpolarized (3)He gas distribution in the lung.

Five volunteers were studied by dynamic ventilation (3)He-MRI using an ultrafast FLASH 2D sequence with a temporal resolution of 128 milliseconds. Signal kinetics were evaluated in the trachea and seven parenchymal Regions of Interest. Reference ranges for healthy subjects were defined for motion-corrected and uncorrected images.

Motion correction was successfully performed. Reference ranges were 0.11-1.21 seconds for tracheal transit time, 0-0.02 seconds for trachea-alveolar interval, 0.22-0.62 seconds for alveolar rise time and 0-76.6 arbitrary units for alveolar amplitude for motion corrected images, and 0-1.09 seconds, 0-0.11 seconds, 0.26-0.85 seconds, 46.4-99.8 arbitrary units for uncorrected images.

Evaluation of (3)He-distribution in the lung using motion correction of dynamic (3)He-ventilation imaging is feasible and gives more narrow reference ranges.
