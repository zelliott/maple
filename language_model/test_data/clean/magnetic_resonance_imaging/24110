A minimally invasive technique for performing magnetic resonance (MR)-guided laser interstitial thermoablation (LITT) for inoperable renal tumors is described. Three patients were treated using a percutaneous technique with real-time MR guidance in an open access interventional MR scanner. Laser therapy was delivered using a neodymium-YAG source via a water-cooled applicator system. Thermal lesions were monitored in real time using a color thermometry sequence. All patients were discharged the following day with no complications. Follow-up with gadolinium-enhanced MRI in a conventional high-field system confirmed necrosis in targeted tissue, and further treatment is planned for one patient. We concluded that LITT can be useful in treating inoperable renal malignancy and merits further evaluation. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 1999;10:545-549.
