Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) may be classified into partial isolated GHD (partial IGHD), severe IGHD or multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD) by the severity of GHD or associated with deficiency of one or more other anterior pituitary hormones during provocative tests. Morphological alterations on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with GHD include pituitary hypoplasia, absence or interruption of pituitary stalk, and absence or ectopic posterior lobe. This study investigated the auxological, clinical severity, and anatomical characteristics of the pituitary hypothalamic region by MRI and correlated their relationships. We evaluated these parameters in 45 Taiwanese children with GHD (31 males and 14 females), aged from 3.13 to 17.91 years (10.5+/-2.5), who were divided into diagnostic subgroups of partial IGHD (18 patients), severe IGHD (13 patients), and MPHD (14 patients). We found that BA-CA, peak GH, IGF-I, IGF-I SDS, and height SDS were significantly different among these three groups. The partial IGHD group had significantly higher IGF-I than the MPHD group. There was no significant difference in prematurity, cesarean delivery, birth order, neonatal jaundice, and target height among these three groups. On MRI, patients with MPHD had significantly smaller pituitary height (PHt) SDS (p = 0.0012) and higher frequency of pituitary hypoplasia, pituitary stalk interruption, and ectopic posterior lobe (p = 0.026, 0.008, 0.005, respectively) than the other two groups. Furthermore, PHt SDS was correlated not only with peak GH (r = 0.40, p = 0.0058), but also with basal IGF-I SDS (r = 0.49, p = 0.0007) and body height SDS (r = 0.44, p = 0.025). In conclusion, morphological alterations on MRI of the hypothalamic-pituitary area are correlated with the severity of hypopituitarism. Meticulous evaluation of auxological, clinical and MRI findings can help evaluation of the severity of hypopituitarism and facilitate appropriate treatment in children with GHD.
