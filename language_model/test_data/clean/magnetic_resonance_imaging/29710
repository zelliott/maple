At the Framingham Heart Study under separate research grant funding from the National Institute of Aging, NIH, we are gathering brain structure and cognitive information on the Framingham Offspring, creating one of the largest known data sets to assess changes in brain structure associated with normative ageing and cognitive decline. Subject recruitment, data collection, data management and statistical analysis require a collaborative integrated effort on the part of the Framingham project team. Here we describe this effort, as well as the various brain structure and cognitive function parameters we are now collecting. We are currently performing analyses of data collected through 2002, and we discuss the statistical issues arising relating brain structure parameters to cognitive function.
