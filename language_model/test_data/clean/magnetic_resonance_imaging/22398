Endovascular stent grafting (EVSG) is a minimally invasive alternative to open repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms. It is useful in the treatment of thoracic aneurysms, dissections, and ruptures. Currently, the incidence of thoracic aortic aneurysms is 6:100,000 people. Comorbidities often include hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease, and there often is a history of smoking. Without surgical intervention, a high risk of mortality exists, primarily due to aneurysm rupture. Due to the complexity of performing open surgical repair of the thoracic aorta and its associated morbidities such as paraplegia, renal failure, stroke, and prolonged ventilator support, new approaches to thoracic aneurysm repair are being investigated. When compared with open repair, stent grafting is a palliative rather than a curative treatment, and the risk of aneurysmal rupture still exists. This article describes a patient who underwent EVSG who had a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and a known bovine arch.
