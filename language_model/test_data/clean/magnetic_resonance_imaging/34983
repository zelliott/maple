A 24-year-old woman developed acute bilateral proptosis. She had a history of rhabdomyosarcoma of the left orbit treated 2 years previously with chemotherapy and radiation. Computed tomography demonstrated enlargement of each of the extraocular muscles in both orbits. Extraocular muscle biopsy confirmed rhabdomyosarcoma. She was treated with radiation but died 2 months after presentation.
