We report a case of osteochondromatosis in the hip joint treated through a surgical dislocation and describe the use and safety of the procedure confirmed by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. A 44-year-old man had right hip pain with moderate limitation of the range of motion. Plain radiographs and computed tomography showed calcified loose bodies in the hip with mild joint degeneration. Magnetic resonance imaging showed remarkable expansion of the capsule containing joint fluid and loose bodies below the femoral head. Complete removal of loose bodies and synovectomy were performed through a surgical dislocation. Three months after the operation, the patient had fully recovered and returned to his job. Magnetic resonance imaging performed 5 months after surgery revealed full removal of the loose bodies and no recurrence of the disease including synovial proliferation. It also showed no evidence of avascular necrosis, meaning that the procedure had been performed safely.
