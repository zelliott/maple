Scimitar syndrome is a rare, complex congenital anomaly characterized by an anomalous connection of the pulmonary vein with the inferior vena cava (IVC). A persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) is another thoracic venous anomaly. We present a rare case with scimitar syndrome associated with the PLSVC. These variations were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). The typical features and the embryonic development of these variations are described. Radiological evaluations and clinical implications are discussed.
