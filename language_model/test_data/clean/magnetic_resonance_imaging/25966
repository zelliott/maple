After surgical resection of a brain tumor or infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), elevated levels of blood by-products or protein contaminations are seen in the patient's CSF spaces. In fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) imaging CSF signal is nulled by an appropriate choice of the inversion recovery time TI to improve the contrast between tissue structures adjacent to CSF-filled volumes. With contaminated CSF, however, the longitudinal relaxation time T(1) may change significantly, which results in an incomplete suppression in the FLAIR images, if standard inversion times are used. In this work, a fast single-voxel T(1) measurement pulse sequence with integrated T(1) calculation that allows determination the optimal TI value in 15 sec is presented. The method was tested in five patients after surgical resection of a brain tumor, where FLAIR MRI with and without contrast agent was performed to identify remaining tumor fragments at the margin of the resection cavity.
