Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a localized process that affects the subchondral bone and can progress to the overlying articular cartilage. The cause of this lesion remains elusive. With the vague clinical symptoms and signs of OCD, imaging plays a vital role in making the diagnosis and helping with the prognosis of OCD lesions. This article reviews current imaging modalities for the assessment of OCD including conventional radiography, nuclear medicine, computed tomography (CT), CT arthrography, magnetic resonance (MR) and MR arthrography. The role of imaging in evaluating healing of the OCD and articular congruity after surgical and nonsurgical management is discussed.
