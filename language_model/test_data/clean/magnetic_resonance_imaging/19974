In order to expand the repertoire of somatosensory functions that can be effectively studied through functional MRI, we have developed a tactile stimulator which can deliver rich and varied combinations of stimulation that simulate natural tactile exploration. The system is computer controlled and compatible with an MRI environment. Complex aspects of somesthesis can thus be studied independent of confounds introduced by motor activity or problems with precision, accuracy or reproducibility of stimulus delivery.
