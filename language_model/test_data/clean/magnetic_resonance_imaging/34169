To describe an uncommon sinus condition that can cause proptosis.

Intermittent unilateral proptosis and diplopia developed in a 29-year-old man. Computed tomography showed an enlarged frontal sinus with erosion of the floor of the sinus and air in the orbit.

Endoscopic ethmoidectomy and frontal sinusotomy corrected an outlet check valve of the nasal frontal duct and eliminated the proptosis.

Pneumatocele of the orbit is an uncommon cause of proptosis and diplopia and can be corrected with endoscopic sinus surgery.
