In middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, ischemia usually is unevenly distributed within the MCA territory. We sought to investigate which brain structures are critical for the acute neurological deficit in severe MCA stroke.

We used magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and statistical parametric mapping in 64 consecutive stroke patients (64 +/-13 years) to study the pattern of the initial perfusion abnormality.

Patients with lesion progression had more severe time-to-peak (TTP) abnormalities (P < .0001) in the inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula, and underlying hemispheric white matter than those with lesion regression. Also, patients with lesion progression had more severe T2 abnormalities on day 8 than those with lesion regression. In contrast, the changes of water diffusion were similar among the two groups resulting in a perfusion-diffusion mismatch in lesion progression. TTP-lesions were related to the neurological deficit score (r(s)=-0.563, P < .0001), T2-lesions (r= 0.686, P < .0001), and cerebral artery abnormalities assessed on MR-angiography (r(s)= 0.399, P < .01).

In major MCA, stroke ischemia was most severe in the central portion of the MCA territory. It is suggested that involvement of hemispheric white matter accentuated the neurological deficit probably by affecting cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical fibers.
