The association of intracranial aneurysm and pregnancy is uncommon. Hemodynamic stress plays an important role in the growth of aneurysms.

The authors report the case of an enlarging cavernous carotid aneurysm in a pregnant 15-year-old young woman.

The aneurysm was initially diagnosed prior to the patient's pregnancy by both cross-sectional imaging and cerebral angiography. Further imaging evaluation was required during pregnancy, which demonstrated significant enlargement of the aneurysm. Following delivery, the lesion decreased in size.

We review potential factors associated with pregnancy that may increase hemodynamic stress and influence aneurysm growth. Additionally, the management of pregnancy-related intracranial aneurysms is discussed.
