Fibroid embolization is a nonsurgical treatment of symptomatic fibroids and is particularly useful in patients with multiple comorbidities.

A 44-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities underwent uterine artery embolization for uterine fibroids. The postprocedure symptoms were controlled with conservative management along with vaginal myomectomy using outlet forceps.

Postprocedure symptom control is important, and some patients may need emergency medical management of pain and infection and surgical management of partially expelled fibroids.
