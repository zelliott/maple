To present the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of placenta accreta in suspected cases of placenta accreta with true fast imaging with steady-state precession (True FISP) and half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) sequences.

Five patients underwent MRI with HASTE (n = 5) and/or True FISP (n = 4) sequences for suspected placenta accreta. Retrospective review of MRI was performed to define the location and extent of the implantation abnormality.

The uteroplacental interface was visualized as three layers; inner low signal intensity layer, middle high signal intensity layer of myometrium, and outer low signal intensity layer of uterine serosa. Three cases were diagnosed with placenta accreta on MRI and focal non-visualization of the inner layer was demonstrated.

The finding of focal non-visualization of the inner layer between the placenta and myometrium by MRI with True FISP and HASTE sequences was the diagnostic finding for placenta accreta.
