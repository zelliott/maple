We evaluate whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast correctly predicts the relative effects of tumor-oxygenating agents on hypoxic fraction in BA1112 rhabdomyosarcomas in WAG/Rij rats.

The response of ten tumors to carbogen (95% O(2)/5% CO(2)), a perfluorocarbon emulsion (PFC), and the combination of PFC + carbogen was studied with high spectral and spatial resolution MR imaging of the water resonance at 4.7 Tesla. Decreases in MR signal linewidth indicate increases in tumor blood oxygen levels.

Average MR signal linewidth was decreased 2.0% by carbogen, 2.5% by PFC + air, and 4.9% by PFC + carbogen. PFC + carbogen caused a larger linewidth decrease than either treatment alone (p < 0.04 by ANOVA). Maps of pixels responding to treatment indicate that combining PFC with carbogen significantly enlarges the area of the tumor in which oxygen levels are increased (p < 0.01 by ANOVA).

MRI predicts that PFC + carbogen will increase radiosensitivity more than either treatment alone; this agrees with the known effects of these treatments on hypoxic fraction. Utilizing MRI to choose the treatment that maximizes the size and extent of increases in tumor oxygenation could reduce hypoxic fraction.
