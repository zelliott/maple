Magnetic Resonance (MR) is currently becoming an important diagnostic pool in therapy planning and care of patients with tumors of the head and neck. In this work MR with GD-DTPA was used to all subjects suffered from acoustic neuroma: in 18 patients (86%) the diagnosis was possible with sequences obtained without contrast medium; in 3 patients (14%) the used of Gd-DTPA was essential in diagnosing the tumor. The Authors conclude that MR with Gd-DTPA is helpful in revealing neuromas of the internal auditory canal, multiple lesions of neurofibromatosis and tumor recurrence.
