Skin fibrosis is the final outcome of a variety of pathologic processes ranging from aberrant wound healing (keloids) to environmentally induced conditions (nephrogenic systemic fibrosis) to idiopathic or autoimmune conditions (morphea and systemic sclerosis). The quantitative assessment of skin fibrosis has been a major burden of clinical and biomarker research in the field for the past three decades. Here, we review the efforts that reached some sort of validation and the ones we envisage have the potential for further development focusing on systemic sclerosis as prototype of fibrotic disease.
