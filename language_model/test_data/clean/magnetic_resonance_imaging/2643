A patient with celiac disease and relapsing-progressive symptoms suggesting brainstem and cerebellar involvement underwent serial MRIs. The first examination revealed multiple enhancing and nonenhancing lesions. Thereafter, a large enhancing cerebellar lesion appeared, followed by severe cerebellar atrophy. The presence of structural neuronal damage was confirmed by proton MR spectroscopy and magnetization transfer imaging. MRI results and CSF findings suggested that neurologic complications were more likely due to an inflammatory process.
