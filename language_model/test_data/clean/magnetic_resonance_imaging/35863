A device was constructed to allow rapid adjustment of the position of a surface coil in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the spine. The device consists of two sheets of acrylic plastic and a movable sled. The surface coil is placed on the sled and can be precisely moved superiorly or inferiorly with a cord attached to the sled. The device can save approximately 30 minutes during MR imaging of the entire spine and increases patient comfort and cooperation.
