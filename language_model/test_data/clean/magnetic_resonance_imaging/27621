Glomangiopericytoma (sinonasal-type hemangiopericytoma) is a rare tumor arising from the periyctes surrounding capillaries and accounts for less than 0.5% of all sinonasal tumors. It falls within the category of borderline and low-malignant-potential soft tissue tumors of the nose and paranasal sinuses. It is defined by the World Health Organization as a sinonasal tumor demonstrating a perivascular myoid phenotype. It was noted that when this lesion arose in the nasal cavity, it tended to behave in a more indolent fashion than its soft tissue counterpart, suggesting that sinonasal hemangiopericytomas represented a distinct entity. We report a case of a 68-year-old female patient diagnosed with glomangiopericytoma arising in the left sinonasal cavity and discussed the condition in terms of differential diagnosis.
