The anorectum and pelvic floor are crucial in maintaining continence, facilitating evacuation, providing pelvic organ support while in females the pelvic floor is part of the birth canal. The anal sphincter is a multilayered cylindrical structure, including the smooth muscle internal sphincter and the outer striated muscle layer. The latter comprises the external sphincter as lower outer half and puborectalis as upper outer half of the sphincter. The external sphincter is continuous with the rectum at the anorectal junction. The pelvic floor constitutes four principal layers: endopelvic fascia, the muscular pelvic diaphragm (commonly referred to as levator plate), the perineal membrane (urogenital diaphragm) and the superficial transverse perineii. Anorectum and pelvic floor have multiple interconnections by fascia and ligaments as well as multiple indirect connections to the bony pelvis. Other structures as perineal body and a fibro-elastic network add to this support.
