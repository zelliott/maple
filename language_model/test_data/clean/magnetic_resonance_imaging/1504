The quantification of blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) signals is closely related to cerebral blood flow (CBF) change; therefore, understanding the exact relationship between BOLD and CBF changes on a pixel-by-pixel basis is fundamental. In this study, quantitative CBF changes induced by neural activity were used to quantify BOLD signal changes during somatosensory stimulation in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rats. To examine the influence of fast-moving vascular spins in quantifying CBF, bipolar gradients were employed. Our data show no significant difference in relative CBF changes obtained with and without bipolar gradients. To compare BOLD and CBF signal changes induced by neural stimulation, a spin-echo (SE) sequence with long SE time of 40 ms at 9.4 T was used in conjunction with an arterial spin labeling technique. SE BOLD changes were quantitatively correlated to CBF changes on a pixel-by-pixel and animal-by-animal basis. Thus, SE BOLD-based fMRI at high magnetic fields allows a quantitative comparison of functional brain activities across brain regions and subjects.
