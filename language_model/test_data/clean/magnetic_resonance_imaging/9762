The diagnostic usefulness of abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging lies in the improved contrast resolution and ability to qualify several tissue characteristics of a specific organ or lesion. Our institution uses organ-specific protocols to facilitate technical reproducibility and optimize scan duration. These protocols are discussed individually in this article when applicable, noting that many build on a basic protocol with slight variations. Because most abdominal MR imaging studies are targeted toward an organ or area of interest, this article discusses the protocol strategies and relevant anatomy in a segmented/organ-specific manner.
