Viral myocarditis may have various clinical presentations, sometimes mimicking acute myocardial infarction or ischaemia. We describe the case of a young man presenting with acute heart failure, who had electrocardiographic changes suggesting myocardial ischaemia and an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia. The diagnosis of acute myocarditis was confirmed using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
