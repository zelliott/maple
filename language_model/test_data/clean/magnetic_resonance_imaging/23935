To review the impetus for the development of image-guided surgical navigation, its technologies, and the few prior outcome studies, and to make recommendations for its role in otologic and neurotologic surgery.

A literature search of English language publications by Medline from 1966 to 1998, using the key words: stereotactic, stereotaxy, navigation, intraoperative, and surgery.

Attempted review of the literature on image-guided surgical navigation in otology and neurotology revealed little relevant data.

There are many possible applications for image-guided surgical navigation in otology and neurotology, but technologic limitations preclude its extensive application. There are no data available that assesses whether image-guided surgical navigation can reduce operative time, hospital stay, or cost. Clinical outcomes have not been studied in patients with otologic and neurotologic disease. In this scenario, image-guided surgical navigation is an adjuvant tool that aids in navigation of the skull base but is not a substitute for sound surgical principles and knowledge of microsurgical anatomy.
