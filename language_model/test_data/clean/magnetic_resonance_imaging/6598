This study defines the clinical characteristics and evolution of 16 epileptic children with hippocampal asymmetry (HA) without sclerosis on MRI. The association of a positive family history of epilepsy (11/16), low incidence of febrile seizures (2/16), and benign prognosis (seizure control in monotherapy in 11/16, mean follow-up = 4.3 years, range 1 to 10) suggest a different clinical presentation than patients with mesial temporal sclerosis. Genetic studies of these mostly French Canadian families should help confirm the existence of a distinct syndrome.
