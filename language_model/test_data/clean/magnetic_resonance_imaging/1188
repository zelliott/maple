Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups and trained to self-administer either saline (n = 14) or heroin (0.1 mg/kg per injection, n = 16) for 10-12 days until a stable self-administration (SA) behavior was achieved. After 8-9 days of withdrawal, each group was divided into two subgroups for reinstatement tests and functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) scanning, respectively, to determine the neural correlates of the reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior. For reinstatement testing, heroin-SA rats (n = 10) displayed robust reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior triggered by an acute heroin priming injection, whereas saline control rats (n = 8) did not show such a behavioral response. Regional positive or negative blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, induced by heroin priming injection, were observed in both groups of rats during fMRI scanning. However, such heroin-induced positive BOLD signal primarily in the prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex was significantly attenuated in heroin-SA rats (n = 6) when compared to saline control rats (n = 6). Similarly, the heroin-induced negative BOLD signal in the subcortical regions, such as in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus, was also significantly attenuated in both signal intensity and number of brain voxels activated in heroin-SA rats. These data demonstrate that heroin-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior coincides with a significant, enduring reduction in opiate-induced brain activity in heroin-SA rats, suggesting a possible role of opiate tolerance in mediating reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior.
