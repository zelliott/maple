Histological studies suggest associations between hemorrhage and large lipid-rich/necrotic cores with thin or ruptured fibrous caps in advanced atherosclerosis. We investigated these associations in carotid arteries with mild to severe stenosis by in vivo 3T MRI.

Seventy-seven patients with >or=50% carotid stenosis in at least one side by duplex ultrasound underwent bilateral multi-contrast carotid MRI scans. Measurements for wall and lipid-rich/necrotic core sizes, presence of hemorrhage, and fibrous cap status (classified as intact thick, intact thin or ruptured) were recorded. Arteries with poor image quality, occlusion, or no detectable lipid-rich/necrotic core were excluded. For the 798 MRI slices included, multivariate ordinal regression analysis demonstrated larger %lipid-rich/necrotic core (odds ratio for 10% increase, 1.49; P=0.02) and presence of hemorrhage (odds ratio, 5.91; P<0.001) were independently associated with a worse (intact thin or ruptured) stage of fibrous cap status. For artery-based multivariate analysis, a larger maximum %lipid-rich/necrotic core and presence of hemorrhage independently associated with worse fibrous cap status (P<0.001, for both). No hemorrhage was detected in arteries with thick fibrous caps.

Hemorrhage and larger %lipid-rich/necrotic core were independently associated with a thin or ruptured fibrous cap status at an early to advanced stage of carotid atherosclerosis.
