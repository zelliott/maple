We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain activity related to motivational function of informative feedback stimuli in a time estimation task. In that task, subjects pressed a button as a response 3 s after a cue stimulus; a visual feedback stimulus was presented 2 s after the response. In a true feedback condition, subjects received true information (informative feedback) about their time-estimation performance. In the false feedback condition, the same visual signs were used, but they were presented randomly. Therefore, they were not related to actual performance. In the 20 subjects examined, higher hemodynamic responses were identified in the insular cortex, the thalamus, and the striatum by comparing the true feedback condition to the false feedback condition. The time estimation performance and subjective score on motivation were also markedly higher in the true feedback condition. The anterior insular cortex and striatal regions are known to be involved in motivational and reward processing. Therefore, the hemodynamic responses observed in this study suggest that the motivational function of the feedback information is a crucial factor for behavioral learning; it is considered that the informative feedback might serve as an implicit reward for humans.
