We report our experience with 19 cases of ACTH secreting pituitary adenomas. They were microadenomas in 50% of the cases, coming with the typical picture of the Cushing syndrome. The ACTH adenoma associated with other types of hormones tend to show visual alterations. The treatment is often surgical using the transsphenoidal approach. The results were satisfactory in most of the cases. For those in which surgical cure was not reached, radiotherapy was indicated.
