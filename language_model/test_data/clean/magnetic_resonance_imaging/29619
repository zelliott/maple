There are few published reports of low-grade renal epithelial tumor originating from the distal nephron. However, it should not be disregarded clinically, because the actual number of patients with such tumors may be higher than expected. We investigated the immunohistochemical profile of a histologically distinct subtype of such a tumor in detail, in addition to the clinical course and imaging studies. The present study demonstrated that both glandular and spindle cell components of this tumor have a persistent characteristic of an epithelial tumor arising from the distal tubule or collecting duct. This tumor is a benign complex neoplasm that can be treated successfully with radical surgery. Beta-catenin and E-cadherin are suggested to play a crucial role in tumorigenesis and the biphasic arrangement of this neoplasm, concerning the expression of epithelial membrane antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9. We suggest that the term 'distal nephron epithelioma' is appropriate for classifying such rare but clinicopathologically distinct tumors.
