Fetal tumors are rare and can be difficult to diagnose in utero. In this presentation, we report an infantile hemangiopericytoma of the tongue, and also review the clinical characteristics, imaging appearances, perinatal differential diagnosis, and potential treatments of this tumors. Prenatal diagnosis of lingual fetal tumors with two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound presents a challenge to sonographers and perinatologists because these lesions are rare, usually develop in the third trimester of pregnancy and need a multidisciplinary approach. We describe an lingual tumor and moderate polyhydramnios which were prenatally detected at 31 weeks of gestation with two- dimensional ultrasound. The application of the surface mode of three-dimensional ultrasound improved the visualization of this tumor. Fetal Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to help in prenatal differential diagnostic. The option of prenatal cytology gained by amniocentesis should also be considered. To our knowledge there are no prenatal reports of similar cases. However, in our experience every information provided during the pregnancy, a correct and early diagnose of fetal condition helps to cope with the demands of perinatal management and to explain to the parents and neonatologists the findings of the case.
