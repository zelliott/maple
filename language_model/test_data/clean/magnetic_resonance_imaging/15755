Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) has advanced to be an important pillar of radiological diagnostics, along side of x-rays and ultrasound. In the present work, the technical requirements for carrying out modern MRT diagnostics are discussed as are the principles of locally generated signal registration. Typical problems in the use of MRT as well as strategies for improving image quality and for the correct interpretation of the images are detailed. Consideration is also given to how existing image problems can be eliminated by the adjustment of the in put parameters.
