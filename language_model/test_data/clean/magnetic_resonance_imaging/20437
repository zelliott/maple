We present the first case of human spondylodiscitis due to Shewanella algae. Our patient did not have any predisposing factors. The portal of entry was probably a cutaneous lesion on the leg, exposed to seawater. Bacteria were isolated in pure culture from a needle biopsy specimen of the vertebral disk. Automated identification systems identified the organism as Shewanella putrefaciens. However, molecular biology identified it as S. algae. Treatment with ceftriaxone and amikacin, then ciprofloxacin successfully addressed the infection. We also review four published cases of human osteoarticular infections caused by Shewanella spp: two cases of arthritis and two cases of osteomyelitis. Two patients had predisposing factors, and contact with water was found in two cases. The clinical, radiological and biological characteristics of S. algae spondylodiscitis are indistinguishable from those of spondylodiscitis of other causes. A cutaneous lesion with exposure to water is a potential portal of entry. Molecular typing is necessary to obtain a precise bacteriological identification.
