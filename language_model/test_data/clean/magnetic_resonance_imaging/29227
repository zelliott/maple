We analyzed current treatment for hydrocephalus in Japan by means of a nationwide questionnaire. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting was the most common form of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting, and in 66% of cases the ventricular catheter was inserted via the anterior horn. Various types of flow-control valves were used in 46% of CSF shunting procedures, and the proportion of cases in which such valves are used seems to be increasing. The Codman-Hakim valve was used most frequently, followed by the Sophy valve. The initial pressure setting of programmable pressure valves was selected in 82% of institutes on the basis of the CSF pressure obtained during the shunt operation. Most flow-control valves were implanted in the retroauricular region; however, Sophy valves were implanted in the chest wall in a high percentage of cases. The rate of shunt complications was significantly lower among VP shunt cases with flow-control valves than in those without flow-control valves. The most common cause of shunt complications was trouble with the abdominal catheter. These results will contribute to progress in the treatment for hydrocephalus.
