We present the MR and single-photon emission CT findings in a 3-year-old patient in whom Kl√ºver-Bucy syndrome developed after Reye syndrome. MR images showed diffuse brain atrophy, which was predominant in the temporal lobes, and single-photon emission CT scans showed decreased cerebral perfusion in the bilateral temporal lobes and associated cortical areas.
