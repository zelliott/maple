The giant cholesterol cyst is a clinical entity distinct from cholesterol granulomas and other destructive lesions of the petrous bone. Preoperative assessment by computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging is extremely helpful. Attempts at total resection of the lesion are not necessary. Adequate surgical drainage may be established through the mastoid or middle fossa.
