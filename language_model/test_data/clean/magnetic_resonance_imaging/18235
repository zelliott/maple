Studies toward the end of the 20th century and in the first decade of the millennium show that meningioma represents the most common brain tumor of all types. There are no data available regarding meningiomas in the French West Indies and French Guiana. The author aimed to determine clinical and epidemiological features and provide data of meningiomas in French West Indies and French Guiana.

I reviewed the files of 358 patients who underwent surgery between January 2000 and December 2008.

I found a sex ratio of 2.5 to 1-256 (71.5%) female to 102 (28.5%) male. Meningiomas were encountered mostly in the sixth decade of life and the most common anatomical location was cerebral convexities (29.32% of patients) followed by parasagittal and parafalcine (20.11%). The third most common was sphenoid wing meningioma. The incidence of meningiomas was 6.31 per 100,000 inhabitants.

The current study attempts to estimate frequency and peculiarities of meningiomas in the French West Indies and French Guiana and is the first of its kind.
