Several functional imaging studies have shown that the extent of activation and percentage change in cerebral blood flow in the supplementary motor area (SMA) during a bimanual mirror performance of a simple repetitive movement are almost identical to those during a unimanual movement. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this finding was also applicable to a more complex movement. Eight right-handed, healthy volunteers performed unimanually (with their right and left hands) and bimanually (in a mirror fashion) thumb-finger opposition in a nonconsecutive order (index-middle-index-ring-index-little-index-middle ... fingers). The SMA proper was more activated during the bimanual movement than the unimanual movement with either hand. This is in accordance with the hypothesis that bimanual movement, even in a mirror fashion, is more difficult than unimanual movement when the task is complex but not when the task is simple. Pre-SMA was inconsistently activated. The results suggest that the SMA proper plays an active role in executive processing during bimanual mirror performance of complex movements.
