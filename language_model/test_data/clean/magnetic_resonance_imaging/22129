To investigate whether MRI without using artificial contrast agents can provide sufficient image contrast to visualize the venous tree in the cold stored liver graft, two pig liver grafts were scanned with a multislice turbo spin-echo sequence with long TE (200 msec). The quality of the data obtained at 1-T field strength was sufficient for three-dimensional reconstruction of the hepatic vascular system, potentially useful for liver splitting surgery.
