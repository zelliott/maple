A 20-year-old female presented with horizontal jerk nystagmus, blurred vision, severe headaches, unsteady gait, and paresthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed Chiari malformation I. Symptoms resolved after decompression of the posterior cranial fossa and removal of the right cerebellar tonsil.

Conditions associated with acquired periodic alternating nystagmus and ocular disorders associated with Chiari malformation are discussed. To our knowledge, this case is the first to report the resolution of periodic alternating nystagmus after neurosurgical decompression.
