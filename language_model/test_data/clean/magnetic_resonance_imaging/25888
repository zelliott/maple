Five newborns presented with cystic lesions of the floor of mouth. Four of these patients proved to have congenitally imperforate submandibular salivary gland ducts and the other newborn proved to have a duplication anomaly of the submandibular gland duct and gland. The patients with imperforate Wharton's ducts underwent marsupialization with or without ductoplasty and have been without evidence of recurrence for up to three years. The duplication anomaly of the submandibular gland duct responded to simple excision. The diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the submandibular gland and duct can be made on physical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in differentiating congenital imperforate submandibular duct and duplication anomalies of the ductal system. Treatment of the former consists of duct marsupialization in the floor of mouth with or without ductoplasty. Treatment of the duplicated ductal system may best be treated with excision. A failure in diagnosis and treatment may result in ranula formation or sialoadenitis requiring more extensive therapy.
