Dermoid cysts are embryonic lesions usually observed in the lateral eyebrow region and the midline nose and neck areas. Communication of these lesions with the central nervous system is rare and occurs in the nasal region. There are few clinical reports of temporal dermoid cysts presenting with intracranial extension, and we present a 15-year-old girl with a fronto-orbital dermoid cyst with intracranial extension and bone erosion. Her presenting symptom was a lacrimation reduction of the left eye. Excision of the cyst was done using a coronal approach because of its extension and localization.
