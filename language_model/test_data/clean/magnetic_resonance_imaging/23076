A multifunctional surgical suite with intraoperative 3.0 T MRI (ioMRI) has been operating at the Central Military Hospital, Prague since April 2008. Our experiences over the past year and the effect of ioMRI on the extent of pituitary adenoma resection are evaluated. Eighty-six pituitary adenoma resections were performed in 85 patients with ioMRI in the first year of the ioMRI service. Pituitary adenoma suprasellar extension was present in 60 cases, invasion into cavernous sinus in 49 cases, and retrosellar growth in one case. The surgical goal was set before surgery: either a radical resection (49 cases) or a partial resection (37 cases). In the group of patients where a decision for a radical resection was taken the results are as follows: ioMRI confirmed radical resection in 69.4% of the cases; ioMRI disclosed unexpected adenoma residuum and further resection led to radical resection in 22.4%. In the group of patients where a decision for a partial resection was taken, the results are as follows: no further resection was perfomed after ioMRI in 51.3% of the cases and further resection was performed after ioMRI in 48.7% of the cases. ioMRI seems to be a valuable tool to increase the extent of pituitary adenoma resection.
