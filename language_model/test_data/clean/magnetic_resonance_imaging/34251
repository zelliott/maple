Positive ulnar variance affects surgical decision making when ulnar wrist pain is refractory to conservative treatment and is either secondary to a posttraumatic triangular fibrocartilage tear or associated with ulnar impaction syndrome. In such settings, ulnar recession may be necessary to diminish load transmission across the ulnocarpal joint. We present a case of a 24-year-old man with chronic right ulnar wrist pain that illustrates the efficacy of the pronated-grip radiograph in assessing dynamic ulnar positive variance.
