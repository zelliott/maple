To prospectively assess the use of cardiac MRI with delayed contrast enhancement (DCE) for identifying patients with active myocarditis among those presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but no coronary stenosis.

A total of 27 consecutive patients (age = 45 +/- 17 years; 14 male) presenting with ACS (chest pain, positive troponin-I) and no coronary stenosis, underwent cardiac MRI 9 +/- 7 days after pain onset and 8 +/- 5 months later (N = 19). Steady-state free-precession pulse (SSFP) sequence was applied for the assessment of myocardial function and both inversion-recovery (IR) and SSFP sequences were used for analyzing the topography and extent of DCE areas. Rest sestamibi-gated-single photon emission CT (SPECT) was also systematically performed.

Subepicardial DCE pattern typical of acute myocarditis was documented in 12 patients (44%). Ischemic DCE pattern (transmural or subendocardial focal DCE) was documented in 12 of the 15 remaining patients (44%). Patients with subepicardial DCE had: higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (38 +/- 32 vs. 14 +/- 24 mg/mL; P = 0.04), lower Framingham cardiovascular risk (3 +/- 3% vs. 9 +/- 5%; P < 0.001), lower incidence of perfusion SPECT defects (17% vs. 73%; P = 0.01), higher left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume (77 +/- 16 vs. 64 +/- 10 mL/m(2); P = 0.02), and higher regression of DCE areas at follow-up (-65 +/- 17% vs. -18 +/- 23%; P = 0.002).

DCE pattern of active myocarditis can be seen in patients presenting with ACS but no coronary stenosis.
