To report a case of limbic encephalitis (LE) presenting with psychosis.

Case report.

A woman with LE initially presented with acute psychotic symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperintensity in bilateral temporal lobes. Paraneoplastic and autoimmune antibodies were negative, but symptoms resolved after starting methylprednisolone.

A greater awareness for and knowledge of LE among all disciplines could help early recognition and management of LE and avoid permanent behavioral deficits.
