The co-existence of schwannoma and meningioma as a mixed intracranial tumour is uncommon and so far only eight cases have been published in the literature. Because of rarity, we report a unique case of mixed tumour having schwann cell and meningeal components, in a patient with neurofibromatosis type -2 (NF-2). The possible mechanisms for the occurrence of these mixed tumours are discussed.
