Spinal idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis (IHP) is a rare, chronic, nonspecific, granulomatous inflammatory disorder of the dura with unknown etiology. It can cause a localized or diffuse thickening of the dura mater with compression of the spinal canal and possible myelopathic symptoms. The authors report 3 consecutive cases of spinal IHP with a review of the literature. The diagnosis of spinal IHP was based on biopsy and pathological confirmation. Typical MR imaging findings suggestive of spinal IHP were noted in all cases. The clinical course may be marked by deterioration despite conservative therapy and may require surgical intervention to prevent irreversible neurological damage. Therefore, prompt diagnosis and institution of proper treatment is critical.
