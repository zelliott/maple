A case of pure epidural cavernous angioma involving the dorsal region of the spine is presented. The clinical picture was of a slowly progressive compressive myelopathy. Imaging studies only showed a dorsally located epidural mass lesion. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of this rare type of lesion. The patient improved after excision of the lesion.
