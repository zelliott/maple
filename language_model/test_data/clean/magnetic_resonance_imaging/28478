A previously healthy 40-year-old man experienced the sudden 'stroke-like' onset of homonymous hemianopsia due to a bacterial brain abscess. Clinical features and initial computed tomography (CT) suggested a stroke. Subsequent CT and magnetic resonance (MR) demonstrated a cerebral abscess, proven at surgery. It is extremely rare that a healthy individual without various risk factors, such as congenital heart disease, immunologic deficiency, diabetes mellitus, or pregnancy, presents with the above symptoms. The exact mechanism of this sudden 'stroke-like' onset in a patient with a bacterial brain abscess is unknown. One possibility is that paroxysmal septic emboli led to abscess formation within or near areas of embolic infarction. Another possibility is that a primary cerebral infarction was associated with secondary bacteremia. Surgical drainage revealed a bacterial (Streptococcus) abscess, but no identifiable source of infection.
