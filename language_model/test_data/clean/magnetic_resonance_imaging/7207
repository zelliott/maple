We described a case of Central Pontine Myelinolysis, typical with regard to pathogenesis (excessive correction of hyponatremia), neuroanatomical damage revealed by imaging techniques (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and clinical symptomatology. Serially performed BAEPs recordings during patient's hospitalization, showed interesting data on functional recovery which well correlate with the evolution of clinical symptomatology. These data strongly suggest the usefulness of such electrophysiological technique for a prognostic evaluation.
