Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has been used as a diagnostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its prognostic significance is not well defined. This study was performed to classify the prognostic significance of AFP status in HCC patients after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).

Four hundred forty-one HCC patients from a prospective maintained database with pathologic confirmation including 139 with normal AFP levels and 302 with elevated AFP levels were retrospectively studied for prognostic significance of AFP in treatment response and survival after TACE. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the prognostic factors.

There were significant differences in overall survival (OS) after TACE between AFP-negative and AFP-positive HCC patients when the AFP cutoff value was defined as 20 ng/ml (P < 0.0001). Among the AFP-positive patients, different AFP levels had no significantly prognostic effects on OS after TACE (P = 0.093). Multivariate analysis revealed that AFP status for AFP-negative or positive was an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients after TACE (P = 0.001), along with Î³-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level (P = 0.004) and tumor diameter (P < 0.0001). In addition, there were significant differences in clinicopathologic features between AFP-positive and AFP-negative patients with regard to age, gender, alanine transferase level, GGT level, tumor diameter, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage.

Compared with AFP-positive HCC patients, patients with AFP-negative status have a better treatment response and prognosis after TACE.
