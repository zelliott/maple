MRI after a constant infusion (CI) of Gd-DTPA has been used to identify the extent of myocardial infarction (MI). However, Gd-DTPA-enhanced "viability" imaging is more commonly performed with a bolus (for "delayed-enhancement" (DE) imaging). This study sought to determine how image delay time and time postinfarction influence the assessment of necrosis by DE. Both infusion and DE imaging was performed in dogs with reperfused (N = 6) or unreperfused (N = 4) MI. Estimates of the partition-coefficient of Gd-DTPA (lambda) with DE were compared with those calculated after 60 min of infusion, and the comparisons were repeated until 4 (reperfused) or 8 (unreperfused) weeks postinfarction. In reperfused animals, the concordance (Rc) between DE and infusion estimates of lambda was > 0.90 for most image delays > 8 min postinjection, for day 0 through week 3, with Rc at day 0 greater than at week 4 (P = 0.022). In unreperfused animals, there was an interaction between image delay time and time postinfarction (P < 0.001): Rc > 0.90 corresponded to longer image delays at week 1 than at weeks 4-8. Therefore, when image delays are selected appropriately, DE images can strongly reflect lambda and identify irreversibly injured myocardium.
