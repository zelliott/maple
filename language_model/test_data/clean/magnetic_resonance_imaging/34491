The purpose of the present study was to determine whether proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an immunohistochemical marker for a nuclear protein abundant in actively proliferating (dividing) cells, is useful as an aid in differentiating idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (IOIS) from lymphoproliferative lesions (LLs). Records of all patients with IOIS and LLs were studied retrospectively. Tissue biopsy specimens from four patients with IOIS and nine patients with LLs were examined. The diagnosis in each case was based on presenting signs and symptoms, orbital computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance (MR) scans, histopathologic criteria, and follow-up data consistent with the entity. These findings were correlated with the percentage of B- and T-cells in the lesions as well as with the number of cells that demonstrated staining for PCNA in formalin-fixed tissue. PCNA activity was markedly increased in the higher grade (HG) lymphoma group as compared to that in the low grade (LG) lymphoma and idiopathic inflammatory group. Lymphoma cases showed a significantly increased B-/T-cell ratio compared to IOIS lesions. PCNA activity in conjunction with the ratio of B-/T-cells may be a helpful immunohistologic adjunct for differentiating purely inflammatory lesions of the orbit from lymphoid tumors. Further studies are necessary to compare PCNA activity in fresh frozen tissue with that in formalin-fixed tissue.
