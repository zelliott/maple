Determination of bone marrow involvement is important in staging Hodgkin disease (HD), so we compared the effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with bone marrow biopsy in diagnosing bone marrow involvement in HD patients.

Twenty-six patients with the diagnosis of HD were included in this study. The ages of the patients were between 4 and 24 years, with a median of 12. Eleven of them had stage III or IV disease and 15 had been previously diagnosed as having HD and were in relapse. They were evaluated by bone marrow biopsy and MRI of lumbar vertebrae. The biopsies were taken from the anterosuperior iliac spine with an age-appropriate Jamshidi biopsy needle. Within 14 days following biopsy, MRI of lumbar vertebrae was carried out.

MRI revealed decreased signal intensity in T1-weighted images in 7 of 26 patients. On the other hand, bone marrow biopsies showed HD involvement in three out of seven patients. The remaining 19 patients who had normal bone MRI were negative for HD in their bone marrow biopsies. The patients with positive MRIs and negative biopsy for HD had bone pain. One of them had a femoral periosteal reaction on bone survey; the other two had height loss in their lumbar vertebral bodies. There was a statistically significant difference in the disease-free survival rates between MRI-positive and -negative patients in the following 24 months period (P < 0.0001).

This study suggests that MRI is a useful method for diagnosing bone marrow involvement in HD, in that our MRI-positive patients had a higher relapse rate in the 24 months follow-up period than the MRI-negative patients.
