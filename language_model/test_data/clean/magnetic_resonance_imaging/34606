This study determined the variability of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disk position in medial, central, and lateral aspects of the joint using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subjects had clinical evidence of reciprocal TMJ clicking (N = 123) or restricted mandibular motion (N = 52). Eighty-nine asymptomatic volunteers provided a control group. Disk position was quantified on MRI by measuring the angle formed by a line through the middle of the condyle and perpendicular to the Frankfort plane and a line through the same midpoint of the condyle and tangential to the posterior-most aspect of the disk. The disk position in asymptomatic TMJs varied considerably with a tendency toward farther anterior placement in more lateral images. In 47 TMJs from a total of 52 TMJ5 (90%), restricted mobility was associated with anterior disk displacement (ADD) without reduction. The disk position demonstrated a mean displacement of 77 degrees without significant differences at the medial and lateral aspects of the condyle. One hundred TMJs from a total of 123 TMJs (81%) with reciprocal clicking demonstrated ADD with reduction. Tomograms revealed larger lateral displacements or rotational displacements in these joints, whereas medial images frequently showed similar ranges of disk positions as compared with asymptomatic TMJs. The results suggest that disk positions of up to +15 degrees on medial tomograms and +30 degrees on lateral tomograms should be regarded as normal variations. Furthermore, multisection analysis of all parasagittal images improved the separation between disk displacement and asymptomatic TMJs.
