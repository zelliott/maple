The aim of this study was to perform a validation study assessing the correlation between magnetic resonance (MR) findings of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disk displacement and effusion and some parameters drawn from kinesiographic (KG) recordings of jaw motion, i.e., deflection, deviations, incisures.

Thirty-one patients with TMJ disorders underwent a kinesiographic recording in the same day in which the MR was performed. Regression analysis was performed to assess the correlation between the MR and KG findings.

MR findings were not correlated with KG parameters (P > .05). The accuracy of all KG variables for diagnosing MR-detected signs was low. KG deflection ranged from 38.7% to 54.8%, KG deviation from 42% to 54.8%, and KG incisures from 9.6% to 71%. Specificity and positive predictive values were far from acceptable levels for all KG variables.

The findings do not support the usefulness of jaw-tracking devices in dental practices that diagnose and manage temporomandibular disorders.
