To evaluate the biliary enhancement dynamics of the two gadolinium chelates Gd-BOPTA (MultiHance) and Gd-EOB-DTPA (Primovist) in normal healthy subjects.

Ten healthy volunteers were evaluated with both agents by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 1.5T using a breath-hold gradient-echo T1-weighted VIBE sequence. The relative signal intensity (SI) differences between the common hepatic duct (CHD) and liver parenchyma were measured before and 10, 20, 30, 40, 130, 240, and 300 min after contrast medium injection.

Biliary enhancement was obvious 10 min post-injection for Gd-EOB-DTPA and was noted at 20 min for Gd-BOPTA. At 40 min delay, Gd-BOPTA reached its peak biliary enhancement, but at neither 30 nor 40 min delay was there any significant difference compared with that of Gd-EOB-DTPA. At later delays, the contrast between CHD and liver continued to increase for Gd-EOB-DTPA, whereas it decreased for Gd-BOPTA.

The earlier onset and longer duration of a high contrast between CHD and liver for Gd-EOB-DTPA facilitates examination of hepatobiliary excretion. Therefore, Gd-EOB-DTPA may provide adequate hepatobiliary imaging within a shorter time span than Gd-BOPTA and facilitate scheduling at the MR unit. Further studies in patients are required to compare the imaging advantages of Gd-EOB-DTPA and Gd-BOPTA in clinical practice.
