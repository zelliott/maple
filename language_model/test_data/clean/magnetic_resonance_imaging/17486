With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging, diagnostic accuracy of spinal disorders has been much improved regarding their localization and histological prediction. The location of herniated disc materials is well appreciated on MR images without using contrast materials. MRI can predict the posterior longitudinal ligament is perforated or not. Kinematics of the spinal axis and CSF flow movement is evaluated on MRI with fast imaging. MR angiography with 3D reconstruction depicts the Adamkiewicz's artery and anterior spinal artery. Neuritis and neuropathy can be diagnosed by post-contrast T1 weighted image since inflammatory nerves are thick and enhance. Some intramedullary deseases tend to involve the peripheral area of the spinal cord; others are central. Edema extends longitudinally within the spinal cord by sparing the peripheral margin of the spinal cord and it is well appreciated with the T2- and proton- weighted images. The lateral and posterior funiculi are more frequently involved in multiple sclerosis.
