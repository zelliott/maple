The present report describes a case of a 33-year old male patient with homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD) with comorbid psychotic symptoms. The systematical evaluation revealed an intimate association between acute SCD complications, associated with hematological abnormalities, and psychotic symptoms worsening. Clozapine was effective in controlling psychotic symptoms refractory to previous antipsychotic trials.
