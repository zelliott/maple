Tectal region tumors can lead to hydrocephalus secondary to aqueductal compression. Surgical options for these patients include extracranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts, third ventriculostomy, and/or aqueductal plasty. In cases of third ventriculostomy failure, the accepted alternative is an extracranial CSF shunt. We report a patient in whom a repeat third ventriculostomy with aqueductal plasty and stenting was successful after a failed initial third ventriculostomy.

A 12-year-old patient with hydrocephalus secondary to a tectal tumor presented with headaches and blurry vision. She had no focal neurologic findings. She underwent a third ventriculostomy. Five months after the procedure she had recurrence of her symptoms. Therefore, she underwent a secondary third ventriculostomy with aqueductal plasty and stenting. She has been symptom-free for 1 year.

Aqueductal plasty with stenting may be an alternative to CSF shunts in some patients with hydrocephalus because of aqueductal compression resulting from tectal tumors.
