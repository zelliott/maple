We report the ultrasound, CT, magnetic resonance, and pathologic findings in a patient with cystic lymphangiomatosis of the retroperitoneum, liver, spleen, pancreas, left kidney, somatic soft tissues, and bone. Unusual features of this case include multiple organ involvement and the patient's relatively benign clinical course.
