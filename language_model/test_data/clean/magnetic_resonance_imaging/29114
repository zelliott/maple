Isolated nerve sheath tumors of the uterine cervix are very rare entities. This is especially true for benign nerve sheath tumors. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a benign nerve sheath tumor resected hysteroscopically. Our patient is a 69 year-old white female with a history of post menopausal bleeding. Initial workup included an endometrial biopsy and an ultrasound. A 4 cm cervical mass was identified on that study. Further characterization of the mass was obtained with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Gynecologic-Oncology consultation was obtained, and the opinion was that this was a cervical myoma. The patient continued to have bleeding and was taken to the operating room for a hysteroscopy and dilatation and curettage. At surgery, a large cervical mass was resected hysteroscopically. Final pathology report showed this to be a benign nerve sheath tumor.
