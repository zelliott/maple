Twenty seconds and 3 minutes after starting rapid injection of Gd-DTPA, multislice dynamic (MD) images were obtained with the 2 dimension fast low-angle shot (2D FLASH) technique. Four of 5 cervical carcinomas showed high signal intensity in the early dynamic phase (20 seconds), so they were readily distinguished from the myometrium that were not enhanced in the same phase. For evaluation of parametrial invasion, MD study showed better contrast between the tumor and the parametrium than did T2-weighted images because the tumor demonstrated a high signal intensity similar to that of the parameterium on T2-weighted images. MD images were able to scan the entire tumor especially in progressive cases and to evaluate the hemodynamics of the tumor. Therefore, MD imaging seemed to be useful for evaluation of parametrial invasion in cervical carcinomas.
