A method is presented which in a composed image maximizes the image intensity difference between two selected tissues. The composition is made from several magnetic resonance (MR) images from the same slice but with different MR imaging parameters. The method is illustrated with a patient with liver metastases for whom the technique was used to emphasize metastases above normal liver parenchyma.
