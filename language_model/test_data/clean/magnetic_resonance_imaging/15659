The curative strategy for most pancreatic cancer is surgical resection. Extensive resection with lymph node dissection is the key to providing long-term survival. However, early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is not always possible (ie, resectability is limited). One reason for such a nonresectable condition is vascular invasion or encasement. Portal vein involvement has been a contraindication for pancreatic cancer surgery for most general surgeons. Combining oncologic and vascular surgeons in the procedure has been a good solution. A multidisciplinary approach that includes general and vascular surgeons is appropriate in selected patients requiring vascular reconstruction at the time of pancreatectomy. The objective of this paper is to report a case in which spiral saphenous vein was used for portal vein reconstruction during pancreatic cancer resection.
