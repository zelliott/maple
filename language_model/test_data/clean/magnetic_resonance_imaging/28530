During the last few years the radiological approach to the diagnosis of pituitary adenomas has changed. In the present article we review the current status of techniques and indications for imaging of pituitary adenomas. First the clinical presentation and pertinent biochemical tests for the various types of adenomas are discussed. Then the important questions to be answered by the radiologists are formulated. With the advent of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) we have a very powerful tool to image the pituitary gland; however, conventional radiographs, computed tomography and angiography continue to play a role in the evaluation of pituitary adenomas under certain circumstances.
