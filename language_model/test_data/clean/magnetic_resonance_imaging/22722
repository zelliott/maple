Ethylmalonic encephalopathy is a rare metabolic disease presenting in infancy with developmental delay, acrocyanosis, petechiae, chronic diarrhea and early death. The biochemical characteristics of this autosomal recessive disease are urinary organic acid abnormalities. Recently it has been found to be caused by mutations in the ETHE1 gene, located on Ch19q13. Only about 30 patients have been reported, and we describe two additional cases. The first patient showed a typical clinical picture and biochemical abnormalities, with additional atypical clinical features. Neuroimaging studies showed extensive changes. A new homozygous mutation in exon 3 of the ETHE1 gene was found. The second patient was not investigated genetically; however besides the typical clinical picture and biochemical profile he was found to have cytochrome C oxidase deficiency.
