Several studies have shown the feasibility of Co-isotopes (55Co and 57Co) in imaging of neuronal damage in stroke, multiple sclerosis, cerebral tumors and trauma. These studies indicate that Co-isotopes allow visualization of brain pathology related to inflammatory processes, reactive gliosis and cell death. Until now, it is not clear if 55Co accumulation occurs in the core of infarction or in the penumbra. Therefore, in the present study, we compared 55Co-PET with functional parameters such as cerebral bloodflow (rCBF) using C15O2, oxygen metabolism (rCMRO2) using 15O2 and cerebral bloodvolume (CBV) using C15O in PET and with the anatomical parameter Gd-MRI.

Seventeen patients (11 male; 6 female) age 43 to 84 (mean 69) with middle cerebral artery (mca) stroke, as proven by CT or MRI, were examined with 55Co-PET (0.5-1.0 mCi 55CoCl2), C15O2-, 15O2- and C15O-PET in one session 0-30 days after stroke-onset. Regions of infarction were defined by rCMRO2 being smaller than 65% or rCBF below 45% of the contralateral value and were subsequently superimposed on the cobalt scan. To compare the Cobalt uptake with the Gd-MRI, a realignment program was used that matches the MRI with the bloodflow images. Clinical status was established using the Orgogozo stroke scale at admission and at discharge (at least 6 weeks after admission) and the Barthel index.

Eight patients showed a positive Co-PET scan and were used for further analysis. It appeared that Co accumulates in areas with a diminished oxygen metabolism and with a preserved bloodflow. We found Co-uptake in only a part of the Gd enhanced brain tissue with a tendency to be located peripherally or outside the Gd demarcated brain tissue.

The results of the present study suggest that Co accumulates into infarcted brain tissue with a rather preserved flow independently of blood-brain barrier breakdown.
