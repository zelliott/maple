We present a case of adenocarcinoma arising in a urethral diverticulum. A 71-year-old woman presented with urinary retention and a mass in the anterior vaginal wall. A biopsy was performed and revealed adenocarcinoma. Anterior pelvic exenteration with continent urinary diversion was performed followed by adjuvant radiation therapy as the tumor was large and poorly differentiated. She developed stomal stenosis and underwent stomal revision. The patient has done well since, with no evidence of recurrence at 1-year follow-up at the time of this report.
