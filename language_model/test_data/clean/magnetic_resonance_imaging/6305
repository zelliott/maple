This study examines the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor follicular and endometrial development during the menstrual cycle. MR scans, sonograms and hormonal levels of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) obtained from five ovulatory volunteers were evaluated on approximately days 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 of the cycle. MRI reliably demonstrated folliculogenesis in all of the volunteers. Changes depicted in the endometrial and junctional zones of the uterus reflected physiologic events occurring during the normal cycle. Important implications exist for infertile women undergoing stimulated cycles and/or in-vitro fertilization.
