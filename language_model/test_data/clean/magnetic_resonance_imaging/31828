Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast has been recently introduced as a potential clinical tool for the detection, diagnosis, staging and management of breast cancer. In this article, we consider the established and evolving roles of MRI with particular reference to screening in high risk women and staging of the primary tumour. Controversies are discussed in the context of the tumour biology and natural history of breast cancer.

Articles were identified by searches of PubMed and MEDLINE up to October 2007.

Contrast-enhanced MRI is an effective tool for screening women at high risk of breast cancer. However, randomized trials have yet to demonstrate a reduction in mortality. MRI can also facilitate local staging, in particular, the evaluation of ipsilateral multicentric or multifocal lesions and synchronous contralateral disease which may be 'missed' by conventional imaging. However, efficacy with respect to clinically relevant and patient oriented end-points has yet to be addressed in the context of clinical trials.

In women at high risk of breast cancer, screening MRI should be used in conjunction with published guidelines. In women with newly diagnosed breast cancer, the utility of MRI is less clearly defined and should be restricted to selected cases within the multidisciplinary setting.
