Ictal and interictal single-photon emission CT (SPECT) play an increasingly important role in the surgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy. We present a method of coregistration of MR, SPECT, and CT images to correlate structural data (MR imaging), blood flow changes (SPECT), and location of subdural electrodes (CT) for patients undergoing image-guided surgical treatment of epilepsy. MR-SPECT root mean square (rms) mismatch distances were 2.1 to 2.5 mm, and MR-CT rms mismatch distances were 1.0 to 4.5 mm. Coregistration assisted in image-guided placement of subdural electrodes and in surgical resection of the suspected epileptogenic focus.
