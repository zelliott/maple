This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that administration of the air with 30% oxygen compared with normal air (21% oxygen) enhances cognitive functioning through increased activation in the brain. A visuospatial task was presented while brain images were scanned by a 3 T fMRI system. The results showed that there was an improvement in performance and also increased activation in several brain areas in the higher oxygen condition. These results suggest that a higher concentration of breathed oxygen increases saturation of blood oxygen in the brain and facilitates performance.
