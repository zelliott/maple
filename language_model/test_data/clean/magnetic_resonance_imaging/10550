We report on a young woman with Jacobsen syndrome (JBS) who was admitted to our psychiatric department because of a bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). Chromosome analysis was performed due to the fact that she had mental retardation, short stature, and subtle facial anomalies. A deletion of the distal long arm of chromosome 11 was found. A detailed mapping of the deletion breakpoint by quantitative real time PCR revealed a true terminal 11q deletion of approximately 8 Mb corresponding to the karyotype 46,XX,del(11)(q24.2). Polymorphic DNA marker analysis showed that the deletion is located on the paternal chromosome. Additionally, laboratory investigations revealed a low platelet count and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed white matter T2 hyperintensities in frontotemporal regions, which are unlikely to result from a demyelinating process as indicated by localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a BPAD in a case with JBS.
