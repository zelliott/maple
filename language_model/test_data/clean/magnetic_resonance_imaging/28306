Intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with a considerable proportion of strokes and head injuries. The mechanism of brain cell injury associated with hemorrhage may be different from that due to pure ischemia. Therefore, it is essential that models of intracerebral hemorrhage be developed and well characterized. The purpose of this study was to obtain high-field MR images of rat brain at progressive times after induction of intracerebral hemorrhage and to correlate the images with behavior and histological evolution.

Intracerebral hemorrhage was induced in rats by injection of bacterial collagenase and heparin into the caudate nucleus. Histopathological changes and corresponding MR images were studied from 30 minutes to 3 weeks after injection. Behavioral changes were also followed for 3 weeks.

Histological correlation showed that MR is capable of resolving the accumulation and degeneration of the hematoma, a centripetal wave of neutrophils infiltrating from the surrounding tissue beginning at 12 hours, and centripetal invasion of macrophages beginning at 48 hours. Widespread white matter edema was clearly evident on MR images for 1 week after the hemorrhage. Medium-sized striatal neurons were lost in the tissue surrounding the hematoma. Behavioral improvement was rapid during resolution of the edema but incomplete at 3 weeks.

MR images correlate very well with histological changes in this experimental model of intracerebral hemorrhage and can therefore be used to follow changes due to drug treatments in vivo. The intense neutrophilic response to this lesion may contribute to neuronal injury at the periphery of the hematoma.
