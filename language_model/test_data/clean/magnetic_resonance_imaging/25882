Three cases of proved peritoneal carcinomatosis were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Air was used to distend the entire gastrointestinal tract via an antegrade method. The findings included seedings along the small intestine, transverse and sigmoid colon, stellate pattern in the mesentery, plaque-like and bulky tumor masses in the mesentery and greater omentum, and focal thickenings along the right subdiaphragmatic parietal peritoneum. Stenosis caused by tumor encasement at the duodenojejunal junction and ileocolic anastomosis were first detected by MRI and later confirmed by barium studies. Ascites was present in all cases. One case showed ascites located only along the left paracolic gutter. This report shows that MRI is also able to demonstrate peritoneal carcinomatosis by using air as a gastrointestinal contrast medium.
