We present a patient who visited emergency department owing to the skin manifestation of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Recent anterior myocardial infarction induced congestive heart failure and left ventricular thrombus, which were considered to be the cause of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Anticoagulant therapy with heparin and warfarin was used successfully to treat the disseminated intravascular coagulation and left ventricular thrombus.
