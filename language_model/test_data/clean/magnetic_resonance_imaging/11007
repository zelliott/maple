We evaluated the usefulness of MRI and compared it with CT for diagnosis of mesenteric lymphoma in a dog. The results in the plain CT, dynamic CT and plain MR (T1WI and T2WI) images suggested that the mass was a large single nodular lesion with abundant blood perfusion. On enhanced MRI(T1WI) , the mass was depicted as a tumor with adhesion to the gut wall. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed the mass was consistent with the findings on enhanced MRI. We think that MRI might be a useful imaging tool for diagnosis of canine mesenteric lymphoma.
