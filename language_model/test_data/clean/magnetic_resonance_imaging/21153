This case report is of a symptomatic posterior-lateral elbow plica in a child who presented with elbow locking. MR images demonstrated thickening of a posterior-lateral plica between the radius and capitellum of the elbow. Surgery confirmed a thickened and inflamed posterior-lateral plica, which was resected with subsequent improvement of the child's symptoms. This case shows the clinical importance of identifying thickening of posterior-lateral plicae in children and suggesting the diagnosis of plica syndrome, an entity that has not been previously reported in children in the radiologic literature.
