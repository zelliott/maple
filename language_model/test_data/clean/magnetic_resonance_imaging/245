Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft-tissue malignancy that represents approximately 4-8% of all solid tumours in children and commonly arises from the head and neck and genitourinary system. Intraperitoneal rhabdomyosarcoma, in particular with omental involvement, has been rarely reported in the literature. Furthermore, reports of omental rhabdomyosarcoma of embryonal origin do not exist, to our knowledge. We report two cases of omental embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma affecting children and illustrate the imaging characteristics of this rare tumour.
