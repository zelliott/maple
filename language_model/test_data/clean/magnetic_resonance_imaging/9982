We report a case of intraluminal duodenal diverticulum with special reference to its magnetic resonance imaging findings. An intraluminal duodenal fluid collection surrounded by a hypointense rim on T2-weighted or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatographic images, the shape of which is changed by peristalsis, is considered to be almost diagnostic for intraluminal duodenal diverticulum.
