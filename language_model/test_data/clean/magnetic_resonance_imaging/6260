Absent or defective cortical gyri (lissencephaly) combined with a characteristic phenotypic appearance was first reported by Miller and Dieker in 1963 and the clinical, computed tomographic and pathological features of this syndrome have been extensively reviewed. We report on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in a sporadic case of this syndrome.
