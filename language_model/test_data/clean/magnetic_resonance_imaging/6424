The ameloblastoma is an uncommon benign odontogenic neoplasm of the maxillofacial region constituting less than 1% of tumours of the oral cavity. The purpose of this paper is to discuss and evaluate the surgical treatment and the outcome from a series of 11 patients with ameloblastomas.

Between the years 1995 and 2003, 11 patients (eight female and three male) aged 17-86 years (mean 52.7) suffering from ameloblastomas of the jaws were seen in our Department.

Ten patients were treated surgically. In eight of those radical surgery was applied. Patients with maxillary tumours were subjected to hemimaxillectomy and local excision. Radical treatment with segmental resection of the mandible was performed in six patients with multilocular (solid) mandibular ameloblastomas, with immediate reconstruction of the defect. Follow-up ranged from 3 months to 7.5 years.

Multilocular (solid) type of tumours should be approached with radical surgical treatment. Enucleation and rarely marsupialization can be applied selectively to unilocular ameloblastomas.
