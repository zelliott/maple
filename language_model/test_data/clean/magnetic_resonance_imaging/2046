Starting from the macroscopic, microscopic and circulatory characteristics of focal liver lesions, we aimed at assessing the possibilities and the limits of their radiological differential diagnosis. We compared the normal hepatic parenchyma (in terms of: general morphology, cellularity, necrosis, macro- and micro-circulation) and the lesions, assessed following the radiological features of echoreflectivity, RX density, contrast dynamics and specific contrast uptake. The association of morphologic and dynamic features can sometimes lead to an excellent diagnostic specificity (by example: angioma); in other fields, interesting results are noted, but the limits of every modality require further evaluation. This study applies to the following focal lesions: angioma, focal hyperplasia, adenoma, regeneration nodule, hepatocarcinoma, metastasis.
