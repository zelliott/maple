Solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma (SEP) represents a rare separate clinical pathological entity; it is radiosensitive, curable, and unrelated to myeloma. Only 15 cases have been reported.

Authors report two well documented cases of dural plasmocytomas mimicking meningiomas. This paper points out differences between plasmacytomas, with very different initial presentation, and other meningeal tumors including extensive radiological investigations. Diagnostic options and outcomes are discussed.

With solitary plasmacytomas, radiological diagnosis is difficult to assess. Serum is generally free of monoclonal protein. The importance of the most recent techniques in ruling out other pathological entities is stressed. Histopathological examination is required to document a monoclonal type of plasma cell tumor. Treatment includes surgery and radiotherapy. Differential radiological diagnosis will be discussed.
