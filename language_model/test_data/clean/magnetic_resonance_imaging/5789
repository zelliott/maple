A 26-year-old man presented with a xanthogranuloma located exclusively in the suprasellar region manifesting as general fatigue, bitemporal hemianopsia, and polyuria. Endocrinological examination disclosed severe hypopituitarism. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a clearly defined suprasellar mass that was heterogeneously enhanced after gadolinium administration and was markedly hypointense on T(2)-weighted images. The tumor was subtotally removed under a preoperative diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. Histological examination found fibrous tissue with abundant cholesterol clefts, multinucleated giant cells, and hemosiderin deposits, but no epithelial cells. Xanthogranulomas of the sellar region are reported to be predominantly located in the sella turcica, but should be included in the differential diagnosis even in cases of suprasellar mass lesions.
