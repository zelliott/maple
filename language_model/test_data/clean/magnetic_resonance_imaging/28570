This article describes the case of a dermoid cyst with unique radiological findings in an unusual location. This cyst arose from the anterior clinoid process and projected into the right frontal lobe in a 39-year-old man. CT and MRI revealed a gravity dependent level within this low density lesion. Stereotaxic biopsy revealed that this gravity dependent level was formed between layers of fat and fluid. Craniotomy later showed the presence of hair within this lesion. The literature concerning the radiographic findings and location of dermoid brain cysts is also reviewed.
