Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare tumor that arises most commonly in the pleura. Recent evidence indicated that it is a tumor that originates from mesenchymal, probably fibroblastic, cells and is not restricted to the pleura. This report presents a case of primary SFT occurring as a dumbbell-shaped tumor of the cervical spine (C4/5) in a 46-year-old Japanese female, probably originating from the spinal rootlet. The tumor was predominantly extradural, loosely attached to the dura mater, with a small intradural extramedullary part attached to the C5 anterior and posterior rootlets. Histologically, the tumor was predominantly composed of a haphazard proliferation of spindle cells separated by abundant collagen. Immunohistochemically, the cells were strongly positive for CD34, bcl-2 and vimentin, but were negative for S-100 protein, neuron specific enolase, cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. The present case and review of the literature strongly suggest that SFT is an entity that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of tumors of the cerebrospinal region.
