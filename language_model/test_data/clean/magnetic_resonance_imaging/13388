Cavernous hemangiomas are vascular malformations that are seldom found in the central nervous system. Four cavernous hemangiomas of the internal auditory canal and one of the cerebellopontine angle have been reported previously. We present a series of seven (six of which have never been reported) cavernous hemangiomas limited primarily to the internal auditory canal. Whereas all cases but one had marked unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, only two had preoperative facial nerve dysfunction. There are no specific symptoms or physical or audiometric findings to differentiate cavernous hemangiomas from acoustic neuromas. However, a hemangioma should be suspected when facial paralysis is present in conjunction with a small intracanalicular tumor as demonstrated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The former reveals calcium stippling in the lesions, whereas magnetic resonance imaging reveals a high signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images.
