Due to the proximity of eloquent areas of the brain, the surgical treatment of insular lesions causing refractory epilepsy is considered difficult. We report here on our experience in this field.

We identified 24 patients (age: 1-62 years, mean 27) who underwent epilepsy surgery for an insular lesion from the epilepsy surgery data bank. We analyzed the preoperative diagnostics, surgical strategy and postoperative follow-up (duration: 12-168 months, mean 37.5) for functional morbidity and seizure outcome.

Eight patients had strictly insular lesions while, in 16 cases, the lesion extended into the frontal (n=3) or temporal (n=8) lobe, or was multilobar (n=5). Sixteen resections (66.7%) were right-sided. Six patients required invasive EEG with implanted electrodes, while three had the aid of intraoperative electrocorticography. In 12 patients, continuous electrophysiological monitoring was used intraoperatively (phase reversal, motor evoked potentials) and, in seven, neuronavigation. In seven patients, only subtotal resection of the insular lesion was possible due to involvement of eloquent areas, and two patients required repeat surgery to complete the resection. Thirteen patients had glial/glioneural tumours (WHO grades I-III), 11 from non-neoplastic lesions. Postoperatively, two patients (8.3%) had a transient neurological deficit (hemiparesis and dysphasia, respectively). One patient had permanent hemihypaesthesia, another had permanent deterioration of preexistent hemiparesis and two had hemianopia as calculated deficit (16.6% rate of mild permanent morbidity). According to the International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification, 15 patients were totally seizure-free (62.5%, ILAE 1) and 79.2% had a satisfactory seizure outcome (ILAE 1-3).

In selected patients, an individually tailored lesionectomy of insular lesions can be performed, with acceptable safety, to provide a high rate of satisfactory seizure relief. Indeed, even subtotal resection can result in effective seizure control.
