Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), a developmental cause of leukocoria, is due to incomplete regression of the fetal blood supply to the eye. We report the MRI features of PHPV of the dorsal type to facilitate differential diagnosis from other causes of leukocoria, namely retinoblastoma, which may have major therapeutic consequences.
