A 46-year-old woman with a history of metastatic malignant melanoma presented with what appeared to be a scaphoid nonunion. Biopsy and subsequent scaphoid excision confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. Her quality of life was improved for her remaining 13 months by scaphoid excision. We assessed our results in relation to the literature.
