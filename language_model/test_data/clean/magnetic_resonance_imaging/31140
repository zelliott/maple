Microorganisms that colonize surfaces, biofilms, are of significant importance due to their role in medical infections, subsurface contaminant remediation, and industrial processing. Spatially resolved data on the distribution of biomass within a capillary bioreactor, the heterogeneity of the biofilm itself and the impact on transport dynamics for a Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm in the natural growth state are presented. The data demonstrate the ability of magnetic resonance microscopy to study spatially resolved processes in bacterial biofilms, thus providing a basis for future studies of spatially resolved metabolism and in vivo clinical detection.
