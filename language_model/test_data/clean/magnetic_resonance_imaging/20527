Correlating the features of the actual executed movement with the associated cortical activations can enhance the reliability of the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data interpretation. This is crucial for longitudinal evaluation of motor recovery in neurological patients and for investigating detailed mutual interactions between activation maps and movement parameters.Therefore, we have explored a new set-up combining fMRI with an optoelectronic motion capture system, which provides a multi-parameter quantification of the performed motor task.

The cameras of the motion system were mounted inside the MR room and passive markers were placed on the subject skin, without any risk or encumbrance. The versatile set-up allows 3-dimensional multi-segment acquisitions including recording of possible mirror movements, and it guarantees a high inter-sessions repeatability.We demonstrated the integrated set-up reliability through compatibility tests. Then, an fMRI block-design protocol combined with kinematic recordings was tested on a healthy volunteer performing finger tapping and ankle dorsal- plantar-flexion. A preliminary assessment of clinical applicability and perspectives was carried out by pre- and post rehabilitation acquisitions on a hemiparetic patient performing ankle dorsal- plantar-flexion. For all sessions, the proposed method integrating kinematic data into the model design was compared with the standard analysis.

Phantom acquisitions demonstrated the not-compromised image quality. Healthy subject sessions showed the protocols feasibility and the model reliability with the kinematic regressor. The patient results showed that brain activation maps were more consistent when the images analysis included in the regression model, besides the stimuli, the kinematic regressor quantifying the actual executed movement (movement timing and amplitude), proving a significant model improvement. Moreover, concerning motor recovery evaluation, after one rehabilitation month, a greater cortical area was activated during exercise, in contrast to the usual focalization associated with functional recovery. Indeed, the availability of kinematics data allows to correlate this wider area with a higher frequency and a larger amplitude of movement.

The kinematic acquisitions resulted to be reliable and versatile to enrich the fMRI images information and therefore the evaluation of motor recovery in neurological patients where large differences between required and performed motion can be expected.
