We report a series of six benign peripheral neurogenic tumors (five schwannomas and one neurofibroma) studied by 3D ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The findings demonstrated by US and MRI are variable, but usually permit the diagnosis of benign nervous tumor without prejudging the final histological diagnosis. MRI does not bring forward further complementary images to those observed at US, which is limited by its dependence on its operator. The use of 3D US will be sufficient for the diagnosis and preoperative evaluation of a lesion when it is possible to furnish the volumetric data and the tools necessary for data analysis in a single document (in a CD).
