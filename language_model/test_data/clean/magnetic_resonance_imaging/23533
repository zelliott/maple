Dedicated and specialized radiofrequency coils are critical for high quality musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dedicated coils improve the signal to noise ratio, allowing for faster or higher resolution examinations. Transmit-receive coils can reduce heating at high field strength. Finally, novel radiofrequency coils can be used for assessment of tissue biochemistry, as seen with sodium MRI.
