In the literature, cardiac response associated with blunt chest trauma in children has been reported generally as case reports, and interventricular septal rupture due to trauma is quite rare. Interventricular septal rupture can develop even in the absence of visible signs of a trauma because of the flexibility of the chest structure in children. In the present case, a seven-year-old boy with interventricular septal rupture at the mid-muscular region and left ventricle pseudoaneurysm developed due to injury to the left anterior descending coronary artery after a traffic accident is reported. Patients with cardiac murmur detected on physical examination after a blunt chest trauma must be considered as cardiac injury, and in those with signs of ischemia detected on electrocardiography, it should not be forgotten that the coronary artery may be affected.
