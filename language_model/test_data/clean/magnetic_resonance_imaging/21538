The primary role of radiographic imaging in dental health has been the detection and localization of disease as a guide for surgical intervention. In this role, it appears to differ from the primary role of postcranial skeletal radiography, evaluation of the structural integrity of the bone. However, in both cases, the radiographic information ultimately is used in an attempt to restore or maintain function in the affected osseous structure. This structure-function relationship can be used as a framework within which the potential of new technologies developed for evaluation of the postcranial skeleton can be assessed relative to craniofacial imaging. Within this context, I treat first the use of newer imaging modalities, followed by methods to assess bone properties, and finally the coupling of these technologies with other analytic tools to obtain direct information about the structure-function relationship in the cranioskeleton.
