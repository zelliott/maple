Rheumatoid arthritis is a predominantly joint-based disease affecting approximately 1% of the world's population. This article will address the increasing use of both ultrasound and MRI in the diagnosis and monitoring of rheumatoid arthritis and will highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of these two imaging modalities, with particular reference to bone erosions and synovitis.

Because they can detect early disease, both ultrasound and MRI will become increasingly important in the diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis. Future studies with increased patient numbers will be necessary if one of these two modalities is to emerge as a clear winner as the imaging modality of choice.
