Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is clinically characterized by orthostatic headache and other symptoms caused by low cerebrospinal fluid pressure due to leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from dural punctures or other medical causes. The other symptoms are mainly due to traction of the cranial and spinal nerves owing to descent of the brain caused by low cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging is very useful in the diagnosis because of its characteristic findings. We describe the MRI findings in six cases that had variable clinical presentation.
