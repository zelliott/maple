A new magnetic resonance (MR) technique, gadolinium-enhanced subtraction MR imaging, was developed to evaluate the response of patients with osteosarcoma to chemotherapy. Ten patients, who had received chemotherapy for osteosarcoma of the lower extremity, underwent MR imaging 3 days before surgery. After routine MR imaging was performed, subtraction MR was performed in the plane in which the tumor was best visualized. With gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.1 mmol per kilogram) on a standard MR console, subtraction images were created by subtracting precontrast images from gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images. The time of maximal tumoral vascular uptake was 1 1/2 minutes after injection, and, therefore, the subtracted image obtained at this time was used for evaluation of viable tumor. Independently, radiologists and histopathologists examined their respective studies for viable tumor to differentiate responders from nonresponders. Four of 10 osteosarcomas were classified as good responders because they appeared as nonenhancing masses, with or without enhancing thin lines, or small nodules (< or = 3 mm wide). At histopathologic examination, all were good responders with less than 3% viable tumor. Six of 10 osteosarcomas were classified as nonresponders because they appeared as enhancing high-signal-intensity masses measuring more than 3 mm in width. Five tumors had between 18% and 43% viable tumor cells.
