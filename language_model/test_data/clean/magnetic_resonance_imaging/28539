Mixed tumors account for about 10% of the childhood central nervous system tumors. Studies of the most common tumor, the ganglioglioma, in patients of all ages suggest that optimal therapy is total gross resection. There are few studies on these tumors in children. In our institution between 1984 and 1993, 28 children with gangliogliomas (4 of which were anaplastic) and 4 children with dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors were treated and followed. Fourteen had local subarachnoid involvement. Total gross resection was usually curative, regardless of histology. Subarachnoid involvement was not indicative of a poorer prognosis.
