Meningioma of the internal auditory canal is very rare. There are only 15 previous reports of intracanalicular meningioma. The authors add a case report of a patient with meningioma of the internal auditory canal. A 31-year-old woman presented with a one-year history of headache, dizziness, hearing loss and left facial paralysis. An MRI of the temporal bone demonstrated a tiny isointense intracanalicular tumor with inhomogeneous enhancement. In the operative field carried out by translabyrinthine approach, the tumor was found in the IAC without intracranial involvement. Pathology revealed a meningioma. The patient was followed up for 2 years without recurrence.
