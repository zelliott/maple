To analyze a putative relationship between white matter lesions (WMLs), risk factors for WMLs, and Alzheimer disease (AD) as measured with the surrogate marker CSF Abeta42.

The authors analyzed effects of acquired risk factors for cerebrovascular disease and WMLs on AD as measured with an intermediate marker, CSF Abeta42. A total of 127 consecutive patients with subjective memory impairment (mean age 66 years; 57 women) investigated at a university-based memory clinic had brain MRI scans. WMLs were rated on a 12-point scale with a semiquantitative procedure. They used path analysis with established and possible risk factors for WMLs and for reduced CSF Abeta42 (age, hypertension, hyperhomocysteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, APOE-epsilon4) as variables.

The WML score was 1.5 points higher (p < 0.05) in hypertensive than in nonhypertensive patients and 1.9 points higher (p < 0.05) in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia than in those with normal homocysteine levels. Hypercholesterolemia increased the probability of low CSF Abeta42 levels by 0.2 (p < 0.05). For each point increase in WML score, the probability of low CSF Abeta42 levels increased by 0.03 (p < 0.05). APOE-epsilon4 was associated with reduced CSF Abeta42 (p < 0.01).

Both hypercholesterolemia and white matter lesions may contribute to low CSF Abeta42 by independent mechanisms.
