The field of inflammatory arthritis owes much to the advances in imaging technology which have enlightened not only clinical specialists but also researchers worldwide. The most exciting developments in recent decades have centred upon rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and more specifically the ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings at various stages of the natural history of this condition. Investigation of RA using the standard techniques of plain radiography (x-ray) and more sophisticated computerised tomography (CT) have now been superseded by the exponential growth of use of US and MRI and this has been born out by the profusion of scientific papers published on these subjects.This paper aims to review the array of imaging modalities available as investigative tools to the rheumatologist when presented with various clinical scenarios by patients with RA.
