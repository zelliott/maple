Sarcoidosis can affect the larynx as a manifestation of systemic disease or as isolated laryngeal involvement. Classically, laryngeal involvement affects the supraglottis, and less commonly the subglottis, and true vocal fold involvement is rare. The clinical course is often highlighted by frequent exacerbations and remissions that, when associated with vague complaints and constitutional symptoms, are probably the greatest contributor to delayed presentation and diagnosis. We describe an unusual case of sarcoidosis that presented after a long and protracted clinical course as an isolated submucosal vocal fold mass requiring deep biopsy for diagnosis. A review of the literature with emphasis on diagnosis, appropriate airway management, and treatment is presented.
