Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor (OFT) of soft parts is a benign soft tissue tumor commonly located in the extremities. In this paper, a 3-week-old boy presented with left nasal mass at birth. He was found to have an OFT involving the ethmoid sinus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of OFT in a newborn with involvement of the sinuses. This rare tumor should alert Pediatric Otolaryngologists to include it in the differential diagnosis of pediatric soft tissue tumors in sinuses.
