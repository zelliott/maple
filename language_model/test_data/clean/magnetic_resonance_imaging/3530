Improvement in both hardware and software has opened up new opportunities in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the shoulder. MR imaging at 3-T has become a reality, with the prospect of 7-T imaging on the horizon. The art of MR arthrography continues to improve, aided by the use of novel imaging positions. New techniques for three-dimensional imaging, the reduction of metal artifact, and biochemical imaging of cartilage hold great promise.
