MR neurography (MRN) has increasingly been used in clinical practice for the evaluation of peripheral nerve disease. This article reviews the historic perspective of MRN, the current imaging trends of this modality, and the future directions and applications that have shown potential for improved imaging and diagnostic capabilities.

MRN has come a long way in the past 2 decades. Excellent depiction of 3D nerve anatomy and pathology is currently possible. Further technical developments in diffusion-based nerve and muscle imaging, whole-body MRN, and nerve-specific MR contrast agents will likely play a major role in advancing this novel field and understanding peripheral neuromuscular diseases in the years to come.
