To evaluate the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features of uterine adenomyoma in comparison with histopathologic findings.

MR images of seven patients who had surgically proven uterine adenomyoma were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists in consensus regarding the morphologic appearance, including tumor size, location, margin, presence of concomitant adenomyosis, presence and signal intensity of cavity within tumor, and signal intensity and enhancement pattern of solid portion of tumor. MR imaging findings were correlated with histopathologic findings.

Tumor location was submucosal in three cases, subserosal in two, and mixed mural/subserosal in two. All tumors were well circumscribed on T2-weighted images and contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted images. In six cases, well defined cavities of high signal intensity, which reflected hemorrhagic cavities pathologically, were demonstrated within the tumors on T1-weighted images. Concomitant adenomyosis was observed in five cases. Solid portion of all tumors except hemorrhagic cavities exhibited iso-signal intensity on T1-weighted images, various signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and homogeneous enhancement on contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted images in five cases.

When MR imaging shows a well circumscribed mass with hemorrhagic cavities of high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and concomitant adenomyosis in the uterus, adenomyoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
