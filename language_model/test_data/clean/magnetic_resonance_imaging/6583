This article summarizes the magnetic resonance imaging features of glutaric aciduria type I (GA I) based on the cases presented at the 3rd International Workshop on Glutaryl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency together with a review of previously reported neuroimaging characteristics of GA I. Previous reports have focused on characteristic findings, such as basal ganglia injury and frontotemporal atrophy or hypoplasia, subdural effusions and white-matter disease. Most of these findings have been demonstrated in symptomatic children, i.e. after manifestation of acute encephalopathic crises. In contrast, prospective investigations in presymptomatically diagnosed children are rare. Since more recent investigations have highlighted CNS changes in patients without encephalopathic crises, systematic prospective investigations of neuroradiological findings in this disease are indispensable for a better understanding of this disease. Based on these findings a suggestion for a MRI protocol is presented, supporting a standardized evaluation of patients with GA I.
