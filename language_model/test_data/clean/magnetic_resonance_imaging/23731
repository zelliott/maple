A 26-year-old man with a previous history of external twin bursitis was remitted to our Department for a bone scintigraphy. Before the study, the patient performed an elevated number of intense sprints. Bone scintigraphy showed a bilaterally increased activity in both anterior rectum muscles suggesting rhabdomyolysis. Biochemical studies and MRT confirmed the diagnosis.
