A large meningioma located in the cerebellopontine angle was an unusual cause for contralateral trigeminal neuralgia. The mass effect displaced the basilar artery affecting the contralateral trigeminal nerve in vicinity of the brain stem. After radical microsurgical removal ot the tumour, the trigeminal neuralgia completely disappeared.
