We describe an infant in whom partial rhombencephalosynapsis was diagnosed by using MR imaging. The anterior vermis and nodulus were normally developed, but part of the posterior vermis was deficient. There was partial fusion of the hemispheres in the inferior part of the cerebellum. Partial rhombencephalosynapsis is described for the first time, and our findings support the recent embryologic observations.
