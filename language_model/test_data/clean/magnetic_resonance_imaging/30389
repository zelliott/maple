The assessment of forward stroke volume (SV) using dynamic, first-pass cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) was shown to be feasible in a limited number of studies with small numbers of subjects. The aim of this study was to compare first-pass derived SV with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)-obtained values in a larger population of subjects.

Fifty-nine subjects with varying degrees of cardiac function were studied. Stroke volume was assessed using oxygen-15-labeled water (H(2)(15)O) dynamic first-pass PET for both the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV), and compared with the findings of aorta velocity-encoded phase-contrast CMR. The PET-estimated SV was higher for the RV than for the LV (133 +/- 34 vs 116 +/- 31 mL, P < .01, +/- SD), and both were higher compared with values obtained by CMR (81 +/- 20 mL, both P < .01, +/- SD). Although significant, the correlations between PET and CMR were moderate for both the RV (r = 0.37, P < .01) and the LV (r = 0.40, P < .01, +/- SD). Bland-Altman analysis revealed a progressive overestimation with increasing SV measured in either ventricle.

First-pass dynamic H(2)(15)O PET for the assessment of forward SV is feasible, although values are progressively overestimated with increasing SV, particularly when the RV is used, and correlations with aorta velocity-encoded phase-contrast CMR are moderate. These findings are probably protocol-dependent and warrant further study before the use of first-pass dynamic H(2)(15)O PET in clinical or research settings can be advocated.
