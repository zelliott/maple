This study was carried out to assess the metabolic differences between pain-free control subjects and patients with low back pain, either with or without disc protrusion or herniation.

To analyze various metabolites in human cerebrospinal fluid using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The potential use of this technique as an additional tool for diagnostic assessment was also evaluated.

Inflammation is thought to play a major role in the generation of lumbar spine pain, a theory supported both by animal and in vitro studies. The effect of the inflammation in terms of increased metabolism has not yet been studied.

Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained from patients by lumbar puncture, frozen, redissolved, and analyzed for metabolites by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Significantly lower values for several key metabolites were found in patients with low back pain or sciatica, with the lowest values in the subgroup of patients with myelographic signs of disc protrusion or herniation.

The results indicate a higher level of metabolic activity in patients with low back pain or sciatica compared with pain-free control subjects, with this difference being most pronounced in the subgroup of patients with myelographic evidence of disc protrusion or herniation.
