Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is probably an under-reported cause of headache and other neurological symptoms.

We report six patients with this diagnosis and review the most recent literature on the topic.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is typically manifested by orthostatic headache and low opening pressure on lumbar puncture, but atypical presentations are frequently reported. Various imaging techniques may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis, and sometimes the precise point of leakage can be demonstrated. All our six patients had orthostatic headache; five had additional complaints. In four patients the diagnosis was verified by typical meningeal enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and in one patient computed tomographic myelography precisely revealed the leakage point. All six patients experienced relief of symptoms after conservative treatment. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a relatively benign syndrome, but it may be complicated by subdural haematomas. Connective tissue disorders may predispose for the condition.
