Many preterm infants require ongoing respiratory support despite treatment with exogenous surfactant. The reasons for this are unclear, but may involve one or a combination of changes in water content or distribution within the lung. Detailed three-dimensional information with the potential to provide quantitation of water content may help to investigate this further. We aimed to determine if magnetic resonance (MR) imaging could be developed to study lung disease in preterm infants. Appropriate MR sequences and procedures were defined and we found that T1 and proton density weighted images could be successfully acquired. The images contained three-dimensional information that could not be obtained using chest radiograph. MR imaging may be a useful method for studying the pathology of respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease in preterm infants.
