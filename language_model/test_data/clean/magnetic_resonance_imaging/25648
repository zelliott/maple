Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents are standard treatment for polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) respectively. Recent reports have emphasized a potentially successful regimen with intravenous immune gammaglobulins (IVIG). The short term success of this treatment in a personally observed case is described. IVIG treatment resulted in normalization of the serum concentrations of the muscle enzymes after continued inflammatory activity under treatment with azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in combination with corticosteroids. The improvement of PM by IVIG was further documented by an increase in muscle strength of up to 367% of the initial value and a regression of the myositic changes in the muscles of the thighs as evidenced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The therapeutic response was paralleled by reversal of peripheral lymphopenia. Experience with IVIG treatment in PM/DM is reviewed and the potential role of this regimen in the management of PM/DM is discussed.
