A case of congenital oligodendroglioma occurring in a 34th-gestational week fetus is reported. The tumor was necrotic, hemorrhagic, and gelatinous. It covered the basal part of the brain, and almost the entire cerebellum was replaced by the tumor. The tumor cells had small, round, hyperchromatic nuclei and watery clear cytoplasm, and were arranged in a paved or alveolar pattern. Immunohistochemically, S100 protein, myelin-basic protein, neuron-specific enolase and Leu 7 were weakly positive for the cytoplasm, but glial fibrilliary acidic protein, synaptophysin, neurofilament, desmin, and vimentin were negative. Many tumor cell nuclei were positive for mutant p53 protein, and the labeling index was 85%. But there was no genetic alteration in exons 4 to 9 of p53 gene from the peripheral blood. The apoptosis index was 1.5%. Considering the p53 labeling index and the apoptosis index together, this congenital oligodendroglioma may be regarded as potentially malignant despite the benign morphological features.
