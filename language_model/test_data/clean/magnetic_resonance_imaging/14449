We report four cases of biopsy proved cerebral amyloid angiopathy demonstrated by MR imaging. White matter signal hyperintensities on T2-weighted spin-echo pulse sequences were present in three patients. We believe the white matter lesions associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy are not specific to this disorder but rather reflect hypoperfusion of distal white matter resulting from vascular disease.
