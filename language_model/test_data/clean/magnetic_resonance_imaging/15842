The aim of this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to evaluate negative blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals during voluntary tongue movement. Deactivated (Negative BOLD) regions included the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), precuneus, and middle temporal gyrus. Activated (Positive BOLD) regions included the primary somatosensory-motor area (SMI), inferior parietal lobule, medial frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula, lentiform nucleus, and thalamus. The results were not consistent with previous studies involving unilateral hand and finger movements showing the deactivation of motor-related cortical areas including the ipsilateral MI. The areas of Negative BOLD in the PPC and precuneus might reflect specific neural networks relating to voluntary tongue movement.
