The patient presented with neurofibromatosis and a dystrophic kyphoscoliosis around the cervico-thoracic junction. When the patient was 59 years old, he started to suffer from dyspnea caused by an intrathoracic meningocele in the upper left thoracic cavity. A wide laminectomy from T2 to T5 was performed and the meningocele was resected. Although the dyspnoea disappeared postoperatively, the patient started to neurologically deteriorate. Laminectomy alone caused instability around the apex of the kyphosoliosis and spinal cord compression. Halo cast was applied and brought remarkable recovery of neurologic deficits. This result encouraged us to perform posterior fusion in situ from C3 to L2 with bone graft from the iliac crests and the Luque technique in conjunction with the Isola system. This resulted in the patient being able to walk again. The removal of the posterior element predisposes the patient to unstable postlaminectomy kyphosis and removes valuable bone stock required for posterior spinal fusion. For this reason, spinal fusion should have been conducted during surgery for the patient's meningocele.
