The incidence of neurological abnormalities in patients with sebaceous naevi may not be as high as has been previously accepted. One hundred and ninety-six patients with epidermal naevi of the sebaceous type were examined for clinical neurological abnormalities. Ninety-three per cent of these patients were neurologically normal on examination. Extensive naevi were present in 21% (3/14) of patients with neurological abnormalities and in 5% (9/182) of those without. A centrofacial location of the naevus was found in 21% (3/14) of patients with abnormalities and in 2% (4/182) of neurologically normal patients. A surprising finding was the low yield of abnormalities from neuroimaging in the patients with clinical neurological abnormalities. Imaging was performed in eight of the 14 and was normal in six patients. Despite the lower than expected rate of associated abnormalities and the low yield of abnormal findings from imaging, it is strongly recommended that all patients with sebaceous naevi have a detailed neurological assessment and that imaging be performed on all those in whom clinical abnormalities are demonstrated, as well as on those patients with large naevi involving the centrofacial area.
