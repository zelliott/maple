Camptocormia, known also as "bent spine syndrome", is characterized by involuntary truncal flexion of the thoraco-lumbar spine that appears in the sitting or standing position. Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most frequent etiologic factor, this postural disorder responds poorly to levodopa or other medications. We report a PD patient in whom chronic bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation produced a striking alleviation of camptocormia.
