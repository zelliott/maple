This review is concerned with diagnostics, surgical and orthopedic treatment of fresh and long-standing Achilles tendon rupture. Despite seemingly easy diagnostics, different authors indicate that 15-29% of Achilles tendon rupture escape timely recognition which leads to inadequate treatment and its poor outcome. Hence, the importance of clinical tests permitting to improve diagnostics bearing in mind that such expensive methods as MRT are not readily available. We describe all (to our knowledge) clinical tests for the purpose as well as X-ray, ultrasonic, and MRT diagnostics (including differential) of Achilles tendon rupture.
