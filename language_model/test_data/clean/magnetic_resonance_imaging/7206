Twenty consecutive patients with chronic partial seizures with onset before twenty years of age were investigated by means of 0.5 T MRI (20) and HM-PAO (19) in order to identify focal alterations amenable to surgical therapy. MRI evidentiated parenchymal lesions in 7 patients. Findings consistent with unilateral medial temporal sclerosis and cortico-subcortical parietal scars were found in two patients each. Small solid nodular lesions in the temporal lobe were observed in two patients. These and one additional patient with nodular partially cystic lesions in temporal lobe were administered a paramagnetic contrast agent (Gadolinium DPA) intravenously. In one case a contrast enhancement was observed. Histologic examination post surgery revealed a low grade glioma in one patient. HM-PAO SPECT examination showed area of abnormal captation in 9 of 19 patients. Aspects of EEG correlation with the MRI and SPECT findings are discussed. Our data supported the usefulness of magnetic resonance and SPECT imaging in the completion of pre-surgical assessment in this kind of patients.
