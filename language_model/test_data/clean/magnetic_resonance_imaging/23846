Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the pre-eminent modality for the detection and characterization of central nervous system pathology. However, in a variety of disease processes, histopathologic studies have often shown more extensive abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord than could be detected on conventional MR images. Magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) can be used qualitatively to augment differences between tissues and to accentuate gadolinium enhancement. Additionally, MTC may be used quantitatively to characterize tissues and potentially to detect otherwise microscopic disease.
