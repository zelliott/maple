Tripositive gadolinium-ion doped NIR-to-NIR upconverting paramagnetic nanoparticles are efficiently detected are NIR imaging techniques but can also provide efficient "positive" contrast in MRI. On page 1478 John A. Capobianco, Marc-Andr√© Fortin, and co-workers show that citrate-coated nanoparticles present the lowest relaxometric ratios reported for NaGdF4 nanoparticle suspensions. IV-injected nanoparticles evidence long blood retention times in mice while biodistribution studies show elimination through the reticuloendothelial and urinary systems.
