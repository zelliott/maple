Low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma is a recently defined tumor that is part of the spectrum of malignant mesenchymal tumors, showing features of myofibroblastic differentiation. These tumors occur most commonly in the head and neck regions, especially in the tongue, and less frequently in the limbs, trunk, and abdominal/pelvic cavity. We describe a 51-year-old woman with a low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma. The distal phalanx of the finger was amputated with a clear surgical margin. The treatment of this tumor should include a simple local excision with free surgical margins and a long clinical follow-up period with imaging studies. At the 28-month follow-up evaluation the patient was free from this tumor.
