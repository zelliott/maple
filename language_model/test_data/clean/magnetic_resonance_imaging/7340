We report a patient with myxoid liposarcoma of the spermatic cord in whom combined use of both ultrasound (US) and MRI helped to suggest the diagnosis. The lesion was solid at US and vascularized at color Doppler. T1-weighted MRI did not show fat within it; on T2-weighted images it had high signal intensity, with a cyst-like appearance. It is known that fat-poor myxoid liposarcomas with high water content may mimic a cystic lesion on non-contrast-enhanced MR; then, a combination of MRI findings, suggesting a cyst, and of US findings, showing the mass was actually solid and vascularized, allowed preoperatively the diagnosis of fat-poor myxoid liposarcoma.
