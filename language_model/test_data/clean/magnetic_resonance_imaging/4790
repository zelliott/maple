A stereotactic device (SDM) was developed for performing consistent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the rat brain. The SDM was developed by adapting a radiofrequency transmit/receive head coil of 4.4 cm inner diameter (quadrature birdcage head coil), and utilizing partial acrylic construction for the positioning elements. The small head coil provides improved resolution and accuracy of the image, while the stereotactic holder permits repeatable and accurate imaging of identified brain structures. This system provides several advantages over existing experimental MRI devices. The SDM ensures that the head is always placed in the center of the coil in a uniform fashion. Standardized positioning of the skull optimizes image quality and provides a consistent orientation of the brain. In addition, a widely-utilized coordinate system described by Paxinos and Watson can be employed to assist in the identification of structures and to facilitate surgical planning. The SDM is compatible with a recently-developed stereotactic device for radiosurgery with the Gamma Knife, thus permitting the planning and performance of experimental radiosurgery using the same coordinate system. The SDM also provides the ability to perform MRI and radiosurgery at different times, thus avoiding the need for prolonged anesthesia during an experimental study. Finally, the SDM allows repeated MRI of the same, identifiable positions in the brain during longitudinal experimental studies. The utility of this device is demonstrated here by examining the time course of cerebral damage that evolved within a radiosurgical focus after gamma irradiation.
