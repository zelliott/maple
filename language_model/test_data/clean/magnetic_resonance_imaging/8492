The rare coexistence of intramuscular myxoma (IM) and fibrous dysplasia (FD) is known as Mazabraud's syndrome. IM tends to occur multifocally and is associated most frequently with polyostotic FD in Mazabraud's syndrome. We present an extremely rare combination of a solitary IM and monostotic FD as a variant of Mazabraud's syndrome, and discuss the importance of recognizing this rare coexistence for appropriate management of the patient.
