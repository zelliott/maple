This study was designed to evaluate pulse sequences and patient positioning for MR imaging of silicone breast implants in patients. One hundred forty-three patients (281 silicone implants) underwent imaging over a 21-month period. The combination of a T2-weighted fast spin echo technique (SE), T2-weighted fast SE with water suppression, and T1-weighted SE with fat suppression is recommended to reliably differentiate silicone from other breast tissues and to identify intracapsular and extracapsular ruptures or leaks. Seventy of the 143 patients underwent removal of their silicone implants. The sensitivity for detection of silicone implant rupture was 76%, with a specificity of 97%. Positioning the patient prone improved image quality.
