Ossification of the ligamenta flava (OLF) and posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) of the spine causing spinal cord compression is described mainly in Japanese patients and is often termed as 'Japanese disease'. We are reporting a case of OLF of the thoracic spine seen in a male Caucasian who presented with an intractable intercostal pain. This is the first case report of OLF in a Caucasian.
