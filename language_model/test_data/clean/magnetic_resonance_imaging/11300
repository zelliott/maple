This study examined the effects of a recently developed automated intensity non-uniformity correction on surface coil images using the orbit as an exemplar. Images were obtained using a standard head coil and a range of surface coils. Slices through the optic nerve head and cavernous sinus were subjected to the correction algorithm. Blind forced-choice rankings of the subjective image quality were performed. Quantitative measurements were taken of the similarity between vitreous humor at two depths from the coil, and of the conspicuity between orbital fat and temporalis muscle intensities. The combined qualitative ranks for corrected surface coil images were higher than for the equivalent uncorrected images in all cases. Intensity non-uniformity correction produced statistically significant improvements in orbital surface coil images, bringing their intensity uniformity in homogeneous tissue to the level of head coil images. The subjective quality of the corrected surface coil images was superior to head coil images, due to increased spatial resolution combined with improved signal to noise ratio across the image.
