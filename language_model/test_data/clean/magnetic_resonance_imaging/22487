To investigate the potential utility of magnetic resonance (MR)-visible coatings for passive visualization of therapeutic endovascular devices such as catheters and guidewires.

Using a multistep coating process, gadolinium-based coatings were applied to commercially available off-the-shelf catheters and guidewires. These coated devices were imaged in phantoms made of fat-free yogurt, saline, and whole blood and also in live canine aorta on a 1.5-T cardiovascular MR scanner using T1-weighted two-dimensional radiofrequency (RF)-spoiled gradient-recalled echo, two-dimensional spin echo, and three-dimensional RF-spoiled gradient-recalled echo techniques.

Commercially available off-the shelf catheters (4, 5, and 6 French) and guidewires (0.038 inch) were clearly visualized in all phantoms and canine aorta and the coatings proved to be durable and imageable without degradation in signal intensity up to 24 hours. MR-visible coatings address some of the shortcomings that have previously limited the role of MR as a guidance tool.

Both in vitro and in vivo visualization of therapeutic endovascular devices coated with MR-visible coatings are found to be clinically viable.
