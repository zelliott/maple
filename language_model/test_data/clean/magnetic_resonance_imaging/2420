The purpose of this study was to elucidate the roles of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), conventional US, CT, and MRI in differential diagnosis of gallbladder wall thickening. We scrutinized images for the presence of the multiple-layer patterns of the thickened gallbladder walls during preoperative images (EUS, n = 22; US, n = 23; CT, n = 20; MRI, n = 15) and retrospectively correlated them with surgical results in 25 patients. The pathological diagnoses included 7 gallbladder cancers, 9 cases of chronic cholecystitis, 5 cases of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, and 4 cases of adenomyomatosis. Multiple-layer patterns of gallbladder wall were observed in patients with inflammatory and benign diseases by US, EUS, CT, and MRI. This pattern was demonstrated by EUS more efficiently compared with other means of imaging. All subjects with loss of multiple layers were finally diagnosed by use of EUS as having gallbladder cancer at surgery. Loss of multiple-layer patterns of the gallbladder wall demonstrated by EUS was the most specific finding in diagnosing gallbladder cancer.
