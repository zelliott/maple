The authors report a case of uterine leiomyomas diagnosed during the first trimester of pregnancy. The most unusual presentation of this observation did not allow any diagnosis through clinical exam, either by sonographic and X ray technics (magnetic resonance imaging, computer tomography) or by the classical histological study. The intra abdominal tumors compatible with imagery are argued: ovarian cyst, gelatinous disease of the peritoneum, desmoid tumor, lymphoma, lymphangiomyoma. The right diagnosis has been established as a last resort to immunocytochemistry.
