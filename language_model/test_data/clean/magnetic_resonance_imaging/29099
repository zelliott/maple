The possibilities of neurosonography (NSG) application in the diagnosis of tumors of the brain were studied in 16 children of the age from 1 month to 2 years. Standard NSG age indices for principal anatomic brain compartments as well as both direct and indirect diagnostic signs of tumors are presented. It is shown that NSG is a method of choice in screening of children of early age for brain tumor. This permits both to find it on an early stage, before the development of the pronounced cerebral and dislocation syndromes, and to make a grounded choice of surgical policy.
