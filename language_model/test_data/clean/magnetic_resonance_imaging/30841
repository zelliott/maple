The management of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations continues to be challenged by a lack of understanding and control of pathophysiological processes implied in the clinical symptoms. New data from functional MRI with diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted and neuronal activation highlight abnormal brain areas near or remote to the AVM nidus. Moreover, these techniques are able to show hemodynamic and neuronal adaptative phenomena involved in brain plasticity. They reflect the instantaneous hemodynamic brain conditions that may help to correlate the clinical symptoms with the anatomical and functional substratum and to influence any invasive therapy.
