With the advance of stem cell transplantation research, in vivo cell tracking techniques have become increasingly important in recent years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide a unique tool for non-invasive tracking of transplanted cells. Since the initial findings on the stem cell migration by MRI several years ago, there have been numerous studies using various animal models, notably in heart or brain disease models. In order to develop more reliable and clinically applicable methodologies, multiple aspects should be taken into consideration. In this review, we will summarize the current status and future perspectives of in vivo cell tracking technologies using MRI. In particular, use of different MR contrast agents and their detection methods using MRI will be described in much detail. In addition, various cell labeling methods to increase the sensitivity of signals will be extensively discussed. We will also review several key experiments, in which MRI techniques were utilized to detect the presence and/or migration of transplanted stem cells in various animal models. Finally, we will discuss the current problems and future directions of cell tracking methods using MRI.
