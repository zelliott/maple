We report a case of transient nonketotic hyperglycinaemia in which radiography correlated closely with clinical and biochemical findings. Only 5 patients have been previously described with this transient from of nonketotic hyperglycinaemia. Among the radiographic findings, thinning of the corpus callosum is the most characteristic.
