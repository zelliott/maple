Between 1986 and 1988 100 patients in whom MRI had been used to diagnose prolapses of lumbar intervertebral discs were admitted to the neurosurgical department of the Munich Technical University. MRI proved to be a valuable diagnostic technique, even if one has to concede certain limitations to the usefulness of the results when compared to conventional methods, particularly in such cases where clinical symptoms are not clear. Typical findings are illustrated and compared with those seen in MRI, whose relative importance is discussed.
