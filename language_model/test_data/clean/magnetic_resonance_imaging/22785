Spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) is a rare entity and post-traumatic cervical SSDH is very rare. Review of the literature revealed 8 reported cases of traumatic SSDH and only 2 were cervical. The exact mechanism and pathogenesis of SSDHs are unclear. There are still controversies about the source of bleeding and mechanisms of formation of a hematoma. Here we report a case of a unique traumatic craniocervical junction focal subdural hematoma in an 8-year-old boy and discuss the possible mechanisms of SSDHs in trauma cases.
