Magnetic resonance imaging is a routine investigation in cases of asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss, but it is not routinely used to investigate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.

This case report illustrates the benefits of magnetic resonance image scanning in the latter patient group.

A 53-year-old man with rapidly progressive, symmetrical, bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss was found also to have anosmia, imbalance and incoordination. Magnetic resonance image scanning demonstrated leptomeningeal haemosiderosis. Progressive, bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss is the most common presentation of this condition and magnetic resonance imaging is the diagnostic investigation of choice.

There are potential treatments for leptomeningeal haemosiderosis which prevent further irreversible damage, if a bleeding source can be found. Hearing loss may be due to cochlear or retrocochlear pathology. Cochlear implantation may be indicated.
