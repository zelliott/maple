Recent progress in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has successfully visualized neuronal migration disorders (NMDs) without autopsy. NMDs are observed in the patients with hydranencephaly, porencephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, agenesis of corpus callosum, agenesis of septum pellucidum and holoprocencephaly. Miller-Dieker syndrome, Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy, Walker-Warburg syndrome, hypomelanosis of Ito, congenital rubella syndrome, toxoplasmosis, Zellweger syndrome and other diseases are also associated with lissencephaly, pachygyria and polymicrogyria. Neuroimagings of illustrative cases with NMDs were shown here.
