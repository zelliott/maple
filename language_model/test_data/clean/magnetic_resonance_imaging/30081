Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the most common parasitic infestation of the central nervous system worldwide. In patients presenting with acute hydrocephalus due to intraventricular NCC, surgery is the only option. Still, there is no consensus regarding the optimal surgical strategy, although neuroendoscopic excision is a promising method. However, the literature regarding the use of this modality in fourth ventricular NCC is scarce. The authors describe a series of patients with fourth ventricular NCC treated endoscopically.

The clinical records of 13 patients with fourth ventricular NCC who had presented with hydrocephalus were retrospectively analyzed. A fourth ventricular cyst was completely excised in all patients by using a transventricular, transaqueductal "scope-in-scope" endoscopic technique. Twelve endoscopic third ventriculostomies and 1 septostomy had been performed.

Shunt placement was avoided in all patients. There were minimal peri- and postoperative complications. The mean duration of follow-up was 22.3 months (range 3-41 months). All patients had an improved clinical outcome. Follow-up neuroimaging revealed no residual lesion and a decreased ventricle size in all patients.

The present series of patients with fourth ventricular NCC is the largest in the existing English-language medical literature. Endoscopic fourth ventricular cysticercal cyst excision along with internal cerebrospinal fluid diversion via endoscopic third ventriculostomy is an effective alternative to open microneurosurgical procedures and avoids shunt placement and its related complications.
