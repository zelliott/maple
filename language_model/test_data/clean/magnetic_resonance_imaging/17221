Not all patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) respond equally to available disease modifying agents (DMA). Rational and reliable criteria are needed to identify responders and non responders in order to optimize the treatment. Natural history of the disease, clinical evolution and magnetic resonance imaging are the putative indicators to be considered with this respect, but neutralizing antibodies, possible immunological markers and pathological or genetic diversity may also represent future additional indicators. Clinical recommendations and consensus criteria for defining a suboptimal response to DMA have been proposed by different international panels of experts, but all need validation in experimental settings to provide solid guidelines for establishing when and how to take action on MS treatment with DMA.
