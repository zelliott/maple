We report a patient with a clinical history and neurologic examination consistent with acute stroke. Diffusion-weighted and fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI obtained 4 hours after stroke onset detected focal abnormalities suggestive of acute ischemic brain damage. The neurologic deficit and the imaging abnormalities both resolved completely at follow-up. This patient illustrates complete resolution of early changes observed with diffusion-weighted MRI at the hyperacute phase in a TIA.
