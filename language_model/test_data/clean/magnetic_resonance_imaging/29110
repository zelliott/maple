Neurotoxic intrathecal chemotherapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) affects developing structures and functions of memory and learning subsystems selectively. Results show significant reductions in magnetic resonance imaging morphometry of mamillary bodies, components of the corticolimbic-diencephalic subsystem subserving functionally later developing, single-trial memory, nonsignificant changes in bilateral heads of the caudate nuclei, components of the corticostriatal subsystem subserving functionally earlier developing, multitrial learning, significant reductions in prefrontal cortical volume, visual and verbal single-trial memory deficits, and visuospatial, but not verbal, multitrial learning deficits. Multiple regression models provide evidence for partial dissociation and connectivity between the subsystems, and suggest that greater involvement of caudate may compensate for inefficient corticolimbic-diencephalic components.
