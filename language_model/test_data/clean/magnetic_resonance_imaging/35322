Although multidetector row computed tomography is not the primary method of evaluating breast cancer, it could be performed as an excellent alternative, especially in the presence of magnetic resonance contraindications. Moreover, computed tomography can still have an important role in evaluation of nodal status, thoracic invasion, and distant metastasis because of the large area covered in a single examination. Our experience together with literature indicates that multidetector row computed tomography is a powerful supplementary method for evaluation of patients with breast cancer.
