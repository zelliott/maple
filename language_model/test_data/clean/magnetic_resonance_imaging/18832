In this paper the author showed possibilities for adaptation of the most present-day medical achievements in the field of noninvasive diagnosis of individual characteristics of human skeleton pathology--at crime detection and during criminalistic identification particularly. The identification value of image diagnosis for individual characteristics of the pathologically changed skeleton has been exemplified with: X-ray radiography, both conventional and computer-assisted tomography, scintigraphy, ultrasonography and nuclear magnetic resonance tomography. The paper's conclusion is formulating of new definitions for identification method of individuals, based on image diagnosis--named osteopathoscopy--which can be an alternative method to controversial radiology.
