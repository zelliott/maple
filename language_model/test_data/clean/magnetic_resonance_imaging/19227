The 3-D ventricle model in this study was reconstructed from a series of MRI torso cross-section data. We used a 3-D voxel array to represent the ventricle. As in cardiac simulations proposed by previous studies, the activation sequence and body surface ECG were simulated in this model. But to reduce the amount of elements in the model, so that the amount of parameters in the model can be handled numerically, we propose another approach to simulate cardiac activity. A mesh model was constructed on the closed surface formed by epicardiac and endocardiac surfaces of the ventricle. We propose a method to simulate the activation sequence on the epicardiac and endocardiac surfaces of the mesh model. As with the uniform double layer theorem, body surface ECG can be estimated in terms of epicardiac and endocardiac surface current source. Consequently, we can also generate ECG waveforms corresponding to this mesh simulation. Both the depolarization sequence and ECG simulated by the mesh model resemble those generated by the 3-D voxel model. However, the mesh model greatly simplified the process of ECG simulation. Both the simulation of depolarization and ECG estimation were expressed in terms of clear and simple mathematical representations. Consequently, we can analytically investigate the effects of the mesh model's parameters on the cardiac activation sequence and ECG. It could be a useful tool to numerically study the relation of ECG waveforms and electrical activity of the heart.
