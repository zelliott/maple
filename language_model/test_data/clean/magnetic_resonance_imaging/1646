A case of posterior fossa hemangioblastoma simulating arachnoid cyst on imaging and peroperatively is presented. In vivo proton MR spectroscopy showed evidence of large lactate and resonance at 2.37 ppm not observed earlier in the cystic lesions, including arachnoid cyst. The demonstration of this resonance may help in characterization of these lesions that may be confused with arachnoid cysts on imaging and during surgery.
