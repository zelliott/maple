In reports of diagnostic methods in disorders of the spine focus is centred on diagnostic resolution, while psychological effects and patients' discomfort are often disregarded. To get a comprehensive picture of the appropriateness of a new technology the latter factors need to be explored and included in an assessment. In a prospective study, eight patients with signs of lumbar disc herniation underwent myelography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. A structured patient interview on attitudes to these technologies was carried out after all three examinations had been carried out. Myelography was most often reported painful and unpleasant among the three modalities. Discomfort due to magnetic resonance imaging stem from the narrow calibre of the machine and the noise. In computed tomography immobilization was the main reason for discomfort. Altogether most patients preferred computed tomography. In view of the fact that myelography must be considered as diagnostically inferior to the other two examinations, the reported discomfort from myelography indicates that computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging should be the primary examinations for patients with lumbar disc herniation.
