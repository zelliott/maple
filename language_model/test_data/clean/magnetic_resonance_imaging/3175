Electrophysiological recording during in vivo NMR imaging for correlation of electrophysiological events with changes in NMR parameters has, until now, not been satisfactory. Here we present a method that uses specially prepared calomel electrodes for the continuous monitoring of both cortical steady potential and EEG during in vivo NMR imaging studies of experimental animal models. In order to demonstrate the reliability of this approach we elicited single episodes of cortical spreading depression in rats by intracortical potassium acetate injection, using an intracerebral micropipette. During the passage of DC potential shifts and associated reduction in EEG amplitude, hyperintense regions, reflecting the progression of cortical spreading depression over the cortex, were visible in diffusion-weighted images of the rat brains. No susceptibility artifacts due to the electrodes and micropipette were visible in the NMR data. Thus, we have demonstrated under controlled experimental conditions, that electrophysiological recording with calomel electrodes can be performed simultaneously with diffusion-weighted NMR imaging. The described method enables further NMR investigations of phenomena which are detectable by electrophysiology.
