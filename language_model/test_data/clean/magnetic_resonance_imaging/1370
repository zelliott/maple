Preoperative magnetic resonance images of three acute Achilles tendon ruptures were correlated with the findings observed during surgical repair of the tendon. Specific comparisons were made regarding the condition (shredded, uniform, etc.) and orientation (antegrade, retrograde, etc.) of the torn fibers, and the width of the diastasis (with and without ankle flexion) between the ends of the tendon. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) accurately assessed all of these parameters.
