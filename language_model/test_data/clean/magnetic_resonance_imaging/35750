In recent years MRI has developed into an imaging modality with great potential for several medical disciplines including radiotherapy. A feature of particular relevance to radiotherapy is the possibility to depict arbitrarily orientated slices. Using multislice imaging techniques one can determine and describe tumour volume and extension in several directions. By doing so prior to and during radiotherapy it is possible to monitor response to treatment. In this case report of a patient treated for carcinoma of the uterine cervix the use of this MRI information is demonstrated.
