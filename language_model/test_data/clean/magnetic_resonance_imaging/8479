Spinal vascular diseases are rare and constitute only 1% to 2% of all vascular neurologic pathologies. In this article, the following vascular pathologies of the spine are described: spinal arterial infarcts, spinal cavernomas, and arteriovenous malformations (including perimedullary fistulae and glomerular arterivenous malformations), and spinal dural arteriovenous fistulae. This article gives an overview about their imaging features on MRI, MR angiography, and digital subtraction angiography. Clinical differential diagnoses, the neurologic symptomatology, and the potential therapeutic approaches of these diseases, which might vary depending on the underlying pathologic condition, are given.
