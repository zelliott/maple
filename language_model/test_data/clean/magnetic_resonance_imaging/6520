Pulmonary blood flow is one of the primary determinants of gas exchange. While a number of methods can be used to evaluation pulmonary perfusion, these have substantial limitations. In this paper, we discuss the use of magnetic resonance imaging techniques for the evaluation of pulmonary blood flow. While these methods are not commonly used at present, they have the potential to contribute greatly to the evaluation of suspected pulmonary vascular disease.
