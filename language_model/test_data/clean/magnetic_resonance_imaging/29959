To evaluate the effects of transarterial administration of an integrin antagonist, GRGDSP (Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro), combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) to treat hepatic carcinoma in rats.

Walker-256 tumor was implanted beneath the liver capsule in 26 Wistar rats. Animal subjects were assigned to groups based on which treatment was injected into the hepatic artery: group A, GRGDSP + TACE; group B, TACE alone; and group C, normal saline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tumor pathology, and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess each treatment.

The ratios of the post-treatment to pretreatment tumor volumes (V2/V1) in groups A, B, and C were 4.42 +/- 0.48, 6.98 +/- 1.09, and 13.00 +/- 1.68, respectively. The metastatic potential of the tumors was assessed by tumor cell nest counts, which were 5.00 +/- 1.25, 6.63 +/- 1.60, and 7.22 +/- 1.92 in groups A, B, and C, respectively. Microvessel density (MVD) was quantified by measuring von Willebrand factor density values, which were 0.18 +/- 0.02, 0.22 +/- 0.02, and 0.23 +/- 0.02 in groups A, B, and C, respectively.

Transarterial infusion of GRGDSP combined with TACE noticeably inhibited the growth of hepatic carcinoma and intrahepatic metastases in rats.
