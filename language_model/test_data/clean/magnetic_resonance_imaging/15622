A 54-year-old man with an underlying AIDS experienced fever and lethargy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple small ring-enhancement lesions over pons, basal ganglion, thalami, and bilateral cerebral hemisphere. Because of the concurrent pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), presumptive diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis and brain tuberculoma was made. The patient's condition clinically improved after a 3-month anti-TB treatment coupled with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and his CD4-T lymphocyte count was increased from 17 cells/mm(3) (HIV viral load, 294,000 copies per milliliter) to 153 cells/mm(3) (HIV viral load, 5930 copies per milliliter). However, the follow-up MRI disclosed disappearance of some old brain lesions and development of some new ones; some previously identified tuberculoma became smaller in size, while some other enlarger. Of note, ring-enhanced brain lesions were found over the left frontal lobe and left posterior fossa with perifocal edema and hyperintensity in diffusion weighted MRI indicating abscess formation. Steroid was added based on the presumed paradoxical reaction of brain tuberculoma. Complete resolution of brain lesions was found on MRI 9 months later. Tuberculoma should be considered in a patient with AIDS with numerous intracranial lesions if TB involving other site(s) is definitively diagnosed, especially when the patient is receiving prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and/or serologically negative for toxoplasmosis. Our report demonstrated the peculiar phenomenon of paradoxical reaction of brain tuberculoma during immune reconstitution and strengthens the belief that additional use of steroids for paradoxical reaction of brain tuberculoma is indicated after exclusion of other causes for the progressively enlarging brain lesions.
