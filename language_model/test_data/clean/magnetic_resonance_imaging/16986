Sacroiliitis caused by Salmonella typhi is rare. In India, unilateral sacroiliitis is usually caused by tuberculosis. We report a 22-year-old man who presented with a high-grade fever and positive blood culture for Salmonella typhi. The patient was treated with intravenous vancomycin and levofloxacin for 15 days and then oral levofloxacin for 6 weeks.
