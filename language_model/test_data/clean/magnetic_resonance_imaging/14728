Conjoined twins are rare. High-quality imaging techniques are essential for proper first-trimester diagnosis. Technological development leads to new imaging techniques such as 3-dimensional virtual embryoscopy. The aim of this review was to explore imaging techniques used in the first-trimester diagnosis of conjoined twins and provide a systematic diagnostic table for making this diagnosis.

A PubMed literature search was performed using the terms ultrasound, Doppler, MRI, and CT combined with first-trimester and conjoined twins. Three recent cases at our department are reviewed and examined additionally using 3-dimensional virtual embryoscopy.

The different types of conjoined twins are summarized in a table for practical use during ultrasound examination. In evaluating conjoined twins, 2-dimensional ultrasound is the criterion standard. Three-dimensional and Doppler ultrasounds add anatomical and prognostic information. Virtual embryoscopy imaging reveals additional findings in our 3 cases not seen with routine 2-dimensionalultrasound examination.

Each case of conjoined twins is unique and should be evaluated with the best possible imaging techniques. Three-dimensional and Doppler ultrasound should be added to the systematic diagnostic evaluation of conjoined twins. Virtual embryoscopy imaging may contribute to earlier, more appropriate counseling and management of these pregnancies.
