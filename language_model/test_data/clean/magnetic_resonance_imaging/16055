Hyperglycemic status may be rarely complicated by Epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) that usually responds to metabolic normalization. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD-Ab) play a pivotal role in the autoimmune process that leads to clinical onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). GAD-Ab have been recently reported in association with rare forms of refractory epilepsy, with or without association to T1DM. Here we describe a young patient who developed EPC five months after T1DM onset; GAD-Ab were detected in his cerebrospinal fluid with evidence of oligoclonal bands. His epileptic disorder evolved over time into drug-resistant epilepsy with continuous spike-waves during slow sleep and severe behavioral impairment. The role of both metabolic imbalance and GAD autoimmunity is discussed.
