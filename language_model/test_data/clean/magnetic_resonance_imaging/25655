In 4 fresh specimens and in 14 healthy volunteers we studied normal anatomy of the glenoid labrum by MRI. In a total of 124 patients we examined the shoulder joints by MRI. 69 patients had any kind of subacromial pathology. 55 patients showed a glenohumeral instability. All MRI findings were compared with the surgical findings during arthroscopy and during open surgery. 44 patients showed a recurrent anterior instability, 7 patients showed a multidirectional instability, 2 patients showed a posterior instability, and 2 patients presented acute anterior dislocation. We found significant variability in the labral shape as well as significant variability of anterior capsular attachment. The pathologic changes of the glenoid labrum were classified in four different types. In 78% we found a concomitant Hill-Sachs lesion of various diameter. 5 patients suffered from an additional complete rotator cuff tear. Compared to the intraoperative findings MRI had a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 94%, an accuracy of 94%, a positive predictive value of 91%, and a negative predictive value of 96% in detecting labral pathology.

Presenting a high diagnostic value for detecting Bankart lesions, MRI may replace other diagnostic modalities like CT-arthrography.
