To evaluate the significance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2(*) value analysis in patients with iron overload and compare it with other clinical parameters.

A total of 53 patients with suspected iron overload were recruited from four Beijing hospitals from December 2010 to December 2012. Their liver and heart T2(*) values were calculated and their serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation, blood transfusion volume and other clinical parameters were recorded and analyzed.

There were 37 males and 16 females with a medium age of 50 years(15-72 years). Their etiologies included myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, n = 25), aplastic anemia (AA, n = 16), myelofibrosis (n = 5), hemochromatosis (n = 2) and β thalassaemia (n = 2), and 3 patients with high SF values were found on regular health examinations. Among them, there were transfusion history (n = 45), SF>1000 µg/L (n = 49), sign of iron overload (n = 10), abnormal liver function (n = 38) and hyperglycemia (n = 32). T2(*) value analysis showed that 10 patients had no evidence of iron overload, 43 patients had liver iron overload (14 mild, 22 moderate and 7 severe) and 2 patients had heart iron overload (1 MDS with heavy transfusion history and 1 AA with heart failure). No relations existed between T2(*) value and SF (P = 0.050) , T2(*) value and transfusion volume (P = 0.820) , and liver T2(*) value and heart T2(*) value (P = 0.129) .

MRI T2(*) value is an accurate way of quantitative detection of iron overload. It provides a comprehensive understanding of patients with iron overload in conjunctions with MRI T2(*) value and other clinical parameters.
