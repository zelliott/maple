The objective of our study was to use MRI to show the cardiac morphology and function of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy after percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation.

Black blood T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced fast inversion recovery gradient-echo images displayed ablated septal myocardium until 35 weeks after percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation. Central hypointense areas were observed on MRI in patients until 4 weeks after ablation. Black blood and cine steady-state free precession MRI were used to assess the decreased septal wall thickness and diameter of the left atrium after ablation as well as the reduced motion of the ablated region. MRI may be useful for evaluation of cardiac structural, signal, and functional changes associated with percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation.
