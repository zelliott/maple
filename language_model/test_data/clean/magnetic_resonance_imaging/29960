Synovial sarcoma most commonly affects adults in the third to fifth decades of life, and is the most common sarcoma of the foot. The tumors are encapsulated and frequently in contact with bone. Because there are often few anatomical barriers, malignant spread to surrounding nerves and vasculature is common. This article discusses the case of a young patient who presented to the foot and ankle clinic with soft tissue swelling in the right foot, and the imaging protocol for such a patient. A literature review of synovial sarcoma is also presented.
