Gangliogliomas are tumors of mixed glial and neuronal phenotype that usually have a benign clinical course. Rare cases display anaplastic features at the time of first presentation or progress to anaplastic gliomas over extended times. We report on a ganglioglioma of the spinal cord that recurred as a malignant glioma one and a half years after resection. The initial neoplasm was composed of a mixture of well-differentiated ganglionic and astrocytic cells. The recurrent tumor was an anaplastic small-cell glioma. The sole unusual aspect in the initial neoplasm was an abundance of small vessels with calcified walls, which mimicked a vascular malformation.
