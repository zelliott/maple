The iron content dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rates (1/T1) of solvent protons in healthy human serum has been studied by FT NMR at 60 MHz. A linear relationship has been established between 1/T1 and the iron content (with a correlation of 0.89). Our data suggest that Fe(III)-transferrin can contribute to the relaxation rate in healthy human serum.
