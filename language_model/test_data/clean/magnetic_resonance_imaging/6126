The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided PCN in an open-configuration low-field MRI system. Eight patients were prospectively enrolled in the study. The degree of the dilatation of the renal collecting system varied from minimal to severe. All procedures were performed solely under MRI guidance with a 0.23-T open configuration C-arm-shaped MRI system with interventional optical tracking. In each case, PCN was performed with a MRI-compatible drainage kit using the Seldinger technique. Seven out of eight nephrostomies were successfully performed under MRI guidance. All PCN procedures in dilated renal collection systems were successful; however, nephrostomy catheter could not be placed in a nondilated system. The mean time needed for the MRI-guided PCN was 26 min. No major complications occurred during the procedure or follow-up. MRI-guided PCN in dilated renal collection system is feasible and safe. The presented technique has limitations that necessitate further technical developments before the procedure can be applied to nondilated kidneys and recommended for routine clinical use.
