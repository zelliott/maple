Diffuse cerebral artery vasospasm following brain tumor resection is a rare complication. The authors reported a case of symptomatic diffuse cerebral artery vasospasm of early phase following resection of a left posterior fossa meningioma. A 50-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital complaining of headache. No neurological deficits were detected at the time of admission. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large mass in the left posterior fossa. Cerebral angiography demonstrated mildly diffuse stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid artery. The tumor was resected totally. CT after operation showed a small amount of subarachnoid hematoma in the superior aspect of the cerebellum. Pathological specimen of the tumor showed fibrous meningioma. One day after this radical operation, the patient was found to have weakness in her left leg. Then she developed left hemiparesis, weakness in the right leg and left homonymous hemianopsia. MRI showed ischemic lesions in the bilateral parietal and the occipital lobe. Angiography demonstrated diffuse severe vasospasm throughout the whole cerebral artery. Ten days after the operation, angiographical findings were improved. This case indicates that vasospasm may occur even after resection of brain tumors which are localized outside the suprasellar area.
