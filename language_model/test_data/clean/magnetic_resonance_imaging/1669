Although neuroblastoma is the most common of extracranial solid tumors of childhood and infancy, we report the first case of an isolated neuroblastoma of a paranasal sinus. A 15-year-old girl with a right maxillary sinus mass was asymptomatic except for persistent epiphora. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed that the mass extended into the nasal cavity, encroached on the lamina papyracea, and obstructed the nasofrontal duct. An extensive workup revealed no evidence of systemic disease. The patient underwent right craniofacial resection. Immunohistochemistry and electronmicroscopic findings were consistent with conventional neuroblastoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed with probes selected to demonstrate genetic alterations associated with neuroblastoma. Studies revealed deletion of chromosome arm 1p, gain of chromosome 17, and normal N-myc gene copy number. In summary, the tumor exhibited morphologic features and genetic alterations more consistent with those of neuroblastoma than with those of esthesioneuroblastoma.
