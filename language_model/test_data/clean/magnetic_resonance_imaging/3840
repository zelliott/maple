Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the liver requires input from a physicist or physician at the time of acquisition to insure proper voxel selection, while in multiecho chemical shift imaging, numerous regions of interest must be manually selected in order to ensure analysis of a representative portion of the liver parenchyma. A fully automated technique could improve workflow by selecting representative portions of the liver prior to human analysis. Complete volumes from three-dimensional gradient dual-echo acquisitions with two-point Dixon reconstruction acquired at 1.5 and 3 T were analyzed in 100 subjects, using an automated liver sampling algorithm, based on ratio pairs calculated from signal intensity image data as fat-only/water-only and log(in-phase/opposed-phase) on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Using different gridding variations of the algorithm, the average correct liver volume samples ranged from 527 to 733 mL. The average percentage of sample located within the liver ranged from 95.4 to 97.1%, whereas the average incorrect volume selected was 16.5-35.4 mL (2.9-4.6%). Average run time was 19.7-79.0 s. The algorithm consistently selected large samples of the hepatic parenchyma with small amounts of erroneous extrahepatic sampling, and run times were feasible for execution on an MRI system console during exam acquisition.
