Limb shaking TIA is a rare but well-known feature of severe carotid artery stenosis. The authors report a patient who developed recurrent shaking movements of a leg. An angiogram showed the focal stenosis of the anterior cerebral artery. Ictal and postacetazolamide SPECT scans suggested a local hyperfunction of cortical neurons and an impaired hemodynamic reserve in the vicinity of the ischemic area.
