Composite hemangioendothelioma (HE) is a recently described rare vascular neoplasm of low-grade malignancy. A 56-year-old man presented with sternum pain for 2 years. Bone scan showed a hot spot in the manubrium sterni. This lesion showed high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images and high vascularity on enhanced T1-weighted MR images. F-FDG PET/CT showed increased FDG uptake of this osteolytic lesion with SUVmax of 5.9. Malignant tumor was suspected. The patient underwent resection of the lesion. Composite HE was confirmed by pathology.
