This case report describes a 63-year-old man referred with right-sided glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated asymmetry of the PICA vessels. A microvascular decompression was performed and complete remission of symptoms followed. After 14 months the neuralgia recurred, this time accompanied by sinus bradycardia/sinus arrest during attacks causing discomfort and syncopes. An MRI now demonstrated an arterial loop at the site of the vagoglossopharyngeal complex leaving the brainstem. After another microvascular decompression, complete remission of symptoms was observed.
