A major intrinsic limitation of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to map the human brain lies in the unclear relationship between the position of the stimulating coil on the scalp and the underlying stimulated cortex. The relationship between structure and function as the major feature constituting a brain mapping modality can therefore not be established. Recent advances in image processing allowed us to refine TMS by combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities with TMS using a neuronavigation system to measure the position of the stimulating coil and map this position onto a MRI data set. This technique has several advantages over recent TMS mapping strategies. The position of the coil on the scalp can be held constant as verified by real time visual guidance. When evaluating higher cortical functions, the relationship between underlying cortical anatomy and the scalp stimulation site can be accurately assessed. Cortical motor output maps can be easily obtained for preoperative planning and decision making for mass lesions near rolandic cortex in patients. In conclusion, navigated TMS is a reliable alternative for localizing cortical functions and therefore may be a useful adjunct or in selected patients even a helpful alternative to other functional neuroimaging methods.
