To describe our experience with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and the relationships between the clinical course, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and treatment, a retrospective record review was conducted of 15 children who were admitted with the diagnosis of ADEM during the period 2004-2010. Their ages ranged between 2 and 13 years. Patients presented most often with ataxia (53.3%) and secondly with weakness and headache (46.6%). Myelitis was determined in two patients. Five patients were treated with high-dose intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone, seven patients were treated with oral prednisolone, one patient was treated with plasmapheresis with IV immunoglobulin (Ig), and one patient was treated with IVIg. We observed recurrence in one patient. ADEM is a demyelinating disorder that is being diagnosed increasingly more as MRI studies are performed more frequently in patients with acute encephalopathy. Early diagnosis and therapy might improve the outcome.
