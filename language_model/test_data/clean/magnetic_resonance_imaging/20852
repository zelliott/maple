This short report presents the case of a 32-year-old man with a knee injury sustained while playing football. A plain radiograph revealed a Segond fracture and a subsequent MRI confirmed a complete anterior cruciate ligament rupture. While the Segond fracture, and its associated intra-articular pathology, is well recognised among orthopaedic surgeons, it is less well recognised among staff in the emergency department. The report aims to emphasise the importance of plain radiographs in patients with a history of knee injury and to highlight that this seemingly innocuous avulsion fracture may reveal more severe underlying pathology.
