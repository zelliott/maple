The association between congenital pseudoarthrosis and osteofibrous dysplasia of the tibia and fibula is a rare entity that has been recently recognized. We report a male newborn who was found to have swelling and deformity of the left lower leg. Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging showed an extensive destructive lesion of the tibial shaft, with dysplastic congenital pseudoarthrosis of the lower fibula. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of congenital pseudoarthrosis of the tibia and fibula with underlying osteofibrous dysplasia involving both bones. Immunohistochemical stains showed cytokeratin positivity.
