This article reviews the normal anatomy of the female urethra, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques, and the role of MR imaging in the evaluation of diverse urethral and periurethral diseases. Salient MR imaging findings of common and uncommon cystic urethral lesions (urethral diverticulum, Skene cyst, and vaginal cysts), and masses (urethral carcinoma, leiomyoma, melanoma, fibroepithelial polyp, caruncle, and mucosal prolapse) are presented. The evolving role of dynamic MR in the evaluation of stress urinary incontinence is reviewed.
