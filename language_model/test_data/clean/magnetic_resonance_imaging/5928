With the increasing number of cancer survivors, we can observe a population that will present a higher risk of developing secondary long-term toxicities related to adjuvant chemo and radiotherapy regimens. Among these, children surviving from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that were treated with prophylactic cranial irradiation represent a group of patients at a high risk of developing secondary brain tumors. Radiation-induced intracranial tumors have been documented since 1950, and today, more than one-hundred cases have been described. We report our experience with two young patients who were hospitalized for low grade gliomas and had a positive anamnesis for ALL and consequent radiotherapy.
