A single case, RCG, showing a unilateral reading disorder without unilateral spatial neglect was studied. The disorder was characterized by substitutions of the initial (left) letters of words, nonwords and Arabic numbers, independently of egocentered spatial coordinates. MRI showed a bilateral lesion with the involvement of the splenium. Although, within the framework of the visual word recognition model proposed by Caramazza and Hillis (1990), RCG disorder could be defined as a stimulus-centered neglect dyslexia, we discuss the hypothesis of a dissociation in neural correlates and mechanisms between the syndrome of unilateral spatial neglect and such a unilateral reading disorder.
