We present the case of a 40-year-old man that presented a fast growing tumour on the external side of the left elbow. The tumour was extirpated by means of marginal exerectomy. The microscopic study corresponded to epithelioid malignant schwannoma, and the patient received radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. During the following years two local recidives and two new malignant schwannomas, one in the left sciatic common trunk and another paraspinal one, appeared and were extirpated. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy were again administered. In the last year, four new tumours have appeared: in the supraclavicular space, right posterior costofrenic, left costovertebral, and in the inferior abdominal wall, none of them has been extirpated or has hystologic diagnosis at the moment, however radiologic findings suggest malignant schwannomas. In this moment there is no neurologic deficiency except for the secondary ones to surgical procedures, and no neurofibromatosis types I to VII signs have been observed. So, the possibility of a new neurofibromatosis type is appointed.
