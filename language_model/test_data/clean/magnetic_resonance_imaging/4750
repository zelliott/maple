We report two cases of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) of the bone, and present the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings of these surgically proven cases of AE of the ilium and clavicle. CT and MR imaging showed destruction of the ilium and clavicle, and numerous cysts of the bone and surrounding tissues. Moreover, CT and MR imaging clearly demonstrated spread of the parailiac region and superior mediastinum. CT and MR imaging were very useful in determining the extent of surgery. Our experience suggested that CT and MR imaging are complementary studies.
