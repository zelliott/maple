Recent studies comparing cryosectional anatomy of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) to its MR appearance have shown that the assessment of disk displacement is inaccurate when based on the sagittal plane alone. This article describes the MR appearance of the normal and abnormal (positional and osseous changes) TMJ in the coronal plane and compares these findings with their cryosectional anatomy. Twenty-two TMJs from unselected frozen cadavers were embedded in paraffin. Coronal and sagittal MR imaging was performed; specimens were then cut in the same plane as the coronal images. Disk position by cryosection was normal in 14 cases and abnormal in eight cases. Coronal MR images alone correctly depicted the TMJ disk position in 17 cases (77%) (13 normal, four abnormal). Complementary sagittal images were necessary for diagnosing anterior displacement in two cases (9%). MR was inaccurate in three cases (14%) of severe degenerative joint disease. Bone condition was correctly diagnosed on the basis of coronal images alone in all cases. Our study shows that coronal MR imaging alone of the TMJ in cadavers accurately shows disk position in 77% of cases. Complementary sagittal images were of benefit in the diagnosis of an additional 9% with anterior displacement. Disk position was assessed inaccurately in either plane in patients with severe degenerative joint disease. For a full MR assessment of the TMJ for disk position and bone condition, we recommend imaging in both coronal and sagittal planes.
