To investigate the course of chondrosarcoma in relation to radiographic and histopathologic findings.

49 consecutive patients seen during an 11-year-period were analysed, including re-evaluation of their radiographic and histopathologic material.

Forty-two patients had radiographic changes typical for cartilaginous tumours, in 37 with malignant stigmata. Seven patients had malignant changes not typical for chondrosarcoma. By histopathologic grading 16 patients had grade I, 17 grade II and 16 grade III tumours. Six of the grade II-III tumours were histopathologic variants (mesenchymal, dedifferentiated or myxoid chondrosarcomas). Surgical removal of the tumour was performed in 42 patients, 41 of whom were followed up for 0.4-11.4 years (median 3.8 years). Local recurrence occurred in 7 patients, and 11 patients developed metastases. Ten patients, 4 with local recurrence and metastases, and 6 with metastases only were dead at the end of the follow-up. The actuarial 5-year overall survival rate was 64%. The occurrence of local recurrence, metastases and death was found to be related to the histopathologic grades II and III. Atypical radiographic features only occurred in grade II-III tumours and were related to metastases and death, but not to local recurrence.

Atypical radiographic findings were related to high-grade malignancy and poor prognosis.
