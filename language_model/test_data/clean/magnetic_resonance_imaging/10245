We report a case of pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration with increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in bilateral lentiform nuclei on technetium Tc-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission CT (ECD-SPECT). A 6-year-old boy presented with opisthotonus. T2*-weighted MR images revealed areas of marked hypointensity with a hyperintense focus in bilateral globus pallidus, creating the characteristic eye-of-the-tiger appearance. ECD-SPECT showed increased rCBF in bilateral lentiform nuclei.
