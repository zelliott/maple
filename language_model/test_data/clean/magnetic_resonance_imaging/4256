Tumors developing in association with metallic implants are being reported with increasing frequency in the orthopedic literature. The authors report the tenth case of malignant fibrous histiocytoma associated with a total hip replacement. The diagnosis was made during an evaluation for rapid radiographic osteolysis surrounding the femoral component detected less than 1 year after revision of a hemiarthroplasty to a total hip replacement. The short latency period and aggressiveness of this tumor mimicking rapid osteolysis prompted a review of the literature, etiology and significance of implant-associated malignant fibrous histiocytoma.
