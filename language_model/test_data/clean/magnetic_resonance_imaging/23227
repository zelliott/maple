dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) at the craniocervical junction is an unusual condition with alternative presentations and is a rare cause of intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We performed a retrospective, angiographic study of six consecutive patients to assess the relation between symptom and venous drainage and to predict the risk for SAH.

there were three females and three males; ages ranged between 37 and 64 with a mean of 52.5. Among them, four had SAH and two had pain. Diagnosis of DVAF was based on CTA, MRA and angiograph.

three patients (50%, 3/6), with single or main ascending venous route into the intracranial vein, all had intracranial SAH. Among these three patients, varix or pouches was identified in two cases (66.7%, 2/3). Three cases were treated by surgical interventions, while two subjects were endovascular techniques. The overall clinical outcomes were good during an average follow-up period of 13 months. In particular, follow-up angiographs performed 6 months later revealed the complete disappearance of DAVF in three patients.

there was an increased risk of SAH if DAVF at the craniocervical junction manifested an ascending venous route into the intracranial vein and/or presented with varix or pouches.
