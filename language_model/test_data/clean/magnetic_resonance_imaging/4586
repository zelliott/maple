Adrenoleukodystrophy is a hereditary, usually X-linked recessive disorder, characterized by progressive demyelination of cerebral white matter and adrenal insufficiency.

We report the case of a 14-year-old boy, presenting the typical changes in CT and MR with almost symmetrical changes in the white matter only, with no mass effect and a rim of enhancement. Adrenoleukodystrophy may resemble tumour but shows no mass effect.

We discuss the differential diagnoses and underline the importance of the characteristic appearance of this disease. Adrenoleukodystrophy is diagnosed by serum analysis.
