Airway obstruction may be caused by extreme mediastinal shift and rotation after right pneumonectomy or after left pneumonectomy in the presence of a right aortic arch. Eleven adults (aged 18 to 58 years) with severe symptoms were treated surgically between 5 months to 17 years after pneumonectomy (7 right, 4 left). An initial patient with only one functional lobe was treated unsuccessfully by aortic division and bypass graft. Ten underwent mediastinal repositioning. After two recurrences prostheses were used to maintain mediastinal position. Five patients who underwent such repositioning are doing well from 5 months to more than 5 years later. One died 1 month after operation probably of pulmonary embolism. One who showed residual airway collapse after operation has some recurrent obstruction. Three other patients who showed severe malacic obstruction of the airway after mediastinal repositioning variously underwent aortic division with bypass graft and tracheal and bronchial resection. One is well almost 6 years later. Two died postoperatively. Occurrence of the syndrome is unpredictable. Where malacic changes have not occurred, mediastinal repositioning may reasonably be expected to correct obstruction. Optimal treatment for concurrent severely malacic airways is unclear.
