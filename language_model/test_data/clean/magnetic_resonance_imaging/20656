Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited disorder, typically presenting in the second and third decade. We report the case of an elderly gentleman with significant vascular risk factors, presenting with slowly progressive, bilateral, visual loss with high signal lesions in the pericallosal and periventricular deep white matter on MRI brain studies. Possible diagnoses included late-onset MS, ischaemic optic neuropathies, a mitochondrial disorder or an overlap syndrome such as Harding's disease.
