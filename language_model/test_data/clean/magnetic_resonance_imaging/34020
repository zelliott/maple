The incidental discovery of adrenal masses in radiologic imaging studies is becoming increasingly common. Herein we present our experience with 59 cases of incidentally discovered and surgically removed adrenal masses. Of 59 adrenal incidentalomas, 15 cases were hypersecretory tumors, including 11 pheochromocytomas; only 3 were adrenocortical carcinomas. The prevalence of incidentally discovered adrenal masses and their differential diagnosis and management are discussed in a review of the literature.
