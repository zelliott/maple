Over the past decade MR (magnetic resonance) imaging has emerged as one of the major modalities for noninvasive functional imaging. Recent advances in the development of targeted MR contrast agents have added significantly to the capabilities of MR imaging. In particular, the use of targeted contrast agents to report on the expression of cell surface receptors, combined with the functional capabilities of MR imaging, together provide unique opportunities to understand receptor-mediated pathways. In this article we have reviewed current MRI strategies used to visualize receptor expression, the potential advantages and drawbacks of these strategies, and novel areas of focus for the future.
