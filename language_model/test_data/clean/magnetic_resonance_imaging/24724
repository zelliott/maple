The authors sought to determine the diagnostic performance of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE-MR) imaging in the evaluation of prostate cancer before and after transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment.

We analysed 25 patients with prostate cancer. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was evaluated 1, 4 and 6 months after treatment. DCE-MR imaging was performed the day prior to and 1, 4 and 6 months after HIFU treatment. Transrectal prostate biopsies were obtained at the time of diagnosis and 6 months after treatment.

Before treatment, intraglandular lesions were considered to be potential sites of neoplasm and subsequently confirmed as sites of prostate adenocarcinoma in all 25 patients based on prostatespecific antigen (PSA) values and histological examinations (rho=1; p<0.001). Using histology as the gold standard, DCE-MR imaging displayed 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value before treatment. After HIFU treatment, DCE-MR imaging showed 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity.

DCE-MR imaging can be used to visualise prostate adenocarcinoma. Several morphological and postgadolinium modifications in the follow-up DCE-MR images after HIFU treatment were also observed.
