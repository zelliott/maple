Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accepted non-invasive modality for evaluation of soft tissue pathology without exposure to ionizing radiation. Current applications demonstrate excellent visualization of the anatomy and pathology of various organs. Preliminary studies in the knee reveal fine resolution of anatomy and pathology involving the meniscus. The purpose of this study is to determine a prospective correlation between MRI scans and actual meniscal pathology as documented at the time of arthroscopy. MRI scans were obtained in 155 patients, on 156 knees (one patient with bilateral scans), with 86 patients (87 knees) eventually undergoing diagnostic and operative videoarthroscopy performed by the same surgeon (DWJ). All images were obtained on the same high-resolution 1.5 Tesla GE Signa Magnetic Resonance Scanner with the same radiologist performing all readings (PEB). The knees were studied in the coronal and sagittal plane using a spin echo sequence and 5 mm slice thicknesses. The menisci were described as having Grade 1, 2, or 3 changes, with Grade 3 reserved for complete tears. Using arthroscopy as the diagnostic standard, the accuracy of MRI in diagnosing medial and lateral meniscal tears was 93.1% and 96.6%, respectively with a Grade 3 MRI reading. For tears of the ACL, the accuracy was 96.6% as confirmed at arthroscopy. Five tears of the PCL were also documented by MRI and correlated with clinical evaluation. Other abnormalities seen were articular cartilage and osteochondral defects, bone tumors, tibial plateau fractures, Baker's cysts, and meniscal cysts. The MRI scan is a highly accurate, noninvasive modality for documentation of meniscal pathology as well as cruciate ligament tears in the knee.
