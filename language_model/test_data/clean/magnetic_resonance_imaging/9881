An 80-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of developed sense of constriction in the trunk and gradually progressive numbness and muscle weakness in the upper and lower extremities. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed increased cell count and protein level. Gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of spine showed the enhancement and swelling of bilateral nerve root in the cervical and lumbar segments. Although chest computed tomography showed neither bilateral hilar lymphoadenopathy nor lung lesions and serum angiotensin converting enzyme and lysozyme (ACE) were normal, tuberculin skin test was negative and cell count and CD4/CD8 elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Biopsy specimen of scalene lymph node showed noncaseating granuloma. The patient was treated with oral predonisolone, which improved her symptoms and abnormalities on MRI. It is important to consider neurosarcoidosis in the differential diagnosis of polyradiculopathy with swelling and gadolinium enhancement of spinal nerve roots.
