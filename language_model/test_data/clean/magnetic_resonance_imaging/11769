A 7-year-old girl with foul-smelling, bloody vaginal discharge for more than 2 years was initially suspected of suffering from vaginal foreign bodies. Although plain radiography revealed no abnormal findings in the pelvis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple low intensity objects and an intact vaginal wall. Four plastic toys were removed with forceps under general anesthesia. MRI is supposed to be the best technique for evaluating vaginal foreign bodies in young girls.
