A 64-year-old female presented with biventricular heart failure. Echocardiography revealed features suggestive of amyloidosis, including segmental impairment of longitudinal strain (rate) in the septal and anterior segments, which matched delayed gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance. Guided endomyocardial biopsy confirmed the presence of perivascular amyloid deposits. Tissue Doppler and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance may be helpful in delineating cardiac amyloidosis.
