MR-tomography was compared to echocardiography for efficacy in diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in 55 patients with stage II essential (WHO criteria). Left ventricular myocardial mass estimated at echocardiography appeared significantly greater than this mass estimated at MR tomography: 244.0 +/- 9.0 g (MRT) and 359.8 +/- 15.6 g (echo-CG), respectively (p < 0.001).
