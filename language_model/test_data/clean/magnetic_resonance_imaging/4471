In order to assess the sound level experienced by the fetal ear during obstetric magnetic resonance imaging, a fluid filled stomach was used as an experimental model of the gravid uterus. A better than 30 dB attenuation in intensity was recorded across the frequency band of interest for all patient orientations. This was enough to reduce acoustic sound pressure from a level close to the instantaneous damage threshold (120 dB), to an acceptable level (< 90 dB). Direct mechanical coupling through the patient table was also shown to increase uterine sound pressure levels by as much as 10 dB. Much higher peak pressures could be obtained by tapping of abdomen with the fingers.
