Aim of the study was the translation of three frequently used stroke scales ("National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale" NIHSS, "European Stroke Scale" ESS and "Rankin Scale") into German and the analysis of the interrater reliability of the respective German versions. The translation process followed the protocol of the Medical Outcomes Trust (Boston) and included two independent forward, one backward translation and a consensus conference for the German versions. Interrater reliability was assessed using the weighted kappa statistic. For this study 43 patients with an ischemic stroke determined by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were recruited from two university hospitals. Excluded were patients with an intracerebral hemorrhage or TIA. The interrater reliability of the three German versions was substantial to excellent. Mean Kappa for the NIHSS was 0.80, for the ESS 0.79 and 0.76 for the Rankin Scale using simple weights in the analysis. Additional analysis revealed the influence of preselected weights on the results of the kappa statistic. The use of German versions of frequently used stroke scales can reduce bias that is introduced by different levels of knowledge of the English language and thus improve the standardised assessment of neurological deficits in stroke.
