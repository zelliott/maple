Neurosarcoidosis is a great mimicker. It is often difficult to diagnose particularly when there is no prior history of systemic sarcoidosis. Although certain sites of the neuraxis are more commonly involved than others, any site of the central or peripheral nervous system can be affected. We report a case of sarcoidosis involving the cauda equina in a 38-year-old African American male without prior history of systemic disease. Initial clinical presentation was suggestive of Guillian-Barr√© syndrome, but the evaluation proved this case to be neurosarcoidosis involving the cauda equina. We have followed this patient for 8 years, and he remains clinically stable on prednisone 5 mg/day.
