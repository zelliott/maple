To summarize and compare magnetization transfer data from biological tissues, a method was developed to extract the average absorption lineshape of the semi-solid pool directly from magnetization transfer experimental data along with the four other parameters that characterize the two-pool model of exchange. Magnetization transfer data for several biological tissues were analyzed using this method and the resulting "flexible" lineshapes were compared with super-Lorentzian and "Kubo-Tomita" lineshapes. The use of flexible lineshapes noticeably improves the fit of the two-pool model to the data. The derived flexible lineshapes of all the tissues analyzed are physically realistic and show remarkably consistent behavior.
