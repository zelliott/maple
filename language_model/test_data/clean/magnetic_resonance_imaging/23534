Magnetic resonance imaging-based methods for measuring the mechanics of human joints have been successfully applied to quantitatively evaluate biomechanics in a wide variety of joints, pathologies, and interventions. The objective of this review was to provide a detailed overview of methods in the literature for measuring joint kinematics, meniscal and ligament movement, and cartilage strain using MRI.
