The human midcalf muscle images were obtained using gradient recalled echo (GRE) sequence with and without magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) sequence. A significant decrease of relative signal intensity was observed in muscle with off-resonance irradiation. The percentage increase of signal intensity after dorsiflexion exercises was 55.6% and 29.0% for MTC-GRE and GRE sequence, respectively. MTC technique might be useful in improving contrast between many tissues as well as muscles.
