A new technique for the evaluation of bone trabeculation using magnetic resonance (MR) phase images has been recently presented. This technique calculates the phase variance in a region of interest (ROI) on the phase images of a gradient echo sequence. In this study, a computer program was developed which simulates the phase distribution in gradient echo acquired phase images of a structure that mimics trabecular bone, consisting of a three-dimensional connected network of orthogonal bone struts. Several tests were performed in order to assess the influence of imaging parameters such as the echo time, the pixel size and the slice width on phase variance. The results from this work show that with selection of appropriate imaging parameters, phase variance strongly reflects variations in trabecular bone density. Representative MR experiments were performed in the distal radius to verify the simulation results.
