The skilled use of nonperiodic phonation techniques in combination with spectrum analysis has been proposed here as a practical method for locating formant frequencies in the singing voice. The study addresses the question of the degree of similarity between sung phonations and their nonperiodic imitations, with respect to both frequency of the first two formants as well as posture of the vocal tract. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), linear predictive coding (LPC), and spectrum analysis, two types of nonperiodic phonation (ingressive and vocal fry) are compared with singing phonations to determine the degree of similarity/difference in acoustic and spatial dimensions of the vocal tract when these phonation types are used to approximate the postures of singing. In comparing phonation types, the close similarity in acoustic data in combination with the relative dissimilarity in spatial data indicates that the accurate imitations are not primarily the result of imitating the singing postures, but have instead an aural basis.
