The German clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and therapy of Crohn's disease is the result of an evidence-based consensus conference under the auspices of the German Gastroenterologic Society and the Competence Network IBD. This article will summarize the recommendations most important for the general practitioner.Crohn's disease is diagnosed in cooperation with a gastroenterologist who is performing endoscopy and possibly ultrasound. Uncomplicated relapses can nevertheless be successfully treated at the office of a family physician - mostly with steroids. Steroids are not appropriate for long-term treatment though. In those cases an early treatment with immunosuppressants in collaboration with a gastroenterologist is required. Cooperation with several different sub specialists is necessary when surgery is required as well as for the treatment of fistula, psychosomatic aspects and extraintestinal manifestations.
