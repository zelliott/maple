With life expectancy in the industrial nations increasing during recent years, the number of patients older than 70 years with intracranial tumours and, especially, meningiomas is rising. To evaluate the indications for operative treatment, we reviewed 66 patients older than 70 years who were operated upon for intracranial meningioma in our department between 1991 and 1997. The mean age was 75 years. The oldest patients were 86 years old. Thirteen patients with recurrent meningiomas were operated upon. The mortality rate was 7.6%. Neurological symptoms improved in 38 patients (57.6%), were unchanged in 11 (16.6%), and deteriorated in 12 (18.2%). Patients with recurrent meningiomas seem to have a higher operative risk and their outcome is worse than after a primary operation. In general, there were good postoperative results in patients with few concomitant diseases, small meningiomas, small edema, short time of operation, and accessible location (convexity rather than skull base). Age in general is not a contraindication for operation. In cases of incidental findings of small meningiomas, we recommend observation and MRI follow-up. Symptomatic meningiomas should be removed whenever there is an acceptable risk from an internal or anaesthesiological point of view.
