Symmetry Considerations can be used not only to plan the desired shape of reconstructured bone structures, but also to generate prototypes for soft tissue implants. The poster describes a system which allows to calculate a symmetry plane in the facial area automatically and computes proposals for implants or transplants. The system presented has been used to calculate soft tissue implants and a replacement for parts of the lower jaw.
