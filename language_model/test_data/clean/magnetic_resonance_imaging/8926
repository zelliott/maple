We report the case of a 55-year-old woman who presented with a severe pain and a mass in the proximal portion of the medial calf. On sonography, the lesion appeared as a poorly defined hypoechoic lesion with interspersed muscle bundles. A total excision of the lesion was performed. On microscopic examination, the specimen demonstrated cystic lesions surrounded by fibrous walls within the muscle bundles. A ruptured intramuscular ganglion cyst diagnosis was made based on the histopathologic findings.
