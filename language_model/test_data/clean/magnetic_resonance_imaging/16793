Hairy polyps are uncommon developmental malformations of the oropharynx. They are frequently pedunculated and can cause respiratory distress in the neonate. Hairy polyps are usually diagnosed with MRI but can be well seen at US. To our knowledge, the sonographic features have not been previously reported.
