The authors report on a new case of dislocation of the tibialis posterior tendon which was associated with a fracture of the lateral malleolus. They postpone a mechanism of injury based on the fibular fracture and emphasize differential diagnosis with rupture of the deltoid ligament. A retinacular repair was performed.
