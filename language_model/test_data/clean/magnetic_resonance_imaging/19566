To evaluate the feasibility, reproducibility, and technical quality of a dynamic contrast material-enhanced isotropic three-dimensional (3D) volumetric interpolated breath-hold hepatic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examination.

Fifty patients underwent 3D spoiled gradient-echo imaging (4.2/1.8 [repetition time msec/echo time msec]; flip angle, 12 degrees; interpolation in three directions; intermittent fat saturation; pixel size </= 2.5 mm in all dimensions) before and dynamically after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, with the first enhanced acquisition timed for hepatic arterial dominance by using a test bolus of contrast material. Qualitative and quantitative measures of image quality were determined. Patterns of arterial and venous anatomy were assessed. Ten patients (20%) underwent repeat imaging within 6 months, and reproducibility was evaluated.

Hepatic contrast-to-noise ratios for nonenhanced and arterial, portal venous, and equilibrium phase studies averaged 13.0 +/- 12.6 (SD), 17.4 +/- 11.8, 30.4 +/- 16.2, and 28.6 +/- 21.1, respectively. During arterial phase, the liver enhanced a mean of 29% of the maximal enhancement as measured during portal venous phase. Hepatic vascular anatomic variants were comparable in distribution to those cited in published articles. Repeat studies were not significantly different in image quality when compared with original studies.

High-quality arterial phase 3D volumetric interpolated breath-hold images can be obtained reliably and reproducibly when timed by using a test dose of contrast material.
