Four patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after a clinical diagnosis of a flexor digitorum profundus tendon rupture of the hand. The delay before presentation ranged from 1 to 5 weeks. Three patients had closed ruptures and one had a minor laceration which had healed. MRI showed proximal retraction of the profundus tendon to the palm in two patients and limited retraction in the other two. MRI provides important preoperative information for surgical decision-making and planning in patients who present late with closed flexor tendon injuries of the hand.
