Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging has recently become a very useful tool in the diagnosis of myocarditis. We describe a patient in whom acute myocarditis was presented as an acute myocardial infarction and had an atypical course with rapid normalization of ECG abnormalities. In this case CMR imaging was essential to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis.
