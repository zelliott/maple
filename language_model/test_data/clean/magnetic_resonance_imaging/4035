We describe our initial experience with the AcQSim (Picker International, St. David, PA) computed tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (CT-MRI) fusion software in eight patients with intracranial lesions. MRI data are electronically integrated into the CT-based treatment planning system. Since MRI is superior to CT in identifying intracranial abnormalities, we evaluated the precision and feasibility of this new localization method. Patients initially underwent CT simulation from C2 to the most superior portion of the scalp. T2 and post-contrast T1-weighted MRI of this area was then performed. Patient positioning was duplicated utilizing a head cup and bridge of nose to forehead angle measurements. First, a gross tumor volume (GTV) was identified utilizing the CT (CT/GTV). The CT and MRI scans were subsequently fused utilizing a point pair matching method and a second GTV (CT-MRI/GTV) was contoured with the aid of both studies. The fusion process was uncomplicated and completed in a timely manner. Volumetric analysis revealed the CT-MRI/GTV to be larger than the CT/GTV in all eight cases. The mean CT-MRI/GTV was 28.7 cm3 compared to 16.7 cm3 by CT alone. This translated into a 72% increase in the radiographic tumor volume by CT-MRI. A simulated dose-volume histogram in two patients revealed that marginal portions of the lesion, as identified by CT and MRI, were not included in the high dose treatment volume as contoured with the use of CT alone. Our initial experience with the fusion software demonstrated an improvement in tumor localization with this technique. Based on these patients the use of CT alone for treatment planning purposes in central nervous system (CNS) lesions is inadequate and would result in an unacceptable rate of marginal misses. The importation of MRI data into three-dimensional treatment planning is therefore crucial to accurate tumor localization. The fusion process simplifies and improves precision of this task.
