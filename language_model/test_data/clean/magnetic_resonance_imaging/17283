Aneurysmatic bone cyst is a hypervascularized, benign lesion locally destructive by its progressive growth with greater incidence in the second decade of life. It lodges preferably in the long bones and vertebrae. The clinical picture varies from pain to local edema and even neurological symptoms when in vertebral location. Three cases of vertebral aneurysmatic bone cyst occurring in childhood and all with neurologic deficit symptoms are described. Computerized tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis. Patients underwent surgery to remove the tumor. In one of the cases, pre-operative selective arterial embolization of the lesion was performed. The three patients progressed satisfactorily with neurological improvement, which demonstrated the efficiency of the microsurgical technique for the resection of the spinal tumor. The evolution of the cases and the current treatment are discussed.
