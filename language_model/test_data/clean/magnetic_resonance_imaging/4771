Twenty-four young girls (mean age 13.0 years) with unilateral occlusion of a duplicated uterus and ipsilateral renal agenesis, dysplasia or hypoplasia were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following ultrasound examination. Hydrocolpos (n = 4), hydrometrocolpos (n = 2), hematocolpos (n = 11), hematometrocolpos (n = 5), hematocolpometra, hematosalpinx (n = 3) and hematometra, hematosalpinx (n = 1) were noted (two of these patients had presented with hydrocolpos and hematocolpos before and after the menarche). Twenty-two of these girls presented with ipsilateral renal agenesis (right 11, left 11) with ectopic ureters to Gartner's duct cysts (GDC) in two, in one renal hypoplasia and in one renal dysplasia with ectopic ureters to GDC. MRI offered specific images of the genital tract, showing the exact type of m√ºllerian duct anomaly and providing high diagnostic accuracy. Such preoperative identification of a uterine anomaly, complemented with appropriate surgical intervention, can assist young girls in achieving normal fertility in the future.
