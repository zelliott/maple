We present the case of a 67-year-old patient, asymptomatic, with a prior diagnosis of amelanotic cutaneous melanoma with positive ganglions (2002), who was referred for thoracic-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT) as part of routine follow-up (2007). The CT revealed a mass in the right atrium cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was practiced to characterize the mass.
