Clinical and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and multiple sclerosis-like (MS-like) syndrome are reported. Cerebral MRI demonstrated multiple, MS-like, scattered foci of signal abnormality, one of which showed contrast enhancement. Lesion dissemination in "space and time" is a hallmark for diagnosis of MS, and its demonstration by enhanced cerebral MRI prompted suspicion of coexistence of MS and AS in our patient.
