Earlier studies reported evidence suggesting distinct category-related auditory representations for environmental sounds such as animal vocalizations and tool sounds in superior and middle temporal regions of the temporal lobe. However, the degree of selectivity of these representations remains to be determined. The present study combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation with a silent acquisition protocol to further investigate category-related auditory processing of environmental sounds. To this end, we consecutively presented pairs of sounds taken from the categories 'tool sounds' or 'animal vocalizations' with either the same or different identity/category. We examined the degree of selectivity as evidenced by adaptation effects to both or only one sound category in the course of whole-brain as well as functionally and anatomically constrained region of interest analyses. While most regions predominately in the temporal cortex showed an adaptation to both sound categories, particularly the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) selectively adapted to animal vocalizations and tool sounds, respectively. However, the activation profiles of these regions differed with respect to the general responsiveness to sounds. While tool sounds still produced fMRI signals significantly different from fixation baseline in the STG, this was not the case for animal vocalizations in pMTG. Consistent with the interpretation of STG as an intermediate auditory processing stage, this region might differentiate auditory stimuli into categories based on variations of physical stimulus properties. However, processing in left pMTG seems to be even more restricted to action-related sounds of man-made objects.
