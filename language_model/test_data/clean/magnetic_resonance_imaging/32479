A 32-year-old woman was diagnosed with chronic bilateral frontoparietal and interhemispheric subdural haematomas (SDH). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed chronic renal failure due to bilateral large cystic kidneys. Brain MRI demonstrated Dandy-Walker malformation associated with hypoplastic vermis, in addition to the chronic subdural haematomas. This association of polycystic kidneys with Dandy-Walker malformation has been referred to as Goldston or cerebrorenal syndrome. The case is rare and is the first to be reported in an adult patient. The relevant literature is reviewed.
