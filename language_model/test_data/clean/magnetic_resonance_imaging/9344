Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus-8, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) of the plasma cell type, and primary effusion lymphoma. KSHV is rarely associated with the hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS), but when it does occur, it most occurs in immunocompromised patients. We report herein an unusual case of KSHV-associated HPS in an immunocompetent patient. A previously healthy 62-yr-old male was referred for evaluation of leukocytopenia and multiple lymphadenopathies. After a lymph node biopsy, he was diagnosed with MCD of the plasma cell type. KSHV DNA was detected in the lymph node tissue by polymerase chain reaction. Following a short-term response of the leukocytopenia to prednisolone, mental change, left side weakness, fever, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and renal failure developed. Despite intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and plasmapheresis, he expired. The lymph nodes were infiltrated by hemophagocytic histiocytes in the sinuses. Pulmonary nodules and gastric erosions were shown to be KS. KSHV DNA was detected in the stomach, lung, and liver. This is the first case of multiple KSHV associated diseases including MCD and KS with KSHV-associated hemophagocytic syndrome in an HIV-negative, non-transplant, immunocompetent patient.
