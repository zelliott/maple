We described the clinical, electrophysiological (electromyography, sensory and motor nerve conduction study, somatosensory evoked potentials, brainstem auditory evoked potentials, visual evoked potentials) and neuroradiological (brain magnetic resonance) data in 3 siblings (2 males and 1 female, age range: 54-48 years) affected by autosomal recessive late onset cerebellar ataxia. The 3 patients showed at the electrophysiological examination: mild peripheral neuropathy, involvement of somatosensory pathways both on central and peripheral side. A mild cerebellar atrophy, most evident in the female more severely disabled, was found by magnetic resonance.
