Using an ESR spectrometer, we studied the time course of the uptake of the liposome-entrapped spin label 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl-4-trimethylammonium in liver, spleen, and bone marrow following reticuloendothelial liver blockade. Our results show that suppression of the phagocytic activity of the liver increases the delivery of liposomes to the spleen and bone marrow without substantially altering uptake by the liver.
