Antegrade recanalisation of a completely occluded internal carotid artery (ICA) via the vasa vasorum is extremely rare. Here, we report such a case after proximal endovascular coiling in a case of dissected (i.e. non-atherosclerotic) ICA. A 42-year-old man presented with thromboembolic stroke of the left frontal lobe owing to pseudo-occlusion of the left ICA manifesting as motor aphasia and right hemiparesis. There were abundant floating thrombi in the petrous portion of the left ICA. Because of good collateral flow in the left middle cerebral artery territory through the anterior communicating artery and external carotid artery system, endovascular coil embolisation of the left ICA was performed for prevention of further thromboembolic stroke. The patient showed progressive recovery following endovascular treatment, and was discharged with mild right hemiparesis 1 month later. He maintained a regimen of aspirin and physical rehabilitation. At follow-up, 38 months later, the patient was asymptomatic. Angiography demonstrated occlusion of the left ICA and multiple serpiginous vessels originating from the proximal internal and external carotid arteries and which filled the ICA distal to the occlusion. This case suggests that an ICA occluded by proximal coil embolisation-even in a non-atherosclerotic case-might be recanalised via the vasa vasorum.
