The incidence of lipoma among parotid tumours ranges from 0.6% to 4.4%, with most series reporting an incidence of 1%. The most common origin of these tumours, in the parotid gland, is from the superficial lobe and, only rarely, from the deep lobe. Lipomas, upon clinical history, are found to be most frequently related to an episode of trauma. Computed Tomography scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging can lead to a pre-operative diagnosis of lipoma. The case is described of lipoma of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland.
