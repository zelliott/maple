Despite remarkable advances in detection and therapy, coccidioidomycosis remains a persistent threat to military troops deployed in endemic areas. Pregnant women, immunocompromised hosts, and dark-skinned persons, particularly those of Filipino, African, Hispanic or Asian ancestry, are at greatest risk for disseminated coccidioidomycosis. The ethnically diverse military forces have susceptible active duty and reserve members stationed at or temporarily trained on bases located in endemic areas for Coccidioides immitis. Although the vast majority of infections with this organism are subclinical, unusual patterns of dissemination pose a diagnostic challenge. The military physician may be tasked with recognizing acute non-specific symptoms as well as bizarre, occult manifestations of coccidioidomycosis. We present a case of disseminated coccidioidomycosis in an active duty Caucasian male who presented with a right shoulder mass. Our patient is atypical in that he had disseminated disease although immunocompetent and Caucasian. Another unusual feature is that the mass was not preceded or accompanied by any other symptoms. We could find only two other reported cases of coccidioidomycosis presenting as a soft tissue mass, both in African-American patients. The epidemiology and history of coccidioidomycosis will be reviewed, with an emphasis on military populations. The insidious nature of coccidioidomycosis, the importance of early detection and treatment in decreasing morbidity and mortality, and the presence of large numbers of military members in the endemic areas make the lessons of this case particularly relevant for all flight surgeons.
