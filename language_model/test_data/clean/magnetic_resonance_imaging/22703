Local invasion is the hallmark of malignant glioma dissemination. Leptomeningeal dissemination, a serious complication of malignant gliomas, has been increasingly observed. To correlate the physiopathologic mechanisms and the magnetic resonance imaging patterns of neuroaxis dissemination, a classification of malignant glioma dissemination is proposed (Instituto de Neurologia de Curitiba Classification).

This classification includes the following patterns of dissemination: leptomeningeal (type I), nodular (type Ia), diffuse (type Ib); subependymal (type II); satellite (type IIIa, IIIb); and mixed (type IV), combination of 2 or more previous types. Of 138 patients with histologically confirmed gliomas treated between 2000 and 2004, 10 presented neuroaxis dissemination and were evaluated.

The distribution of dissemination patterns was as follows: subependymal, 4 of 10; diffuse leptomeningeal, 1 of 10; nodular leptomeningeal, 1 of 10; and satellite, 4 of 10. Mean interval between primary tumor and dissemination was 4 months. The most frequent glioma dissemination risk factor was entering the ventricular system during surgery.

Improvements in our diagnostic imaging capabilities have contributed to a better understanding of the patterns of malignant glioma dissemination. Using this information, we present a useful classification scheme, applicable to patients with neuroaxis dissemination, which will help standardize future discussions aimed at understanding these patterns of tumor spread.
