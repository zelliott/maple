We describe a 17-year-old boy with a left extraventricular temporo-mesial neurocytoma associated with cortical dysplasia causing focal pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy. He presented with a long history of medically refractory, temporal complex partial seizures. MRI showed a left temporo-mesial lesion suspect to be a low-grade tumor. Based on the pre-operative non-invasive neurophysiological studies, the patient underwent a left tailored temporal antero-mesial resection. Histopathological examination showed an extraventricular neurocytoma associated with architectural dysplasia (Type 1a) of the temporal pole. The patient was seizure-free at 2 years follow-up. Extraventricular neurocytomas must be considered in the differential diagnosis of the plethora of low-grade tumors associated with focal epilepsy that typically involve the temporal lobe, and are frequently associated with focal cortical dysplasia.
