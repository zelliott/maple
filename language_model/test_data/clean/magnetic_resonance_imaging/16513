Rhabdomyolysis is rare in the head and neck. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential to prevent serious complications such as hyperkalaemia, acidosis, acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. We present a case of rhabdomyolysis of the head and neck. CT and MRI findings supported the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis with the patient's clinical and laboratory findings. While imaging is not crucial, it can aid in the detection of rhabdomyolysis and narrow the differential diagnosis along with laboratory findings and physical examination.
