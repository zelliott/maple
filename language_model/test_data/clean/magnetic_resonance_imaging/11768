We present a case of penile agenesis complicated by multicystic dysplastic kidneys and urethral agenesis, which resulted in oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal death. In this case, no external urethral opening was found, and the gastrointestinal tract showed no anomaly. Cases of penile agenesis complicated by Potter sequence with urethral agenesis should be differentiated from those with ectopic urethral openning.
