We report a 7-year-old girl with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis subsequent to a mycoplasma infection. She manifested a prolonged state of akinetic mutism, during which EEG revealed well-synchronized spindles. Four months later, she regained consciousness, with no mental deficit, but complete flaccid quadriplegia persisted and magnetic resonance imaging disclosed extensive destruction of the spinal cord. Antibody against galactocerebroside was detected in her serum during the acute phase. The anti-Gal C antibody is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases in the central nervous system subsequent to mycoplasma infections.
