Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia in the elderly and its prevalence is rapidly rising. Although there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, treatment can be administered to slow progression or delay the onset of symptoms. A major challenge is the early identification of patients who will develop Alzheimer's disease. As disease-modifying treatments become available, enhancing our ability to identify Alzheimer's early and accurately would allow intervention to slow, halt or even prevent disease progression or onset. Early recognition and intervention facilitates optimal care of Alzheimer's patients and delays the morbidity associated with this progressive illness.
