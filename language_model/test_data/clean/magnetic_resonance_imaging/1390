The authors report a 7-year-old girl who developed neck pain and stiffness over a four-day period. There was no fever, trauma, systemic illness or headache. Physical examination demonstrated subtle neurologic deficits indicative of cervical cord compression. CAT scan and subsequent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine demonstrated a spinal epidural hematoma, which was evacuated surgically. Post-operative angiography failed to demonstrate a vascular abnormality. The child recovered without neurologic deficit. MRI proved to be a sensitive tool in identifying the nature and extent of this lesion, and may be considered in lieu of myelography.
