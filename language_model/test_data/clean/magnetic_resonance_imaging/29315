Mesenteric cysts are rare benign intraabdominal lesions without typical clinical findings. Treatment is indicated if they become symptomatic due to enlargement of the cyst. We report 3 patients who were treated by laparoscopic surgery. In 3 patients (3 women, ages 18, 18, 46 years) admitted to our hospital with uncharacteristic abdominal pain, a mesenteric cyst 4.5-18 cm in diameter was diagnosed by ultrasonography and CT scan or MRI. One cyst was partially resected laparoscopically by unroofing of the surface, and the other two were resected completely. There were no intra- or postoperative complications. During follow-up, cyst recurrence was diagnosed in the patient with cyst unroofing 10 months after surgery, and complete cyst resection was successfully performed laparoscopically. Mesenteric cysts can be successfully managed laparoscopically. In order to prevent recurrence, complete resection should be performed.
