A 44-year-old man presented with lipoma arborescens of the right shoulder, associated with a rotator cuff tear. MRI revealed villous proliferations with signal intensity of fat on all pulse sequences. At surgery, this bursa was found to contain moderately yellow cloudy fluid without fat globules. Histological examination of the lesion showed subsynovial accumulation of mature fat cells.
