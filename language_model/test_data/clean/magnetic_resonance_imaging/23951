We describe a 33-year-old woman with a bilateral fracture of the sacrum associated with pregnancy. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and femoral neck showed normal bone mineral density, whereas bilateral osteopenic areas in the massae laterales were demonstrated by the initial CT-scan. The question remains whether the correct diagnosis is so-called insufficiency fracture due to transient osteoporosis of the sacrum associated with pregnancy or so-called fatigue fracture due to unaccustomed stress related to rapid and excessive weight gain in the last trimester of pregnancy.
