Two patients presented with primary intramedullary spinal cord germinoma (PISCG). Neither diagnosis was correct at initial evaluation, and both underwent surgical verification of the tumor. Based on the histological diagnosis, both patients were treated successfully by combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. These cases illustrate the unexpected occurrence of PISCG and treatment strategy.
