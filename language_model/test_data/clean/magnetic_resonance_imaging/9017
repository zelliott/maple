Aseptic spondylodiscitis is a well recognized complication of ankylosing spondylitis. Neurological complications of such discovertebral lesions are uncommon. We report a new case with a diagnosis of T12-L1 spondylodiscitis which developed ten years after a spinal cord compression. Such neurological complications of aseptic spondylodiscitis may be explained by proliferative epidural tissue without predominant inflammatory infiltrates and also the development of new bone reaction, suggesting the contribution of mechanical factors.
