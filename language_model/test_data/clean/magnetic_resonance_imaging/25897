We report the case of a 28 year old woman with acute, mainly motor, radiculopathy at C5-C6 on the right side secondary to a congenital vertebral arteriovenous fistula. The finding of a bruit at the side of the neck lent weight to the CT and MRI findings. Angiography was diagnostic. The fistula was embolized successfully.
