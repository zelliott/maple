Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is becoming a frequently used tool in the study of sexual physiology and neurophysiology.

This report reviews various MRI methods used to study the female sexual arousal response.

Retrospective review of pertinent literature.

Dynamic genital MRI studies enable the visualization of the physiologic arousal response that provides the direct observation of the time course and magnitude of this response, along with the variability that appears to occur in women with sexual arousal disorder. Functional brain MR studies are described and summarized along with an overview of what we have learned. Finally, the speculation on how we may be able to use MRI technology to better understand the female sexual response and to help in validating new drug treatments or in devising new treatment strategies for sexual dysfunction is also presented.

Neuroimaging has already been proven as an invaluable research tool to study the sexual response in women both in the pelvis as well as within the brain. Using these techniques, major inroads are being made to improve the understanding of the sexual arousal process in women.
