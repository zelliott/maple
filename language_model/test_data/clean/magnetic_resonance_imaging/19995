The Pott puffy tumor is a subperiosteal abscess of the frontal bone that appears as a localized swelling of the overlying region of the forehead associated with frontal osteomyelitis. The authors report the case of an 11-year-old boy who presented with a 6-week history of frontal headaches and a recent sudden-onset, progressively enlarging swelling of his midline forehead associated with immediate relief of headaches. A computed tomography (CT) study revealed 1) a subperiosteal abscess with intracranial extension through the perforated posterior table of the frontal sinus and 2) a large epidural abscess overlying a compressed and narrowed superior sagittal sinus. Emergency surgical relief of the epidural abscess, curettage of the osteomyelitic bone, and excision of the periosteal granulomatous puffy lump were performed. A 6-week course of intravenous antibiotic medication was completed, and the patient had an excellent recovery. The Pott puffy tumor remains a serious complication of frontal sinusitis. In the past 5 years, the frequency of published pediatric cases has increased. Undiagnosed or partially treated frontal sinusitis may lead to this serious complication, and the apparent increase in incidence rate may suggest that this complication of frontal sinusitis could be underestimated in clinical practice. The authors conclude that early diagnosis and complete treatment of frontal sinusitis is crucial.
