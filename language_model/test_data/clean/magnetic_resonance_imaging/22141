We report our recent experience with an asymptomatic case of Morgagni hernia composed of hypertrophic adipose tissue in the falciform ligament. The patient was a 47-year-old obese para-II woman. A chest X-ray during a routine health checkup showed an abnormal shadow in the right cardiophrenic angle that was larger than one year previously. Computed tomograms revealed a fat-density mass in the right side of the chest in contact with the anterior chest wall, pericardium and sternum that continued into the abdominal cavity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the intrathoracic mass lesion was continuous with the subphrenic tissue, and that the hilus of the hernia was 5 x 3 cm in size. A barium gastro-intestinal series revealed no abnormal findings. Surgical repair was achieved through the transabdominal approach. The omentum was found in its normal position. The herniated adipose tissue in the falciform ligament was repositioned on the peritoneal side, and excised. The hilus of the hernia was then closed with knotted sutures. Postoperatively, the abnormal shadow on the X-ray was no longer present, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Histological examination revealed the hernia to consist of mature adipose tissue 5 x 10 x 3 cm in size. This is the first case of Morgagni hernia composed of hypertrophic adipose tissue in the falciform ligament reported in Japan.
