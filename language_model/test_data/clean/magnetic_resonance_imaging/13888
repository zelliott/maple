Evaluating the MR findings of renal cortical necrosis was the purpose of this study.

Eight series of T1-/T2-weighted (n = 8) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (n = 4) MR images in six patients with renal cortical necrosis diagnosed by renal biopsy (n = 4) or on clinical grounds (n = 2) were reviewed. In those who had follow-up MRI (n = 2) or comparable CT (n = 3), interval changes of MR findings and comparison with CT images were done.

Swollen kidney with dark signal intensity rim involving the inner cortex and column of Bertin was noted on T2-and T1-weighted images. It was more conspicuous on T2-weighted images. The lesion did not enhance and was differentiated from uninvolved renal parenchyma. In the follow-up MRI, thickened dark signal intensity was more prominent and proved to be calcification or fibrosis.

MRI, especially T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, was helpful in evaluating renal cortical necrosis.
