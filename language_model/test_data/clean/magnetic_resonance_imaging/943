A 54-year-old woman who presented with headaches and bitemporal visual field loss had an MRI that disclosed a cystic lesion within the optic chiasm. Craniotomy yielded an inconclusive biopsy; incisional decompression of the cyst provided only temporary improvement in vision. When vision declined 3 months later, an MRI showed recurrence of the cyst. The patient underwent a second craniotomy with biopsy that revealed an adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. Because of the dangers of surgical removal, the cyst was left in place and connected by catheter to the prechiasmatic cisternal subarachnoid space. She received 54 Gy of three-dimensional conformal x-irradiation. At the time of her last follow-up examination 28 months postoperatively, the patient had marked improvement in her visual acuity and visual fields; an MRI demonstrated that the cyst remained decompressed. Cisternal catheter drainage represents a novel approach to the treatment of this rare variant of craniopharyngioma.
