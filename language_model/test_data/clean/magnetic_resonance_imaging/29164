The authors reports a case of inverted papilloma in a man of 59. The presenting symptom was unilateral nasal obstruction which developed over a period of five years. The characteristic feature of inverted papillomas is slow local growth with a tendency to cause absorption of bone and to recur, and also a potential for malignant change. Treatment is only surgical, and consists of wide and complete local excision to avoid recurrence, using either the para-latero-nasal approach or a degloving technique. The etio-pathogenesis of inverted papillomas is probably viral. DNA of papillomavirus origin has been identified in the cells of an inverted papilloma by using techniques of in situ hybridisation.
