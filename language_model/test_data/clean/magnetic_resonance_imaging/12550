Lung cancer with intramedullary spinal cord metastasis (ISCM) is a rare event exhibiting dismal prognosis. In the present paper, we describe a 74-year-old male who developed bilateral leg weakness with associated backache and non-productive cough. Chest imaging evaluation demonstrated pronounced bilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a nodular opacity in the right lower lobe. The patient was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer through bronchoscopic procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord with contrast-enhancement revealed an intramedullary lesion consistent with metastasis at the T5-T6 level. Despite chemotherapy and thoracic spine radiotherapy, he eventually succumbed to the disease 3 months after diagnosis. A brief overview of the current literature is also provided laying emphasis on the therapeutic strategies of this unusual extrathoracic metastatic disease.
