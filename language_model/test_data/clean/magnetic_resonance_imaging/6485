Choroid plexus surgery, which had been discarded as a treatment for hydrocephalus, was brought back into use with the development of modern neuroendoscopic technology. The object of this article is to describe the author's experience of the surgery with special emphasis on the surgical indication.

Three infants underwent endoscopic choroid plexus coagulation as a treatment for hydrocephalus. Standard procedure for the surgery was unilateral transparietal insertion of a flexible neuroendoscope and electrical coagulation of the choroid plexus. The results showed the release of increased intracranial pressure in two infants, while the other, whose hydrocephalus was rather progressive, later required a VP shunt.

Choroid plexus surgery for hydrocephalus seems to be effective in some patients. Advanced modern technology has enabled the application of a neuroendoscope for this procedure. From our limited experience, the key to the success of endoscopic choroid plexus coagulation is the selection of patients. Favorable candidates for the surgery seem to be those who suffer from the slow progressive, severe form of hydrocephalus and who lack the septum pellucidum.
