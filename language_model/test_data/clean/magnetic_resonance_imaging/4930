Studies of absence seizures (AS) using EEG with fMRI (EEG-fMRI) show a consistent network with prominent thalamic activation and a variety of cortical changes. Despite evidence suggesting a role of frontal cortex in seizure generation, group studies have not detected consistent AS-related changes in this region. We hypothesized that only a subgroup may show frontal cortical activation.

We studied 13 subjects with AS during EEG-fMRI to classify the different individual patterns of frontal cortical activation associated with AS.

Based upon visual inspection of surface-rendered activation maps we identified 2 subgroups that could be distinguished by the activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). One group of patients (n = 7) showed a primarily positive signal change (DLPFC-POS), whereas the other group (n = 6) showed a primarily negative signal change (DLFPC-NEG). When the DLPFC-POS group was compared to the DLPFC-NEG group, time-course analysis revealed a larger positive blood oxygenation level-dependent deflection following onset of the AS in cortical and subcortical areas beyond the DLPFC. This suggests a basic biological difference between these groups.

These observations suggest that there may be at least 2 mechanisms underpinning AS in individuals with absence epilepsy. This may have phenotypic and genetic implications for understanding epilepsy syndromes.
