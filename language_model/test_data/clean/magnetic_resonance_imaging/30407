To prospectively compare in canines the diagnostic accuracy for myocardial infarction (MI) of standard delayed-enhancement (DE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging versus that of subsecond DE MR imaging with and without breath holding and/or cardiac arrhythmia, with histologic findings or absence of surgical creation of MI as the reference standard.

This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee; 21 canines were imaged with one standard and two subsecond DE MR techniques in four conditions: condition 1, breath holding and steady gating; 2, non-breath holding and steady gating; 3, breath holding and irregular heart rhythm; and 4, non-breath holding and irregular heart rhythm. Images were randomized and scored for diagnostic accuracy, image quality, and observer confidence. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for MI detection were calculated for each technique and clinical condition separately. The chi(2), paired t, and McNemar tests were used for comparisons.

Fifteen dogs had MIs. Among conditions 2-4, differences were not significant (P > .05); data were pooled and referred to as group B. Condition 1 was group A. Accuracy, image quality, and observer confidence, respectively, for standard DE MR imaging were 96%, 3.7 +/- 0.8, and 2.7 +/- 0.6 in group A but only 74%, 2.4 +/- 0.8, and 1.8 +/- 0.7 in group B (P < or = .004 for each). Corresponding scores for subsecond techniques were unaffected by respiratory motion and/or arrhythmia. Subsecond techniques had higher accuracy (82% and 86% vs 74%), better image quality (3.9 +/- 0.7 and 3.2 +/- 0.8 vs 2.4 +/- 0.8), and greater confidence (2.4 +/- 0.7 and 2.1 +/- 0.7 vs 1.8 +/- 0.7) (P < or = .0002 for each) than standard DE MR imaging. In group A, standard performed better than subsecond DE MR imaging.

Standard DE MR imaging is appropriate for MI detection with breath holding and regular heart rhythm, while subsecond techniques are appropriate with an irregular heart rhythm and when breath holding is not possible.
