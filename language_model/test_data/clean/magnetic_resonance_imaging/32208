This study investigates the use of 3D representation and haptic technology in radiosurgery. The users, experienced users of the Leksell GammaKnife, prefer the 3D representation for constructing a first draft of their plan for neurosurgical intervention. When it comes to the final adjustments, however, they still choose the traditional 2D representation and interaction devices. The perceived control over the radiosurgical process is not considered adequate using the 3D interaction methods. Practitioners do not consider the haptic forces implemented in this test system useful. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed in the paper.
