To investigate whether Gd-DTPA-BMA-enhanced MR imaging permits differentiation between reperfused and nonreperfused myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction was induced in 12 domestic pigs. In 6 pigs, Gd-DTPA-BMA, 0.3 mmol/kg b.w. was administered i.v. 60 min after the occlusion. In 6 other pigs, the infarctions were reperfused 80 min after the occlusion, followed by injection of Gd-DTPA-BMA after 20 min of reperfusion. Radiolabeled microspheres were used to confirm zero-flow during the occlusion period and reperfusion in the infarcted myocardium. All pigs were killed 20 min after injection of contrast medium, and the hearts were excised and imaged with MR. The Gd concentration was measured in infarcted and nonischemic myocardium by ICP-AES. In the reperfused hearts, the infarctions were strongly highlighted, corresponding to a 5-fold higher Gd concentration in infarcted vis-Ã -vis nonischemic myocardium. In the hearts subjected to occlusion without reperfusion, there was only a rim of enhancement in the peripheral part of the infarctions.
