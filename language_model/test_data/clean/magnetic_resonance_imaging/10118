Spontaneous bilateral rupture of the quadriceps tendons without a significant history of trauma is an uncommon disease. It is generally associated with chronic metabolic disorders such as chronic renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Here, we report a case of spontaneous bilateral tendon rupture in a patient on chronic hemodialysis for the past 5 years. We performed a preoperative MRI to confirm the diagnosis; then we repaired the ruptured quadriceps tendons and reviewed the patient both clinically and by performing MRI postoperatively 4 yrs later. The patient attained the full function of the quadriceps tendon.
