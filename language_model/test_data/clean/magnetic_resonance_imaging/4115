Magnetic resonance imaging has been used to visualize size-based protein separations inside operating chromatography columns. The effects of flow nonuniformity have been observed and analyzed quantitatively through concentration profiles of tracers measured inside the column. Analysis of these profiles provides local and averaged intracolumn plate height values for characterization of dispersion and flow nonuniformity. The magnetic resonance measurements compare favorably with conventional chromatographic measurements of column efficiency and provide more detailed insights into nonideal column performance.
