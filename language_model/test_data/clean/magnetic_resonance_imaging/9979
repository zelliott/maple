Glatiramer acetate is a collection of synthetic polypeptides indicated as therapy for relapsing a remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Current understanding of the immunological and neuroprotective mechanisms of action of GA makes it unique among current MS therapies. The clinical efficacy of GA appears similar to that of the recombinant beta interferons. GA has a favorable side effect profile with excellent patient compliance and long-term acceptance. The results of pivotal controlled clinical trials and long-term data derived from organized extension studies are reviewed. Supportive data from open-label comparison, combination treatment and therapeutic switch studies are also provided to enable informed decisions on the appropriate place for GA among other immunomodulatory treatments for relapsing MS.
