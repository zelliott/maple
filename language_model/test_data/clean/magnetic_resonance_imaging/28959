Retrovirus-mediated gene therapy is a particularly attractive approach for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), given the poor prognosis of this tumour and its localized proliferation in post-mitotic tissue. In this study we assessed, for the first time in humans, the therapeutic potential of a newly designed bicistronic Moloney vector (pLIL-2-TK), combining the expression of a suicide gene (thymidine kinase, tk) with an immunomodulatory gene (human interleukin 2, IL-2). Evidence of transgene activity in the treated tumours is presented.
