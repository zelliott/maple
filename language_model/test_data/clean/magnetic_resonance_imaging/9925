Phaeohyphomycosis is an increasingly recognized cause of brain abscess in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. We report a case of cerebral phaeohyphomycosis in a 55-year-old male heart transplant recipient caused by Bipolaris spicifera. We review the literature regarding the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of infections with dematiaceous fungi.
