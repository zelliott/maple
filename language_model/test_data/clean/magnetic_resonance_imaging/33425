Intraosseous ganglia are benign cystic lesions usually located in the end of long bones, especially the distal tibia. Patients typically present with mild, localized, aching discomfort in a joint that is aggravated by weightbearing. Pathogenesis is currently unknown with the literature suggesting many valid theories. Surgical excision and curettage is the treatment of choice. A case of a ganglion cyst within a cuboid bone is presented along with a review of the literature and discussion of operative technique.
