Tremor resulting from damage to midbrain structures is poorly understood and often difficult to treat. The authors report a case of cystic degeneration of the brainstem with resultant Holmes-like tremor which was successfully treated using a stimulating electrode placed in the contralateral ventralis intermedius nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus.

A 31-year-old man presented with a multilobulated, multiseptated lesion of the upper brainstem diagnosed after subacute onset of headaches. The patient subsequently developed an incapacitating left-upper-extremity tremor refractory to medical treatment.

The patient underwent implantation of a deep brain stimulator in the VIM with symptomatic and functional improvement.

Deep brain stimulation is an effective and safe intervention for tremor of unusual etiology. Electrode placement should be based on an understanding of the structure-function relationships underlying the various and distinct types of tremor.
