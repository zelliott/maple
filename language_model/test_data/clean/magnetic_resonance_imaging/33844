Both ganglioglioma and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors are well-recognized glial-neuronal neoplasms associated with chronic epilepsy and cortical dysplasia (neuronal migration abnormalities). The exact relationship between these 2 glial-neuronal tumors continues to be debated. This article reports a case of a composite ganglioglioma and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor occurring in a 36-year-old woman in the left temporal lobe region. The resection histologically demonstrated distinct areas of ganglioglioma and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor. A focal area of cortical dysplasia is also identified. The MIB-1 labeling indexes in both components were low (<1% of tumor cell nuclei). The coexistence of these 2 lesions and cortical dysplasia suggest a possible etiologic relationship between these 2 tumors.
