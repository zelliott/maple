We studied regional cerebral glucose metabolism in 15 patients with a clinical diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration (CBD), 15 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 15 healthy controls for 19 brain regions. Asymmetry in regional glucose metabolism was found in the central and frontal cortices in patients with CBD as compared with either the normal controls or the patients with AD. Regional glucose metabolism in CBD patients was significantly lower in the paracentral and superior parietal areas and thalamus than in patients with AD. Relative glucose metabolism in patients with CBD was significantly higher in the posterior cingulate, medial temporal and basal frontal areas, and significantly lower in the paracentral and superior parietal areas than in those with AD. These features of regional glucose metabolic abnormality in CBD may correspond to neurological and cognitive disturbances peculiar to CBD.
