The differential diagnosis of intradural spinal tumors is primarily based on location, but the clinical presentation, age, and gender of the patient are also important factors in determining the diagnosis. This comprehensive review focuses on the current classification, clinical symptoms, and MRI features of the more common intradural extramedullary and intramedullary neoplastic lesions. This review does not include extradural lesions.
