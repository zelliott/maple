Localized fibrous tumours of the pleura (LFTP) represent clinical entities rarely encountered, especially in giant forms. We report of three cases of giant localized fibrous tumours of the pleura found last year in a short time. The patients underwent surgery by thoracotomy. All tumours arose from visceral pleura and were radically excised by a wedge resection of the lung. The patients discharged from the hospital after a short postoperative period without complications. Two of three giant localized fibrous tumours were classified as benign forms; in one case a malignant characteristic was found.
