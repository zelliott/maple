The cerebellum traditionally has been viewed as a neural device dedicated to motor control. Although recent evidence shows that it is involved in nonmotor operations as well, an important question is whether this involvement is independent of motor control and motor guidance. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to demonstrate that attention and motor performance independently activate distinct cerebellar regions. These findings support a broader concept of cerebellar function, in which the cerebellum is involved in diverse cognitive and noncognitive neurobehavioral systems, including the attention and motor systems, in order to anticipate imminent information acquisition, analysis, or action.
