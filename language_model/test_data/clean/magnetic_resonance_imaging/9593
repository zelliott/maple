Although Doppler echocardiography remains the most frequently used imaging modality for assessing valvular heart disease, the technique has a number of limitations that could affect the quality of imaging studies and make the results difficult to interpret. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging could be superior to echocardiography in a number of ways: for example, for assessing ventricular dimensions, volumes, function and mass, for quantifying valvular regurgitation, and for investigating areas of myocardial fibrosis and extracardiac structures. In carrying out these tasks, CMR uses a variety of pulse sequences that are specially created to obtain information on specific tissue characteristics or on particular aspects of blood flow through heart valves. This general review article focuses on the usefulness of CMR in the clinical diagnosis of valvular heart disease and reviews how the data acquired using the technique can be incorporated into algorithms for the clinical management of patients with significant valvular heart lesions.
