Two independent intracranial arteriovenous malformations occurring to a single patient is rarely seen. A 23-year-old female suffered from a sudden onset weakness of the left side extremities and a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. A cranial CT revealed an intracranial hemorrhage in the right posterior temporal region and a highly enhanced mass in the left frontal lobe. On MR images, combination of subacute hematoma and serpentine vascular shadows in the right temporal area as well as clusters of vessels in the left frontal lobe were seen. Cerebral angiography confirmed one AVM in the right posterior temporal and the other the left frontal cortex.
