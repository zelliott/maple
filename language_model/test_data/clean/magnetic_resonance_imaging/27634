Lymphadenitis is the most common form of tuberculosis in the head and neck region, but it can be seen in the other areas of the head and neck. Nasopharyngeal tuberculosis is a rare condition without pulmonary and systemic involvement. The majority of patients present with neck mass. A 17-year-old female patient admitted to our outpatient clinic with the complaints of swelling on both sides of the neck and hearing loss. The endoscopic examination revealed a nasopharyngeal mass, and biopsies were taken from the mass. The result of pathologic examination was reported as caseating granulomatous inflammation compatible with tuberculosis. In this report, a nasopharyngeal tuberculosis case associated with massive cervical lymphadenopathy was reported, and etiopathogenesis and treatment were also discussed.
