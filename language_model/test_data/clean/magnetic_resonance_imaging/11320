In this contribution, a rapid and robust technique for quantitative T(1) mapping of the human lung is presented. Based on a series of Snapshot FLASH tomograms acquired after a single inversion pulse, high quality and quantitative T(1) parameter maps acquired in under five seconds were obtained from six healthy volunteers. The measured T(1) values are in good agreement with previously reported literature values. T(1) maps were also acquired with the volunteers breathing room air or 100% O(2). The T(1) difference between breathing room air and 100% O(2) is statistically significant at P < 0.0001.
