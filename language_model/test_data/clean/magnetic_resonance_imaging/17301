This paper presents two cases of muscle infarction involving four major muscles of the anterior abdominal wall (case 1) and pectoralis major (case 2) in individuals with diabetes.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and creatine kinase (CK) were measured and Doppler ultrasound, an open muscle biopsy (case 1) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (case 2) were performed.

The diagnosis of muscle infarction was made by histological findings and MRI images with hyper-intensive signals on a gadolinium-enhanced T2-weighted sequence, respectively. Both patients were treated with bed rest, immobilization of the involved extremities, analgesia and intensive insulin therapy. In addition, anticoagulant drugs such as low molecular weight heparin sodium and cilostazol, and some traditional Chinese medicines such as ligustrazine and salvia miltiorrhiza were administered. The symptoms of both patients resolved gradually after 3 weeks. However, muscle infarction reoccurred in case 1 on the opposite side of the abdomen and recovered after 40 days.

This is the first report of muscle infarction involving the muscles of anterior abdominal walls and pectoralis major in diabetes. MRI is the best non-invasive technique and T2-weighted imaging is the most valuable method for the diagnosis. In addition to supportive therapy, administration of anticoagulant agents and some Chinese traditional medicine may be useful in symptom relief.
