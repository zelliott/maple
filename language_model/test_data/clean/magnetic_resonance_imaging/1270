Diffuse, asymptomatic skeletal metastases occurred in a 46-year-old patient with liposarcoma. These metastases were detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but not by roentgenograms or radionuclide scans. Pathologic confirmation from the MRI-detected area was obtained. This observation suggests a possible explanation for the present discrepancy between the incidence of skeletal involvement in antemortem and postmortem studies in metastatic liposarcoma. MRI may be an extremely sensitive tool for detection of bone and bone marrow metastasis.
