Differences in cortical surface features between healthy controls (n = 48) and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (n = 46), ages 14-59, were characterized by means of advanced quantitative MRI processing techniques. Cortical surface features of interest included gyral and sulcal curvature, cortical depth, and total cortical surface area. Epilepsy patients and controls differed on measures of gyrification; the abnormalities generalized despite the focal nature of the primary epileptic process. Changes in cortical surface features were associated with increasing chronological age in both groups. Abnormalities in gyrification were associated with cognitive performance and with other morphometric measurements (e.g., surface cerebral spinal fluid). These findings are related to the literature regarding morphometric changes associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and normal aging.
