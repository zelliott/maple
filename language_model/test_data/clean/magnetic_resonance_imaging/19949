A case of Little Leaguer's shoulder (LLS) in a 12-year-old male is presented. Classically, LLS is an overuse injury affecting adolescent pitchers. The diagnosis is the result of a thorough history, physical examination, and radiographic evaluation. Clinicians unfamiliar with LLS may fail to detect this injury and order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study without radiographs. The objective of this case report is to help radiologists become more familiar with the MRI and radiographic findings of LLS.
