We report on a 17-year-old girl who developed shoulder pain after a fall on an outstretched arm. CT arthrography and MR imaging demonstrated a cartilage defect centrally located in the glenoid. This was accompanied by an eroded appearance of the underlying bone. Since symptoms persisted over several months it was initially thought this represented a cartilage injury. Subsequently arthroscopy was performed and the abnormality was identified as a bare area of the glenoid. A tear of the superior glenohumeral ligament was depicted and was repaired. The bare area is an oval area denuded of cartilage that is probably developmental and that should be differentiated from true cartilage injuries to avoid unnecessary interventions. An eroded appearance of the underlying bone may occur on imaging, a finding that has not been previously reported.
