The aim of this study is to evaluate the interest of diffusion weighted MRI for the study of white matter fiber tracking.

Fifteen subjects having undergone diffusion weighted MRI have been included. Three white matter fiber trackings have been studied for each subject: interhemispheric transcallosum, optic radiations and pyramidal tracts. The results were compared to an atlas of human anatomy.

All the white matter tracts studied have been visualized. The morphology of the three white matter tracts was similar to standard anatomy. The orientation of the three white matter tracts was determined in 100% of the cases.

diffusion weighted MRI allowed the morphological study of all the analyzed white matter tracts. This technique might, therefore, help to evaluate nerve fiber tracts and guide neurosurgical interventions.
