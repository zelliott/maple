The past 20 years have seen major advances in the diagnosis and management of brain abscess, with a corresponding improvement in the survival rates. The advances in radiographic scanning, the availability of new antimicrobials, and the development of novel surgical techniques have all contributed to the decreases in associated morbidity and mortality. The relative rarity of brain abscess and the frequent delays in making the diagnosis render this condition a significant challenge for the clinician. A high index of suspicion is required so that effective therapy can be instituted as soon as possible. Close coordination of care between neurosurgeons and infectious diseases specialists is increasingly important in the complicated management of brain abscess. Adequate abscess drainage and appropriate antimicrobial therapy remain the cornerstones of proper treatment of this condition.
