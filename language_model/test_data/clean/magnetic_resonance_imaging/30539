Metallosis after shoulder replacement has not previously been described in the literature. We report a patient who developed extensive metallosis after implantation of an uncemented Nottingham shoulder replacement. He underwent a revision procedure. Examination of the retrieved prosthesis showed that the titanium porous coating was separating from the humeral stem and becoming embedded in the ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene glenoid component, resulting in abrasive wear of the humeral component. There was metallosis despite exchange of the modular humeral head. Both components had to be exchanged to resolve the problem.
