A 46-year-old female presented with persistent bifrontal headache. Computed tomography revealed a large cystic tumor in the right temporoparietal area, which included a solid component. The tumor had no attachment to the dura. There was no peritumoral edema or mass effect usually found around cystic meningiomas. The solid component was totally removed. Histological examination indicated that the tumor was a fibrous meningioma. Intracerebral meningioma with a large cystic component without dural attachment should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic cerebral tumors.
