The maximal strengths of knee extensor (E) and flexor (F) muscles were compared in a group of 6 male subjects aged 24-31 years. Cross-sectional area (CSA) of E and F was evaluated from planimetric measurements of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging axial scans, carried out at five levels along the thigh. Maximal CSA for E was found at 2/3 upper femur height and at 1/3 lower femur height for F. Maximum isometric force (MIF) of E was found to be 135% greater than that of F. The maximum CSA of E was found to be 93% larger than CSA of F. The calculated mechanical advantage of the flexors was estimated to be 13.8% higher than that of the knee extensors (0.116 +/- 0.012 and 0.132 +/- 0.005, respectively). However, when MIF of E and F were standardised for their respective CSA, no significant difference was found between their stress: 80.1 +/- 15.5 N.cm-2 for E and 70.5 +/- 7.0 N.cm-2 for F. From the present study, it is concluded that no significant difference exists between the maximum stress of knee extensor and flexor muscles despite large differences in their absolute values of force and CSA and that the NMR imaging technique enables accurate in-vivo determination of the CSA of individual muscles.
