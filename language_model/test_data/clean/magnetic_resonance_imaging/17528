A 55-year-old woman presented with a longstanding history of headache and personality change. Preoperative imaging suggested an olfactory groove meningioma invading the posterior nasal space. Following surgical removal of the lesion histopathology confirmed the presence of both a nasal schwannoma and an olfactory groove meningioma. This dual pathology may represent a variation of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF-2).
