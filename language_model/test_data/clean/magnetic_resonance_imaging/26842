Phyllodes tumor of the breast is a rare disease constituting 0.3-0.9% of all breast neoplasms. Occurring mainly in females aged 35 to 55 yr, the disease is especially rare among adolescent females. There is no published literature about de novo phyllodes tumor after liver transplantation. Here we describe a case of de novo phyllodes tumors in an adolescent female after liver transplantation from a living donor for Wilson disease.
