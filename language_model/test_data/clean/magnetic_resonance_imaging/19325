Imaging of the facial nerve has proved its usefulness to physicians in the evaluation of pathological conditions of this nerve. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the facial nerve should always be obtained selectively and should include the parotid gland in case of peripheral facial nerve palsy. Gadolinium-DTPA contrast pulse sequence is the most informative MRI study for evaluation of facial nerve pathology. This article reviews the imaging anatomy of the facial nerve and describes the clinical features and MR characteristics of common disorders of the facial nerve.
