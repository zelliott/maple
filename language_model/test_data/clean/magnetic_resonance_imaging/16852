This study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of extremity tumor regions for patient-specific preoperative assessment and planning by using CT and MRI image data fusion. The CT and MRI image data of five patients with solid tumors were fused to construct 3D models of the respective tumor regions. The reconstruction time and image fusion accuracy were measured, and the tumor features and spatial relationships were analyzed to enable subject-specific preoperative assessment and planning as guidance for tumor resection. The 3D models of the tumor regions, including skin, fat, bones, tumor, muscles, internal organs, nerves and vessels, were created with a mean reconstruction time of 103 minutes and fusion accuracy of 2.02â€‰mm. The 3D reconstruction clearly delineated the tumor features, and provided a vivid view of spatial relationships within the tumor region. Based on this intuitional information, the subject-specific preoperative assessment and planning were easily accomplished, and all tumor resections were performed as planned preoperatively. Three-dimensional reconstruction using CT/MRI image fusion is feasible for accurate reproduction of the complex anatomy of the tumor region with high efficiency, and can help surgeons improve the preoperative assessment and planning for effective removal of tumors.
