Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is an unusual tumor composed of differentiated myofibroblastic spindle cells usually accompanied by numerous plasma cells and lymphocytes. IMT was originally described in the lung; occurrence in a long bone is rare. We present two examples of IMT arising in a long bone: one in the humerus and one in the femur. In both cases, imaging shows a poorly delineated osteolytic lesion with cortical bone destruction that aggressively extends into surrounding soft tissue. Histologically, the lesion is dominated by differentiated spindle cells with aprominent collagenous stroma and an inflammatory component including plasma cells and lymphocytes, and with positive immunoreactivity for anaplastic lymphoma kinase. The absence of cytologic atypia helps differentiate this lesion from malignant spindle cell tumors.
