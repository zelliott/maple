A comparison between contrast and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as obtained by both maximum entropy (ME) and 2DFT reconstruction, is reported for NMR images. Our results show that in the ME elaboration the contrast and SNR are generally increased with respect to the 2DFT elaboration. The magnitude of such an increase depends on the ME statistical parameter and also, quite strongly, on the values of contrast and SNR of the 2DFT image.
