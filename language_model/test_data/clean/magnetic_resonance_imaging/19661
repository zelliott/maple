Herein is described the case of a 79-year-old woman who underwent elective aortic valve replacement. The procedure was complicated by a particulate embolism into the left anterior descending artery leading to a myocardial infarction, complicated by ventricular septal rupture. Subsequently, the patient was reoperated on and the septal defect closed successfully, with an uneventful recovery.
