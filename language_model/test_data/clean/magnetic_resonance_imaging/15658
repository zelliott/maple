Renal transplant recipients are at increased risk for life-threatening complications, most commonly infections. Because of their impaired cell-mediated immunity, these patients are particularly susceptible to organisms that rely on intracellular survival and spread, such as Listeria monocytogenes. Despite being a food-borne pathogen, L. monocytogenes is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Here we report the case of a renal transplant recipient who developed rapidly progressive neurological symptoms after a brief gastrointestinal illness. Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain showed a large mass that was identified as an abscess due to L. monocytogenes. Timely aspiration and antibiotic treatment resulted in complete recovery, as opposed to worse outcomes in the available case reports. We further review the epidemiology, microbiology, clinical presentation, and therapeutic options for listerial brain abscess.
