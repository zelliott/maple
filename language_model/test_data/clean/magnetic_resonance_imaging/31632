High-quality prostate images were obtained with transceiver arrays at 7T after performing subject-dependent local transmit B(1) (B(1) (+)) shimming to minimize B(1) (+) losses resulting from destructive interferences. B(1) (+) shimming was performed by altering the input phase of individual RF channels based on relative B(1) (+) phase maps rapidly obtained in vivo for each channel of an eight-element stripline coil. The relative transmit phases needed to maximize B(1) (+) coherence within a limited region around the prostate greatly differed from those dictated by coil geometry and were highly subject-dependent. A set of transmit phases determined by B(1) (+) shimming provided a gain in transmit efficiency of 4.2 +/- 2.7 in the prostate when compared to the standard transmit phases determined by coil geometry. This increased efficiency resulted in large reductions in required RF power for a given flip angle in the prostate which, when accounted for in modeling studies, resulted in significant reductions of local specific absorption rates. Additionally, B(1) (+) shimming decreased B(1) (+) nonuniformity within the prostate from (24 +/- 9%) to (5 +/- 4%). This study demonstrates the tremendous impact of fast local B(1) (+) phase shimming on ultrahigh magnetic field body imaging.
