We report on a case of malignant lymphoma in the chest wall, associated with chronic tuberculous empyema. CT and MR imaging showed a soft-tissue mass contiguous with the empyema and invading the chest wall. MR imaging demonstrated a difference in signal intensity between the mass and the empyema. The extent of the chest-wall lymphoma was optimally delineated on fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced MR images.
