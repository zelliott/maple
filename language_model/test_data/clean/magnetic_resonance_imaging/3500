Distal brachii triceps tendon rupture is rare. Partial lesions are not so well defined. If functionally they are well tolerated in patients with low functional demand, management guideline is not so clear for sportsmen. To our best knowledge, there is no reported technique for the repair of partial forms. A 28-year-old patient was operated on for a partial triceps rupture. He underwent a transosseous olecranon suture of the tricipital tendon, with a side-to-side suture to the healthy residual tendon. The patient was assessed at 2 years follow-up with the DASH score. He had painless and mobile elbow with no effusion and returned to sport 4 months after his surgical repair. The extension strength was comparable to the healthy side (5/5). The DASH score was 1,7 for global score, and 6,3 for work and sport modules. Partial rupture of brachii triceps tendon is not well tolerated in high functional demand patients. We think that patients should be operated in these situations and may achieve excellent results. Postoperative management is crucial to achieve good results as well as in complete rupture.
