Two, discrete and spherical low grade gliomas, both demonstrating homogenous signal characteristics on MRI, were treated by radical radiosurgery. Both demonstrated the central low intensity signal alterations that are now well-described as occurring after radiosurgery of cranial neuroma. Growth arrest occurred in both cases by 2 years, followed by slow shrinkage in case 2 with the longer follow-up. Both patients are well at 2 and 5 years after treatment. These observations are discussed with regard to the role of radiosurgery in glioma therapy.
