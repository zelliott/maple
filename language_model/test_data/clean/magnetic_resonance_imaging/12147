The Authors consider magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with surface coils in the diagnosis of normal and abnormal temporomandibular joint. After describing technical data, the Authors discuss advantages and limitations of MR. The noninvasive and nonionizing characteristics of MR; the possibility to visualize at the same time soft and hard tissues of TMJ induce the Authors to maintain the validity of the technique and the potentiality for the future.
