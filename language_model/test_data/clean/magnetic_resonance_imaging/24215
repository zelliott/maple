The association between dental occlusion and the development of intraarticular temporomandibular disorders remains unclear.

This study evaluated the prevalence of molar relationship, lateral guidance and nonworking side contacts and intraarticular temporomandibular disorders.

Eighty-two asymptomatic volunteers and 263 symptomatic temporomandibular disorder (TMD) patients completed a subjective questionnaire that documented the absence of jaw pain, joint noise, locking, and a positive history for TMD. Participants also underwent clinical and dental examination for signs and symptoms commonly associated with TMD or internal derangements.

The most prevalent molar relationship was Class I. Symptomatic patients had a higher prevalence of Class II, Division 1 relationships on the left side compared with the asymptomatic volunteers with normal joints. There was a higher prevalence of canine guidance (52.04%; P <.005) on the right side in the symptomatic patients with disk displacement (DD). Volunteers with normal joints had a higher prevalence of 1 or more nonworking side contacts compared with symptomatic patients with normal joints (P <.001) and symptomatic patients with DD (P <. 001).

This study suggests there are no systematic dental occlusal differences that clearly separate symptomatic from asymptomatic patients. Results indicate that it is unclear as to the relationship of the 3 analyzed factors and of intraarticular TMDs.
