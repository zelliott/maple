The authors analyzed data from 69 published case studies of Psychotic Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury (PDTBI) in order to describe its common characteristics and assist in its diagnosis and differentiation from schizophrenia. The majority of these PDTBI patients were males with onset of symptoms occurring within the first 2 years after moderate to severe head injury. A majority showed abnormalities on MRI/CT and EEG with localization in the frontal and temporal areas. The general presentation included delusions and hallucinations without co-occurring negative symptoms. The findings demonstrate that patients with PDTBI have a profile that distinguishes itself from schizophrenia.
