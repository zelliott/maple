Choledochal cysts are rare developmental malformations of the biliary tree. Percutaneous and endoscopic ultrasound, as well as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, are recommended diagnostic tools. Magnetic resonance cholangiography may also contribute to the workup and treatment plan of patients with choledochal cysts. We report a 25-yr-old white woman with episodic nausea and moderate epigastric discomfort. Magnetic resonance cholangiography showed a rather spherical, cyst-like, fluid-filled structure in continuity with the prepapillary segment of the common bile duct, thus making a choledochocele (type III choledochal cyst) likely. The patient was treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy and, after a 6-month follow-up, is without complaints.
