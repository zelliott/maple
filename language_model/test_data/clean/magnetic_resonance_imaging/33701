Since Hunt et al's description (1961) Tolosa-Hunt syndrome has been a matter of controversies about its nosological identity and differential diagnosis. We report 7 cases diagnosed between 1979 and 1990. Four of them had a low-resolution CT and the diagnosis was made after a long follow-up, according to classical criteria of exclusion. The last 3 cases had a modern high-resolution CT or a MRI (2 cases) and the diagnosis was established in a few days. MRI has considerably simplified the differential diagnosis but it has not completely resolved it. Alterations of shape and signal of the cavernous sinus are similar to those of lymphoma, sarcoidosis and meningioma. When MRI is normal diabetic ophthalmoplegia, migrainous ophthalmoplegia and giant-cell arteritis must also be considered. We conclude that the diagnosis of the Tolosa-Hunt syndrome can generally be made in a few days, without a cavernous sinus biopsy. There is no reason to doubt that this syndrome is a specific nosological entity.
