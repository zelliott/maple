Bone marrow pathology of hematological neoplasms was evaluated using short TI IR sequences and T2 weighted STIR (IR 1500/100/40, IR 1500/100/80). Material consisted of 49 individuals including 10 leukemias, 5 myelofibroses and 30 multiple myelomas. On IR 1500/100/40, all cases revealed heterogenously or diffusely high intensity. On IR 1500/100/80, both of acute and chronic myelocytic leukemias revealed definite signal decrease, while chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myelofibrosis and multiple myeloma showed no obvious signal decrease.
