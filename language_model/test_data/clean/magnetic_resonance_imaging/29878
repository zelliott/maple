Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a superficially located, rare glial tumour first described in 1979. It affects young patients, who often present with seizures. The tumour has a relatively favourable prognosis, but 15-20% progress to malignancy. We describe two cases of PXA, both with benign features at presentation, one of which underwent anaplastic transformation. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment. Factors influencing clinical outcome include extent of resection, and histological features such as mitotic index, necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration. The roles of radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain undefined. We advocate lifelong follow-up and establishment of a central registry in order to further the understanding of this infrequently encountered tumour.
