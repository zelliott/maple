The aim of this study was to evaluate prevalence of intracranial abnormalities in children with non-syndromic single suture craniosynostosis scheduled for cranial vault remodelling surgery using pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging.

A retrospective analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging studies of 129 non-syndromic single suture craniosynostosis children undergoing craniofacial surgery between January, 2004-October, 2010 was conducted. Statistical analysis was performed for child, maternal and sibling related predisposing factors for abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging findings. The mean age of these 121 patients at the time of imaging was 21.6 months. The majority, 78% were males and 74% of the patients were scaphocephalic.

In 18 (15%) patients abnormal brain findings were noted. The most common finding was Chiari 1 malformation in 11 (9%). Chiari 1 malformation comprised over half (61%) of the brain anomalies identified. None of these findings required any additional surgical procedures. None of the statistical analysis reached statistical significance.

Brain anomalies in connection with non-syndromic single suture craniosynostosis patients seem to be a coincidental event. We did not establish any specific craniosynostosis form to be regularly associated with abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging findings. The routine use of pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging in non-syndromic single suture craniosynostosis patients seems to be of limited value in the search for associated intracranial malformations necessitating additional interventions.
