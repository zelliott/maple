We report a 22-yr-old male patient with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH) associated with a giant middle fossa arachnoid cyst (AC) diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). He presented with pubertal and growth delay. He also had learning disabilities and anosmia. Laboratory investigation revealed pre-pubertal levels of testosterone and normal results of the combined test of anterior pituitary function, except for in GnRH acute and prolonged test. Cranial MRI showed an AC in left middle fossa with expansion to suprasellar cisterna and several abnormalities like left temporal lobe hypoplasia, left optic tract and bilateral olfactory bulb hypoplasia and left hypothalamic hypoplasia.
