The objective of our study was to describe the MRI appearance of and possible mechanism responsible for physeal widening in the knees of high-level child athletes.

Widened physes in the knees of skeletally immature child athletes have MR signal characteristics similar to the normal physis but likely are a sign of stress injury. These children should cease the offending sport and rest the knee to allow rapid healing.
