The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using ultrashort TE (UTE) pulse sequences to image the lumbar spine.

Pulse sequences of TE=0.08 ms were used to image the lumbar spine in 5 normal subjects and 14 patients with degenerative disease. Contrast enhancement was administered in 11 cases.

The sequences showed high signal in the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments, the cartilaginous end plate, the annulus fibrosus, the ligamentum flavum, interspinous ligaments and insertions of ligaments. Normal contrast enhancement was seen in these structures. Enhancement of hypertrophied ligaments and scar tissue was readily identified. Long T2 suppression techniques were useful in distinguishing enhancement of scar tissue from veins. Enhancement in discs was more obvious than with conventional sequences. In a case of thalassaemia bands of high signal were seen in the intervertebral discs parallel to the end plates.

The UTE sequences offer new options for visualizing discs, scar tissue, ligaments and other structures of the lumbar spine in health and disease.
