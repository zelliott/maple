With increasing numbers of in vivo experiments in the field of neuroscience, the interest in methods for in vivo imaging of animal brains as small as those of mice has increased. Because highly specialized small bore scanners with high field strengths are not commonly available, clinical magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) scanners have been used in the past to image rat and more recently also mouse brains in combination with specifically developed RF coils. These studies have demonstrated that imaging of small animal brains is feasible, and that tumor volumes measured by cMRI correlate well with histological tumor volume analysis. This protocol describes the cMRI settings at 1.5 T for imaging of mouse brain with resolutions up to 120 x 120 microm using an inexpensive, commercially available small loop surface coil. This allows easy establishment of a small animal MRI facility without the need for cost intensive dedicated small animal scanners or special custom made coils. In this study, we demonstrate high-resolution imaging of intracranial xenografts in a mouse glioma model and monitor the treatment effect of external field irradiation by cMRI.
