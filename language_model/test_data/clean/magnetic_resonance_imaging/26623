Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) are a hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). These large nerve tumors can be disfiguring and surgery is the only known standard therapy. Surgical intervention may be suboptimal due to the diffuse nature of PN. Here, we present a case in which we describe the use of high-dose carboplatin to treat the patient's testicular seminoma which resulted in the decrease in size of a PN in a patient with NF1.
