Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the functional connectivity throughout the entire brain in schizophrenia. The abnormalities in functional connectivity were identified by comparing the correlation coefficients of each pair of 116 brain regions between 15 patients and 15 controls. Then, the global distribution of the abnormal functional connectivities was examined. Experimental results indicated, in general, a decreased functional connectivity in schizophrenia during rest, and such abnormalities were widely distributed throughout the entire brain rather than restricted to a few specific brain regions. The results provide a quantitative support for the hypothesis that schizophrenia may arise from the disrupted functional integration of widespread brain areas.
