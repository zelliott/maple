We used MRI to examine the hips of 32 asymptomatic patients at 9 to 21 months after renal transplantation covered by high-dose corticosteroids. Five hips in three patients showed changes which indicate avascular necrosis, although radiographs, CT scans and isotope scans were normal. These patients had repeat MRI scans after another two years and three years. One patient with bilateral MRI changes developed symptoms and abnormal radiographs and CT and isotope scans in one hip nine months after the abnormal MRI. Intraosseous pressure was found to be raised in both hips, and core biopsies revealed necrotic bone on both sides. The other three hips have remained asymptomatic with unchanged MRI appearances three years after the initial MRI. It seems that idiopathic avascular necrosis does not always progress to bone collapse in the medium term.
