Advances in stroke treatment have mirrored advances in vascular imaging. Understanding and advances in reperfusion therapies were made possible by improvements in computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, neurovascular ultrasound, and renewed interest in catheter angiography. As technology allows better noninvasive vascular diagnosis, digital subtraction angiography (the remaining gold standard for vascular imaging) is increasingly used for rescue procedures and elective interventions. This review will examine specific advantages and disadvantages of different vascular imaging modalities as related to stroke diagnosis.
