Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMCS) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma and usually occurs in deep soft tissues, especially of the proximal extremities and limb girdles. We present an unusual case of the tumor arising in the finger. The diagnosis was confirmed by molecular detection of a characteristic EWS-CHN/TEC fusion gene transcript. Molecular detection of the tumor specific fusion gene could be a valuable aid for the final diagnosis of EMCS, particularly in cases with unusual clinicopathological features.
