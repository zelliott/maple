As compared to other imaging modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is characterized by superior soft tissue contrast, multiplanar display, and lack of ionizing radiation and other hazards. Contrast media, including paramagnetic substances, (e.g., gadolinium-DTPA) are useful for further improvement of diagnostic capabilities of MRI. In this paper the results of MRI in rheumatoid arthritis and related disorders, as well as the potentials of its clinical use are discussed.
