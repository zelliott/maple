Percutaneous catheter ablation is an established therapy for symptomatic drug-refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). Accurate delineation of relevant anatomy is critical but often challenging and limited in traditional technologies such as intra-procedural fluoroscopy. There has been an increased interest in non-invasive three-dimensional imaging technologies, especially computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as useful tools for patients undergoing AF ablation. Here, we review applications of CT and MRI before, during, and after AF ablation and highlight areas for future research.
