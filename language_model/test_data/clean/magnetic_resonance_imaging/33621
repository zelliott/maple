Cerebral venous angioma (CVA) is an embryonic venous malformation. Its incidence was thought to be radiologically rare previously but with greater clinical awareness, the routine use of contrast enhanced computerised tomography (CECT) and the increasing availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is no longer perceived to be a rare lesion. In fact, it is the commonest intracranial vascular malformation seen at autopsy. We report our experience of 15 patients with cerebral venous angiomas, 14 of whom had their lesions confirmed by cerebral angiography. Presentation was variable and non-specific. The commonest presenting symptom was headache (n = 7). Other clinical presentations included epilepsy (n = 5), intracerebral bleed (n = 4, two were thought to be due to an associated cerebral cavernous angioma and one was due to a ruptured arteriovenous malformation) and non-specific giddiness (n = 3). Six were diagnosed incidentally. Based on the angiographic findings and the relatively benign clinical course in the majority of our patients, we believe that CVA is a developmental anomaly and should not be excised routinely.
