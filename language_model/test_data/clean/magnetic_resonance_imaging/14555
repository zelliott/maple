Fetal MRI is now a well-established imaging modality for the diagnostic evaluation of fetuses with congenital anomalies. In this article, the authors provide a brief overview of the physical principles involved in fetal MRI imaging, the sequences that are used in clinical practice today, current indications, and limitations. A review of current evidence supports the following indications for fetal MRI: suspected central nervous system anomalies, neck and oropharyngeal masses, diaphragmatic hernia, abdominal masses or bowel pathology not fully characterized by ultrasonography, and suspected fetal infection. Other indications should be decided on a case-by-case basis with close collaboration between the departments of maternal-fetal medicine and radiology. More research is needed to determine the role of fetal MRI in functional neuroimaging at higher magnetic field strengths (3T).
