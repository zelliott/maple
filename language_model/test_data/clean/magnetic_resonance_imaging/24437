Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using a double-balloon enteroscope (DBE) in patients with bowel reconstruction due to a previous abdominal surgery is now widely accepted. In particular, a short DBE, which has a 2.8-mm working channel and 152-cm working length, is useful for ERCP because of its good rotational and straightening ability and the availability of various conventional ERCP accessories through the working channel. Herein we report a case of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma via ERCP with a short DBE. This is the first report in which the pre-cutting and the brush cytological examination were performed successfully under a DBE to diagnose intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma pathologically. The short DBE allowed us to perform all diagnostic and therapeutic procedures accepted in conventional ERCP in patients with surgically altered anatomies.
