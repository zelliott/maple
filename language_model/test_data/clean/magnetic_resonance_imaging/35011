Brachytherapy plays a major role in the therapeutic management of patiens with cervix cancer. The rapid dose fall-off provide a very high dose to the tumor, while relative sparing bladder, rektum, sigmoid and small bowel. The CT/MR-based planning provides better information on target and organ volumes and dose-volumes histograms in contrast to radiography-based planning, that provides doses only at selected points.
