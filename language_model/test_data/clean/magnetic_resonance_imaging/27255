To analyze the anesthetic management for neurosurgery using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI).

Thirty patients with intracranial tumor received MRI for preoperative safety screening and the operation was performed with general anesthesia and support by MRI-compatible machines. The operative time, frequency and duration of MRI, MRI-related time (from the preparation for MRI to the beginning of the surgery), time delay by MRI, body temperature at the initial iMRI and special issues related to the scanning and perioperative anesthesia were recorded.

Thirty patients successfully completed the operations without any incidents related to anesthesia or scanning. The mean frequency of MRI was 1.8, the mean duration of MRI was 29.24 ∓ 10.10 min, and the MRI-related time was 43.83 ∓ 10.23 min; the time delay MRI was 92.63 ∓ 28.31 min, and the body temperature was significantly higher at 2 h after MRI than that after induction.

In the anesthetic management for neurosurgery with iMRI, the anesthesiologists should focus on the safety precaution and anesthetic modulation according to the special environment and procedure of iMRI.
