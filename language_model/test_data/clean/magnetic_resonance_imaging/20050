A 25-year-old male patient presented with foot drop indicative of a sciatic nerve injury following gluteal intramuscular (IM) injections. Blood tests and magnetic resonance imaging of his spine were within normal limits, but electrophysiological studies confirmed a partial sciatic nerve lesion. The course of the sciatic nerve in the gluteal region places it at risk for injury from IM injections. Proper technique minimizes the risk of injury.
