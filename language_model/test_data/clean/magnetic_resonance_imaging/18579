This report is on three double aortic arch cases. They were diagnosed in our department between 1982 and 1992. The first case was complicated by dilated cardiomyopathy whose diagnosis was delayed due to a lack of clinical experience. Corrective surgery relieved the airway obstruction and his breathing improved postoperatively. The patient finally died of heart failure due to concurrent progressive dilated cardiomyopathy one and half years later. The second and third cases were diagnosed on the day of admission by a barium esophagogram and echocardiogram. MRI (Magnetic resonance image) of the cardiovascular system on these two patients revealed no other associated abnormalities. No angiography was done on the third case. They underwent surgery with excellent results. In any infant younger than 3 months with dyspnea and dysphagia, double aortic arch should be suspected. The esophagogram can show extrinsic compression. An echocardiogram can reveal two aortic arches. Both procedures can be performed easily and safely at the bedside. We recommend that these to be considered as routine examinations in such patients.
