Tremendous advances have been made in non-invasive cardiology, such as improved visualization of the anatomy and function of the heart and better understanding of heart disease. Echocardiography has improved in both simplicity and complexity, offering a range of modalities from small, hand-held devices that provide basic information simply and inexpensively to complex, dynamic three-dimensional imaging of regional myocardial function. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is the newest technique for non-invasive cardiology. It assesses cardiac function, mass and volume and can detect myocardial infarction, fibrosis, valvular and congenital heart disease. Computed tomography is used to detect and quantify coronary heart disease and coronary calcium, high scores being related to increased risk, but its use remains controversial. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is cost effective in investigating patients with suspected coronary disease and acute coronary syndrome. Also positron emission tomography (PET) is useful in the study of perfusion, metabolism, patients selection for revascularization, and in translational research in transgenic animal models.
