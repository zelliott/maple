MR findings reported in conjunction with spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) include cord swelling, increased T2 signal within the spinal cord, and parenchymal enhancement, each of which is nonspecific. Enlarged vessels on the cord surface, the most specific MR finding, is noted in only half of SDAVF patients. Nevertheless, we have frequently observed MR peripheral hypointensity of the spinal cord in SDAVF on T2-weighted images, which is not characteristic of nonvascular or nonhemorrhagic causes of myelopathy and which has not been described in association with SDAVF. We hypothesized that peripheral cord hypointensity might reliably suggest the diagnosis of SDAVF or other causes of venous hypertensive myelopathy.

We reviewed the MR findings in 11 consecutive cases of angiographically confirmed symptomatic SDAVF and in four cases of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula with spinal drainage, a lesion that also causes spinal cord deficits mediated by venous hypertensive myelopathy.

In each case, T2 hypointensity involving the cord periphery was present. This sign has not been previously described in association with either SDAVF or other causes of venous hypertensive myelopathy. It appears, however, to be a relatively constant imaging feature of SDAVF.

In the absence of spinal hemorrhage, T2 hypointensity involving the periphery of the spinal cord suggests venous hypertensive myelopathy as a cause of spinal cord dysfunction.
