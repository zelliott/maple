Angiolipomas are rare benign soft tissue tumours that are mostly encapsulated by fibrous tissue. A case of an infiltrating angiolipoma with mixed vascularisation, not surrounded by a capsule, is described. Differentiation between lipoid degenerated fibromas, lipoid histiocytoses and haemangiomas is radiologically possible with an extensive security and enables an adequate choice of the surgical procedure.
