A rare case of intramedullary gliofibroma in a 12-year-old girl is reported. MRI revealed an intramedullary tumor with two different intensities, and these portions showed different staining patterns after gadolinium contrast enhancement, with faint enhancement at the periphery and strong enhancement in the central portion. Intraoperatively, the tumor had a relatively clear margin to the spinal cord and was composed of two portions of different consistencies, one soft in the periphery and the other elastic and firm in the central portion. This tumor was grossly, totally removed. The patient made a full recovery and there was no recurrence 2 years and 9 months after operation. There have only been 7 previous case reports of spinal intramedullary gliofibroma. Gliofibroma is usually a relatively benign astroglial variant. Recognition of such a variant is clinically important in considering the extent of the operation and postoperative adjuvant therapy.
