Gangliocytomas are rare CNS tumors that occur in children and young adults. We present a case of a cerebellar gangliocytoma with invasion of the cervical spinal cord demonstrated on MR. Radiographic differentiation of gangliocytomas from other ganglion cell tumors--ganglioglioma, dysplastic gangliocytoma of Lhermitte-Duclos, and desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma--is discussed.
