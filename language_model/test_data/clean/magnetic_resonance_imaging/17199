We present a patient with a placenta previa in which we failed to manage conservatively with methotrexate and uterine embolization. The patient was diagnosed in the second trimester as having a possible placenta previa-increta,and underwent a repeat classical cesarean delivery at 32 weeks of gestation due to significant antepartum vaginal bleeding. Following abdominal closure,the uterine vessels were embolized with the Gel-Foam by interventional radiology. The placenta previa was left in-situ and patient was discharged home in stable condition in five days. The patient reported on the 44th postoperative day with heavy vaginal bleeding. A total abdominal hysterectomy was performed due to an unstable patient's hemodynamic condition in association with fluid resuscitation and multiple blood transfusions. The pathologic findings revealed a 675 g uterus with placenta previa-percreta with extension of chorionic villi to the serosal layer. Our case demonstrates a need for careful selection of patients with placenta previa and suspected accreta/increta/percreta that would be suitable candidates for conservative medical management. Patients who opt for conservative medical management should be informed about the possibility of catastrophic bleeding associated with a retained placenta, that would ultimately require blood transfusions and hysterectomy.
