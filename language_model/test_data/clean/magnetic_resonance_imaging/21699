A 25-year-old Japanese woman had fever and general fatigue for 3 months. Examination revealed no abnormalities in her pulse or blood pressure. Gallium 67 scintigraphy demonstrated an abnormal uptake in the right supraclavicular and anterior chest regions. A plain computerized tomogram (CT) scan revealed ringed high densities in the ascending and descending aorta and the left common carotid artery, however, an enhanced CT scan showed only irregular aortic walls. Angiography gave a final diagnosis of Takayasu's disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography also demonstrated complete occlusive stenosis of the left common carotid artery and right subclavian artery. Our case suggests the usefulness of gallium 67 scintigraphy, plain CT scan and MRI angiography in the active phase or early diagnosis of Takayasu's disease.
