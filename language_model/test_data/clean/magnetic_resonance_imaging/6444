We describe a very rare non-infantile case of desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma (DIA). A 9-year-old boy presented with motor weakness and sensory disturbance in his right upper and lower limbs. CT and MRI showed a contrast-enhanced large cystic tumor in the left sensorimotor area. We successfully resected the entire tumor. Its histopathological features were typical of DIA.

The patient's neurological symptoms improved postoperatively. Neither radiotherapy nor chemotherapy was used postoperatively. The patient developed normally and had been doing well for 12 months after surgery without tumor recurrence.
