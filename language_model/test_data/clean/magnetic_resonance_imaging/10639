We studied the safety and efficacy of a 1,064 nm neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser with a 300-micron fiber for the reduction of small unwanted fat areas.

Thirty subjects with focal areas of fat less than 100 cc were enrolled. Ten subjects were treated with laser lipolysis and had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and 3 months post-treatment. Ten subjects had laser lipolysis followed by biweekly treatments with the Tri-active system. The last group of 10 subjects served as control. Patients were seen at baseline and 1-week, 1-month, and 3-month follow-up visits.

Twenty-nine patients completed the study. Self-assessment evaluations reported an improvement of 37% at the 3-month follow-up visit. MRI demonstrated an average 17% reduction in fat volume. Smaller baseline volume areas, such as the submentum, had better results, suggesting a dose-response relationship. The most common side effects were mild bruising and swelling resolving within 2 weeks.

Laser lipolysis using the 1,064 nm Nd:YAG laser with a 300-micron fiber appears to be a very promising procedure that delivers good, reproducible results safely and effectively. The advantages include excellent patient tolerance, quick recovery time, and the benefit of dermal tightening.
