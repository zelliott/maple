The authors prospectively studied transcranial Doppler changes in patients with refractory congestive heart failure before and after cardiac transplantation. They evaluated 22 patients preoperatively and 14 patients after transplantation. Mean postoperative flow velocity increased by 53.3% (p < 0.0001). Preoperative waveform changes became normal after transplantation.
