Taenia solium infection is a zoonotic disease and swine is the natural intermediate host. Till date no literatures have described clinical signs in swine indicative of brain involvement by cysticerci. In the present study we describe such clinical signs of porcine neurocysticercosis (NCC). These signs were excessive salivation, excessive blinking and tearing, and subconjunctival nodule. A total of 30 swine (18 with 2 or all 3 clinical signs and 12 without any sign) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All 18 swine with above signs had NCC on MRI along with variable involvement of other organs that were subsequently confirmed by ex vivo MRI, necropsy and histopathology, while none of the 12 animals without any sign had NCC. As development of a porcine NCC model has proved difficult, we propose that naturally infected swine can be identified on the basis of these clinical signs and thus used as a model for further research on NCC.
