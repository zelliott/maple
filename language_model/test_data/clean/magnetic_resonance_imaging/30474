In younger women at high risk for developing breast cancer the value of mammography is limited by a higher prevalence of breast tissue density, low rate of DCIS in gene carriers, faster growing tumours and concerns over radiation exposure. We report on our experience of MR screening in high risk patients over a three year period. Women at high risk of developing breast cancer were offered an MRI scan and an Ultrasound in addition to their annual mammogram for two years. The following MR-protocol was used: pre-contrast T2 STIR sequence and pre contrast 3D FLASH sequence, post contrast axial dynamic 3D FLASH sequence. Seventy two women consented to participate in this study. One hundred thirty nine breast MRI examinations were performed. Two pre-cancerous lesions and an axillary lymph node metastasis were found, but the majority of the lesions were benign. Difficulties in screening young women at high risk are discussed in this paper. In our study three lesions of significance were detected. Two lesions were precancerous thus curable. The recall rates show the difficult nature of screening younger breasts. MRI generated more findings judged as uncertain, so short term-term follow up studies or MR-guided biopsy techniques are required.
