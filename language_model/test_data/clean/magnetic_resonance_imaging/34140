Extracardiac ventriculopulmonary conduits tend to deteriorate over time, developing both obstruction and regurgitation. In this prospective study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was compared with Doppler echocardiography to determine whether MRI improves the noninvasive evaluation of conduit patients. Twenty-five patients (median age 10 years, range 2.5 to 32) were investigated 27 times with Doppler echocardiography and an MRI protocol with spin echo sequences for morphology, velocity mapping, and multislice gradient echo technique for right ventricular volume measuring. Cardiac catheterization data were available in 6 patients. Echocardiography could assess the morphology of the conduits in 6 patients, whereas MRI demonstrated all conduits efficiently. Doppler echocardiography could evaluate the occurrence of regurgitation in 18 patients and could quantify peak velocity in 20 of the patients. A technically adequate MRI velocity mapping was obtained in 25 patients. There was good agreement between MRI and Doppler echocardiography in establishing or not establishing regurgitation, but Doppler echocardiography was less reliable in evaluating the degree of regurgitation. The correlation between peak velocity determined with Doppler and magnetic resonance imaging was r = 0.63 [corrected]. Correlations between catheterization pressure gradients and noninvasive techniques were r = 0.97 for magnetic resonance imaging [corrected] versus catheterization, and r = 0.86 [corrected] for Doppler versus catheterization. MRI can provide complete information on the morphology and function of extracardiac ventriculopulmonary conduits, as well as of the right ventricle. If the results of MRI and echocardiography with Doppler are in agreement, heart catheterization and angiography can be avoided, even in patients considered for conduit replacement.
