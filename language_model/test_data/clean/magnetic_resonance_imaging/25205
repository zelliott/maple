Contrast-enhanced breast MR imaging has made significant progress since its introduction into the radiological literature in 1989. The techniques and technology continue to be refined, and understanding of the interpretation strategies has improved dramatically. Clinical applications in difficult diagnostic cases and the evaluation of the extent of breast cancer are now being practiced in many centers worldwide. There is great excitement over the potential for breast MR imaging to address the problem of screening high-risk women. Despite all of the progress made over the past years, however, there is still a significant amount of work ahead before a clear understanding of how this technique will affect the health care of women is obtained.
