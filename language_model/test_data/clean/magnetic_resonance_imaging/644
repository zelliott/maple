Although port wine stains are seen in 0.3% births, widespread cutaneous capillary malformations are unusual and an association with static gliosis has not been previously reported. This is a report of a 3-year-old boy with a fixed widespread capillary naevus (port wine stain), megalencephaly and global developmental, and features of gliosis on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
