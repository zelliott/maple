Pancreatic tumors in children represent a very rare entity. We reviewed the clinical and pathologic features of pediatric patients with pancreatic tumors at a single institution.

We conducted a retrospective review of cases diagnosed at the Hospital for Sick Children between 1986 and 2010.

Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed during the study period: 18 with solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN), 6 with pancreatic endocrine neoplasia, and 3 with other tumors. Of the 27 children, 3 had associated syndromes, in specific tuberous sclerosis, von Hippel-Lindau, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. The most common symptoms were pain and vomiting in SPN and hypoglycemia and seizures in insulinomas. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic scan were equally accurate in determining size and site of origin of the tumor, and both were better than ultrasound. All patients underwent surgery (distal pancreatectomy in 14 cases, Whipple procedure in 8, other procedures in 5), which represented the only treatment for all but 3 cases. Seventeen patients (94%) with SPN are alive (median follow-up, 32 months), 3 of whom had positive margins. Two patients died: 1 male with SPN with malignant transformation and 1 with fibrosarcoma.

We describe the largest single-institution study of pediatric pancreatic tumors. Females with SPN have an excellent outcome, even in presence of positive margins, suggesting that limited surgical resection may be appropriate for these patients.
