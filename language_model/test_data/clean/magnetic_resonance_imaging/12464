Liposarcomas are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the retroperitoneal space. Retroperitoneal liposarcomas are usually grown slowly and frequently reach a very large size before clinical recognition. Precise diagnosis and distinct multiplanar evaluation is essential for complete resection of these tumors. Here in we reported two cases with giant retroperitoneal liposarcomas which were evaluated multiplanary with multidetector computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.
