Stereotactic procedures employing frame-based systems and utilizing pre-operative MR or CT have several shortcomings such as long procedure time, patient discomfort and transport, poor fail-safe capabilities and targeting inaccuracies due to brain shift. Conducting all procedural steps in an interventional MRI has the potential of alleviating some of these deficiencies.

A stereotactic system consisting of a skull-mounted mechanical positioning device and customized navigation software has been developed. The accuracy of this system was tested within an interventional MRI employing a skull phantom.

The mean distance between the targets hit and the planned target coordinates was 0.70 mm +/- 0.3 mm with a maximum distance of 1.3 mm.

The results indicate that the proposed stereotactic system can be used for stereotactic procedures in the interventional MRI.
