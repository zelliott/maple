We describe a standard set of quantity names and symbols related to the estimation of kinetic parameters from dynamic contrast-enhanced T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data, using diffusable agents such as gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA). These include a) the volume transfer constant K(trans) (min(-1)); b) the volume of extravascular extracellular space (EES) per unit volume of tissue v(e) (0 < v(e) < 1); and c) the flux rate constant between EES and plasma k(ep) (min(-1)). The rate constant is the ratio of the transfer constant to the EES (k(ep) = K(trans)/v(e)). Under flow-limited conditions K(trans) equals the blood plasma flow per unit volume of tissue; under permeability-limited conditions K(trans) equals the permeability surface area product per unit volume of tissue. We relate these quantities to previously published work from our groups; our future publications will refer to these standardized terms, and we propose that these be adopted as international standards.
