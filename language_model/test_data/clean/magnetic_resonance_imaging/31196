Tsao et al. have recently used functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare processing for moving stereoscopic forms in macaque and human brains. Most humans exhibited activation in a swath of lateral occipital areas, extending into the intraparietal sulcus, with a limited version of the same pattern in monkeys. However, neither species showed strong activation of the motion area known as MT in monkey or its human homolog.
