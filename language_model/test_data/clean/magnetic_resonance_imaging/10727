Benign schwannoma commonly arises from schwann cells of the neural sheath. We report a rare case of retroperitoneal schwannoma bearing at the vaginal wall. The tumor was a 7x5x4-cm solid mass revealed using several image techniques and diagnosed to be a retroperitoneal tumor preoperatively. The tumor was tightly attached to the vaginal submucosal tissue, so complete surgical resection was difficult. However, an almost complete resection was carried out macroscopically using laparotomy. Histologic and immunohistochemical studies confirmed the diagnosis. The patient has been followed for 18 months after the operation, but there is no evidence of recurrent tumor.
