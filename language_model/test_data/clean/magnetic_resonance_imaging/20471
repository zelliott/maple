The study aimed to determine whether post-radiation vaginal side effects in cervical cancer patients can be correlated with DVH parameter D(2cc). The result was negative in that no correlation could be demonstrated between D(2cc) and the presence and grade of side effects in this patients' subset treated with high brachytherapy doses.
