Serial MR scans were performed with the 2DFT imaging method and the filtered backprojection imaging method on 12 patients with multiple sclerosis in acute phase, 4 in a relapsing/remitting form, and 8 in a progressive form, before, during and after ACTH treatment. Both T1 and T2mono relaxation times, obtained by fitting transverse magnetization decay curves with a monoexponential function within the apparently normal white matter and the areas of increased signal, were measured. With the backprojection method it was possible to fit the transverse magnetization decay curve with a biexponential function and obtain T2long and T2short relaxation times. The T2mono and T1 relaxation times of the apparently normal white matter were significantly different from those obtained for volunteers, but no significant differences were found before, during, or after treatment. The transverse magnetization decay curves of the areas of increased signal were better fitted by a biexponential function. No significant changes in these relaxation times were observed after ACTH treatment. These results argue against an anti-oedematous action of ACTH and may suggest that it has an immunosuppressant effect.
