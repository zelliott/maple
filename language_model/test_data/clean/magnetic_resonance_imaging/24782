Skeletal infections secondary to Candida albicans are uncommon and described primarily in adults. Nearly all 22 pediatric cases of C. albicans osteomyelitis described to date have occurred in neonates with specific risk factors or in children with a severe immunodeficiency. We report an unusual presentation of C. albicans osteomyelitis and arthritis in a 1-year-old boy without an immunodeficiency, which led to a delayed diagnosis. He most likely developed C. albicans arthritis and osteomyelitis during the neonatal period with a subsequent indolent and subacute presentation. Our literature search found no prior or recent reviews of C. albicans osteomyelitis in pediatric patients. On the basis of this patient and the case reports previously published, we discuss an approach to the evaluation and management of pediatric patients with Candida osteomyelitis.
