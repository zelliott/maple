To describe the MR findings of brain and spinal cord in adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy.

One hundred sixty-four adult patients ranging from 19 to 74 years of age (119 men and 45 women) with clinically and biochemically proved adrenoleukodystrophy underwent MR of the brain. In 30 patients the spinal cord also was evaluated with MR.

The brain MR findings were abnormal in 54 of 119 males and in 9 of 45 female heterozygotes and consisted of varying degrees of demyelination of the cerebral white matter in 40 patients, corpus callosum in 25 patients, corticospinal tracts in 46 patients, visual tracts in 31 patients, and auditory tracts in 18 patients. The thoracic spinal cord showed diffuse atrophy in 18 of 20 men and in 8 of 10 women.

It is important to recognize the MR findings of adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy, because not uncommonly the clinical and MR findings of adrenoleukodystrophy are misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, olivopontocerebellar or spinocerebellar atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or dementia. Analysis of the MR findings and correlation of the clinical findings has permitted a tentative subdivision of adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy population into four subtypes that appear to differ in respect to prognosis and possibly pathogenesis. MR evaluation of the brain in adrenoleukodystrophy also is helpful in patient selection for experimental therapy, which is most effective if offered in the early stage of the disease.
