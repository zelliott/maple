Between February 1984 and September 1990, 60 patients with brainstem gliomas were treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of California, San Francisco. Forty-one children (< or = 18 years) and 19 adults were treated with 100 cGy twice daily with 4-8 hr between doses. Thirty-one patients (21 children and 10 adults) received total doses of 66-72 Gy and 29 patients (20 children and nine adults) received 74-78 Gy. Median follow-up was 208 weeks for all patients (214 weeks for children, 157 weeks for adults). Twenty-three patients (14 children and nine adults) were alive at the time of analysis, surviving 59-359 weeks following treatment. Median actuarial survival was 73.6 weeks overall (72 weeks for children, 190 weeks for adults; p = 0.43). Survival at 12 and 24 months was 65% and 38%, respectively (63% and 32%, for children; 68% and 53% for adults). All patients had pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging by which tumors were classified as either focal or diffuse. No significant pretreatment prognostic factors for adults were identified. In children, significant favorable prognostic factors on univariate analysis were older age (p = 0.001), tumor location in thalamus or midbrain (p = 0.002), focal appearance on MRI scan (p < 0.001) and duration of symptoms > 2 months prior to treatment (p < 0.001). Thirty-five patients had tumor biopsies, leading to a diagnosis in 33 (22 children and 11 adults). Children with moderately anaplastic astrocytomas survived significantly longer than those with glioblastoma multiforme or unbiopsied tumors (p < 0.001). Only duration of symptoms > 2 months remained significant as a favorable prognostic indicator for children on multivariate analysis (p < 0.001). Survival was not significantly different for patients receiving < or = 72 Gy and those receiving > 72 Gy (p = 0.18). No subgroup of patients showed significantly better survival with the higher dose. These findings indicate that hyperfractionated radiotherapy is effective treatment for adults and a subgroup of better prognosis children with brainstem gliomas. There is a subgroup of pediatric patients with extremely poor prognosis for whom even this aggressive treatment does little to extend survival. We conclude that there is no benefit to increasing total dose above 72 Gy for any of the groups analyzed.
