Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is commonly associated with factors like hypertension, immunosuppression, uraemia, volume overload and electrolyte disturbances in post renal transplant patients. We report a case of (posterior reverssible encephalopathy syndrome) PRES in young post renal transplant patient where all these common associations were absent. High index of suspicion, clinical course and characteristic MRI finding was the key to the diagnosis.
