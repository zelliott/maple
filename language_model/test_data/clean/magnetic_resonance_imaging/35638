This study was undertaken to analyze the functional outcome of surgically treated spinal meningiomas and to determine factors for surgical morbidity. Between January 1990 and December 2006 a total of 131 patients underwent surgical resection of a spinal menigioma. There were 114 (87%) female and 17 (13%) male patients. Age ranged from 17 to 88 years (mean 69 years). The mean follow-up period was 61 months (range 1-116 months) including a complete neurological examination and postoperative MRI studies. The pre- and postoperative neurological state was graded according to the Frankel Scale. Surgery was performed under standard microsurgical conditions with neurophysiological monitoring. In 73% the lesion was located in the thoracic region, in 16% in the cervical region, in 5% at the cervico-thoracic junction, in 4.5% at the thoraco-lumbar junction and in 1.5% in the lumbar region. Surgical resection was complete in 127 patients (97%) and incomplete in 4 patients (3%). At the last follow-up the neurological state was improved or unchanged in 126 patients (96.2%) and worse in 4 patients (3%). Permanent operative morbidity and mortality rates were 3 and 0.8%, respectively. Extensive tumour calcification proved to be a significant factor for surgical morbidity (P < 0.0001). Radical resection of spinal meningiomas can be performed with good functional results. Extensive tumor calcification, especially in elderly patients proved to harbor an increased risk for surgical morbidity.
