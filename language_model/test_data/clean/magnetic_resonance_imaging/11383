The antenatal ultrasound diagnosis of renal tract abnormalities is now firmly established. Postnatal imaging protocols are constantly evolving and still many questions remain unanswered. Most infants are asymptomatic at birth and aggressive imaging is unwarranted both for the infant and overburdened Radiology departments. The urgency with which to undertake imaging relates to the suspected antenatal diagnosis and clinical scenario, with bilateral hydronephrosis, posterior urethral valves and complicated duplex systems taking a high priority. The main imaging modality postnatally remains ultrasound, and together with nuclear medicine gives a powerful combination of both anatomy and function. Intravenous urography is never indicated in the neonate.
