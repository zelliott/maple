To investigate the role of the diffusion MR weighted sequence in the pre-operative grading of gliomas, and its application in defining the different components of these tumours.

Seventeen patients with gliomas (eight high grade, nine low grade) had diffusion weighted imaging. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of different components of tumours were measured.

ADC of the cystic portion of the tumour was significantly higher than ADCs of the enhanced tumour, non-enhanced tumour and perifocal oedema (P < 0.01). No significant difference in ADC values between low grade and high grade glioma (P > 0.7) was found nor was there any difference between oligoglioma and non-oligoglioma (P > 0.29).

ADC value was useful to differentiate the cystic from the solid components of the tumours. However, it was not useful in pre-operative grading of glioma.
