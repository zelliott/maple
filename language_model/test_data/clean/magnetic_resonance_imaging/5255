Extensive neuron death following peripheral nerve trauma is implicated in poor sensory recovery. Translational research for experimentally proven neuroprotective drugs requires knowledge of the numbers and distribution of sensory neurons in the human upper limb and a novel noninvasive clinical measure of neuron loss.

To compare optical fractionation and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in histological quantification and objective clinical assessment of human brachial plexus sensory neurons.

Bilateral C5-T1 DRG were harvested from 5 human cadavers for stereological volume measurement and sensory neuron counts (optical fractionator). MRI scans were obtained from 14 healthy volunteers for volumetric analysis of C5-T1 DRG.

The brachial plexus is innervated by 425,409 (standard deviation 15,596) sensory neurons with a significant difference in neuron counts and DRG volume between segmental levels (P < .001), with C7 ganglion containing the most. DRG volume correlated with neuron counts (r = 0.75, P < .001). Vertebral artery pulsation hindered C5 and 6 imaging, yet high-resolution MRI of C7, C8, and T1 DRG permitted unbiased volume measurement. In accord with histological analysis, MRI confirmed a significant difference between C7, C8, and T1 DRG volume (P < .001), interindividual variability (CV = 15.3%), and sex differences (P = .04). Slight right-left sided disparity in neuron counts (2.5%, P = .04) was possibly related to hand dominance, but no significant volume disparity existed.

Neuron counts for the human brachial plexus are presented. These correlate with histological DRG volumes and concur with volumetric MRI results in human volunteers. Volumetric MRI of C7-T1 DRG is a legitimate noninvasive proxy measure of sensory neurons for clinical study.
