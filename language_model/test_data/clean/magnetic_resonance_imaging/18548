We reported the first case of angiotropic lymphoma diagnosed by adrenal biopsy in Japan. Immunohistochemical study and southern blot hybridization analysis proved it to be B-lymphocyte origin. A 61-year-old man with history of mild hypertension and diabetes mellitus was admitted to our department because of recurrent minor stroke. On admission, general physical findings were normal. Laboratory investigations showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and increased serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level. The serial computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain showed multifocal abnormal density lesions in bilateral hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated multiple lesions of increased signal intensity in the brainstem and bilateral hemispheres. A subsequent CT scan of the abdomen revealed swelling of bilateral adrenal glands. Adrenal biopsy was performed. Biopsy samples showed the intravascular proliferation of malignant lymphoma cells, non-Hodgkin, diffuse large cell type. These cells had the immunophenotype of a B cell lymphoma (reactive with the antileukocyte common antigen, anti-MB-1, anti-MB-2 and anti-MX-pan B, and unreactive with the anti-MT-1, anti-UCHL, anti-Ki, anti-kappa, anti-lambda and antifactor-VIII). Southern blot hybridization analysis showed monoclonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, which strongly suggested a B-lymphocyte origin. Thus, a diagnosis of angiotropic lymphoma was made. As soon as chemotherapy was begun, the patient fell into deep coma. A repeat CT scan of the brain was normal. His clinical status gradually deteriorated, and he died 18 months after his initial symptom. Autopsy, which was limited to the body, revealed characteristic systemic intravascular stagnation of lymphoma cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
