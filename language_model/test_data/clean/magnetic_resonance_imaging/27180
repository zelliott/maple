To explore the pathology, diagnosis, therapeutic strategies and prognosis of primary temporal inverted papilloma.

We present one of the first reported cases of primary temporal inverted papilloma with premalignant change. The available data are reviewed.

To the best of our knowledge, only 10 evaluable cases of this tumour have been reported. The recurrence rate is higher for this tumour than for sinonasal inverted papilloma.

Primary temporal inverted papilloma is extremely rare, and its diagnosis should be made only following clinical exclusion of sinonasal papilloma. Therapy mainly comprises radical resection of the lesion, and long-term post-operative follow up is mandatory.
