Spinal cord abscess is an unusual cause of progressive paraplegia. We report the case of a 75-year-old man who presented Chlamydia pneumoniae bronchopulmonary infection with secondary spinal cord localization. Little clinical improvement was observed with antibiotic therapy, but the neuroradiological course was favorable.
