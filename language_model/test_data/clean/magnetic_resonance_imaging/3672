Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease that primarily affects the sinuses, lungs, skin, and eyes. In our case, a young female was referred for evaluation of post partum galactorrhea. Initial magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pituitary mass. After steroids for mild adrenal insufficiency and sinus disease, the mass had resolved on imaging. This led to further investigation and diagnosis of sarcoidosis that responded to these steroids. Only 10-15% of patients with sarcoidosis have central nervous system involvement.
