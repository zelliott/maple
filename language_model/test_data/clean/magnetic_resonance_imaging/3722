Adolescents are predisposed to osteochondral (OC) injuries in the knee. The medial facet of the patella, the femoral trochlea, and the lateral femoral condyle are the most common sites of injury. Most of these injuries are classically traumatic but noncontact injuries. Surgery is warranted in most cases of OC fracture. Depending on size, condition, and location of the lesion, options include OC fragment reduction and internal fixation or excision and cartilage resurfacing. Understanding of how to diagnose and treat OC fractures will help optimize outcomes.
