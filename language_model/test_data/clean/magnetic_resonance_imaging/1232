High-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain of an adult spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris orientalis) were acquired in the coronal plane at 55 antero-posterior levels. From these scans a computer-generated set of resectioned virtual images in the two remaining orthogonal planes was constructed with the use of the VoxelView and VoxelMath (Vital Images, Inc.) programs. Neuroanatomical structures were labeled in all three planes, providing the first labeled anatomical description of the spinner dolphin brain.
