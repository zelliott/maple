To assess the changes of the volume and dimensions of the eyeball and the vitreous following encircling scleral buckle.

26 eyes from 26 patients received successful broad-band encircling scleral buckles for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment from July 2002 to December 2003. The examinations, A-scan ultrasonography (SONOMED A-5500, USA), Corneal topography and MRI, were performed preoperatively and at the first week postoperatively. The volume of the eyeballs and the dimensions along the three cardinal axes from 13 eyeballs were measured with Gyroscan MR imaging system.

The measurement of MRI for the 13 eyes operated with the encircling scleral buckling revealed that the volume of the eyeball was decreased (1.72 +/- 0.49) ml, and volume of vitreous was decreased (1.73 +/- 0.46) ml in the comparison with volume before surgery. Horizontal and vertical dimensions of eyeball were decreased (7.84 +/- 1.86) mm, (7.70 +/- 2.79) mm respectively. The length of circumference was decreased to (24.42 +/- 6.68) mm, the percentage of the decrease was (33.11 +/- 8.69)%. The average high of the buckle indentions was (3.80 +/- 0.58) mm with the average width of (3.82 +/- 0.60) mm in the temperal part and (3.51 +/- 0.76) mm in the nasal part.

The length of the circumference at the site of buckling is shorted, and the volume of the vitreous was decreased after the surgery. The technique of MRI has an important role in the measurement and analysis of the volume and the dimension of the eyeball.
