To date, few studies have addressed the relationship between brain structure alterations and responses to atypical antipsychotics in schizophrenia. To this end, in this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were used to assess the relationship between the brain volumes of gray (GM) and white (WM) matters and the clinical response to risperidone or olanzapine in 30 schizophrenia patients. In comparison with healthy controls, the patients in this study showed a bilateral decrease in the anteromedial cerebellar hemispheres, the rectal gyrus and the insula, together with bilateral increases in GM in the basal ganglia. Both patient groups had a significantly smaller volume of WM in a region encompassing the internal and external capsules as compared to the controls. We found an inverse association between striatal size and the degree of clinical improvement, and a direct association between the degree of insular volume deficit and its improvement. The non-responder patient group showed a significant decrease in their left rectal gyrus as compared with the responder group. This study reveals a pattern of structural alterations in schizophrenia associated with the response to risperidone or olanzapine.
