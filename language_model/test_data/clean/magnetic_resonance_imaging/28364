An 18-year-old renal transplant patient presented with sudden onset of seizures almost 2 years after she received the graft. Diagnostic work-up was unrevealing except for magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities of the brain that resolved spontaneously 4 weeks later. In this brief report, we discuss the etiology of the seizures and neurological abnormalities in renal transplant patients in light of the findings of our patient.
