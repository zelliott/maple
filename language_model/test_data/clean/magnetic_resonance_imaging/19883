The use of computer-aided detection (CAD) with film or digital mammography is now widely regarded as the standard of practice in mammography and has been shown to increase the rate of breast cancer detection. There are inherent limitations in 2D mammography, and new technologies involving 2D and 3D imaging with X-rays, ultrasound, and MRI are in use or under investigation. CAD can aid in the reduction of oversight error for these modalities and has the potential to assist the physician in unifying the interpretation across alternative modalities. We believe the result will be improved sensitivity and specificity due to both improved detection and diagnosis.
