Leiomyomas of the fallopian tube are rare. They are typically incidental findings seen at autopsy or unrelated surgical procedures. A 32-year-old woman presented with lower abdominal pain and mass. Transvaginal sonogram and magnetic resonance imaging showed the solid mass at the outside of the uterus. At surgery, the left fallopian tube contained a firm mass with torsion in the area of the ampullary-isthmic junction. The left tube and the infundibulopelvic ligament were rolled in torsion and showed edematous change. We report a rare case in whom torsion of a pedunculated tubal leiomyoma caused abdominal pain.
