Microsurgery is an optional way to treat parenchymal neurocysticercosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of microsurgery in cerebral parenchymal cysticercosis.

A retrospective analysis was performed of the clinical data and outcomes of microsurgery in 20 cases of cerebral parenchymal cysticercosis.

All head segments found in cysticercus cysts were removed completely. Total resection of the cystic wall was achieved in 16 cases and subtotal resection in 4 cases. Twelve patients recovered from intracranial hypertension soon after the operation. No novel complications or deaths occurred postoperatively. The patients were followed up for 3 months to 10 years; among them, 14 patients who had epilepsy before surgery were markedly improved and controlled, 4 of 5 patients recovered from hemiparesis within 6 months after surgery, and 2 patients with cerebellar ataxia showed improvement. Two patients were lost to follow-up.

Despite a high rate of misdiagnosis of cerebral parenchymal cysticercosis, microsurgery is associated with satisfactory clinical outcomes in appropriately selected patients.
