Acetabular labral tears may cause considerable pain and predispose patients to premature osteoarthritis. Therefore, early and accurate examination is required. Acetabular labral tears are difficult to view on MR images. We report the association of paralabral ganglion cysts detected on MR imaging with surgically proven acetabular labral disorders.

Paralabral cysts may be associated with labral disorders. The appearance of a paralabral cyst on MR imaging is a useful indirect sign of acetabular labral abnormality. Use of this sign may enable earlier and more accurate examination of labral disorders.
