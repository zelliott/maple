To discuss the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of cerebral cavernous angiomas in children.

The clinical data of 30 cases of cavernous angioma hospitalized in the past 11 years, 25 boys and 5 girl, with an average age of 9.4 years, of which 27 underwent operation, were analyzed retrospectively.

Epilepsy and focal neurological deficits caused by repeated hemorrhage of lesion were the most common symptoms. MRI appearances were mainly high or complex abnormal signal. Ring-shaped low signal could be seen around the lesions by T1 and T2, especially by T2. The results of operation were satisfactory.

MRI examination is the best method for diagnosis and follow-up of cerebral cavernomas. Operation is the first choice for paediatric cavernous angioma.
