In order to investigate the merit of high field strength for BOLD-contrast-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, multishot gradient-echo fMRI experiments during motor cortex activation were performed on 1.5- and 4.0-T scanners with equivalent hardware, on the same volunteers. In these studies, artifactual vascular enhancement related to inflow effects was minimized, and large brain areas were covered by using a 3D scan technique. Temporal signal stability was optimized by using spiral readout gradients. The sensitivity for detection of activated regions was assessed by measuring the number of "activated voxels" and their average t score in predefined regions of interest. When comparing fMRI experiments with the same total scan time, performed on six subjects, and with acquisition parameters optimized for each field strength separately, the 4.0-T scanner proved to give superior results, with a 70% greater number of activated voxels and a 20% higher average t score for the activated voxels.
