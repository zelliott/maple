Taping of the patella is a common treatment for patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) and has been shown to reduce pain. The reason for this affect is unknown; it has been proposed that taping alters patella orientation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies investigating this are limited and the results are contradictory. Eight subjects (5 female, 3 male, 10 knees in total) with PFPS were involved in the study. MRI scans were taken at 0, 10, and 20 degrees of knee flexion, prior to and after patella taping. Lateral patella displacement (LPD) was determined for both conditions at each joint angle. Mean LPD data were compared using two-way ANOVA. Taping resulted in a significant reduction in LPD (p < 0.05) at all joint angles. The absolute average reductions in LPD here 0.4, 1.1, and 0.7 mm at 0 degree, 10 degrees, 20 degrees knee flexion, respectively. This change was small but might be sufficient to bring about the biologically significant changes resulting in the reported reduction in pain.
