We report two cases of rotator cuff tear in which the T(2)-weighted MRI signal was negative at the first examination, but positive by the second examination without any changes in symptoms. Many authors have reported on correlations between the MRI and operative findings of rotator cuff tears. However, MRI findings, history of symptoms and operative findings in our patients suggest that there was a discrepancy between symptoms and MRI findings dependent on the period from the injury. Operative findings also indicate that intratendinous tears might have occurred first in these patients then progressed to partial or full thickness tears over time. We concluded that physicians should keep rotator cuff pathology in mind even in patients whose MRI findings are negative but symptoms of rotator cuff tear persist.
