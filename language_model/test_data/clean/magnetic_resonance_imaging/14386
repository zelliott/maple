The complex anatomy of the neonatal hip is often difficult to image. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to evaluate the normal and abnormal neonatal hip. We correlated the MRI scans of the hip of a newborn cadaver with multiplanar cryo-sections stained according to Mallory-Cason, to detail the anatomic structures of the normal hip joint space. In our experience, MRI was shown to provide excellent depiction of hip anatomy.
