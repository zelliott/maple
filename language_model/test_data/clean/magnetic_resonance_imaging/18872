The goal of this study was to evaluate the utility of preoperative functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging in the prediction of whether a given cortical area would be deemed essential for language processing by electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM).

The authors studied patients with vascular malformations, specifically arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and cavernous angiomas, in whom blood-flow patterns are not normal and in whom a perfusion-dependent mapping signal may be questionable. Ten patients were studied (seven harboring AVMs and three with cavernous angiomas). The authors used a battery of linguistic tasks, including visual object naming, word generation, auditory responsive naming, visual responsive naming, and sentence comprehension, to identify brain regions that were consistently activated across expression and comprehension linguistic tasks. In a comparison of ESM and fMR imaging activations, the authors varied the matching criteria (overlapping activations, adjacent activations, and deep activations) and the radii of influence of ESM (2.5, 5, and 10 mm) to determine the effects of these factors on the sensitivity and specificity of fMR imaging. The sensitivity and specificity of fMR imaging were dependent on the task, lobe, and matching criterion. For the population studied, the sensitivity and specificity of fMR imaging activations during expressive linguistic tasks were found to be up to 100 and 66.7%, respectively, in the frontal lobe, and during comprehension linguistic tasks up to 96.2 and 69.8%, respectively, in the temporal and parietal lobes. The sensitivity and specificity of each disease population (patients with AVMs and those with cavernous angiomas) and of individuals were consistent with those values reported for the entire population studied.

The authors conclude that preoperative fMR imaging is a highly sensitive preoperative planning tool for the identification of which cortical areas are essential for language and that this imaging modality may play a future role in presurgical planning for patients with vascular malformations.
