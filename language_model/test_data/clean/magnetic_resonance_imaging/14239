Thirty one patients with tumours of the larynx and hypo-pharynx were studied by MRI, both with and without the para-magnetic contrast medium, GD-DTPA. The results were compared with pre-operative laryngoscopy and the final pathological tumour classification. The most accurate results were obtained by comparing T1-weighted sequences before and after the use of GD-DTPA. Because of the relatively rapid mode of examination and the specific enhancement, the method proved ideal for evaluating tumours of the larynx and hypo-pharynx. MRI is a valuable diagnostic technique for staging and treatment planning of patient with tumours of the larynx and hypo-pharynx.
