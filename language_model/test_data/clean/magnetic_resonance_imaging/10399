Pseudomeningocele is a rare but well recognised complication of lumbar surgery (microdiscectomy and laminectomy). Most of the patients tolerate the presence of the cyst well, however some present with back pain and spinal claudication, presumably due to neural compression. We report a case who presented following three operations (microdiscectomy, laminectomy and excision of a pseudomeningocele) with symptoms of spinal claudication and bilateral radicular pain. The cause of her pain was evident only at operation and was due to herniation of nerve roots through the dural defect.
