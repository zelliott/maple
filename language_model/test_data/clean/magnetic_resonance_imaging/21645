Digital Image Intensifier Radiography (DIR) as well as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Tomography (NMR) using an especially developed imaging routine for pelvimetry are suitable tools for the assessment of the anatomical conditions when mechanical problems are supposed to occur during birth (cephalopelvic disproportion, breech presentation). A concept for an optimised evaluation procedure of these imaging techniques has been developed, including: a more elaborate measuring protocol, easily and precisely executable due to appropriate software packages being implemented in the diagnostic units, calculation of obstetrically relevant parameters not deriving immediately from the imaging procedures. This is possible by means of multiple regression analysis of a data base from 467 evaluated female pelvis computed tomograms, calculation of intrapelvic soft tissue place requirements by means of correlative analysis of female computed tomograms and weight-/height-index, empirical determination of cut off values in borderline pelvi-fetometric constellations evaluating 190 births by means of logistic regression of the according pelvic-fetometric data. The calculations necessary to obtain all these parameters are implemented in a software package which also contains an algorithm for the general characterisation of an individual pelvis. Thus, a rather sophisticated knowledge base for pelvic assessment becomes easily accessible.
