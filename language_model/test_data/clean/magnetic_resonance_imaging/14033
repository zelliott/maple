To understand the pathological changes in pediatric craniopharyngiomas in order to determine the diagnosis and operative strategy and to prevent damage to the hypothalamus.

A total of 189 cases of pediatric craniopharyngiomas from 1990 to 1998 were reviewed and analyzed based on computerized tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging and operations.

Of the 189 cases, 187 (98.9%) were cystic tumors and calcification could be seen in 176 cases (93.1%). Two cases were solid tumors (1.1%), and calcification occurred in only 1 of these. There was a gliosis layer between the wall of the tumor and the hypothalamus.

Cystic changes and calcification are the pathological features of pediatric craniopharyngiomas. There are some special relationships between the tumors and stalk. This is the basis for the total removal of pediatric craniopharyngiomas.
