To evaluate the relationship between biomarker levels and disease activity and the spinal inflammation detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

Patients with AS were randomly assigned in a 3:8 ratio to receive infusions of placebo or 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, 12 and 18. Sera were collected for biomarker analysis at weeks 0, 2 and 24 and were analysed for levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) scores and pre- and post-gadolinium T1 and short tau inversion recovery MRIs were collected at baseline and week 24.

Significantly greater reductions in IL-6, VEGF and CRP were observed at weeks 2 and 24 in the infliximab group compared with the placebo group (all p<0.001). Baseline IL-6 levels >7.38 pg/ml and CRP levels >1.5 mg/dl were associated with increased rates of clinical response after 24 weeks. Multiple regression analyses showed that reductions from baseline to week 2 in IL-6, but not CRP or VEGF, were significantly associated with reductions in MRI activity and BASDAI scores from baseline to week 24 in the infliximab group (p<0.001).

Significant reductions in IL-6, VEGF and CRP were observed with infliximab compared with placebo. High levels of baseline IL-6 and CRP were associated with clinical response after infliximab treatment. Early reductions in IL-6 were significantly associated with improvements in disease activity and the spinal inflammation detected by MRI.
