The rheological and functional properties of food components are related to their molecular structure, morphology, and atomic mobilities. NMR provides a powerful tool for elucidating chemical structures, molecular conformations, and interactions of components in food systems. Quantitative analysis of sugars, fats, and other principal compounds in complex food systems was achieved by high-resolution liquid NMR. In addition to information available from liquid experiments, solids NMR experiments can reveal differences and changes in crystal packing of structures in food model systems. Interpretation of experimental results is enhanced by molecular modeling of key food compounds. Models for fat crystallization are carried out to enhance understanding of the molecular structures involved in the fat crystallization process. Recently, MRI has also shown significant impact on food science and technology. Some examples of NMR applications are given in this presentation.
