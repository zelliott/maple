We report here on a 3 1/2-year-old mother cow with a malignant perineural tumour near the pontine angle of the cerebellum, but which first drew attention because of clinical signs of BSE. Neurological symptoms that manifested during the course of the disease included disturbances in behaviour, movement and aesthesia, as described by BRAUN et al. (2001) in cases of BSE. Inconsistent with a diagnosis of BSE were focal neurological disturbances (head held aslant to the right, tendency to fall to the right, right-sided facial weakness, left-sided nystagmus and ventral strabismus). Following euthanasia, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tumour in the cerebellopontine angle. Histological findings describe a malignant peripheral nerve tumour of the vagal nerve with rhabdoid differentiation (a so-called Triton tumour) with an intracranial and an extracranial part.
