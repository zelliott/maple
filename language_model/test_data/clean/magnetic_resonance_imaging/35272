Meningiomas in early infancy are rare lesions, worth to be reported for their exceptional occurrence. The authors report a case of an 11-month-old female child with asymmetric macrocephaly due to the presence of a cystic atypical meningioma associated to bilateral subdural collections.

This unusual and unique case of atypical cystic meningioma in early infancy showed a high positivity to immunostaining of aquaporin 1, and this pattern could correlate with the coexistence both of cysts and subdural collections.
