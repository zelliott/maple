The authors present the case of a 62-year-old woman with rapid enlargement of a meningioma following radiosurgery (RS). Previous slow growth of the tumor over a 3-year period and the radiological signs of benign meningioma had been confirmed by successive MR scans. Histopathological examination performed after successful surgical removal revealed an atypical, infiltrating meningioma.
