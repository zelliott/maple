Advanced imaging techniques, particularly in CT and MRI, have become state-of-the-art to support the performance of interventional neuroradiologic procedures. Multidetector CT scanners with submillimeter detectors and real-time workstations have allowed the use of a noninvasive study, CT angiography, as a first-line diagnostic study at many institutions to detect and evaluate the morphology of aneurysms. Follow-up for postsubarachnoid spasm now includes transcranial Doppler, CT angiography, and sometimes perfusion to guide therapy. While both intracranial and extracranial stenosis have long been well evaluated by MR and CT angiography, information about the intimal wall and plaque morphology is now possible. In the setting of acute ischemia, CT with perfusion or MR with diffusion and perfusion has increased the ability to separate territory at risk from infarcted tissue, and can help to guide more appropriate intervention. This article addresses current state-of the-art imaging applications as well as a few techniques on the horizon that show great promise in helping to characterize those lesions amenable to endovascular therapy.
