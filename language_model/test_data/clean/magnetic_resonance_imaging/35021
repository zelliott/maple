Our purpose was to highlight the importance of radiologic studies in assessing the appropriateness of total scapular resection and total shoulder prosthetic reconstruction and to examine the role of imaging in evaluating for postoperative complications.

Evolving surgical and reconstructive techniques for treatment of shoulder girdle tumors require radiologists to familiarize themselves with novel imaging findings associated with these procedures. Readers will better understand the indications for limbsparing surgery with total shoulder prosthetic reconstruction, normal postoperative radiologic findings, and common complications.
