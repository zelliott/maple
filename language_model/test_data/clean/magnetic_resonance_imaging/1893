Rhythm in terms of the modulation of syllable durations represents an information-bearing feature of verbal utterances contributing both to the meaning of a sentence (linguistic prosody) as well as a speaker's emotional expression (affective prosody). In order to delineate the neural structures subserving rhythmic shaping of speech production, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed during (a) isochronous syllable repetitions and (b) production of syllable triplets with lengthening either of the initial or final unit. A cognitive subtraction approach (rhythmic versus isochronous iterations) revealed activation of right-sided perisylvian areas (superior temporal gyrus, Broca analogue and adjacent premotor cortex) as well as contralateral subcortical structures (putamen and thalamus). Presumably, these responses reflect a right-hemisphere rehearsal mechanism of rhythmic patterns and left-hemisphere monitoring of verbal output.
