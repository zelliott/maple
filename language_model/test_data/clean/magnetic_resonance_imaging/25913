Four patients with intracranial glioependymal cysts were evaluated in our institution in the last 7 years. All underwent surgical drainage and biopsy of the cyst wall. Cranial CT revealed a uniformly hypodense lesion with no contrast enhancement in all cases. Magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed a well defined cyst that was isointense to CSF on T1-weighted images and iso- or mildly hyperintense to CSF on proton density and T2-weighted images. In one case, a fluid-fluid level was demonstrated within the cavity, indicating the presence of fluid with a high protein content. A diagnosis of glioependymal cysts can be suggested based on CSF-like intensity patterns on T1-weighted images and iso- or mild hyperintensity on T2-weighted images.
