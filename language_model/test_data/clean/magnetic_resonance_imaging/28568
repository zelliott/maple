In this article clinical and neuroradiological features from a cohort of 48 immunocompetent patients who have a histologically proved primary cerebral lymphoma are considered. Our series consisted of 27 men and 21 women with an average age of 59. The clinical results gave 73% patients with a focal deficit, 46% with deterioration of vigilance, 35% intracranial hypertension, and only 8% with epilepsy, which was never revealing. We observed 4 uveitis of which 3 revealed, and preceded by several months, the neuroradiological manifestations. Histological classification using the criterias of the Working Formulation showed that 92% of our patients had a large cell lymphoma (class G or H). Precise analysis of computed tomography features of 40 patients revealed 46 lesions (most of them were isodense) before contrast medium administration. In all the cases, the lesion enhancement was intense and homogeneous. In 50% of the cases, there were multiple lesions. Sixty lesions were of the supra tentorial compartment, lobar in 32 cases, deep in 28 cases. Fifteen were infratentorial. From our experience, we can put forward the following suggestions: 1) Neuroradiological aspects suggesting primary cerebral lymphomas exist but none of them are specific. 2) Research of an uveitis is important, as this makes the histological diagnosis more simple. 3)The prescription of corticosteroids should be delayed until the histological diagnosis is certain because the primary cerebral lymphoma, which is very corticosensitive, is likely to disappear with this treatment and then change the biopsy results.
