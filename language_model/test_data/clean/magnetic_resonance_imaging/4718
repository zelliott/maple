This article reports on an acquired Brown's syndrome case presenting with cyclic characteristics. Restriction of elevation in adduction was observed in the right eye of a 15-year-old boy who had been referred with a complaint of diplopia that occurred on waking in the morning and continuing until noon. The same situation was noted following afternoon naps. The patient was able to improve his complaint by performing a forced elevation in adduction while massaging his right trochlear region and the restriction did not recur until the next morning.
