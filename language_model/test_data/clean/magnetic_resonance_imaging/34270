Magnetic resonance imaging of pulmonary parenchyma perfusion using pulsed arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques is presented. ASL uses magnetically labeled water as an endogenous, freely diffusible tracer. Presented are comparative results of ASL methods called Flow sensitive Alternating Inversion Recovery (FAIR), and FAIR with an Extra Radiofrequency pulse (FAIRER). Six healthy human volunteers were imaged. Perfusion-weighted images at different time delays, TI, were calculated from the subtraction of the control and tag images, which were acquired within a single breathhold. Detailed pulmonary structures can be visualized with negligible cardiac or respiratory motion artifacts. Different patterns of signal enhancement between the pulmonary vessels and parenchyma are shown in the perfusion images acquired at different TIs.
