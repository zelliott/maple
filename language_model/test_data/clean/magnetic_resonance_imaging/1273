Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a high-cost, new technology with great potential for improving patient care. The lack of a coherent public policy for MRI, or its predecessor computed tomography (CT), has caused considerable problems. Lack of an enunciated public policy has led to inconsistent reimbursement and reimbursement levels that develop in haphazard ways. Furthermore, diffusion has been unpredictable and has led to geographical excesses and deficiencies. Technology assessments of MRI, although numerous, have used inconsistent criteria to rate MRI's clinical efficacy. The lack of methodologically sound studies of MRI severely hampered early evaluation. This article examines these problems and suggests that the medical profession take a stronger leadership role in developing policies for expensive, promising new diagnostic technologies. The profession should promote, demand, and perform rigorous clinical evaluations of new technologies, and help develop a consensus regarding the criteria for what constitutes a clinically valuable advance in diagnostic technology.
