We report on a blink reflex abnormality observed in two patients, which provides additional information on the central pathways mediating this reflex. Autopsy was performed in one patient and MRI in the other. In the first patient there was a small lesion at the dorsal middle third of the lateral tegmental field and in the second patient at the level of the dorsal lower third of the medulla oblongata. In both patients the common finding was the absence of the late response (R2) ipsilateral to the side of the lesion, while the R2 response on the unaffected side was normal regardless of the side of the supraorbital nerve stimulation. The R1 responses were normal. This type of blink reflex abnormality has not been reported before and is referred to by us as 'tegmental type' of R2 abnormality. The results led to the conclusions that: (i) the crossed and uncrossed ascending trigeminofacial connections are mediated through the lateral tegmental field; (ii) the uncrossed trigeminofacial connection originates at the level of at least the lower medulla oblongata; (iii) the contralateral R2 response is established by way of an ascending pathway, which crosses the midline at the level of at least the lower third of the medulla oblongata.
