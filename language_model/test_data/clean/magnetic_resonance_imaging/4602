Two magnetization transfer (MT) contrast effects, a T2-like effect and the improved contrast observed when gadolinium is used with MT, are combined in a single sequence. Forty patients (22 males:18 females; mean age, 45 years (23-87)) with suspected intracranial pathology underwent MRI on a 1.5 Tesla system. Of 46 lesions; seven were ischemic, five infective, seven neoplastic, four hemorrhagic, four multiple sclerosis, seven human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leukoencephalopathy, nine normal/miscellaneous, and three gliosis. A conventional spin-echo sequence (TR 900 TE 15) was used with on-resonance binomial MT pulses. The sequence was performed postgadolinium +/- MT. The signal intensity ratios +/- MT were: white matter, 0.62 +/- 0.03; gray matter, 0.75 +/- 0.04; ischemia, edema, and demyelination, 0.75 (0.57-0.86); and gadolinium/methemoglobin, 0.85 (0.81-0.98). Areas which exhibited MT had T2-like contrast and those that did not maintained expected contrast for the given parameters. The result was a combination of T2-like contrast, gadolinium enhancement, and dark cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) providing both increased sensitivity to lesions which exhibited both contrast features and improved delineation of periventricular lesions. Furthermore, the differential signal between T2-like contrast of edema and gadolinium enhancement in neoplastic or infective lesions was maintained.
