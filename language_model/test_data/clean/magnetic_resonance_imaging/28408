To evaluate the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting retinal detachment (RD) in eyes filled with silicone oil, and to determine the MRI characteristics of silicone oil in vivo.

Seven eyes of seven patients with RD and eight eyes of eight patients without RD after silicone oil surgery were included in the study. All of the patients had clear media. MRI was performed in these patients. The results of ophthalmic examinations were compared with MRI findings.

MRI detected six of the seven detached retinas. The multiplanar imaging capability of MRI helped in showing the RDs in various locations. The chemical shift artifact exaggerated the retinal thickness and made the detached retina visible. Fat suppressed images showed the silicone oil-corneal contact clearly.

MRI is an effective technique for demonstrating RD in eyes filled with silicone oil and can be used successfully in eyes with opaque media.
