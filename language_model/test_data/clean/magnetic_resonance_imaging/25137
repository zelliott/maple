The aim of this study was to document and analyse the course of several audiometric parameters in 49 patients with a non-growing unilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS).

Patients received conservative management and absence of tumour growth was ascertained by means of serial magnetic imaging studies. Pure-tone audiometry and speech audiometry were performed at yearly intervals.

Pure-tone audiometry revealed a significant increase in thresholds at all frequencies, except for 8.0 kHz. The maximum yearly threshold increase was 2.4 dB hearing level at 1.0 and 2.0 kHz. Speech audiometry revealed a significant decrease in maximum discrimination over the course of time. No significant changes were observed in the following parameters: the intensity level at which maximum discrimination was achieved; the roll-over index; the speech reception threshold; and the slope of the curve in the speech audiogram. No change was observed in the relation between pure-tone audiometry thresholds and speech audiometry scores. Apparently, the deterioration of pure-tone perception and speech discrimination ran parallel courses.

The results of this study indicate that hearing loss is a predominant symptom in patients with a non-growing VS, as is also known in patients with a growing lesion. Moreover, it seems unlikely that the hearing loss in VS patients is merely the result of mechanical influences on retrocochlear neural or vascular structures.
