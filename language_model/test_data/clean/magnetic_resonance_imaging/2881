Neoplastic meningitis, an unusual complication of systemic cancer, is becoming more common as cancer patients live longer. Although leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors are usually associated with multifocal neurological signs, the authors report on 4 patients who presented with normal findings on neurological examination. One man had severe headache and complex partial seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed gadolinium enhancement of multiple cranial nerves. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology was positive for melanoma. One woman presented with severe migratory retroorbital headaches. MRIs of the brain with and without gadolinium appeared normal. CSF cytology was positive for pulmonary adenocarcinoma. One man presented with morning headache, and a woman presented with back pain. Both had CSF cytologies positive for lymphoma. Neoplastic meningitis can occur without abnormalities on neurological or MRI examinations. Lumbar punctures should be performed on cancer patients with severe, unusual, or prolonged headaches.
