Primary splenic tumors are very rare. The authors present a case of splenic hamartoma in which positive 99mTc-DTPA-HSA uptake was recognized with ultrasound, CT, MR and angiographic images. This case showed the need to consider hamartoma as well as hemangioma in the differential diagnosis of 99mTc-DTPA-HSA uptake in splenic tumors.
