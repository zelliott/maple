A 29-year-old man with an osteosarcoma of the left distal femur developed asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The thrombotic event occurred in the left common iliac vein and was revealed by pelvic computed tomography (CT). We successfully performed a limb salvage operation with placement of a permanent inferior vena cava filter. The thrombus spontaneously regressed without thrombolytic therapy after surgery. We should consider DVT in patients with musculoskeletal sarcomas who are under long-term hospitalization and immobilization associated with not only surgery but also chemotherapy. To screen for both metastasis and DVT, we recommend contrast-enhanced whole-body CT, including scans of the pelvis.
