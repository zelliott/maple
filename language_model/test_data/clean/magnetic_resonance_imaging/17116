The purpose of this article is to highlight the role of radiography, CT, PET/CT, and MRI in the diagnosis and management of chest wall lesions. Chest wall masses are caused by a spectrum of clinical entities. The lesions highlighted in this selection of case scenarios include neoplastic, inflammatory, and vascular lesions.

Imaging evaluation with radiography, CT, MRI, and PET/CT plays an important role in the accurate diagnosis of chest wall lesions. It can also facilitate percutaneous biopsy, when it is indicated. Imaging enables accurate staging and is a key component of treatment planning for chest wall masses.
