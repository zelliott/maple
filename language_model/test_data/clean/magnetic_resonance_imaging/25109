Neurinomas of the vestibulocochlear nerve unrelated to neurofibromatosis in children are extremely rare. Only 20 cases in children under the age of 16 are reported in the literature. Progressive unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo and neurological deficits due to cranial nerve or brainstem compression are clinical signs.

We report on the case of a 12-years-old girl with an unilateral hearing loss, progressing to total deafness. Otoacoustic emissions were normal. In the MRI a large cerebellopontine angle tumor was found, identified as schwannoma of the vestibulocochlear nerve.

The importance of MR Imaging in children with progressive unilateral hearing loss is demonstrated in this case.
