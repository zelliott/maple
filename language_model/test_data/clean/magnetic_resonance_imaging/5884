Cardiac MRI is known to be diagnostically valuable in cardiac amyloidosis. Several features are frequently found, including myocardial hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, a faster gadolinium blood wash out, pleural and pericardial effusions, and diffuse myocardial delayed enhancement. Cardiac MR facilitates the detection of cardiac amyloidosis and allows longitudinal assessment of myocardial function. This pictorial review focuses on cases with histologically proven systemic amyloidosis and cardiac involvement in order to illustrate typical findings.
