Two dogs and a cat with intracranial lesions were evaluated by both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. In a dog with vestibular syndrome, better quality images of the medulla oblongata surrounded by thick bones were obtained by MR than by CT, on which the appearance of artifacts impeded the clear image of the area. In a dog with multiple brain metastases of lymphoma, contrast CT delineated lesions more clearly than MR, which was performed one week after CT. During that week dexamethasone which might affect the clarity of MR images of the lesion was administered to reduce brain edema. In a cat with meningeal syndrome of lymphocytic leukemia, only contrast MR imaging identified the width and site of the lesion. These results indicate that it is necessary to select either one of these imaging methods according to the type and site of lesions that are suspected in a particular case.
