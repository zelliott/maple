A 10-year-old boy was admitted with a 4-month history of ataxic gait, headache, vomiting and diplopia. The headaches had worsened in month 4 and were associated with vomiting during head movement. Cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed a hydatid cyst located in the posterior fossa. The patient underwent suboccipital craniotomy and a cerebellar hydatid cyst (approximately 5 cm in diameter) was removed using Dowling's technique. The diagnosis was confirmed during surgery and by histological examination of a tissue sample from the cyst. The patient was treated with the antihelmintic agent albendazole in combination with antibiotics. The post-operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged after 1 week. In conclusion, when a cystic lesion is detected on CT or MRI scans, hydatid disease should be taken into consideration in countries where hydatid infestation is endemic.
