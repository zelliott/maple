A 49-year-old man presented with blurred vision 9 days following frontal head trauma. Visual loss progressed to bilateral blindness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed hemorrhage and swelling within the optic nerves and chiasm. Indirect trauma to the anterior visual pathways may cause delayed blindness due to hemorrhage and edema within these structures.
