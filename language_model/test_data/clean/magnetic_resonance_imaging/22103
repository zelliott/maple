T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) magnetic resonance imaging in the liver was compared with four sequences: fast and conventional half-Fourier single-shot turbo SE (HASTE) and breath-hold and respiratory-triggered turbo SE.

In 58 patients with focal liver lesions, imaging was performed with a 1.5-T magnet and a phased-array coil. Images obtained with fast HASTE conventional HASTE, breath-hold turbo SE, and respiratory-triggered turbo SE were compared. Results of quantitative, qualitative, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were compared.

Lesion-to-liver contrast for solid tumors was significantly higher with the fast HASTE and respiratory-triggered turbo SE sequences than with the conventional HASTE and breath-hold turbo SE sequences (P < .01) and for cystic lesions was significantly higher with the conventional and fast HASTE sequences than with the breath-hold or respiratory-triggered turbo SE sequences (P < .01). Artifacts were negligible on all fast and conventional HASTE images. In receiver operating characteristic analyses, diagnostic performance was significantly higher with the fast HASTE and respiratory-triggered turbo SE sequences than with the conventional HASTE and breath-hold turbo SE sequences (P < .01).

Images obtained with the fast HASTE sequence were free from motion artifacts, and observer diagnostic performance was similar to that with the respiratory-triggered turbo SE sequence.
