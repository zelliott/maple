To report the clinicopathological features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of solid and pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of pancreas.

From 1981 to 2005, 26 surgically treated cases of SPT were retrospectively reviewed. MRI findings of the latest 11 consecutive SPT cases were investigated.

There were 25 women and one man having SPT (median age: 23 year) with a median tumor size of 7.5 cm. Among them, nine patients developed solid pseudopapillary carcinoma. During the median follow-up period of 66 mo, the 5-year survival rate of the 26 SPT patients was 96.2%. Three MRI features were proposed including Type 1 image, displaying SPT with completely solid part. All SPT patients with type 1 image were detected incidentally. Type 2 image displays of SPT with solid mass hemorrhage and type 3 image with massive hemorrhage. All the eight SPT patients with type 2 and 3 images suffered abdominal pain due to hemorrhage from SPT.

SPT had a favorable survival rate irrespective of surgical procedures, malignancy, and MRI findings, however, MRI could reliably correlate with its clinicopathological features.
