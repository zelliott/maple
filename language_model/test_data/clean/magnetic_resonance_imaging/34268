We assessed the value of three-compartment magnetic resonance (MR) wrist arthrography in comparison with non-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the evaluation of 13 individual wrist ligaments in 35 patients with refractory wrist pain. In 20 of these patients MR findings were correlated with the findings from multiportal wrist arthroscopy. For MR imaging (1.5-T magnet) a three-dimensional volume acquisition with a gradient-recalled echo sequence and 0.6-1.0 mm effective slice thickness was used. The delineation of individual wrist ligaments was rated as "good" in 10% of non-enhanced MR and 90% of MR arthrography images. Ligament evaluation was possible with high diagnostic confidence in 11% by non-enhanced MR imaging and 90% by MR arthrography. With wrist arthroscopy as the standard of reference, average sensitivities/specificities/accuracies for the diagnosis of full-thickness ligamentous defects were 0.81/0.75/0.77 for non-enhanced MR imaging and 0.97/0.96/0.96 for MR arthrography. Our findings suggest that MR arthrography is more accurate than standard MRI in delineating and evaluating the ligaments of the wrist.
