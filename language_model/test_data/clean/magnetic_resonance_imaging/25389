The clinicopathological features of two cases of capillary haemangioma of the spinal cord are described. The presenting symptoms were similar to those of common intradural, intramedullary tumours or tumour-like mass lesions. Radiological features of these two lesions resembled other vascular lesions of the spinal cord. The patients underwent surgery, and recoveries were good. Histologically, the lesions resembled capillary haemangioma of superficial tissues that are composed of lobules of small capillaries with feeding vessels. A fibrous capsule enveloped the lesions. Capillary haemangiomas of the central nervous system are rare. Awareness of their existence may help the surgeon to avoid misdiagnosis and overtreatment of these benign tumour-like lesions.
