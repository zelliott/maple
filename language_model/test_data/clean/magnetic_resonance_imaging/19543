In Crohn's disease, some concomitant neurological illnesses such as cerebral ischemia following arterial or venous thrombosis, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord following malabsorption of vitamin B12 or folic acid, opticus neuropathy, and polyneuropathy have been described. Cerebral vasculitis secondary to Crohn's disease seems to be a very rare phenomenon. We report on three such cases in three female patients (aged 26, 29, and 61 years). All patients became symptomatic with a hemiparesis; one complained additionally of a speech disorder, headache, and intermittent loss of orientation. In CT and MRI scans, multiple lesions were detected; cerebral angiography showed multiple stenoses of middle- and large-sized vessels that were compatible with cerebral vasculitis. Serologic tests concerning vasculitis were inconspicuous at that time. Under anticoagulation (in two cases) and immunosuppressive therapy, neurologic symptoms disappeared. In the following 6 to 12 months, no new neurological symptoms appeared. In two cases, Doppler sonographic controls showed stationary and, in one case, progressive intracranial stenoses. Since autoimmunologically caused inflammatory bowel diseases might be associated with vasculitis of other organs, the appearance of cerebral vasculitis secondary to Crohn's disease is a possible organ manifestation by inflamed vessels.
