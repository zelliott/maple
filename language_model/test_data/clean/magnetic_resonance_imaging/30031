Although most of pseudocysts as one of complications of pancreatitis occur primarily within the pancreas, the extrapancreatic locations of pseudocysts, especially in the liver, are rare events. With advanced technology of imaging studies including abdominal computed tomography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging, their frequency seems to be increasing. We report here a case of left intrahepatic pancreatic pseudocyst following acute pancreatitis. Percutaneous puncture revealed a high level of amylase and lipase in the collection, confirming the diagnosis of intrahepatic pseudocyst. Symptomatic intrahepatic pseudocysts can be managed surgically, transcutaneously or endoscopically, and asymptomatic intrahepatic pseudocysts can be treated conservatively. We report this case with a review of literature.
