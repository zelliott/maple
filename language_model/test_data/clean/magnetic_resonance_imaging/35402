To describe early results regarding efficacy and safety of magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) for the treatment of uterine leiomyomas among a population of Japanese women.

In this single site study, 48 Japanese women, over 18 years of age, who were candidates for surgical intervention due to symptomatic fibroids, were recruited. Fifty-five uterine fibroids were treated by MRgFUS and followed up for 12 months.

During the 12-month follow-up period, two patients (4%) required surgical interventions, and two patients required additional drug treatment for fibroids. The average reduction in fibroid volume determined by MR imaging at 6 months after treatment was 33%. This volume reduction is correlated with the fibroid's treated volume. No serious complications were recorded during the treatments or follow-up period.

MRgFUS can safely be used to non-invasively treat symptomatic uterine fibroids and avoid the need for surgical intervention in the short term. With large treatment volumes, MRgFUS also results in significant fibroid shrinkage in a relatively short time. Additional follow-up is needed to determine the long-term durability of this promising non-invasive approach.
