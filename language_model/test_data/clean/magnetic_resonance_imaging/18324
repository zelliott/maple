A case of pheochromocytoma discovered at pregnancy is reported. The patient was a 27-year-old woman who had no symptoms before pregnancy. A sudden hypertensive attack occurred during vaginal examination at the 36th week of pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography showed a right adrenal mass. The level of catecholamine in blood and urine was beyond the normal limit. This patient was diagnosed as pheochromocytoma with pregnancy. Cesarean section was immediately done to avoid hypertensive crisis caused by spontaneous delivery. Blood pressure and blood volume were controlled by an alpha-blocker for one month after delivery, and, then the tumor was removed surgically. Pheochromocytoma with pregnancy is life-threatening for the mother and the fetus because of difficult diagnosis and complex clinical features. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are mandatory. Pathophysiological characteristics and the treatment of such specified statics are mainly discussed through our successful achievement.
