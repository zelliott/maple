We evaluated four cases of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) encountered at Nagoya City University Hospital in 1995. PHPV was seen unilaterally in three cases and bilaterally in one. The series comprised two males and two females, ranging in age from three to eight months, with an average of 4.8 months. Case 1 had a white strand running from the optic disc to the posterior surface of the lens in the left eye. Case 2 showed leukocoria in the right eye and central corneal opacity in the left. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed total retinal detachment in both eyes. Case 3 exhibited retinal folds running from the optic disc to the posterior surface of the lens in the left eye. Case 4 showed elongation of the ciliary processes and leukocoria in the right eye. Ipsilateral total retinal detachment was seen in MRI. Three eyes of two cases were microphthalmic. Associated ocular anomalies included, posterior embryotoxon, sclerocornea, hypoplasia of the iris stroma and peripapillary staphyloma. There were accompanying systemic anomalies such as arachnoidal cyst, syndactyly, microcephalus, heart anomalies, pulmonary atresia and asplenia. Patients with PHPV should be carefully examined for the possible presence of other ocular and systemic anomalies caused by neural crest disorders.
