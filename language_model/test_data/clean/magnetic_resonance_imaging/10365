The aim of the study was differential evaluation of new and classical sonographic features of benign thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer with three-dimensional gray-scale sonography and evaluation of the effectiveness of the thin-slice surface rendered images in comparison with multiplanar reformation (MPR) presentation. Fifty-four thyroid nodules were interactively evaluated with thin-slice smooth surface rendering: shape in the c-plane (parallel to the probe) and evaluation of echogenicity, margins and calcification/microcalcification-like echogenic foci in the a-plane (plane of the probe). Evaluation of the level of agreement in readers' interpretation and between sonographic techniques was performed using the kappa statistic. Surface rendering permitted visualization of the shape of the nodule in the c-plane in all cases, in contrast to only up to 48% of cases in MPR evaluation. Lobulated nodule shape in the c-plane was 82-100% sensitive and 47-53% specific in diagnosis of carcinoma. Surface rendered images showed more calcification/microcalcification-like echogenic foci than MPR ones. The level of agreement between the observers in the evaluation of features of thyroid nodules and the agreement between features of thyroid nodules on MPR and surface-rendered images showed at least moderate reproducibility (kappa>or=0.41). Three-dimensional thin-slice surface rendering sonography appears to be a feasible and effective method for thyroid nodule evaluation.
