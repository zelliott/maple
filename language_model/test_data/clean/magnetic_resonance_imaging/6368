The cerebral energy metabolism and brain oedema were investigated in three experimental cerebral ischaemia models using 31P-NMR spectroscopy (MRS) and 1H-NMR imaging (MRI) in the same subject animal. These measurements were performed also in experimental brain oedema models and the findings were compared with each other. 31P-MRS showed an ischaemic pattern in all of the cerebral ischaemia models, that is, ATP and PCr peaks decreased, and the Pi peak increased and shifted to a higher resonant frequency. However, 31P-MRS did not show any remarkable change in the brain oedema models. On the other hand, 1H-MRI clearly demonstrated brain oedema in the brain oedema model. In the cerebral ischaemia models, 1H-MRI findings differed depending upon the type of model, namely the most marked brain oedema was detected in the unilateral middle cerebral arterial occlusion model and no marked change was detected in the temporary four vessel occlusion model. It was thought that this difference depended on the severity of the ischaemic insult. Accordingly, the fundamental pathophysiological problem of cerebral ischaemia was the energy metabolism disturbance with the brain oedema being associated with this disturbance but occurring secondarily. However, in the brain oedema model the main pathological change was the increase in tissue water.
