Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a significant amount of information about both the position of the meniscoligamentous complex and the osseous structures in evaluation of internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). With the advent of computer-driven cine displays, dynamic information is now available, providing cost-effective diagnostic evaluation similar to cine fluoroscopy with arthrography, but without the ionizing radiation exposure or discomfort. Using a bite block, a series of sagittal images are obtained with the patient "posing" at different degrees of jaw opening. The subsequent cine MRIs with "posed" motion are striking and very helpful in evaluating various types of TMJ dysfunction. At the authors' institution, 205 patients were examined with a history of TMJ arthralgia. Correlation of imaging studies and surgical findings reveals a sensitivity (98%) and specificity (96%) for identifying the meniscoligamentous complex.
