The present study examined the effects of a selective inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, aminoguanidine (AG), on neuronal cell survival and post-traumatic recovery in rats following a lateral fluid percussive brain injury. Daily treatment of AG at the dosage of 100 mg/kg or normal saline was given intraperitoneally into rats starting 2 h before or 30 min after brain injury. Treatment with AG significantly reduced lesion volumes in the brains of rats after injury, as evaluated by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Immunohistochemical analysis showed a marked induction of iNOS expression in brain macrophages ipsilateral to the injury. Apoptotic neurons were observed in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex by in situ terminal transferase d-UTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 immunohistochemistry. In rats receiving prophylactic or post-injury treatment of AG, the number of degenerating neurons was markedly reduced in the cerebrum compared to those receiving saline injection. The location and extent of these pathologic changes correlated with MRI findings. Neurobehavioral studies showed that rotametric performance, grip-strength score, total and ambulatory locomotor responses and acoustic startle response were reduced in rats subjected to the injury but were significantly improved in AG-treated rats. It is suggested that inhibition of iNOS by AG may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of traumatic brain injury.
