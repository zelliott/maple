FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF AN ARTERIOPATHY: The approach is basically clinical, and vascular explorations are represented by the measurement of ankle blood pressure and calculation of the pressure index, a simple test that should systematically complete the examination. THE SEARCH FOR LOCAL LESIONS OF POTENTIALLY POOR PROGNOSIS: These are principally aneurysm and stenosis of the derivation routes that should be searched for using a Doppler in order to localise them and, completed by measurement of ankle blood pressure, specify the upstream impact and the ultrasound-Doppler analysis of certain selected areas. BEFORE REVASCULARISATION: The arteriography, examination of reference until recently, has certain limits that explain its more restricted use and the widened use of ultrasound-Doppler explorations, combined with magnetic resonance imaging and scanning.
