Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) is a drug widely used in the treatment of metastatic renal cell cancers, especially lung lesions. Successful treatment using IFNalpha for histologically proven brain metastasis has not been reported.

A large pineal tumor was found in a 51-year-old man with renal cell cancer in the left kidney. The histological diagnosis of biopsied specimens was a brain metastasis from renal cell cancer. The patient was treated with intramuscular injections of IFNalpha. The brain metastasis gradually decreased in size and disappeared completely 6 months after the initial injection of IFNalpha. The IFNalpha therapy was continued for 9 months. Fifteen months later, no recurrence was evident on brain magnetic resonance imaging.

This is an extremely rare case in which the long-term use of IFNalpha induced a complete response of a brain metastasis from renal cell cancer.
