Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging are important postoperative diagnostic and evaluation tools, particularly in patients who have undergone spinal fusions. Advancements in materials and imaging techniques have lessened artifact and improved overall imaging results. Systems that combine titanium alloy and cobalt-chromium components have been introduced to reduce implant profile while maintaining strength. The objective of this study was to determine if there were any differences in the clarity of imaging between two types of implant materials in a lumbar spine construct model.

One of two lumbar spine stabilization implant systems, titanium alloy (titanium) or titanium alloy with cobalt-chromium alloy (titanium-cobalt), was placed to simulate a four-level fusion construct in two human cadaveric spine segments, followed by MRI and CT imaging. The implant systems were then removed from each cadaver and implanted in the other cadaver. Nine physician graders from three subspecialties scored the images using a 5-point scale, with higher imaging scores indicating greater clarity of the region of interest. Physician-rated scores were compared across systems and between physician groups.

There were no significant differences in the overall mean total scores on the basis of construct material. Overall mean scores were 18.16 for titanium and 17.45 for titanium-cobalt (p = 0.275). Among images of the titanium-cobalt constructs, no significant differences in mean scores were found between specimens with use of MRI (p = 0.883) or with use of CT only (p = 0.274). Among images of the titanium system, a slightly significant difference was found between specimens with use of MRI (p = 0.044) but not with CT imaging (p = 0.837).

Overall image clarity scores were not significantly different between titanium and titanium-cobalt implant systems in the lumbar spine. Observation of pertinent anatomy in the regions of interest was not degraded by the presence of either system.
