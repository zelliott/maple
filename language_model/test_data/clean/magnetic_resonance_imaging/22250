An animal model of sensory activation using fMRI at 2.0 T has been developed, demonstrating that fMRI studies on animals need not be limited to high field magnets. These methods produced reliable image intensity changes of 2% using median nerve stimulation in rats at 3 Hz and propofol as the anesthetic agent. At 6 Hz the activation was slightly but not statistically significantly greater. The feasibility of fMRI studies in animals using propofol suggests that it may be a useful anesthetic for fMRI studies in agitated adult patients or in children.
