Magnetic resonance is a great diagnostic tool in equine lameness examination. Its value is most significantly visible in evaluating distal extremities. Problems with podotrochlear apparatus, laminitis or distal interphalangeal joint osteoarthritis are the most common disorders diagnosed in equine patients. Without using magnetic resonance it was impossible to clearly assess which structures are involved in each of these diseases. One of the most important things in MRI is the choice of sequence. Most commonly used are T1 GE, T2 FSE, STIR and T2* GE, in sagittal, transverse and dorsal planes. To make a reliable diagnosis it is important to compare findings in all these sequences.
