Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) along with basal cell carcinoma (BCC), collectively known as Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), are the most common cancers in the United States. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is less common than BCC, but is known to be more aggressive with a higher mortality rate. Squamous cell carcinoma of the external auditory canal (EAC) is rare when compared to SCC on other cutaneous sites. Due to the rarity of SCC originating in the EAC, there is currently no universal staging system, making it difficult to analyze data and form a treatment strategy. This is a case of a 76-year-old man who initially presented with actinic keratosis of the EAC that died in just over a year from metastatic cutaneous SCC.
