Ataxic hemiparesis and homonimous hemianopia developed in a hypertensive 60-year-old woman. Magnetic resonance imaging detected multiple lesions in the territory of distribution of the posterior cerebral artery and in the inferior region of the left cerebellar hemisphere. At computed tomography only a right hypodense area involving the posterior right thalamus, the postero-medial region of the temporal lobe and the occipital lobe was evident.
