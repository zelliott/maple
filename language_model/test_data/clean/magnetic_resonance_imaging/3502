Ewing's sarcoma of the finger is extremely rare. Pain and swelling of the affected finger are the most frequent presenting features. We report two cases of Ewing's sarcoma located at ring finger and the thumb in two children aged 14 and 10 years. The first patient died of generalised metastases despite surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The second had no localised recurrence or metastases after surgery and chemotherapy at last follow-up of 4.5 years after tumour resection. The tumour's surgical accessibility, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy improve the prognosis of this tumour.
