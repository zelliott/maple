We report a case of a 43-year-old woman with pseudocoarctation of the aorta manifested by a superior mediastinal mass on the chest roentgenogram. Evaluation was made using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). No other congenital anomalies or aneurysms below the kinked area of the aorta could be found. The characteristic "kink" of the aorta and the absence of true coarctation were evident in the sagittal plane by MRI. MRI is of great value for examining disorders of the aorta.
