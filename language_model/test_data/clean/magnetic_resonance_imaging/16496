The term cardiac amyloidosis refers to the involvement of the heart as a result of amyloid deposition in heart tissue either in the context of a systemic disease or as a localized form. Several proamyloid proteins can produce amyloid deposits in the heart. Each of these amyloidoses has characteristic clinical (cardiac and extracardiac) features, its own course, and a specific diagnosis and treatment. Since cardiac involvement may be the first-manifestation of amyloidosis, the cardiologist may be the first healthcare professional to see the patient and must always consider this diagnosis. In this review, we consider the amyloidosis characteristics that may present with cardiac involvement, from the cardiologist's viewpoint and in light of our experience. We review in detail when and how to establish the diagnosis and how to treat these patients' cardiac involvement and the underlying amyloid disease.
