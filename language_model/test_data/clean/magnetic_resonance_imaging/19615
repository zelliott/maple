Vascular tumors of the pelvis are a rare, diverse group of neoplasms. These benign or malignant tumors can arise from the endothelium, smooth muscle cells, or pericytes of the arterial venous or lymphatic walls. They are rarely diagnosed by physical examination but more commonly seen with imaging studies such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or angiography. Benign and malignant tumors can be differentiated pathologically by the two major anatomic characteristics of vascular channel formation and the regularity of endothelial cell proliferation. This review will focus on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, outcomes, and surgical approaches to benign and malignant vascular tumors of the pelvis.
