Diagnostic considerations in young patients presenting with coronary artery disease have conventionally included familial dyslipidemias, lipoprotein(a) elevation, hyperhomocysteinemia, cocaine toxicity, hypercoagulable states, connective tissue disorders, vasculitis and the presence of other established risk factors for coronary artery disease. The case of a young woman with unstable angina and a left main coronary artery ostial lesion on cardiac catheterization is discussed. She was subsequently diagnosed with Takayasu's arteritis 4 years later.
