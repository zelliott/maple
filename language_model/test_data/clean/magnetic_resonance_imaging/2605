While many equine diagnostic imaging procedures can be done in field, some procedures require specialized facilities, equipment or expertise which are generally only available in referral or specialty practices. As client awareness of the availability and advantages of these diagnostic procedures increases, veterinarians are faced with the increasing opportunity to utilize these services to provide optimal patient care. A working knowledge of the value and limitations of these methods is required to help guide veterinarians and clients in the selection of additional, and sometimes costly, diagnostic tests.
