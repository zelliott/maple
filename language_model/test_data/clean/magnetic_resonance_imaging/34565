Ruptures of the cruciate ligaments continue to pose both diagnostic and therapeutic problems. On the basis of structural analysis of MR images obtained after the accident and the results of conservative treatment, it can be shown that function healing of the rupture can result, when, for example, the synovial membrane (capsule) is preserved (70%). It proved possible to show and objectify this using MRI and measurements.
