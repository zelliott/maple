The origin of the high rate of depression in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown. We applied voxel-based morphometry (VBM), as a sensitive tool in detection of gray matter MR density alterations, to find differences in depressed and nondepressed PD patients. Patients with idiopathic PD were classified into depressed (DPD) and nondepressed (NDPD) groups based on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Subsequently, a group comparisons were performed between depressed PD (n = 23), nondepressed PD (n = 27) and normal healthy controls (NC, n = 16). There was no difference in gray matter density comparing healthy controls to any PD groups. However, when NDPD and DPD cohorts were compared, density alteration of the bilateral orbitofrontal, bilateral rectal gyrus, and also the right superior temporal pole was detected in the depressed subgroup. Exploratory analyses revealed an inverse correlation of MADRS scores and severity of VBM alteration in these regions beside the right medial temporal gyrus, anterior and medial cingular gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus. These results suggest that depression in PD is related to gray matter decrease in the bilateral orbitofrontal and right temporal regions as well as the limbic system.
