Osteoid osteomas are benign bone tumors, most commonly located in the femur or tibia. In young children, these tumors can be extremely difficult to diagnose. They commonly present nonspecifically with gait disturbance and pain and characteristically respond well to mild pain relievers. We report two patients who presented with neurologic signs, including atrophy, weakness, and diminished deep tendon reflexes of the affected limb. These two patients demonstrate that osteoid osteomas of the lower extremities can present with neurologic signs, and proper diagnosis requires a detailed history and clinical awareness of this phenomenon.
