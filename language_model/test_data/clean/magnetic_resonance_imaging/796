A 60-year-old right-handed man showed dysprosody and agnosia for environmental sounds. His mother tongue was Japanese, and he could not speak foreign languages. He gradually developed difficulty in speaking from the age of 57 years, speaking non-native Japanese. In addition, he often complained of difficulty in hearing sounds, but audiometry showed no abnormalities. At the age of 60 years, the standard language test of aphasia showed no abnormalities in repetition, verbal comprehension, or reading, suggesting the absence of aphasia. However, in speaking, marked abnormality in rhythm, and occasional lack of postpositional particles and syllable-stumblings were observed. Writing was almost accurate, but a few grammatical errors were observed in speaking were observed. There were no cerebellar symptoms, pyramidal signs, pathologic reflexes, or abnormalities in phonation-related organs. Though the recognition of verbal sounds was maintained, impairment in the recognition of non-verbal sounds was observed. An environmental sound perception test showed correct answers only in 8 of 21 non-verbal sound sources (such as a car starting, glass breaking and so on), suggesting agnosia for environmental sounds. He insisted that the difficulty in perception was due to hearing impairment. However, re-examination with an increase in the sound volume showed similar results. He had no inconvenience in daily life and was not aware of agnosia for environmental sounds. He could recognize and differentiate sounds he heard once. His intelligence was normal, and neither apraxia nor frontal lobe symptoms were observed. MRI of the brain revealed slight atrophy of the right temporal lobe. Cerebral blood flow SPECT showed decreased blood flow from the superior temporal gyrus to the area around the arcuate fasciculi in the right temporal lobe. We considered that the lesion responsible for environmental auditory sound agnosia was present in the area around the secondary auditory area of the right temporal lobe and this patient differed from slowly progressive aphasia characterized by decreased blood flow in the left temporal lobe. Although the pathological process occurring in the area of hypoperfusion remained unclear, early stage of some degenerative disorders was more likely than cerebrovascular disease.
