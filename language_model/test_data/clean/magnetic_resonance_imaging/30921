To evaluate colonic motility and to investigate contributing factors to colonic dysmotility in children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP).

Cross-sectional study.

A university-based rehabilitation hospital.

Thirty-eight children with spastic CP.

Not applicable.

Colonic transit time was measured by using a Sitzmarks. The nutrient intake during 3 consecutive days was analyzed by using the ESHA Food Processor program.

A significant relationship between colon transit time and stool frequency was observed (P<.05). All children with constipation and 17 (60.8%) of 28 without constipation showed an abnormal segmental colon transit time in at least 1 segment of the colon. A transit time delay at the proximal segment of colon was remarkable in CP children with constipation. In children without constipation, a transit time delay was marked at the rectosigmoid colon only. Constipation and transit time delay were significantly related to ambulatory function (P<.05).

A transit time delay at total or segmental colon was frequently observed in children with CP. Constipation and colonic motility were related to ambulatory function.
