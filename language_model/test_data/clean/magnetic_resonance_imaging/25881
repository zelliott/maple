Thirty-one patients were investigated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the lower abdomen before and after the administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) solution per os or per rectum or from both routes for the opacification of the intestinal tract. The parameters evaluated were: (a) contrast medium distribution, (b) degree of filling of the bowel lumen, (c) contrast between the bowel lumen and the surrounding normal or pathological structures, and (d) whether the administration of the contrast agent improved the diagnostic ability of MR compared to computed tomography (CT) or plain MR of the same region. Gd-DTPA, at a concentration of 1 mmol/L, produced a positive signal irrespective of its dilution in the bowel and good contrast between the bowel lumen and the adjacent tissues or any possible pathological lesions. From the diagnostic point of view, after the administration of contrast medium, MR is comparable to CT and much superior to plain MR. It is concluded that opacification of the bowel with Gd-DTPA solution will improve the diagnostic yield of MR imaging of the lower abdomen.
