Internal fixation of a traumatic osteochondral defect presents a challenge in terms of obtaining anatomic reduction, fixation, and adequate compression for healing. Fixation with countersunk intraarticular screws, Herbert screws, bioabsorbable screws and pins, mini-cancellous screws, and glue tissue adhesive have been reported with varying results. We present an alternative fixation method used in two patients for femoral condylar defects that achieved anatomic reduction with compression via a cruciate-shaped suture bridge construct tied down over a bony bridge. This fixation method allowed early passive range of motion and permitted high-quality MRI for followup of fracture healing and articular cartilage integrity. Arthroscopic examination of one of two patients at 6 months followup showed the gross appearance of a healed, anatomically reduced fracture. With 1 year followup for one patient and 2 years for the other, the patients have resumed activity as tolerated with full, painless range of motion at the knee. Longer-term outcomes are unknown. However, the suture bridge is an alternative means of fixation with encouraging early results for treatment of traumatic osteochondral fragments in the knee.
