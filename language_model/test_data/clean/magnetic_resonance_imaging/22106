To assess the relationship between imaging findings, therapy, and functional outcome in patients with persistent low back pain who are suspected of having herniated nucleus pulposus.

Data collected during a multicenter, longitudinal study were retrospectively analyzed (n = 1,084). Multivariate regression was used to determine the association between imaging findings, therapy, and functional outcome. The patient outcome measure was disability days: the number of days the patient was unable to perform work-related activities.

In patients with at least one normal advanced (imaging other than plain radiography) diagnostic study or with an unconfirmed diagnosis of herniated nucleus pulposus, outcome at 2-year follow-up was no better in patients who were treated than in those who were not. In patients with only abnormal advanced imaging results or with a concordant diagnosis based on clinical and imaging findings, outcome was better in patients who underwent surgery than in those treated nonsurgically. Patients with a free fragment, protrusion, or extrusion that was treated surgically had fewer disability days than patients treated nonsurgically.

Advanced diagnostic imaging studies can play an important role in treatment selection in patients with persistent low back pain who are suspected of having herniated nucleus pulposus.
