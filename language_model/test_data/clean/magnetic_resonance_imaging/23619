Central neurocytomas are uncommon, benign tumours of the central nervous system. These tumours have been recognised outside the limits of the cerebral ventricles and, in these instances, have been called as 'extraventricular neurocytomas'. The authors described a case of frontal neurocytoma and discuss the current knowledge on these infrequent neoplasms.
