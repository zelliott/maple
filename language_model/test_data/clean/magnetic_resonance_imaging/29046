The authors report a case of giant cell tumor originating in the sphenoid bone. A 29-year-old woman presented with headache and diplopia. Bilateral ophthalmoplegia developed and MRI showed rapid growth of the tumor in spite of transnasal removal and conventional radiation therapy. The second transnasal surgery was performed 3 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. The symptoms were relieved except for right abducens palsy. Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide was started after the second operation. The patient regained full ocular movement several months after the operation. Clinical remission has continued for four years. We conclude that the combination of repeated operations in the initial phase of rapid tumor growth, irradiation and chemotherapy is important to achieve tumor control.
