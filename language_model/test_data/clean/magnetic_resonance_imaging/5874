In this paper, the authors review the results of a single-center experience using linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery for the treatment of cavernous sinus meningiomas.

This is a retrospective analysis with a median follow-up of 50 months. All patients were treated on an outpatient basis. Fifty-five patients were treated and 6 patients were lost to follow-up. Changes in preradiosurgery cranial nerve deficits and symptoms as well as actuarial local tumor control were evaluated.

The actuarial local tumor control was 100% at 5 years and 98% at 10 years. One patient had enlargement of tumor. Sixty-five percent had improvement in preradiosurgery cranial nerve deficits, 31% were unchanged and 1 patient (3.5%) was worse. Only 1 patient developed a new neurologic deficit.

This is the largest LINAC radiosurgery experience for cavernous sinus meningiomas reported to date. Radiosurgery appears to offer greatly superior tumor control and much lower morbidity than surgical resection of cavernous sinus meningiomas.
