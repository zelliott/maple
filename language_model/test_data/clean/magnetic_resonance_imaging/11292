Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is a rare congenital brain malformation of unknown etiology. Patients with HME can present with an early onset epileptic syndrome which is often refractory to medical treatment and associated to impaired neurological development. Functional hemispherectomy (FH) has proven to be a valuable treatment alternative in patients with refractory epilepsy in this setting. Very few children operated under the age of 6 months and bearing HME and catastrophic epilepsy (CE) have been described in the literature. This study reports on 2 kids younger than 6 months with HME and CE submitted to FH with good clinical outcome.
