To investigate the sequential changes in signal intensity (SI) of normal and abnormal uteri, T1 WIs were taken repeatedly after the injection of Gd-DTPA. Six volunteers and 19 patients with known uterine body malignancy (18 carcinomas, one carcinosarcoma) were examined. The results in volunteers were as follows. In the secretory phase, SI of the endometrium was stronger in the late images than in the early ones, whereas in the proliferative phase, SI was stronger in the early images. SI of the myometrium decreased rapidly and there were no differences in SI between menstrual phases. In 17 of 18 endometrial carcinomas, the tumors showed hypointensity relative to the myometrium, and the contrast between the tumor and the myometrium was better in the early images. In the remaining two cases, the tumor showed hyperintensity and the contrast was better in the late images. After the injection of Gd-DTPA, the endometrium appeared differently according to the menstrual cycle in normal volunteers, and the appearance of uterine structures and endometrial malignant tumors changed sequentially. These findings must be kept in mind when evaluating uterine diseases by Gd-DTPA enhanced MRI.
