The effects of irradiation on a large volume of normal brain tissue as occurs in interstitial brachytherapy were investigated. Double iridium-192 seed assemblies were stereotactically implanted into the right centrum semiovale of eight adult Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata). The morphological changes induced in the normal brain tissue were evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with and without gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (Gd) enhancement at 2 days and 1, 3, and 6 months after the brachytherapy. After each MR imaging examination, randomly selected experimental animals were sacrificed to analyze the histological changes. The low intensity area seen inside the ring of contrast enhancement on the T1-weighted image with Gd enhancement was well correlated with histologically defined necrosis. The high intensity area seen outside the area showing contrast enhancement on the T2-weighted image was well correlated with an area of histological edema and demyelination. The sizes of the lesion and the high intensity area were maximum during the acute stage (2 days) following interstitial irradiation. This monkey model with MR imaging can be used to investigate the development of brain damage induced by interstitial irradiation. We further recommend careful monitoring to detect the development of brain edema during the acute stage after interstitial brachytherapy, especially when large tumors are treated.
