Nowadays, due to its high diagnostic accuracy, MR imaging is the method of choice for the evaluation of knee joint disorders pre- and postoperatively. Accurate diagnosis is sometimes possible only if the reporting radiologist has knowledge of the therapeutic procedures and the surgical report. Frequently, further therapeutic management is strongly influenced by MR examinations and radiological reports.
