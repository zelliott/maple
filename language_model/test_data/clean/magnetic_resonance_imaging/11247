The diagnosis of corpus callosum agenesis (CCA) with prenatal MRI relies on indirect signs. However, they are known to be inconstant in case of incomplete CCA. The purpose of this study is to specify the frequency of indirect signs in partial CCA to approach the reliability of fetal MRI.

This retrospective study included 33 children with partial CCA. MRI were reviewed by two observers and a standardized radiological and clinical data collection was performed. Depending on the ratio CC length/anteroposterior brain diameter, two groups were statistically compared: subtotal partial CCA and mild partial CCA.

14% of patients had none indirect sign and 33% had only one sign. We found a significative difference of frequency for most of the indirect signs. 48% of patients had other cerebral anomalies. Clinical correlation showed no statistical difference between the two groups.

This series shows that indirect signs are inconstant in partial CCA and related to the CC length. In contrast, mild and subtotal CCA have a similar neurological outcome. These data suggest that greatest care has to be taken in the interpretation of fetal MRI.
