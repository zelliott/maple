Monitoring of articular cartilage repair after matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation with HyalograftC by a new grading system based on non-invasive high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging.

In 23 patients, postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed between 76 and 120 weeks. In nine of these patients, five MRI examinations were performed at 4, 12, 24, 52 and 104 weeks after HyalograftC implant. The repair tissue was described with separate variables: degree of defect repair in width and length, signal intensity of the repair tissue and status of the subchondral bone. For these variables a grading system with point scale evaluation was applied.



High-resolution MRI provides a non-invasive tool for monitoring the development of cartilage repair tissue following HyalograftC technology, shows a good correlation with clinical outcome and may help to differentiate abnormal repair tissue from a normal maturation process.
