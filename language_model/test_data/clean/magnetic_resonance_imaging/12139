Six pigs with coronary artery occlusion were investigated with MR imaging before and subsequently for about 2.5 hours at repeated intervals after the intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA (0.4 mmol/kg). The animals were sacrificed after a total occlusion time of 6 hours and the hearts were excised. The excised hearts were then reexamined in the MR equipment and stained with TTC (triphenyl tetrazolium) in order to define areas of infarction. Four control hearts with 6-hour-old infarctions were only imaged ex vivo without any previous administration of contrast media. In vivo, there was no clear demarcation of infarction with or without Gd-DTPA. Ex vivo, without any contrast media, the infarctions were poorly discriminated with a discretely increased signal intensity relative to normal myocardium in the T2 weighted images. Gd-DTPA was found to accumulate in the infarctions, which caused an elevated signal intensity most pronounced in the T1 weighted images. This considerably improved the delineation of the infarcted area.
