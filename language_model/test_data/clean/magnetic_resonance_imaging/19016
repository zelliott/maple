The aim of this study was to determine whether atrophy could be detected at the earliest clinical stages of MS. Patients were selected from a 1-year follow-up MRI study of clinically isolated syndromes. Nine patients who developed MS were compared with eight matched patients who had no further symptoms. Significant ventricular enlargement occurred in the group that developed MS but not in the other group. Our findings show that atrophy, albeit mild, can be detected early in the course of MS.
