A case is presented of a patient undergoing pre-operative embolization of a glomus tumour who developed a facial palsy one hour after embolization. At the time of surgery it was found to be due to the embolization material (polyvinyl alcohol foam) blocking the stylomastoid artery. The blood supply of glomus tumours and the variations in the blood supply of the facial nerve are discussed.
