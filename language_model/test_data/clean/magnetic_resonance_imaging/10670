The vast majority of ruptured aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery typically present with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Isolated visual complaints are very uncommon in this setting. We present an unusual case of a patient with an acute retrobulbar optic neuropathy, secondary to a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm.

Observational case report.

A 29-year-old woman was assessed for an acute, isolated unilateral optic neuropathy of unknown origin. Although an initial encephalic MRI was believed to be normal, an underlying ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm was eventually diagnosed when the patient became stuporous because of intracranial bleeding.

Occurrence of an acute retrobulbar optic neuropathy may be the initial isolated sign related to a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm, prompting an appropriate neuroradiological assessment.
