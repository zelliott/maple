This study contrasts visuospatial reorienting and response selection signals in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) with functional magnetic resonance imaging. The overall goal was to investigate whether spatial orienting signals and motor signals interacted or were independent in TPJ. The right TPJ showed a greater response to targets at in-validly rather than validly cued locations, but no significant modulation from the effector used to respond. We suggest that TPJ may work as a modality-independent 'circuit breaker' for the dorsal fronto-parietal attention system, directing attention to salient events and enabling a variety of responses to those events.
