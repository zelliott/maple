We report a case of a 55-year-old man who experienced spontaneous resolution of a large herniated disc at T8-9. Spontaneous resolution of disc herniation is well known at the lumbar level. This case is a rare example of a large thoracic disc herniation diagnosed by CT and MRI which completely regressed six months after a medical treatment with complete disappearance of symptoms. The mechanism of resolution of a disc herniation is unclear and we discuss theoretical considerations. We emphasize the interest of conservative therapy in patients with thoracic disc herniation without neurological deficit.
