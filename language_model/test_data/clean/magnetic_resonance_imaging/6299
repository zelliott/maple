We report a method for mapping apparent diffusion coefficients using two interleaved CPMG sequences. Image slice selection is performed prior to each sequence, allowing the use of non-selective "hard" refocussing pulses. Phase cycling of the slice-selection process for each projection minimizes out-of-slice contributions to echo amplitudes. This permits an accurate evaluation of both T2 and apparent proton self-diffusion coefficients.
