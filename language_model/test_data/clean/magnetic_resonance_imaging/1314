We reported a case of teratoma of the posterior mediastinum, whose common location in the mediastinum is anterosuperior portion. A 10-year-old female with teratoma of the posterior mediastinum received thoracotomy in our department. Magnetic Resonance Imaging was useful in this case for the clinical diagnosis of the nature of tumorous shadow using T1-weighted, T2-weighted SE images and IR images.
