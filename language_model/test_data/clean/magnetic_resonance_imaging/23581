A 48-year-old man with a history of a traumatic splenic rupture followed by splenectomy at the age of 5 years was referred to the outpatient clinic with markedly elevated liver enzymes. He was diagnosed with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Ultrasound of the upper abdomen revealed hepatomegaly and suggested a central mass in the liver. Subsequent MRI of the abdomen did not show a hepatic mass, but revealed multiple intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal ovoid structures with a maximum diameter of 3 cm. A peripheral blood smear did not reveal Howell-Jolly bodies suggesting intact splenic function. The diagnosis splenosis-that is, autotransplantation of splenic tissue after iatrogenic/traumatic rupture of the spleen-was considered and confirmed by SPECT-CT with technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) labelled heat-denatured autologous red blood cells.
