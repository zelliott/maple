We describe surgical treatment of a hemangiopericytoma in the anterior skull base and nasal cavity. The patient underwent a novel method of anterior skull base reconstruction, using the superior turbinate and cerebral falx, which was successful. The patient did not develop a cerebrospinal fluid leak or intracranial infection.
