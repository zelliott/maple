Non-invasive functional evaluation of the brain complements structural MRI imaging and has largely supplanted invasive techniques such as awake craniotomy. Techniques used for functional mapping of the brain include BOLD-functional MRI (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We describe the case of a right-handed patient with a lesion centered in the left inferior perirolandic cortex who underwent fMRI, MEG, and TMS on a single day to facilitate maximal lesion resection while preserving eloquent cortex and eloquent white matter tracts.
