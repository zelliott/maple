In patients with dementia, leukoaraiosis (LA) was hypothesized to result in differential patterns of impairment on a verbal serial list-learning test. Using a visual rating scale, 144 dementia patients with ischemic scores <4 were re-categorized as having mild (n = 73), moderate (n = 44), or severe LA (n = 27). Mild LA was predicted to be associated with an amnestic list-learning profile, while severe LA was predicted to be associated with a dysexecutive profile. List-learning performances were standardized to a group of healthy older adults (n = 24). Analyses were conducted on a set of four factors derived from the list-learning paradigm, as well as error scores. Data indicate that LA severity is an important marker for understanding list learning in dementia.
