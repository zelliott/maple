Improved leukemia therapies in children have brought about prolonged remissions with extramedullary relapses being reported in sites other than the most common (bone marrow, testes, brain, and spinal cord). A 3-1/2 year-old boy with a history of acute lymphocytic leukemia presented with total retinal detachment in one eye. Painful glaucoma unresponsive to medical therapy necessitated enucleation. Histopathologic examination documented the presence of a dense leukemic cellular infiltrate replacing a totally detached, necrotic retina. Tumor cells also were present in the optic nerve. The child had remained free of leukemia for 3 years after systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy, supplemented by craniospinal radiation. This represents the first case of relapse of acute lymphocytic leukemia presenting solely as a retinal detachment. Our case also underscores the point that the treatment of leukemia after an isolated ocular relapse can be associated with a favorable outcome.
