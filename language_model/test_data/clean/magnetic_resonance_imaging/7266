A male child with type I (no neck) Klippel-Feil syndrome presented at birth with a transient and partial cord injury. Investigations failed to reveal spinal instability or foramen magnum compression. Subsequent deterioration led to investigations that demonstrated neuroschisis. A cervical meningocoele manque with cord tethering was found at exploration and untethering reversed the deficit. The surgical pathology of the cervical cord is described.
