The incidentally discovered adrenal mass is a diagnostic dilemma veterinarians are likely to face with increasing frequency in the coming years. Dogs and cats may be more prone to functional adrenal lesions than are humans. Most adrenal tumors are benign, but a significant number of adrenocortical carcinomas (approximately 12%) and metastatic lesions within the adrenal glands (3% to 34%) do occur. Evaluation for hypertension, hypokalemia, and loss of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responsiveness to a low dose of dexamethasone is appropriate for all patients with adrenal incidentalomas. The value of clinical and historical signs of hormonal overexpression should not be underestimated. More invasive or expensive diagnostic testing should be predicted on suspicions raised by the history and clinical signs. New diagnostic clinicopathologic tests, including plasma CgA and serum DHEAS, should be investigated in veterinary patients. Advanced diagnostic imaging using nuclear scintigraphy and chemical-shift MRI may offer veterinarians sensitive and specific noninvasive tools to consider for the evaluation of these patients. Patients with large masses, tumors with signs of malignancy, or productive adrenal tumors (plus or minus cortisol-producing tumors in which chemical ablation with mitotane can be attempted) should be considered candidates for exploratory surgery.
