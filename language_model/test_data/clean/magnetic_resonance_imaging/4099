We report the case of a 70-year-old woman with chronic idiopathic ataxic neuropathy. Neurological examination, electrophysiological studies and a sural nerve biopsy suggested involvement of the axon and the dorsal root ganglia. Laboratory examination showed polyclonal elevation of serum IgA. MRI showed high signal intensity in the posterior column of the lumbar spinal cord on T2-weighted images. High signal intensity in the posterior column of the cervical spinal cord on T2-weighted images appeared during the course of the illness. MR abnormalities in this case may reflect the degeneration of the posterior column of the spinal cord subsequent to sensory ganglionic neuropathy.
