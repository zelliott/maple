Here we describe a patient with limb girdle muscular dystrophy 1A (LGMD1A) due to a novel myotilin gene (MYOT) mutation with late onset, rapid progression, loss of ambulation and respiratory failure. The onset of weakness in proximal muscles and muscle MRI findings are clearly different from the pattern identified in myofibrillar myopathies (MFM) related to MYOT mutations. Moreover, there was very limited evidence of myofibrillar pathology in several muscle biopsies obtained during the disease course. We conclude, that MYOT mutations need to be considered as a rare cause of adult-onset, dominant LGMD without clear-cut MFM pathology.
