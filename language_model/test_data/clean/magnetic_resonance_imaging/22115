This study was devoted to tumor differentiation in liver MR T1-weighted imaging with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO). Twenty-one patients with 40 liver lesions were studied at 1.5 T. Before and at least 45 minutes after SPIO administration, turbo-field-echo (TFE) T1-weighted, TFE T1 x T2*-weighted (MXT), and fat-suppressed turbo-spin-echo T2-weighted images were acquired. A quantitative analysis was performed blindly. On TFE T1-weighted images, the signal enhancement was -33% +/- 12 for the liver, -24% +/- 2 for adenomas and focal nodular hyperplasia, +60% +/- 33 for the hemangiomas; metastases and cyst enhancement were not significant. After SPIO on TFE T1-weighted images, the hemangioma-to-liver signal ratio (149% +/- 18) was definitely higher than the mean metastasis-to-liver signal ratio (90% +/- 16). This T1-related differentiation ability lacked dramatically on TFE MXT images and, in one case, was reduced on post-SPIO TFE T1-weighted images by a long imaging delay after SPIO administration (2 hours).
