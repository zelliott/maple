The empty sella syndrome has become a rather frequent finding in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. The usual presentation of empty sella syndrome involves an incidental finding on a computed tomography scan or an MRI scan. It is unusual to find empty sella syndrome associated with hypopituitarism. The authors describe such an unusual finding in a 54-year-old nulliparous woman.
