Malignant tumors of the skull base are complex lesions. Identifying the indications and contraindications for resection is essential for the successful treatment of these lesions. This requires an understanding of the pathology, principles of resection, and nonsurgical therapeutic modalities. Choosing the appropriate surgical approach requires an understanding of the tumor and its association with the anatomy of the skull base. Preoperative assessment and preparation of the patient for the postoperative course, including functional and cosmetic deficits, are reviewed in the context of the specific approach. Anatomical variations encountered in the preoperative planning are discussed. A review of reconstructive alternatives is presented that is specific to the approach and anatomical violation. Finally, the use of a multidisciplinary team both in and out of the operating room is recommended, emphasizing a team approach during the resection itself.
