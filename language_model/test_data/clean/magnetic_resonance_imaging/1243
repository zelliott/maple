Maldevelopment of the vagina is usually combined with aplasia/hypoplasia of the uterus. Complete vaginal aplasia with a normally developed uterus and cervix is an extremely rare form of developmental failure. The accepted treatment for this kind of maldevelopment is hysterectomy plus creation of a neovagina. We present the case of 12-year-old girl with isolated complete vaginal aplasia. After the creation of a vagina during a first procedure and lysis of pericervical adhesions with implantation of skin graft in a second she now has regular menstrual bleeding.
