Antrochoanal polyp is an infrequent nasal mass and is uncommon in elderly people. The case is presented of a 65-year-old man who developed a giant antrochoanal polyp which blocked the right maxillary sinus, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx and hypopharynx. Endoscopic removal of the polyp as well as the base of the polyp was performed.
