MRI is routinely performed to evaluate acute complex knee injuries. This article will review the fundamental biomechanical forces underlying the most important and common injuries and correlate MRI findings with specific traumatic mechanisms.

MRI findings can reveal the traumatic mechanisms in many acute knee injuries. By applying a biomechanical approach in MRI interpretation, it is possible to use easily detected lesions, such as osseous contusion and ligament rupture, to predict subtle but important abnormalities that might otherwise be missed. This systematic focused analysis enables a more accurate and rapid interpretation of knee MR studies.
