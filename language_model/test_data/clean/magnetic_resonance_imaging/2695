A case of acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHLE) in a 6-year-old girl is reported. The presentation was typical for acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis, with acute onset of a rapidly progressive neurologic disorder with asymmetric involvement of brain, with polymorphonuclear predominant peripheral leukocytosis and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Cerebrospinal fluid findings not previously reported included elevation of IgG and the presence of myelin basic protein. Additional previously unreported findings were striking abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, in contrast to normal findings on computed tomography (CT). The child was treated with high dose intravenous steroids and made a full recovery, with a parallel disappearance of all of her cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities and almost all of her abnormalities on MRI. Detailed examination of cerebrospinal fluid and MRI of brain should facilitate early diagnosis in other cases of suspected acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis and high-dose steroid therapy may lead to improved clinical outcomes.
