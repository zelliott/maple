We present a case of a young child who developed eight-and-a-half syndrome following a pontine tuberculoma, an unusual complication of central nervous system tuberculosis not previously described in an immunocompetent child. The combination of clinical findings allowed for precise localization of the lesion whilst magnetic resonance T1 weighted imaging with contrast provided valuable etiological information. We also discuss the management and outcome of the case.
