Pericardial agenesis is a rare anomaly, difficult to diagnose. Its evolution is usually benign. However, on rare occasions, partial defects have been the cause of sudden death. Therefore, surgical treatment has sometimes been indicated, even though in the cases were asymptomatic. We report the case of a 50 year-old woman with partial pericardial agenesis and herniation of left atrial appendage trough. The defect was discovered by a routine chest x-ray and treated in a conservative way. Current diagnostic and therapeutic techniques are reviewed.
