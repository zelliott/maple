The paper analyzes the experience gained in using a molecular resonance coagulator in 145 patients with tumors of the base of the skull and brain. The Vesalius NEUROsurgery N1 molecular resonance apparatus is an innovational bipolar device that is specially designed for neurosurgical application,(operations on the brain). Due to the fact that the temperature at the site of a cut does not exceed 45-50 degrees C, the apparatus has the minimum effect on tissues, nerves, nerve ending, and blood vessels, permitting a surgeon to make interventions into sophisticated anatomic formations. The apparatus operates in the modes "cut" and "coagulation" that enable operations to be performed on particularly minor and fine structures. While working on brain tissues, it is particularly important that there is no thermal injury, tissue charring, or sticking effect due to low working temperatures. The possibility of concurrently making hemostasis and tissue dissection reduces the time of an operation and considerably decreases the extent of blood loss. The clinical case given in this paper demonstrates the universality of the Vesalius NEUROsurgery N1 molecular resonance apparatus used in an infiltrative tumor of the bases of the skull. One forceps operated in different modes may provide sparing coagulation of minor cortical arteries, reduce the volume of a tumor through its bloodless dissection, arrest bleeding from the hyperostosis (wax sticking effect), prepare nerves in the upper lid slit and cavernous sinus. The Vesalius NEUROsurgery N1 molecular resonance surgical apparatus is recommended for neurosurgical care to perform brain operations requiring great caution in handling the tissues being operated on.
