The isolated fourth ventricle (IFV) develops in which obstruction to the out flow of cerebrospinal fluid from the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle occurs rostrally and caudally. IFV has been a rare occurrence and is difficult to treat. We had an occasion to admit a 28-year-old female to our hospital due to hydrocephalus: she also had a history of meningitis a year ago. The patient was initially managed by a lateral ventriculo-peritoneal shunting procedure. Six months after the procedure the patient began to suffer from vomiting, nausea, and diplopia. CT and MRI scans demonstrated an isolated fourth ventricle enlargement; and thus, a fourth ventriculo-peritoneal shunting procedure was performed under stereotactic conditions. The authors present a case of an isolated fourth ventricle after lateral ventriculo-peritoneal shunting for hydrocephalus, which was treated with a stereotactically guided fourth ventriculo-peritoneal shunting procedure. The technique of this procedure is described below.
