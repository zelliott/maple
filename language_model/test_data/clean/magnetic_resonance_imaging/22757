The authors report six neonates with enteroviral meningoencephalitis. Five infants presented with prolonged seizures, and one presented with systemic enteroviral disease. Cranial ultrasonography showed increased echogenicity in the periventricular white matter, and MRI confirmed mild to severe white matter damage in all infants, which looked similar to periventricular leukomalacia. Two infants developed cerebral palsy: one was neurologically suspect at age 18 months, and three were developmentally normal.
