Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can provide important information for diagnosis and evaluation of soft-tissue trauma in the fingers. An optimal imaging technique should include proper positioning, dedicated surface coils, and specific protocols for the suspected abnormalities. Familiarity with the fine anatomy of the normal finger is crucial for identifying pathologic entities. MR imaging is a powerful method for evaluating acute and chronic lesions of the stabilizing articular elements (volar plate and collateral ligaments) of the fingers and thumbs, particularly in the frequently affected proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints. As in other body regions, MR imaging is also useful for depicting traumatic conditions of the extensor and flexor tendons, including injuries to the pulley system. In general, normal ligaments and tendons have low signal intensity on MR images, whereas disruption manifests as increased signal intensity. Radiologists need to understand the full spectrum of finger abnormalities and associated MR imaging findings.
