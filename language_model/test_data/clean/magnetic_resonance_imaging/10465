A proposed explanation for memory impairments in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is stress-induced hippocampal damage due to elevated cortisol levels. We have previously reported smaller hippocampi in police officers with PTSD. In this study, we examined changes in and associations between cortisol, learning, memory, attention, and hippocampal volume in PTSD.

In a case-matched control study, 12 police officers with PTSD and 12 traumatized police officers without lifetime PTSD were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (for hippocampal volume), salivary cortisol tests, and neurocognitive assessments.

Significantly smaller hippocampi and higher early morning salivary cortisol levels were found in PTSD. Subjects with PTSD performed worse on a delayed visual memory recall task at trend level, and made more perseverations and intrusions on a verbal memory task. Negative correlations were found between PTSD symptom severity and immediate recall function, and between re-experiencing symptoms and left hippocampal volume. A positive correlation was found between salivary cortisol level in early morning and right hippocampal volume; however, hippocampal volume did not correlate with memory.

Smaller hippocampi, higher cortisol levels, and memory impairments were associated with PTSD but were not directly correlated to one another. Memory impairments in PTSD do not seem to be a direct consequence of hippocampal size.
