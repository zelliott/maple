Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) can be treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. An infrequent, but important complication of this treatment is radionecrosis, which can be detected by MRI. However, the imaging characteristics of necrosis are unspecific in conventional MRI. Here, we report a case of necrosis after radiotherapy of an AVM to illustrate the potential of 7 Tesla MRI including amide proton transfer (APT) for necrosis imaging.
