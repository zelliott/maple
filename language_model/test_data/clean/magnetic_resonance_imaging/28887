The purpose of this work was to characterize the cross-sectional imaging features of Kikuchi disease.

A search of our hospital records yielded three patients with pathologically proven Kikuchi disease. CT, MR, and ultrasound examinations of these patients were reviewed to characterize the imaging features of Kikuchi disease.

MRI of the neck in one patient, CT of the chest and abdomen in another, and CT and MRI of the abdomen in the third demonstrated uniformly enhancing small lymph nodes in larger than normal numbers in the submandibular, axillary, gastrohepatic, celiac, periportal, paraaortic, retrocrural, mesenteric, and inguinal regions. Lymph node diameter was usually <10 mm and was always <18 mm.

Many small clustered lymph nodes may be a characteristic imaging feature of Kikuchi disease. The abdominal extent of disease may be underreported if cross-sectional imaging is not performed.
