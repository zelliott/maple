Case report.

To report complete recovery after paraplegia in an elderly patient after removal of meningioma at C7-T1 level.

Department of Neurosurgery, Reggio Calabria, Italy.

An 82-year-old lady with 48 months of progressive weakness and numbness was admitted with complete paraplegia lasting 15 days. Investigations (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) demonstrated a meningioma at C7-T1. The tumour compressed the extremely thinned spinal cord. MRI after surgery showed no evidence of residual tumour and the spinal cord was of normal dimensions. The patient recovered fully and locomotion was restored.

Surgical decompression gave an excellent result. The result raises the possibility of neuronal plasticity.
