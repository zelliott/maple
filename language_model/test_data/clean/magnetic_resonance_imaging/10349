Controversy exists in the diagnosis and treatment of pectoralis major tear patterns.

Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in determining the grade and the location of pectoralis major tears and in guiding toward an appropriate treatment plan.

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Between January 1998 and December 2002, 27 patients were treated for pectoralis major tears. All patients were evaluated by history and physical examination. A clinical impression was formed regarding the location and grade of injury, and a treatment plan was established. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and images were reviewed by an orthopaedic surgeon and a board-certified musculoskeletal radiologist, resulting in a final treatment plan. The mean follow-up was 12 months. All patients were evaluated by questionnaire and clinical examination to assess pain, function, deformity, and overall satisfaction.

In 19 of 27 patients, the clinical impression and magnetic resonance imaging agreed regarding the location and the grade of the injury. A total of 19 patients underwent surgical repair, and 8 patients were treated nonoperatively. The magnetic resonance imaging result changed the treatment plan in 3 patients from operative to nonoperative.

The clinical impression appeared to overestimate the severity, the location, and the grade of the injury. Magnetic resonance imaging provided a more accurate assessment and, in conjunction with the clinical examination, helped to identify those patients who would benefit most from surgical repair.
