In an effort to define human cortical gustatory areas we reviewed functional neuroimaging data for which coordinates standardized in Talairach proportional space were available. We observed a wide distribution of peaks within the insula and parietal and frontal opercula, suggesting multiple gustatory regions within this cortical area. Multiple peaks also emerged in the orbitofrontal cortex. However, only two peaks, both in the right hemisphere, were observed in the caudolateral orbitofrontal cortex, the region likely homologous to the secondary taste area described in monkeys. Overall significantly more peaks originated from the right hemisphere suggesting asymmetrical cortical representation of taste favoring the right hemisphere.
