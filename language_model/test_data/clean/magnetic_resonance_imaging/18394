We report palilalia and acquired stuttering in a 60-year-old Japanese male with Parkinson's disease. At the age of 54, he presented with resting tremor in the hand and foot on the left, and gradual slowness in voluntary movements. Two years later, resting tremor involved the right foot, and an expressionless face and frozen gait occurred. A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was made and treatment with L-dopa and carbidopa resulted in conspicuous improvement. At the age of 57, he developed compulsive repetitions of syllables, words and phrases, and sentences infrequently when he spoke. They have been persisting for four years. Repetitions increased in spontaneous speech while they decreased in oral reading and repetition of sentences. These repetitions in speech were symptomatologically diagnosed as palilalia and acquired stuttering. Brain CT showed slight brain atrophy, and brain MRI disclosed a few lesions indicating lacunae in the left substantia nigra, left putamen, and right internal capsule. SPECT showed a slight decrease in blood flow in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia bilaterally. Full IQ on WAIS was 105, and neither agnosia nor apraxia was detected. Palilalia and acquired stuttering, though the pathomechanism has not been clarified, have been reported to occur usually secondary to cerebral vascucular lesions and very rarely in Parkinson's disease. In the present case, they may have been produced by the parkinsonian nigro-striatal lesions. Alternatively, they may have been induced by the small vascular lesions demonstrated by MRI.
