The reason cerebral edema in postpartum cerebral angiopathy (PPCA) occurs preferentially in the posterior brain is poorly understood. The authors present two patients with PPCA who showed vasospasm occurring earlier and more severely in the basilar artery than in the middle cerebral artery. Our patients demonstrate the difference in vascular change between the anterior and posterior cerebral vessels, explaining the susceptibility of the posterior brain to PPCA.
