Prospective study.

In a prospective study, 45 consecutive cases of cervical spinal cord injury without radiographic evidence of trauma (SCIWORET) who were treated non-operatively were analyzed to correlate the magnetic resonance image findings with the initial neurological deficit and the extent of neurological recovery at 2 years.

University tertiary-care teaching hospital in South India.

The neurological status of patients who did not have any radiographic or computerized tomographic abnormality at the time of admission was assessed by ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) modification of Frankel's grading. The spinal cord abnormality seen in the magnetic resonance imaging was noted. The neurological status at the end of 2 years was recorded.

Twenty-seven of the 45 patients (60%) had cord oedema, 8 (17.77%) had cord contusion, 8 (17.77%) patients had a normal cord and 2 (4.44%) patients had cord swelling on the magnetic resonance image. Out of 27 patients who presented with cord oedema, 14 (31.11%) patients recovered from AIS D to AIS E and 6 (13.33%) patients did not recover and remained at AIS D. Seven (15.55%) patients who had a normal cord recovered completely to AIS E. Five (11.11%) patients who had contusion of the cord recovered up to AIS D.

The initial neurological status correlates with magnetic resonance imaging findings. Subsequent neurological recovery is dependent on the type of cord damage and initial neurological status. The rate of recovery and the final motor outcome are inversely related to the length of cord involvement.
