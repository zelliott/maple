To examine the clinical, electrographic, and quantitative MRI differences between frontal lobe (FLE) and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) in children.

The population included children who underwent video-EEG monitoring between 1995 and 2000 who were classified as either FLE (n = 39) or MTLE (n = 17) according to the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy. Clinical, EEG, and quantitative MRI data (including frontal cortical volumes) were compared between the two syndromes and a control group (n = 42).

In FLE, seizures were significantly briefer, more frequent, and predominantly from sleep, and had differing motor characteristics. The rates of bilateral epileptiform interictal and ictal EEG abnormalities were significantly higher in FLE. A nonlesional MRI was significantly more common in FLE. Mean frontal cortical volume in FLE was significantly lower than MTLE and controls. Seizure freedom after surgery was lower in FLE.

The clinical syndrome of FLE is clearly distinct from MTLE. The etiology of this disorder is unknown in the majority of cases despite extensive investigation. Because of a lack of a clearly defined etiology and frequent nonlateralizing EEG changes, few of these children are considered optimal surgical candidates. The demonstration of bilateral frontal cortical volume loss and bilateral EEG abnormalities suggests that FLE is a bilateral disease in a high proportion of patients. The outcome in those patients who were deemed surgical candidates was significantly worse than the MTLE cases.
