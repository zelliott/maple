We report two cases in which the MRI appearances mimicked the dural tail sign; a glioma extending into the subarachnoid space, and a meningioma extending to the subdural space. They indicate that tumour invasion into the subarachnoid or subdural space, should be considered when prominent linear enhancement is observed along the dura mater adjacent to tumours.
