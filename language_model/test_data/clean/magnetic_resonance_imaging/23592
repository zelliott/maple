The authors report a case of an older gentleman with a history of metastatic prostate cancer who presented to the emergency department following 3 weeks of progressively intermittent and then continuous priapism. After an initial clinical workup, an MRI was performed of the pelvis for further evaluation of the patient's condition which demonstrated metastatic lesions within his corpora cavernosa. The patient underwent follow-up core-needle biopsy with pathologically proven metastasis.
