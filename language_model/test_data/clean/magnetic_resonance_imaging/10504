Few studies have assessed long-term prognosis and risk factors for death after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Patients who survive the acute phase may run different prognoses, depending on their disability, treatment, and lifestyle. The present study was performed to find out the predictors for long-term mortality after ICH.

We assessed 7-year prognosis in a population-based cohort of patients who had survived the first 3 months after ICH (n=140). Controls (n=206) living in the same geographical area were randomly drawn from the population register and followed up for the same time.

Seven-year mortality was significantly higher in ICH patients than in controls (32.9 and 19.4%, respectively; P=0.0034). The annual risk for death in ICH patients was 5.6%, and the annual risk for fatal recurrent ICH was 1.3%. The ICH patients with good recovery at 3 months showed similar risk for death as controls. Recurrent ICH and pneumonia were the most common causes of death in ICH patients. Cigarette smoking, age, and diabetes seemed to increase the risk for death in patients and controls.

Survivors of ICH run a higher long-term risk for death than age- and sex-matched controls. However, those who show good recovery at 3 months run a similar outcome as controls.
