The neuroimaging findings in an infant with hypernatremic dehydration are presented. Brain parenchymal haemorrhage and extensive multiple infarcts were present in the acute stage. Follow-up CT showed bilateral, symmetrical changes presumed to indicate extrapontine myelinolysis in the thalamus and globus pallidus. MRI confirmed sparing of the pons. Only three previous cases of neuroimaging abnormalities due to hypernatraemia have been described in the radiological literature.
