A 9-year, 6-month-old boy presented with peripheral-type multiple cranial nerve palsy due to extensive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dissemination of intracranial glioblastoma multiforme. Tissue obtained from biopsy did not stain for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The relationship between GFAP-negative tumor cells and extensive CSF dissemination agreed with recent reports. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium-DPTA enhancement clearly depicted not only the cranial meningeal dissemination but also spinal metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed undoubted usefulness in demonstrating disseminated glioblastoma.
