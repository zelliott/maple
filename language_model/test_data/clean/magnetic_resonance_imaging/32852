The purpose of this study was to evaluate three-dimensional images of liver tumours  obtained with gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MRI (3D-EOB-MRI) in hepatic surgery. We conclude that 3D-EOB-MRI may be an alternative method for depicting liver tumours adjacent to the hepatic veins and portal branches, and may provide additional information for surgical planning.
