This case series describes four children who had meningitis in the neonatal period. After a stable period of years, they developed a myelopathy caused by chronic arachnoiditis. The myelopathy was precipitated by a fall in two cases, and in two cases there was an acute deterioration after surgery. A history of neonatal meningitis should be taken into consideration before planning surgery or anaesthesia. Careful intra-operative positioning, immobilisation of the neck, and maintenance of blood pressure is important but may not prevent this complication.
