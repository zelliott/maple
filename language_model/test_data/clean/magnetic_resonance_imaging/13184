The OMERACT magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in inflammatory arthritis group previously developed the rheumatoid arthritis MRI score (RAMRIS) for use in clinical studies, evaluated the use of extremity MRI, and initiated development of a psoriatic arthritis MRI score (PsAMRIS). At OMERACT 9 the group looked at clarifications of applying the RAMRIS, and presented data from a study examining how the contrast agent gadolinium affects RAMRIS outcomes. Much of the group's effort has been aimed at the iterative development of its PsA score, and reported exercises examining this score demonstrated encouraging results, allowing subsequent presentation of a preliminary PsAMRIS. The large amount of data presented were followed by discussions with the wider audience highlighting constructive suggestions for future research priorities, including further feasibility studies, understanding imaging remission, and further improvements to PsAMRIS.
