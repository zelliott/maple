The most commonly used staging system for cervical cancer is based on the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been accepted as the optimal tool for evaluation of the main prognostic factors and selection of therapeutic strategy. The purpose of this study was to compare the preoperative clinical examination FIGO staging findings with MRI and postoperative pathology report in females with primary cancer of the cervix. The study prospectively included 46 females consecutively hospitalized at the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics at the "Sestre milosrdnice" University Hospital Center in Zagreb. Interviews, clinical examination, transvaginal ultrasound and MRI were performed in all patients. In selected patients the surgical procedure was done and the correlation of clinical findings according to FIGO classifications, MRI and histopathological findings was completed. According to FIGO classification, positive clinical findings for stage IIA were found in 26/46 (55.5%) and stage IIB in 20/46 (44.5%)patients. FIGO MR modified classification confirmed stage IIA in 30/46 (66.6%) and stage IIB in 16/46 (33.4%) patients. Surgery (Wertheim radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic and selective para-aortic lymphadenectomy) was performed in 33/46 (71%) patients with clinically, MR, cytologically and pathohistologically confirmed findings of cervical cancer: 26 patients with IIA clinically FIGO stage and 7 with IIB stage. MRI examination proved better than clinical examination in staging of cervical carcinoma with 90.9% versus 79.0% accuracy rate. We suggest the application of the following MR protocol in all clinically staged FIGO IIA and IIB patients: T1W, T2WI and postcontrast dynamic T1WI after 3 and 60 seconds and after 5 minutes, performed on 1.5T MR machine.
