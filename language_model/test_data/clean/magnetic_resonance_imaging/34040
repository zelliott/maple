During the period covered by this review a number of papers have been published on saccade and smooth pursuit research, conducted experimentally in monkeys and clinically in humans. In monkeys, using mainly electrophysiological methods, the roles of the frontal eye field, parietal eye field and supplementary eye field at the cortical level, and those of the paramedian pontine reticular formation, nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, interstitial nucleus of Cajal and superior colliculus at the brainstem level have been studied in great detail. In humans the same cortical areas have also been examined, mainly using functional imaging resulting in new information on the location of these areas and new hypotheses on the role of the superior parietal lobule in visual attention and that of the posterior part of the anterior cingulate cortex in motivation. Saccades, smooth pursuit and clinical applications of eye movement research are dealt with separately.
