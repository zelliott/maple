The wrist is frequently involved in the course of inflammatory rheumatism. The clinical and radiological features of the arthritis may guide the diagnosis when wrist involvement is isolated. The rheumatoid wrist may associate articular and tendon sheath synovitis, nerve compressions, muscle atrophy and deformities. X-rays reveal increased volume of the soft tissues, followed by cartilaginous destruction. Magnetic resonance imaging may detect the lesions early in their course. RS3PE, rheumatoid arthritis of the elderly, never induces destructive lesions. Still's disease is distinguished from rheumatoid arthritis by the predominant involvement of the radiocarpal and intercarpal joints with relative sparing of the metacarpo-phalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. Jaccoud's hand may be observed in the course of lupus with metacarpo-phalangeal dislocation of capsulo-ligamentous origin without cartilaginous destruction. Wrist involvement is often asymmetrical in ankylosing spondylitis. In psoriatic rheumatism, arthritis of the wrist is similar to that observed in rheumatoid arthritis, but demineralization is less common and occurs later and constructive lesions are associated with pinching.
