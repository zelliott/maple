Extracranial meningiomas are common tumours but may occur in unexpected locations. Awareness can avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate management of these tumours. We report the case of a 54-year-old Caucasian male with en plaque meningioma of the external ear canal and an intracranial temporal lobe meningioma.

The patient underwent extended canal wall down atticomastoidectomy with preservation of the ossicular chain and tympanic membrane and en bloc resection of the bony posterior canal wall, tumour, and overlying skin.

Radical removal of a grade I meningothelial meningioma was achieved. The tegmen tympani and dura were not breached. No connection with the temporal lobe meningioma was demonstrated. The patient recovered completely and experienced a marked improvement in hearing. No clinical signs of recurrent or residual tumour have occurred.

Careful clinical examination and extensive radiological workup is required to avoid missing the unusual diagnosis of concurrent meningioma of the temporal bone and temporal lobe, and miss the chance to treat this disease adequately.
