Eleven abattoir workers in Singapore were infected in March 1999 by an outbreak caused by the Nipah virus. This newly discovered, Hendra-like paramyxovirus causes acute infection of the CNS. We present the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) findings in a patient suffering from acute meningoencephalitis. Multiple small white matter lesions were detected on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted images. There were no abnormalities detected on MRS. We believe this to be the first reported MRI findings in this novel zoonotic viral disease.
