Slice thickness is a primary operational parameter in the evaluation of the performance of an MRI system with regard to providing accurate imaging of a slice of tissue. Of the various methods that have been utilized to evaluate slice thickness, a continuous high-signal ramp has gained the most support as the method of choice. However, problems with the accuracy of the measurement method have been associated with the finite thickness of the ramp. This report considers the accuracy of the measurement method as a function of ramp width.
