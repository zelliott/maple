Primary intraosseous cavernous hemangiomas (PICHs) are rare tumors, and there are no previous reports of cases with a tumor at the anterior clinoid process. We report a case of a PICH at the anterior clinoid process in a 66-year-old female presenting with headaches and visual impairment. CT and MR imaging showed a mass in the anterior clinoid process. The lesion showed hyperintensity on T1- and T2-weighted imaging, and gadolinium was homogenously enhanced. The lesion was removed surgically, and histologically confirmed as a cavernous hemangioma. Preoperative examinations could not provide a definitive diagnosis. A brief clinical and radiological review of the literature is presented.
