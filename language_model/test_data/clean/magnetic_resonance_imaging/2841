A 77-year-old woman had an acute onset of chorea after hyperglycemic coma. She had no family history of neurologic disorders. Although brain CT showed no detectable lesions in the putamen, MR revealed a high intensity on T1-weighted images and a low intensity on T2-weighted images in both putamina.
