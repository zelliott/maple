Schizophrenia has been increasingly conceptualized as a disorder of brain connectivity, in large part due to findings emerging from white matter and functional connectivity (FC) studies. This work has focused primarily on within-hemispheric connectivity, however some evidence has suggested abnormalities in callosal structure and interhemispheric interaction. Here we examined functional connectivity between homotopic points in the brain using a technique called voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). We performed VMHC analyses on resting state fMRI data from 23 healthy controls and 25 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. We found highly significant reductions in VMHC in patients for a number of regions, particularly the occipital lobe, the thalamus, and the cerebellum. No regions of increased VMHC were detected in patients. VMHC in the postcentral gyrus extending into the precentral gyrus was correlated with PANSS Total scores. These results show substantial impairment of interhemispheric coordination in schizophrenia.
