In humans, neurotrauma is suspected to cause brain atrophy and accelerate slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia. However, a direct link between brain injury and subsequent delayed global neurodegeneration has remained elusive. Here we show that juvenile (4-week-old) mice that are given a discrete unilateral lesion of the parietal cortex, develop to adulthood without obvious clinical symptoms. However, when monitored 3 and 9 months after lesioning, using high-resolution three-dimensional MRI and behavioural testing, the same mice display global neurodegenerative changes. Surprisingly, erythropoietin, a haematopoietic growth factor with potent neuroprotective activity, prevents behavioural abnormalities, cognitive dysfunction and brain atrophy when given for 2 weeks after acute brain injury. This demonstrates that a localized brain lesion is a primary cause of delayed global neurodegeneration that can be efficiently counteracted by neuroprotection.
