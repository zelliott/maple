The authors report one case of a relatively common benign tumor, hemangioma, although in an uncommon location, intra-muscular. The radiological exploration, principally MR imaging has a great interest to specify the diagnosis and the regional extension. Intramuscular hemangioma appears with a relatively low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, but demonstrates a clear delineation of the extent of the lesion on T2-weighted images, because of high contrast between hemangiomas and surrounding muscle. The informations obtained with MR imaging may be valuable clinically in planning surgical resection.
