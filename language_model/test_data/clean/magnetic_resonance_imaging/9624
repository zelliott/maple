Gray matter (GM) volume deficits have been described in patients with schizophrenia (Sz) and bipolar disorder (BD), but to date, few studies have directly compared GM volumes between these syndromes with methods allowing for whole-brain comparisons. We have used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to compare GM volumes between 38 Sz and 19 BD chronic patients. We also included 24 healthy controls. The results revealed a widespread cortical (dorsolateral and medial prefrontal and precentral) and cerebellar deficit as well as GM deficits in putamen and thalamus in Sz when compared to BD patients. Besides, a subcortical GM deficit was shown by Sz and BD groups when compared to the healthy controls, although a putaminal reduction was only evident in the Sz patients. In this comparison, the BD patients showed a limited cortical and subcortical GM deficit. These results support a partly different pattern of GM deficits associated to chronic Sz and chronic BD, with some degree of overlapping.
