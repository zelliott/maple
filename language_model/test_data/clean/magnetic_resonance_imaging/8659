Cognitive impairment belongs to the core symptoms in MS affecting quality of life, self-esteem, and social as well as occupational functioning. Due to this high impact on patients' well-being efficient treatment concepts are required. Imaging studies on cognition have shown that functional reorganisation takes place spontaneously to compensate for deficits. In mildly to moderately impaired patients these processes may support coping with emerging deficits. However, these compensatory processes seem to be limited as brain activation of cognitively severely impaired patients is characterised by decreased additional recruitment of brain regions. Cognitive rehabilitation concentrates on the question whether induction of brain plasticity is possible for both the support of the spontaneous processes and the initiation of new ones. Combining cognition, brain imaging and cognitive rehabilitation in MS, an intriguing question is whether fMRI can provide further insights into the mechanisms of induced plasticity and serve as objective outcome measures for efficient cognitive intervention.
