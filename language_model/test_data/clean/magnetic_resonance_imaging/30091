The most common vascular anomaly associated with a developmental venous anomaly (DVA) is a cavernous malformation. A cerebral DVA is a rare vascular malformation of the brain when it is associated with a varix. The authors report on a 13-year-old girl who presented with 2 brief episodes of nonresponsiveness that mimicked absence seizures. The computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance images, and cerebral angiograms showed a left temporal DVA in combination with a sylvian fissure varix. To maintain normal parenchymal venous drainage, no surgical intervention was performed. Radiological and clinical follow-up was planned. This case report expands the present knowledge of the rare association of a cerebral DVA with a varix and emphasizes the need for meticulous neuroimaging to avoid unnecessary surgery.
