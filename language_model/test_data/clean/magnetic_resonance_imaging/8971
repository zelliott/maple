The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of submucosal radiofrequency tonsil reduction (SRFTR) in adults by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The secondary objective was to evaluate the morbidity of SRFTR.

A prospective, longitudinal clinical study with a follow-up time of 12 months was conducted of 10 consecutive patients with the median age of 24.5 years (range 19-55 years) with obstructive palatine tonsil hypertrophy. SRFTR was delivered in an outpatient setting in a tertiary care centre, academic teaching hospital.

The change in tonsillar volume after SRFTR was evaluated with MRI by two radiologists independently and blinded to the treatment results. The morbidity was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS), a questionnaire for the pain medication needed, and inflammatory laboratory parameters. VAS and use of pain medication results were compared with those of two earlier cohort groups undergoing conventional tonsillectomy with two different techniques at our department.

The tonsil volume reduced significantly with a median reduction in the total tonsil volume of 12.6% (range 3.7-41.5%, pretreatment vs posttreatment volume, p < .01). VAS of the morbidity symptoms and the amount of pain medication needed were significantly lower in the SRFTR group than in the two historical tonsillectomy groups. The laboratory parameters showed a significant change.

SRFTR in adults with obstructive palatine tonsil hypertrophy is a minimally invasive procedure causing a tonsil volume reduction demonstrated by MRI. The procedure seems to be associated with acceptable morbidity.
