We present a personal case of papillary pineocytoma in a 42-year-old woman.

The lesion was first treated surgically both for diagnostic aims and for resolution of the mass effect causing hydrocephalus and correlated neurological disturbances. Because the tumor recurred after surgery and radiotherapy, we decided to further treat the patient with chemotherapy, in particular with temozolomide.

Currently, almost 9 years after the first treatment, the patient is symptom-free and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging shows no tumor recurrence.

Although surgery should be considered the first-choice therapy, we think that temozolomide can be a valid option in case of recurrence of these rare tumors.
