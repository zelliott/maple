Three paracardiac masses (1 thymic cyst, 2 thymomas) were studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using spin-echo, multi-echo, and gradient-echo sequences (cine-MR). MRI showed: a pedunculate cystic lesion, typical for thymic origin, in Case 1; cardiac and pulmonary infiltration, and 3 intracardiac metastases, in Case 2; cardiovascular compression but not infiltration, in Case 3. In 3/3 cases MRI was superior to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and in 2/2 MRI was superior to computed tomography (CT), not performed in Case 2 (allergy to contrast agents). MRI may be considered the most important technique to evaluate cardiovascular involvement by thymic neoplasms. MRI should be performed after TTE and makes CT unnecessary.
