Metastatic lesions of midbrain are quite rare, and only unusually they produce isolated cranial nerve palsy.

We report two cases of 2nd and 3rd cranial nerves impairment, produced by solitary midbrain metastases.

In both patients Magnetic Resonance (MR) allowed a correct diagnosis, subsequently confirmed by histology.

The metastatic involvement of midbrain would be included in the differential diagnosis of neuro-ophthalmic conditions to avoid the risk of misdiagnosis and consequently delay in management of this special population. MR is crucial for early detection of this infrequent pathology.
