Over the past 15 years, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has vaulted to the forefront as the ideal diagnostic modality for the evaluation of both left and right ventricular function. The accumulated literature supports this contention for the left ventricle. However, for the right ventricle, typically poorly visualized accurately by traditional imaging techniques, CMR has emerged as the test of choice. Although earlier CMR sequences have become even more robust, resulting in further improvements in spatial and temporal resolution, CMR has avidly remained the gold standard. Yet, these attributes that have so benefited investigations of the systole need not be so constrained. In this review, we discuss recent applications of CMR to the study of lusitropy, demonstrating the potential for further advances in our understanding of diastole.
