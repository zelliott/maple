This study aimed to determine the feasibility, reproducibility, and reliability of the multiecho T*(2) Magnetic resonance imaging technique at 3 T for myocardial and liver iron burden quantification and the relationship between T*(2) values at 3 and 1.5 T. Thirty-eight transfusion-dependent patients and 20 healthy subjects were studied. Cardiac segmental and global T*(2) values were calculated after developing a correction map to compensate the artifactual T*(2) variations. The hepatic T*(2) value was determined over a region of interest. The intraoperator and interoperator reproducibility for T*(2) measurements at 3 T was good. A linear relationship was found between patients' Râ€‰*2 (1000/T*(2) ) values at 3 and 1.5 T. Segmental correction factors were significantly higher at 3 T. A conversion formula returning T*(2) values at 1.5 T from values at 3 T was proposed. A good diagnostic reliability for T*(2) assessment at 3 T was demonstrated. Lower limits of normal for 3 T T*(2) values were 23.3 ms, 21.1 ms, and 11.7 ms, for the global heart, mid-ventricular septum, and liver, respectively. In conclusion, T*(2) quantification of iron burden in the mid-ventricular septum, global heart, and no heavy-moderate livers resulted to be feasible, reproducible, and reliable at 3 T. Segmental heart T*(2) analysis at 3 T may be challenging due to significantly higher susceptibility artifacts.
