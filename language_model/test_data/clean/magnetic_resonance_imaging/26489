To compare the performance of three pulse sequences commonly used at magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography in the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis.

MR cholangiography was performed in 57 patients who were suspected of having choledocholithiasis and referred for endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Non-breath-hold three-dimensional fast spin-echo, breath-hold single-section half-Fourier rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE), and breath-hold multisection half-Fourier RARE sequences were compared. Two radiologists independently interpreted the MR cholangiograms. Evaluated diagnostic performance parameters included sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and interobserver agreement (kappa statistics). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was the standard of reference.

Eight patients were excluded because of incomplete MR examinations (n = 4) or failure in the cannulation of the bile duct at retrograde cholangiography (n = 4). In 49 patients, the three MR cholangiographic sequences were completed successfully. In 24 (49%) of these patients, retrograde cholangiography demonstrated stones. Sensitivity and specificity of MR cholangiography exceeded 90%, and the area under the ROC curve was greater than 0.95 for both radiologists and for the three sequences. Interobserver agreement for presence of bile duct stones was at least 0.80 (very good) for the three sequences.

The three MR cholangiographic sequences had similarly high sensitivities and specificities for the detection of choledocholithiasis.
