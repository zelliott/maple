Out of 137 cases concerning the spine and spine cord, the authors demonstrate that MRI is nowadays fully integrated in urgency investigations. In all cord compression suspicions and in spine trauma investigations, it's place is found. Coil and software improvements allow to put CT and MR scanning delays on a line. This study underlines the necessity of being equipped with non magnetic life support systems allowing management of very fragile patients. In traumas, MR provides the lesion's authentification, it's type, it's unique localisation or not, and therefore an early functional prognosis. The discovery of spine cord involving lesions in neoplastic conditions allows to follow a therapeutic strateging for maintaining the motor function. In the end, the authors discuss about practical utility of MR in scuba diving decompression accidents. No lesion of the spine cord has been demonstrated in 25 patients, probably because of technical insufficiency.
