Cerebral deficit has been implicated in the genesis of strabismus and in the mechanisms adopted to compensate for the visual disorder. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was applied to magnetic resonance images of strabismic adults to detect any abnormal brain anatomy, which could not be easily identified by simple inspection. The gray matter volume in strabismic adults was smaller than that in normal subjects at the areas consistent with the occipital eye field (OEF) and parietal eye field (PEF). However, greater gray matter volume was found in strabismic adults relative to normal controls at the areas consistent with the frontal eye field (FEF), the supplementary eye field (SEF), the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and subcortical regions such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia. These opposite gray matter changes in the visual and the oculomotor processing areas are compatible with a hypothesis of plasticity in the oculomotor regions to compensate for the cortical deficits in the visual processing areas.
