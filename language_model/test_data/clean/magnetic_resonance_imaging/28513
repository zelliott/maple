Herpes simplex virus encephalitis is a severe sporadic encephalitis in man with high mortality and morbidity. A critical step in the establishment of therapy is early diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive, accurate diagnostic test for the detection of central nervous system disease. In an effort to monitor morphological changes in vivo we present a new diagnostic neuroimaging model of experimental herpes simplex virus encephalitis. A mouse model of herpes simplex virus encephalitis was used. 40 SJL mice were intranasally inoculated with an infectious dose of wild-type strain HSV-I F. Morphological abnormalities were studied by cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These findings were correlated with sequential neuropathological studies. 95% of animals developed cerebral abnormalities on MRI. resembling human HSVE. Areas of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences and focal pathological contrast enhancement were mostly found in the frontal and temporal lobes and thalamic and cerebellar regions. All animals with MRI abnormalities had neuropathological signs of neuronal degeneration and reactive astrocytosis in corresponding regions. The described monitoring system offers a new approach for studies on neurovirulence and therapeutic strategies.
