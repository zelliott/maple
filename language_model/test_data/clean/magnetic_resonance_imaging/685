The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, the safety, and the usefulness of T2*-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) for neuronavigational guidance in patients with cerebral cavernomas. Eight patients with intracerebral cavernomas were operated assisted by T2*-weighted MR image-guidance. The cavernomas were either deep-seated or in eloquent regions. Image fusion of a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo (GRE) sequence with a T2*-weighted GRE sequence was performed via an automated fusion software (StealthMerge). The T2*-weighted images were used to secure complete resection of the cavernoma in all patients and to verify resection of surrounding hemosiderin-stained tissue in epilepsy cases. Furthermore, the multimodal neuronavigational concept included ultrasonography, corticography, and evoked potentials. Postoperative MR excluded any residual malformation in all cases. There was no postoperative morbidity; all epilepsy patients are seizure-free up to now. In our preliminary series, T2*-GRE-guided neuronavigation proved useful for resection control in cavernoma surgery, and we suppose that it will be helpful to clarify the discussion on the value of resection of the surrounding hemosiderin-stained tissue.
