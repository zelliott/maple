This report describes cartilaginous regeneration in a cricoarytenoid joint affected by spondyloarthropathy using tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) blockade, monitored by magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging. This case is interesting for several reasons. It is only the eighth case of destructive ankylosing spondylitis-related cricoarytenoid arthritis published in the English language literature. It describes, for the first time, full recovery of vocal cord mobility following TNF-α blockade. It is also the first case to be published with MR imaging demonstrating regeneration of the cricoarytenoid cartilage following treatment. This case represents a landmark in the treatment of patients presenting with destructive arthritis involving the cricoarytenoid joint.
