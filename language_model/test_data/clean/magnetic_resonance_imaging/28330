Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been used to study the baking of a cookie. The structural and dynamic changes occurring during baking have been monitored, including changes in the internal moisture saturations and distribution. The images reveal the moisture distribution is initially uniform, and during baking a gradient in moisture develops from the interior to the edge. Changes in physical dimensions calculated from the data are consistent with those obtained from time-lapsed photography.
