A 44-year-old patient underwent CT and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and was found to have a typical appearing meningioma. The meningioma was of increased density relative to brain and enhanced homogeneously on CT. It was slightly hypointense on T1-weighted MR images and isointense on T2-weighted MR images relative to cortex. Thirty days later, repeat CT and MR scans showed change of the tumor consistent with central necrosis. An area of central low density developed on the CT scans, and a central high signal developed on the T2-weighted MR images. Pathological sectioning confirmed central necrosis of a syncytial meningioma.
