Differences in cross-section areas of calf structures were studied in different sportsmen groups and controls: sprinters, long-distance runners, free-climbers, and sport non active persons. The cross-section areas of calf tissues were established by magnetic resonance imaging. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in single muscle areas. The only statistically significant difference was found in subcutaneous fat between sportsmen and non active persons. Results show a general adaptive tendency of the muscle to greater activity, without exhibiting sport-group specificity differences.
