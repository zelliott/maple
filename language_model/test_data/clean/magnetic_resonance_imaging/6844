The reimplantation of autologous chondrocytes is a new technique in reconstruction of cartilage defects; initial results achieved with this technique have been promising. In an arthroscopic procedure, scales of cartilage are obtained from intact cartilage. The chondrocytes are then multiplied in special laboratories. A few weeks later, in a second procedure, the cartilage defect is filled with the cell suspension and closed with a flap of periosteum.

At our department, autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) has been used in 10 patients since 1996, in 6 cases in the knee joint, and in 4 cases in the ankle joint. The mean age of the patients was 30 years. The mean size of the defect was 4 cm(2). In 4 patients, a parallel surgical procedure was required at the time of removal.

The mean duration of follow-up was 21/2 years. Six patients had good to excellent results, 3 patients had moderate results, and one patient a poor result. The modified Cincinnati rating scale was improved from 2.4 to 7.1 points, and the Lysholm score from 59.2 to 86.6 points. The AOFAS score for ankle joints had improved from 33 to 76.

We were able to show that ACT achieves improvement in the knee as well as ankle joint in the majority of patients. ACT appears to be a promising therapeutic concept for both joints.
