Gouty arthritis is the most frequent rheumatological complication among cyclosporine-treated organ transplant recipients. We report one case of pseudotumoral intramuscular tophaceous deposit of the forearm, in a heart transplant patient with a history of traumatic wound to the same area 17 years previously, and with no known arthritis.
