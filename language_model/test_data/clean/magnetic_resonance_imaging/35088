Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) provides a powerful tool to study multisynaptic circuits in vivo and thereby to link information about neural structure and function within individual subjects. Making the best use of MEMRI in monkeys requires minimizing manganese-associated neurotoxicity, maintaining sensitivity to manganese-dependent signal changes and mapping transport throughout the brain without a priori anatomical hypotheses. Here, we performed intracortical injections of isotonic MnCl(2), comparisons of preinjection and postinjection scans, and voxelwise statistical mapping. Isotonic MnCl(2) did not cause cell death at the injection site, damage to downstream targets of manganese transport, behavioral deficits, or changes in neuronal responsiveness. We detected and mapped manganese transport throughout cortical-subcortical circuits by using voxelwise statistical comparisons of at least 10 preinjection and two postinjection scans. We were able to differentiate between focal and diffuse projection fields and to distinguish between the topography of striatal projections from orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in a single animal. This MEMRI approach provides a basis for combining circuit-based anatomical analyses with simultaneous single-unit recordings and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging in individual monkeys. Such studies will enhance our interpretations of functional data and our understanding of how neuronal activity is transformed as it propagates through a circuit.
