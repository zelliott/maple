We report a case of alexia without either agraphia or hemianopia following herpes simplex encephalitis. The patient had a temporal lobe lesion with involvement of the occipitotemporal gyrus. This is an unusual cause of alexia without agraphia. The location of the lesion supports the view that transcallosal fibers from the right hemisphere to the left angular gyrus course inferior to the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle and pass close to the left occipitotemporal gyrus.
