To assess the performance of three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) venography of the pelvis and lower extremities in patients without acute deep venous thrombosis by using a lower extremity vascular coil and pedal injection of paramagnetic contrast material.

Conventional and MR venography were performed in 35 legs in 25 patients referred for evaluation of varicosities (n = 8) and postthrombotic changes (n = 7) and assessment of the great saphenous veins prior to bypass surgery (n = 10). Injection of 120 mL of diluted (1:15) gadopentetate dimeglumine into a pedal vein was performed manually at a rate of 1 mL/sec, and 3D gradient-recalled echo data sets of the upper and lower veins were collected. Conventional and MR venographic images were analyzed separately in a blinded fashion.

MR image quality was comparable to that of conventional venograms. Varicose changes of the great and small saphenous veins (sensitivity, 94% [44 of 47]; specificity, 96% [89 of 93]) were assessed as reliably as their status before bypass surgery (sensitivity, 98% [53 of 54]; specificity, 92% [47 of 51]). Postthrombotic changes were diagnosed with a sensitivity of 100% [13 of 13] and a specificity of 98% [88 of 90].

Direct 3D MR venography comprehensively displays the lower extremity venous system and permits assessment of postthrombotic and varicose changes and the bypass suitability of the saphenous vein.
