A 74-year-old man developed paranoid ideation, memory impairment, and defective gustatory and olfactory function while on bismuth subgallate therapy for use as a colostomy deodorant. Twenty-four-hour urine bismuth was elevated at 889 micrograms/day, and whole blood bismuth concentration was 67 micrograms/L. The patient improved after discontinuation of bismuth subgallate; there was resolution of paranoid behavior and gustatory and olfactory functions improved. Follow-up whole blood bismuth concentration was 21 micrograms/L 4 weeks after cessation. Altered gustatory and olfactory function have not been previously reported with bismuth intoxication.
