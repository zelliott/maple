Angiolipomas are rare benign mesenchymal tumours that are distinguished from common lipomas by a marked degree of vascularisation. They are differentiated into non-infiltrating and the even less frequent infiltrating angiolipomas. The present case is the 9th report of an infiltrating angiolipoma of the head and neck. The patient was a 63-year-old man with an infiltrating angiolipoma of the left M. temporalis. Microscopic examination showed univacuolated adipose cells mixed with capillaries invading skeletal muscle. The patient has been free of recurrence since excision of the tumor.
