Numerous new modalities in computertomography (CT), in particular Multislice-Spiral-CT and Virtual Endoscopy, and novel developments in endoscopy and spirometry gave us reason to review the current state of the art in diagnostics of tracheal stenosis (TS).

This review evaluates the literature of the last decade regarding new trends and methods in diagnostics of tracheal stenosis. Pros and cons are discussed, and the future trends are highlighted.

Spiral-CT scans at collimated slices of < or = 3 mm, PITCH < or = 1.5 and a segmentation level of - 350 HE permit a valid measurement of tracheal lumina. The flow-volume-plot is still the most important investigation to evaluate respiratory function in TS. Peak-Flow-Meters are suitable for patient self monitoring. The selective estimation of the TS related airway resistance using in situ measurements and numerical flow simulation studies are likely to reach importance in future. The ability to obtain exact measures from endoscopic recordings using EndoScan serves quality control in endoscopy. An objective comparison of different treatments becomes possible. Endosonography and methods for in-vitro tissue analysis (Optical Coherence Tomography) are more focused on the early diagnosis of malignant lesions. The Synopsis of endoscopy, CT-scan and spirometry provides the highest diagnostic accuracy today.
