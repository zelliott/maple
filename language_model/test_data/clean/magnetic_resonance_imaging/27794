Rapid deformation of brain tissue in response to head impact or acceleration can lead to numerous pathological changes, both immediate and delayed. Modeling and simulation hold promise for illuminating the mechanisms of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and for developing preventive devices and strategies. However, mathematical models have predictive value only if they satisfy two conditions. First, they must capture the biomechanics of the brain as both a material and a structure, including the mechanics of brain tissue and its interactions with the skull. Second, they must be validated by direct comparison with experimental data. Emerging imaging technologies and recent imaging studies provide important data for these purposes. This review describes these techniques and data, with an emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging approaches. In combination, these imaging tools promise to extend our understanding of brain biomechanics and improve our ability to study TBI in silico.
