A congenital partial defect of the right-sided pericardium is a rare cardiac anomaly and it represents defective formation of the pleuropericardial membrane. Patients can be asymptomatic, but they may experience chest pain, myocardial ischemia, emboli, arrhythmia, and sudden death. In this report, we present an 8-month-old boy with pericardial defect and right atrial appendage herniation. It was diagnosed by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
