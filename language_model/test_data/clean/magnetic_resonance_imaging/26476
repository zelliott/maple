Chiasmal apoplexy, defined as hemorrhage into the optic chiasm, generally is caused by an intrachiasmal vascular malformation. We report the first case of chiasmal apoplexy due to hemorrhage from a pituitary macroadenoma into the optic chiasm.

A 52-year-old man presented with headache, sudden and severe deterioration of visual acuity in the left eye, and a bitemporal visual field deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large intra- and suprasellar homogeneously enhancing mass, which elevated a markedly thickened optic chiasm. After emergent transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary adenoma, vision did not improve.

A pterional craniotomy was subsequently performed, during which a hematoma was found and evacuated from within the substance of the left optic nerve and chiasm. The hematoma cavity was found to communicate with the sella through a defect in the diaphragm. Vision improved dramatically after the operation.

Chiasmal apoplexy resulting from pituitary adenoma should be distinguished from pituitary apoplexy, particularly because it requires a different surgical treatment. Clinical and radiographic features that may help distinguish the two are discussed.
