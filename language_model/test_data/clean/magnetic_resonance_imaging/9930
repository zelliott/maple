To explore the pathogenesis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by studying default mode network during the resting state in patients with PTSD after homologous traumatic experience.

Seventeen PTSD patients and 20 matched normal controls received the examnation of resting-state fMRI scanning. Left and right posterior cingulate cortex was regarded as seed region respectively, and the functional connectivity about whole brain was assessed by using resting-state functional connectivity analysis.

Compared with control group, the patients with PTSD showed that the brain area with decreased functional connectivity included left superior frontal gyrus and right fusiform gyrus, while the brain area with increased functional connectivity included right precuneus, right superior temporal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus.

The brain default mode network of PTSD patients is abnormal in resting state. These abnormalities might be the neuropathological mechanisms of PTSD.
