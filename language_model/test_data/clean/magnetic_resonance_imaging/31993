We report a case of synovial sarcoma in the neck that was initially considered to be a benign soft-tissue tumour. The mass appeared to originate in the perivertebral space, extending to the spinal canal via the C3/4 and C4/5 neural foramina. The mass also encased the right vertebral artery and this suggested a malignant soft-tissue tumour.
