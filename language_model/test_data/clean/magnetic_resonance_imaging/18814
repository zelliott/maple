Esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB) is an uncommon tumor type of neural crest origin, which, in the majority of cases, arises in the nasal cavity. We present a rare primary presentation of ENB in the sphenoidal area studied with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR). To our knowledge, this is the first case in which MR findings are available.
