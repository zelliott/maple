To investigate whether the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was a better predictor of abdominal fat, measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the level of L2-L3, than anthropometric measurements in non-obese men and non-obese women.

Observational, cross sectional study.

34 healthy subjects (17 men and 17 women) aged 20-53 y with a body mass index (BMI) < 30 kg/m2.

Fat distribution parameters including waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR); intra abdominal fat (IAF) by MRI; and central abdominal fat (CAF) by DEXA.

Measurement of IAF by MRI, was highly correlated to the CAF measured by DEXA. In men, both waist circumference and WHR had similar correlation to IAF as DEXA. In women, waist circumference was less well correlated with IAF than DEXA, and the WHR had a weaker non significant correlation with IAF.

In non-obese men; DEXA, waist circumference and WHR can predict IAF equally well, while in non-obese women, DEXA is superior to waist circumference and much better than WHR.
