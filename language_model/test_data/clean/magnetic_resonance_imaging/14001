To evaluate uterine changes on MRI before and after GnRH analog (GnRHa) treatment in diffuse adenomyosis.

Thirty-one patients with MRI features suggestive of diffuse adenomyosis received GnRHa for 6 months. Diffuse adenomyosis was sub-classified as: symmetric (symmetric/ entire widening of the junctional zone [JZ]) and asymmetric (asymmetric/ partial widening of JZ). Pre- and post-high signal intensity (SI) foci and JZ width, and post-demarcated change (interface of adenomyosis with the myometrium became more discrete with a concomitant decrease in JZ width) were analyzed.

Before therapy, 15 of 18 asymmetric contained high SI foci compared to none of symmetric. After therapy, JZ width decreased (P < 0.0001). Eight asymmetric and none of symmetric showed demarcated change with resolved high SI foci.

Our results suggest the use of GnRHa is associated with a decrease of JZ width in adenomyosis. Asymmetric adenomyosis with high SI foci appears to be the most sensitive to hormonal therapy.
