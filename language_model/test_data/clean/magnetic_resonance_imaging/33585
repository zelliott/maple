A mathematical procedure, which we call "Deblurring," was developed to reduce spatial blur distortion of scalp-recorded brain potentials due to transmission through the skull and other tissues. Deblurring estimates potentials at the superficial cerebral cortical surface from EEG's recorded at the scalp using a finite element model of each subject's scalp, skull and cortical surface constructed from their magnetic resonance images (MRI's). Simulations indicate that Deblurring is numerically stable, while a comparison of deblurred data with a direct cortical recording from a neurosurgery patient suggests that the procedure is valid. Application of Deblurring to somatosensory evoked potential data recorded at 124 scalp sites suggests that the method produces a dramatic improvement in spatial detail, and merits further development.
