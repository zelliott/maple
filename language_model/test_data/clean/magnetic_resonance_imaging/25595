Some patients with schizophrenia appear to have brain abnormalities, including enlarged third and lateral ventricles and reduced volumes of temporal lobe structures. These abnormalities could be attributed to a developmental abnormality or a neurodegenerative process. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a protein that is found primarily in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, has been used as an index of neuronal damage or degeneration. Levels of NSE in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum from 50 patients with acute and chronic schizophrenia were compared with those in normal and neurological control subjects. A double-antibody, solid phase iodinated radioimmunoassay was used to determine NSE levels. There was no evidence of elevated levels in patients with schizophrenia, whereas control subjects with neurological illnesses had increased levels of NSE in CSF. Because NSE is rapidly cleared from CSF, however, elevated levels could have been missed. Unmedicated patients tended to have lower levels than medicated patients.
