Twenty patients with enigmatic knee symptoms were selected for evaluation by both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and office arthroscopy. Office arthroscopy was performed in a standard examination room using a miniature (1.7 mm) fiberoptic arthroscope under local anesthesia. All MRI scans were performed on a state-of-the-art 1.5-T magnet unit, and included specialized cartilage sequences in 7 patients. In 14 patients, 26 areas showed articular cartilage changes by arthroscopy (grade 2-3). Only nine of these areas were detected by MRI (sensitivity 34.6%). There were five false-positive and four false-negative readings of meniscal tears by MRI as compared with office arthroscopy. These results improved when postoperative menisci were excluded. Only one of three anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) disruptions identified by MRI could be verified by arthroscopy. The one posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) disruption was confirmed by both techniques. MRI was superior to arthroscopy in identifying bone contusions, subchondral sclerosis, and medial cruciate ligament (MCL) sprains. Office arthroscopy is an accurate and cost-efficient alternative to MRI in diagnostic evaluation of knee pathology in patients with enigmatic symptomatology.
