We describe how proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MR spectroscopy) was useful in elucidating the diagnosis of galactosemia in an undiagnosed 6-month-old infant. In vivo (1)H-MR spectroscopy of the brain showed a doublet at 3.7 parts per million, which was identified as galactitol (Gal-ol) by in vitro (1)H-MR spectroscopy of the urine. Galactosemia was subsequently confirmed by laboratory tests and treatment was initiated. A follow-up brain MR imaging and (1)H-MR spectroscopy study revealed resolution of white matter lesions and disappearance of Gal-ol peaks.
