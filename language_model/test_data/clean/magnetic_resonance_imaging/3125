We report a pathologically proven case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) with striking asymmetry in abnormal high signal intensity of the basal ganglia on long-repetition-time MRI. Symmetric or asymmetric high signal intensity of the basal ganglia, in the appropriate clinical setting, may be a specific finding of CJD.
