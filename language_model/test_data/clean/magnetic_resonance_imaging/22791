We report a case of fetal nasal glioma diagnosed at 21 weeks of gestation. The glioma appeared as a moderately hypoechoic mass arising from the junction between the medial aspect of the left orbit and the lateral aspect of the nose, and showing no internal vascularization on color and power Doppler ultrasonography. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excluded the possibility of an encephalocele by ruling out underlying bone defects. After an uneventful pregnancy, the nasal glioma was resected without complications at 4 months of age. The differential diagnosis of fetal paranasal facial masses is discussed.
