Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis with stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a rare mitochondrial disorder that affects adults. MELAS syndrome can mimic cerebrovascular disease, encephalitis or toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. The authors reported two patients who presented with auditory symptoms before the onset of encephalopathy and stroke-like episodes. The first patient was a 28 year-old man, who presented with acute sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) followed by headache, left hemiparesis and generalized tonic-clonic seizure. CT scan of the brain showed hypodensity lesion at the tip of right temporooccipital region. Audiogram and brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) showed abnormal conduction of left brainstem auditory pathway. MRI of the brain showed a lesion involving gray and white matters of the right occipital, parietal and temporal lobes. The distribution of the lesions was not compatible with distribution of arterial supply. MRA was normal. The second patient was a 56 year-old woman with a one-year history of hearing loss. The audiogram revealed bilateral SNHL. A few days before admission, her hearing was acutely deteriorated She could not understand a conversation while she could communicate by writing. CT scan of the brain showed hypodensity in both temporal lobes and MRI revealed lesions in the same area. Pure tone audiogram showed moderate SNHL but BAEP was normal. One week later, she developed global dysphasia and generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Both patients had elevated cerebrospinal fluid and serum lactate: pyruvate ratio. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism disclosed A3243G mtDNA mutation in the blood in the first patient and in muscle biopsy in the second patient. Ubiquinone supplement was prescribed The auditory symptoms in combination with stroke-like episode in supratentorium are important clues to diagnose MELAS syndrome.
