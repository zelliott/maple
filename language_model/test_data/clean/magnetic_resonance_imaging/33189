Ventricular enlargement due to a imbalance of the production of cerebrospinal fluid and its absorption can be a symptom of a variety of diseases. The causes are increased production or decreased absorption of cerebrospinal fluid and obstructions to cerebrospinal fluid flow. Treatment requires thorough neuroradiological imaging with high-resolution thin-section magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid flow measurements. Thus, for instance even small membranes causing aqueductal obstruction can be detected and their influence on cerebrospinal fluid flow can be analyzed. The results of neurosurgical therapy, such as ventriculostomy can also be evaluated. This article provides an overview about imaging features as well as clinical and therapeutic aspects of hydrocephalus.
