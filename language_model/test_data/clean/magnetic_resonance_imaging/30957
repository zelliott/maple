Möbius' syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by paralysis of the 7th and other cranial nerves and musculoskeletal abnormalities. We report a patient with Möbius' syndrome associated with arthrogryposis and mega cisterna magna in addition to the classic components of this syndrome. The case is interesting because she developed Wilms' tumor at 21 months of age. To our knowledge, this is the first case of this association reported in the literature.
