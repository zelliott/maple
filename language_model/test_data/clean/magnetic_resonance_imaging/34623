Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary stroke disease linked to chromosome 19 q 12. We report on two families affected by this disease, which is characterised by recurrent subcortical ischaemic strokes, progressive pseudobulbar palsy, and presenile dementia. Neuroimaging revealed multiple deep infarcts and diffuse leukoencephalopathy. Diagnosis of CADASIL based on the typical clinical feature without vascular risk factors, the neuroradiological signs of extensive leukoencephalopathy, and the autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. CADASIL might be an underestimated cause of familial stroke and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hereditary stroke.
