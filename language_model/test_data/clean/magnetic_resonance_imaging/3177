This report presents a case of a ruptured intracranial dermoid accidentally found in a 51-year old patient. The tumour appears as a large lesion located in the posterior fossa. The CT and MRI studies identify fatty material into the CSF spaces providing intraventricular fat-fluid levels. These characteristic findings are indicative of the diagnosis.
