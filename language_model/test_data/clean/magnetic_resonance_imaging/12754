A 3-month-old infant with a digital hemangioma had relative proptosis of the left eye. Ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging showed a retro-orbital mass with features consistent with a capillary hemangioma. Despite the radiographic appearance, however, biopsy findings showed histologically benign tissues of a hamartomatous nature, inconsistent with a capillary hemangioma.
