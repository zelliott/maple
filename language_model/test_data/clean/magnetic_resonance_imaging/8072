We report on a woman with delayed-onset of belly dancer's syndrome 5 months after central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis (CPM/EPM) and severe hyponatriemia. This case demonstrates that basal ganglia lesions in EPM can be the underlying pathoanatomic substrate for the rarely observed belly dancer's syndrome. The sequential appearance of extrapyramidal symptoms might reflect an ongoing but ineffective or deficient remyelination process. The presence of CPM/EPM should be considered in patients with involuntary dyskinesias of the abdominal wall.
