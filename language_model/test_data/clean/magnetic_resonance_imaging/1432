Thirty-two cases of congenital arachnoid cyst (AC), 26 cases of supratentorial, and 6 cases of infratentorial cyst are reported. They were encountered over a period of 9 years. The 26 supratentorial cysts consisted of 21 cases located in the middle fossa, 2 in the frontal, and 3 in the suprasellar. Patients' ages ranged from 7 months to 67 years (mean: 19.3 years), with a male to female ratio of 23:9. The most common symptoms were headache, epileptic seizure, and cranial enlargement. Based on observations between neuroradiological examinations including analysis of the cyst content, and operation, typical AC might be defined as "duplicated arachnoid and its splitting", and it may be said that "there is continuous existence of cerebral structure such as cortex and white matter lying adjacent to AC on MRI". Out of 32 cases, 15 received surgical treatment because of mass effect of AC itself, abnormal dynamics of the AC fluid, and/or increasing sign of ICP. 13 cases had resection of AC outer membrane with craniotomy, and the remaining two had cystoperitoneal shunt. One of the shunting cases complicated subdural hematoma. Surgical treatment was discussed and radical craniotomy rather than a shunt procedure was preferred. Prognosis of all cases was favorable and uneventful.
