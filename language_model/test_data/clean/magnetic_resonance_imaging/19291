A 61-year-old asymptomatic patient presented with a hepatocellular carcinoma and a history of 11 cycles of transarterial chemoembolization. Staging investigations revealed an enlarged hepatic tumour and a right atrial mass.

Computed tomography of chest and abdomen showed a progressive tumour in both hepatic lobes with extension to the inferior vena cava, through the diaphragma and to the right atrium.

The patient received supportive treatment and died 3 months later.

Inspite the incidence of 1-4%, hepatocellular carcinoma with extension to the heart has been diagnosed rarely. Although treatment is limited, early diagnosis by abdominal echography or echocardiography is necessary for the interpretation of cardiogenic symptoms and the prognosis.
