Eleven patients presenting signs and symptoms related to flogistic disease of the right inferior abdominal region were studied with Computed Tomography. Four out of the eleven patients also underwent Magnetic Resonance examination. In 9 patients final diagnosis was correctly reached after surgery and in 1 case diagnosis was made on the basis of endoscopic findings and delayed echographic controls. Among the eleven patient a correct diagnosis was possible on the basis of CT findings in seven of the examined patients; 4 of them were correctly diagnosed as appendicitis; 1 case was diagnosed as Crohn disease; 1 case was a mucocele and 1 case was diagnosed as tubo-ovaric abscess. In 1 case no one diagnostic hypothesis was possible on the basis of CT and MR findings; on surgery the diagnosis was of appendicitis. In 2 cases of surgery proven tubo-ovaric abscesses a diagnosis of appendicitis was done on the basis of CT examination. In one case CT and MR findings were considered to be related to an ovaric tumor; on surgery the correct diagnosis was of post-surgical fibrosis. In 4 cases MR findings confirmed the diagnostic hypothesis reached with CT examination but only in two of them the final diagnosis was correct. In this paper we describe all the CT and MR findings found in each patient.
