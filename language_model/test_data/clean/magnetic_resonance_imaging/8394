Bevacizumab is the first anti-angiogenic agent inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for treatment of patients suffering from cancer. Life-threatening hemoptysis is the most serious adverse effect of bevacizumab. The inhibition of VEGF is a possible mechanism involved in the destruction of normal lung tissue and subsequent hemoptysis. We report a case of bevacizumab-related hemoptysis and associated bronchoscopic findings that were successfully treated with rigid bronchoscopy and laser photocoagulation.
