A 76-year-old woman with a history of migraine presented with worsening headache. Computerized tomography brain scan and magnetic resonance imaging brain scan showed the presence of fat globules in the cerebrospinal fluid space. This appearance was suggestive of ruptured intracranial dermoid. She recovered spontaneously. While headache is a known presentation of ruptured intracranial dermoid, the condition is unusual to present in older people.
