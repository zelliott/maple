Cerebellar hemangioblastomas are unusual benign neoplasms that may go undetected for years. When associated with pregnancy, however, these tumors may undergo rapid expression and promote progression of symptomatology.

A 28-year-old woman with ataxia and left-sided weakness was diagnosed with cerebellar hemangioblastoma in the second trimester of pregnancy following repeated hospital admissions for nausea and vomiting. Surgical removal was uneventful, and she delivered vaginally at term.

Cerebellar hemangioblastomas, although rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent nausea and vomiting when accompanied by an abnormal neurologic examination.
