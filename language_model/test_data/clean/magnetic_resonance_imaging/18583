12 cases of cerebral "venous angioma" are reported; pathological, clinical and radiological features of the lesion are reviewed. "Venous angioma" should be regarded as a developmental anatomic variation of the venous drainage system of the white matter. Its clinical significance is controversial, although it has been reported to cause hemorrhage, seizures, progressive neurological deficits, headaches. The clinical presentation of our patients was variable and, in some of them, dependent also on associated lesions. An hematoma was found in three patients, infarction in one and tumor in one. Angiography, CT and MRI demonstrated the typical appearance of the anomaly. Surgery was performed in one patient harboring a significant cerebellar hematoma and the coexistence of a cavernoma was pathologically confirmed. Venous developmental anomalies are often identified as the source of symptoms due to other conditions, that should be treated independently sparing the anomaly.
