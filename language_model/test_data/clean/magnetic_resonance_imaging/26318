Myxoid chondrosarcoma (MCS) and chondromyxoid fibroma (CMF) are two uncommon myxoid cartilaginous neoplasms with distinct cytologic features, histologic patterns, and immunoprofiles. Because these neoplasms have characteristic biological behaviors and management, their correct diagnosis is crucial to avoid debilitating and unnecessary surgical procedures. We report the imprint cytology (IC) preparation findings along with the differential diagnosis in one case each of myxoid chondrosarcoma and chondromyxoid fibroma of the splenoid sinus and iliac bone, respectively. The two great mimickers for these neoplasms, chordoma and chondrosarcoma, represent difficult diagnostic challenges, especially when MCS and CMF occur in unusual locations. IC in conjunction with the clinical and radiologic findings can provide a rapid preliminary intraoperative diagnostic interpretation which can aid in planning the immediate surgical management, as well as guide specific tissue triage for key ancillary studies such as electron microscopy and cytogenetic analyses. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no cytologic reports of MCS of the sphenoid sinus and CMF of the iliac bone.
