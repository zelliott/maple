To assess the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify morphologic and functional abnormalities associated with transmural anterior and inferior myocardial infarction, 18 patients with anterior myocardial infarcts and 11 patients with inferior myocardial infarcts confirmed by ECG and cine-ventriculography underwent gradient-echo MRI of transverse and short-axis imaging planes. Myocardial perfusion of corresponding imaging planes was measured by 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography (MIBI-SPECT). Transmural scar by MRI was defined as diastolic wall thickness 2.5 SD below corresponding normal values of a healthy control group (n = 21). MIBI-SPECT scar was defined as a MIBI uptake less than 2.5 SD below mean values of a healthy control group (n = 11). By MIBI-SPECT, 231 segments contained normal tissue and 161 contained scarred myocardium. In 352/392 (90%) segments gradings based on diastolic wall thickness and MIBI-SPECT gradings were identical. Diastolic wall thickness was significantly higher in normal than in scarred MIBI-SPECT segments (10.3 +/- 1.5 vs 5.2 +/- 2 mm, p less than 0.0001). Additionally, normal segments by MIBI-SPECT showed significantly higher systolic wall thickening than scar segments (5.5 +/- 1.5 vs 0.6 +/- 1.6 mm, p less than 0.0001). The correlation between MRI and MIBI-SPECT assessed infarct size was r = 0.91 for anterior and r = 0.77 for inferior myocardial infarcts. The agreement between MIBI-SPECT perfusion defect size and regions with reduced diastolic wall thickness on MRI tomograms was significantly better for anterior myocardial infarcts than for inferior myocardial infarcts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
