Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT) is a recently recognized tumor entity with distinctive clinicopathological features and an excellent long-term prognosis. We report 10 cases of DNT out of neurosurgical specimens sent for histopathological examination since 1994. Epilepsy surgery is not done at our center, and all the cases were sent with a clinical diagnosis of glioma. On histopathological examination, all the 10 cases contained the specific glioneuronal element. In 6 cases, glial nodules were noted in addition. This study therefore reports 4 cases of simple DNT and 6 cases of complex DNT. There was no nuclear atypia or mitosis in any of the cases. Proliferative index by PCNA varied from negative to <1%. It is very important to recognize this entity, as surgery cures the patient, and radiotherapy or chemotherapy is not required.
