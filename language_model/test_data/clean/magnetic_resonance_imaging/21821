A developmental chronometry hypothesis of early brain damage is suggested in which regions of the brain with a protracted course of postnatal development will be more vulnerable than earlier maturing areas to deleterious effects of early insult and, therefore, may become common sites of abnormality across many disorders originating in early childhood. Initial investigations of the cerebellum and frontal lobes are presented using MRI and neuropsychological measures. Planimetric measures of the cerebellar vermis (lobuli I-V and VI-VII) and pons, and neuropsychological frontal lobe measures were obtained from high functioning individuals with autism (A), survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with brain sequelae following radiation and chemotherapy, and from rigorously selected healthy controls (C). The neuropsychological results were clustered according to functions commonly related to frontal brain, posterior brain, and left and right hemispheres. The A and ALL groups, as compared to C, yielded modest but consistently reduced MRI measures for vermal lobuli I-V and VI-VII. Hypoplasia of lobuli VI-VII was more marked than I-V. Performance on neuropsychological tests for frontal lobe functions was generally depressed in both groups, with more severe deficits in A. Between-group differences in verbal, visual-spatial, and emotional-social skills are discussed. The cerebellar and frontal brain deficits that are present in both clinical groups (A and ALL) may be common to other developmental and acquired disorders of early childhood. Such joint manifestation of cerebellar and frontal lobe abnormalities is in agreement with the concept of cerebellar significance for the development of higher cognitive functions.
