Precocious puberty resulting from hypothalamic hamartoma is well known. Neurofibromatosis type 1 can also present with precocious puberty. However, hypothalamic hamartoma as the cause of precocious puberty in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 has never been described in the literature. This rare occurrence of these two together in a patient with precocious puberty is reported.
