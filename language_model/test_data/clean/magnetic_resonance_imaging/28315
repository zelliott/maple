Broad-line magnetic resonance imaging using large oscillating field gradients has become a very useful and robust tool in the study of systems with a T2 of order 0.1-1 ms. Its use is illustrated with two examples involving microporous media: the ingress of decane into lightly cross-linked rubber and water transport in compacted zeolite 4A powder beds.
