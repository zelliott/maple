We describe a case of a surgically proven intraosseous venous anomaly of the fibula in a patient who presented with ankle pain and swelling with deep venous thrombosis. MRI, including gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography, provides a less invasive means than conventional venography for diagnosing these lesions and assessing venous patency while also allowing for evaluation of extravascular structures.
