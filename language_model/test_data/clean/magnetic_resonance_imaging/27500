We investigated the use of micro-CT with contrast agent for the characterization of fixed mouse spinal cord as a means to differentiate between gray and white matter. The spinal cords were soaked in a concentration of nonionic iodinated contrast agent for 14 days. Micro-CT was performed and then compared using 11.7T-MRI images and myelin staining. Soaking the spinal cords in contrast agent resulted in clear differences in signal between the gray and white matter at 3 planes. Micro-CT provides more relevant information on mouse spinal cord GM and WM anatomical structures.
