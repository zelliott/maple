Detection of bilateral adrenal masses in any patient often presents a management dilemma. Despite extensive imaging, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), a definite diagnosis may not be reached. We report an unusual case of bilateral adrenal mass diagnosed as histoplasmosis postoperatively and managed successfully by laparoscopy. Focus is placed on the role of laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in such patients.
