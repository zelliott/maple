Foreign accent syndrome occurs rarely after stroke. Most patients with this syndrome develop an aphasia characterized by a new accent. This report presents a 48-year-old man who sustained a left parietal hemorrhagic stroke resulting in right hemiparesis and the inability to speak. As spontaneous speech emerged several weeks later, he was noted to have a Broca's aphasia and a Dutch accent. Analysis of his speech demonstrated final consonant deletion, substitution of "d" for "th" sounds, vowel distortions, additional "uh" syllables added at the end of words, and errors in voicing. This speech pattern has persisted for more than 5 years after the stroke. Elicitation of additional history found that the patient was born in Holland and lived there until the age of 5 years, when he moved to the United States with his family. Before his stroke, he had no foreign accent. This report illustrates the importance of considering foreign accent syndrome during aphasia recovery and suggests several pathogenetic mechanisms that may contribute to the development of this syndrome.
