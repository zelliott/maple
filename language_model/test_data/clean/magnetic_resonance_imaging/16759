To describe imaging findings of cerebral hydatid cysts on computed tomography of brain.

We retrospectively reviewed CT scans of brain in 5 patients with pathologically confirmed hydatid cysts in cerebral hemispheres. The patients were scanned either on a spiral (single slice) CT or on multidetector-row CT before and after intravenous injection of iodinated contrast material.

All the patients were children aged 8 to 13 years with 3 boys and 2 girls. Features of raised intracranial tension were present in all the cases at presentation. CT findings of a large intracerebral cystic lesion with significant mass effect and without any calcification or enhancement were common in all 5 cases. Perilesional edema was present in 1 case. Cerebral hydatid was seen as either a homogenous fluid attenuation unilocular cyst (3 cases) or a unilocular cyst with few peripheral daughter cysts (1 case) or cyst filled by multiple daughter cysts inside (1 case). All the cases were operated and cyst was removed completely after craniotomy.

Accurate preoperative diagnosis of cerebral hydatid by CT followed by surgery with care to avoid cyst rupture can result in favorable outcome.
