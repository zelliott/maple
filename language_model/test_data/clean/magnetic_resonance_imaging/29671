The external anal sphincter (EAS) plays a critical role in maintaining fecal continence; however, cerebral cortical control of voluntary EAS contraction is not completely understood. Our aims were to determine the cortical areas associated with voluntary EAS contraction and to determine the effect of two levels of sphincter contraction effort on brain activity. Seventeen asymptomatic adults (ages 21-48, 9 male) were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect brain activity. Studies were done in two stages. In stage 1 (10 subjects, 5 male), anal sphincter pressure was monitored from a catheter-affixed bag. Subjects performed maximal and submaximal EAS contractions during two fMRI scanning sessions consisting of alternating 10-s intervals of sustained contraction and rest. In stage 2 studies, seven subjects (4 male) performed only maximum effort sphincter contractions without a catheter. EAS contraction was associated with multifocal fMRI activity in sensory/motor, anterior cingulate, prefrontal, parietal, occipital, and insular regions. Total cortical activity volume was significantly larger (P < 0.05) for maximal (5,175 +/- 720 microl) compared with submaximal effort contractions (2,558 +/- 306 microl). Similarly, percent fMRI signal change was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for maximal (4.8 +/- 0.1%) compared with submaximal effort contractions (2.2 +/- 0.1%). Cortical region-of-interest analysis showed the incidence of insular activation to be more common in women compared with men. Other cortical regions showed no such gender differences. fMRI activity detected in stage 2 showed similar regions of cortical activation to those of the stage 1 study. Willful contraction of the EAS is associated with multifocal cerebral cortical activity. The volume and intensity of cerebral cortical activation is commensurate with the level of contractile effort.
