To determine the prognostic value of CT and MRI in AIDS we studied the survival of patients with neurological involvement, in relation to the initial imaging results. Twenty-six initial CT and 15 MRI examinations of 41 patients were reviewed for the presence of cerebral atrophy and/or focal lesions. The mean survival time of patients with initially normal imaging was longer (700 +/- 89 days) than that of patients with isolated cerebral atrophy (326 +/- 65) or isolated focal lesions (202 +/- 97). The shortest survival (78 +/- 44 days) was found in patients with both cerebral atrophy and focal lesions. The risk of death in patients with atrophy alone was 3.6 times higher, that in patients with focal lesions alone 6.4 times higher, and in patients with both changes 19.3 times higher than in patients with initially normal imaging. Cerebral imaging with CT and/or MRI thus allows identification of AIDS-related cerebral changes and may contribute to assessment of prognosis.
