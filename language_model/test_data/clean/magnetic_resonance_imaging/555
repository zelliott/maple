Temporal lobe involvement on neuroimaging is extremely rare in Japanese encephalitis (JE) and isolated temporal lobe involvement on neuroimaging has rarely been described in the literature. With isolated temporal lobe involvement, distinguishing JE from the treatable Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) can be difficult. Both JE and HSE should be considered in patients who present clinically with acute encephalitis and have radiological evidence of temporal lobe involvement, especially in JE endemic areas.
