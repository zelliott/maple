Asymmetry of the planum temporale, a region on the posterosuperior surface of the temporal lobe involved in the production and comprehension of language, is a notable feature of the normal human brain. Several attempts have been made to measure it using both post-mortem and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, but previous approaches made inadequate allowance for the convoluted nature of the structure. The current study used rigorous criteria to define the planum and examined three separate approaches for its measurement on MRI scans. A method involving triangulation of the surface consistently gave larger values for the surface area of the planum, suggesting that this method takes account of the convoluted nature of the structure.
