To determine whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels are associated with the presence of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in patients after acute ischemic stroke.

A cross-sectional study that used blood samples obtained within 24 hours of symptom onset from patients who experienced acute stroke to measure VEGF levels by enzyme immunoassay. A validated CMB rating scale was used to analyze acutely acquired magnetic resonance images, with the rater blind to clinical details and VEGF levels.

Accident and Emergency Department at University College Hospital, London, England.

Twenty patients who experienced acute ischemic stroke.

Presence of CMBs and serum level of VEGF.

Five of the 20 patients with acute ischemic stroke (25%) had CMBs. The median VEGF level in the CMB group was significantly higher than that in the group without CMBs (P = .003).

An increase in vascular permeability secondary to a raised VEGF level may have a role in the genesis of CMBs in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
