A case of paraparesis due to an apophyseal joint cyst is reported. Full recovery occurred following surgical removal of the cyst. A review of the literature found approximately 60 cases of nerve root pain due to a synovial apophyseal joint cyst. Only very few patients had neurological loss. Facet joint cysts must be differentiated from spinal tumors. Computed tomography and above all magnetic resonance imaging provide valuable diagnostic and therapeutic information.
