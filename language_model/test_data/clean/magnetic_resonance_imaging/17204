We report a 39-year-old male who presented non-traumatic testicular swelling and pain. Physical examination and sonography presented a suspicion of testicular tumor and both surgical exploration and inguinal orchiectomy were performed. Hematocele may both clinically and sonographically resemble a testicular tumor. The diagnostic study of choice is magnetic resonance, establishing the diagnosis and differentiating it from neoplasms.
