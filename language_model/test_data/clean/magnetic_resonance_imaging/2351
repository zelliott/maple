Inadvertant intra-arterial injection is a rare complication of sclerotherapy of varicose veins. We report one case of accidental popliteal injection complicated by acute ischemiae of the posterior compartment of the leg who needed fasciotomy and Achillus tendum elongation. There is no practical "step-by-step" guide of these complications and the best treatment is the prevention by respect of contraindications and the injection of sclerosing agent under ultrasonographic control.
