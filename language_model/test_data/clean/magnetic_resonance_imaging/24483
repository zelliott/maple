To explore the presence of functional connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during the manipulation of attentional network test (ANT) and its relationship with behavioral performance.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 25 healthy subjects aged 17 - 20 years. And ANT was used as a paradigm. Functional connectivity between ACC-DLPFC was tested and correlation analysis conducted between functional connectivity coefficients and behavioral scores of ANT.

Significant functional connectivity between the dorsal ACC (dACC) with bilateral DLPFC was found. Furthermore, event-related functional connectivity coefficients between left dACC and left DLPFC were negatively associated with the behavioral scores of executive control (r = -0.63; P < 0.01).

Our findings provide new evidence that ACC and DLPFC are functionally connected and such functional connectivity has advantageous influence on executive control function of attention so as to contribute to our understanding of the integrated role of these brain regions in attentional network.
