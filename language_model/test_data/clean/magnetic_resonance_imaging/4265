Seminal vesicle cysts with ureteral ectopy and ipsilateral renal agenesis or dysplasia are rare congenital malformations. This study reports 7 consecutive cases in a single center and, for the first time in the literature, reports long-term results on 5 cases. Patients were between the age of 15 and 57 years. The malformation was diagnosed in all cases with excretory urography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and cystoscopy. 5 patients were followed after diagnosis for 26 to 119 months (mean 52 months). Only 2 of 7 patients primarily presented with nonspecific lower urinary tract symptoms. One patient (15 years old) showed significant enlargement of the cysts with compression of the urinary bladder and signs of urinary incontinence 10 years after primary diagnosis. The other 4 patients had no changes of their malformation. In conclusion, seminal vesicle cysts with ipsilateral renal agenesis are now more frequently diagnosed because of the increasing use of sectional imaging procedures. They are mostly asymptomatic and their morphology does not change with time. These data support the concept of only treating symptomatic patients.
