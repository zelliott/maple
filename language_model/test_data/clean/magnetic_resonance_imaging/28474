Progressive clumsiness developed in the right hand of a 33-year-old man, became bilateral and evolved very slowly for ten years. Another neurological deficit was restricted to a slight impairment of superficial sensations. Magnetic resonance imaging verified an atrophy of bilateral parietal lobes. The cerebral blood flow was markedly decreased in the atrophic area. Pure clumsiness of a very slowly progressive course due to parietal atrophy has never been reported in such a young adult. This clinical picture may suggest another variety of degenerative process.
