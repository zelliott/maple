Colo-uterine fistula of diverticular origin is an extremely rare disease due to the resistance of uterine tissue. Methods for diagnosis remain to be established. Non-invasive imaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help to establish a proper diagnosis, but confirmation may be reached by diagnostic hysteroscopy or even surgical exploration. We report a 78-year-old female who presented with continuous dull aching pain associated with increasing constipation. MRI suspected a fistula between the posterior aspect of the uterine body and the sigmoid colon which contained extensive diverticulosis. Hysteroscopy confirmed the fistulous opening, but colonoscopy confirmed diverticular disease with no evidence of malignancy. The patient had en block surgical treatment of the uterus and the adjacent colon, followed by an uneventful recovery. The sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive imaging procedures to diagnose such cases remain to be established. As imaging procedures cannot rule out neoplasia, endoscopic procedures need to be added.
