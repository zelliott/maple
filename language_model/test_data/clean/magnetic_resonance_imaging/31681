Manual asymmetries in limb kinematics and eye-hand coordination have usually been attributed to differences in online processing capabilities between the left and the right cerebral hemisphere. In the present fMRI experiment, we examined in right handers the brain areas involved in eye-hand coordination with either the left or the right hand. Although temporal and spatial accuracy was equal for left- and right-hand movements, manual asymmetries were found in behavioral and neurophysiologic data, suggesting an asymmetric mode of control for left vs. right eye-hand coordination. For left eye-hand coordination, peak velocity and saccade completion occurred earlier than for the contralateral movements, suggesting that there was more time needed for homing-in on the target. When using the right hand, there was more activation in occipital areas. This might indicate a more intense visual processing or visualization of the target locations. When using the left hand, there was more activation in sensorimotor areas, frontal areas and cerebellum. This might point toward more processing effort. Left-hand movements may be considered as more difficult than right-hand movements by right-handed participants. Alternatively and more likely, these findings might reflect a difference in attention or resources attributed to different aspects of the tasks because of the different functional specializations of both hand/hemisphere systems.
