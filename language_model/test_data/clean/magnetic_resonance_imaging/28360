A newborn with a rare type of lissencephaly is reported, characterized by extreme cerebral and cerebellar hypoplasia. The diagnosis was made by postmortem magnetic resonance imaging, indicating the value of such studies to evaluate neuronal migration disorders in patients in whom autopsy cannot be performed. Two earlier described microlissencephaly syndromes, the "Barth" and "McComb" type, are reviewed.
