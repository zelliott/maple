Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems are becoming essential intraoperative tools in neurosurgery because they provide high-resolution, detailed images. Only a few institutions around the world currently have intraoperative MRI capabilities. Consequently, the body of knowledge with regard to safety procedures in such an environment is fragmented and often institution-specific. The components of the MRI system are described in relationship to surgical procedures. Perioperative nursing responsibilities are discussed and a case study is presented. The article concludes with a discussion about the present limitations of intraoperative MRI equipment.
