Myelitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome occurring concurrently after varicella infection is very rare. A 34-year-old man presented with progressive flaccid tetraparesis, facial palsy, respiratory failure, sensory loss and urinary incontinence one week after varicella infection. Clinical, imaging and electrodiagnostic studies supported the diagnosis of myelitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. He improved with intravenous acyclovir and gammaglobulin.
