The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcome of facial nerve neuromas in children. To date, no specific study has focused on children, and the management of these tumors is not codified.

A review of case series treated in a tertiary care center of pediatric otolaryngology.

The treatment and outcomes for 7 children (4 infants and 3 adolescents) were analyzed.

Six patients underwent complete removal of tumor and immediate restoration of the nerve continuity. The grade of facial palsy improved in 4 of the 6 children, but did not get better than grade 3 (House classification). The remaining patient was managed conservatively and remained stable clinically and radiologically after 9 years follow-up.

These findings support the reasonable strategy of combining conservative assessment of these slow-growing tumors with regular clinical and radiologic evaluations and radical surgery using various procedures. The choice depends on the age of the child, the extent and growth rate of the tumor, the grade of facial palsy, and the hearing function.
