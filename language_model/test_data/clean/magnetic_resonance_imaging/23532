Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is one of the most commonly used imaging modality for evaluating patients with joint pain. Musculoskeletal MR protocols at most institutions consist of 2-dimensional fast spin echo (FSE) sequences repeated in multiple planes. Three-dimensional sequences have also been used to evaluate the musculoskeletal system and have many potential advantages over 2-dimensional FSE sequences. Three-dimensional sequences acquire thin continuous slices through joints with high in-plane spatial resolution, which minimize the effects of partial volume averaging. Newly developed 3-dimensional isotropic resolution sequences can also be used to create high-quality multiplanar reformat images that allow joints to be evaluated in any orientation after a single acquisition. Preliminary results on the use of 3-dimensional isotropic resolution sequences for evaluating the musculoskeletal system are encouraging. However, additional studies are needed to document the advantages of 3-dimensional sequences before they can replace currently used 2-dimensional FSE sequences for evaluating the musculoskeletal system in clinical practice.
