Oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) is an autosomal dominant disorder involving eye and face abnormalities, syndactyly, and enamel hypoplasia. Some individuals with ODDD also have spastic paraparesis. Previously, we reported on a woman with sporadic ODDD and progressive neurologic dysfunction who had cerebral white matter abnormalities demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We now describe a 2-generation family with ODDD and progressive paraparesis associated with leukodystrophic changes documented by MRI. This family represents one of the largest pedigrees with ODDD described so far. The presence of abnormal white matter changes in both sporadic and inherited forms of ODDD suggests that the phenotype of ODDD should be expanded to include spastic paraparesis.
