A patient with AL (amyloid light chain) amyloidosis was investigated in liver and brain by localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Liver spectra of the patient were characterized by small line widths, a striking increase of trimethylammonium compounds, and the presence of a further resonance at 3.8 ppm. None of the healthy control subjects showed trimethylammonium levels of comparable intensity. In the brain, the intensities of amino acids was relatively increased in white matter, whereas the concentration of choline, creatine, and N-acetyl-aspartate were reduced.
