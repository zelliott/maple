To review the clinical features and management of patients with intraorbital foreign bodies.

Noncomparative interventional case series.

Forty patients seen at two regional orbital surgery departments with intraorbital foreign bodies were reviewed.

Visual acuity, surgical interventions, and complications.

Seventy-three percent of patients were younger than 30 years old. There were 22 metallic, inorganic; 5 nonmetallic, inorganic; and 13 organic intraorbital foreign bodies (IOrbFb) in this series. Thirty patients were seen at the time of injury, and 10 patients were seen in a delayed setting with orbital complications. Thirty-four patients had surgical removal of their IOrbFb either because of complications or easy surgical access. Six patients had no surgery because of posteriorly located inorganic foreign bodies. Thirteen patients had resultant blind eyes; 12 of these were blind from the initial trauma.

Loss of vision in conjunction with IOrbFbs is usually a result of the initial trauma. All patients should have antibiotic therapy because of the high incidence of secondary orbital infections. Computed tomography is the best initial mode of imaging. Surgical removal is indicated for all organic IOrbFbs. Inorganic IOrbFbs should be removed if causing complications or if located anteriorly after discussion of potential surgical complications with the patient. Posteriorly located inorganic IOrbFbs should be left alone, unless they are causing significant orbital complications.
