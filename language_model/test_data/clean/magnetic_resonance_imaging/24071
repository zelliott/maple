Bipartite scaphoid has long been debated, and is of traumatic origin for some authors or congenital for others. The aim of the study is to distinguish clinical and radiographic criteria for the diagnosis of congenital bipartite scaphoid.

A case of bilateral bipartite scaphoid is presented. To distinguish pseudarthrosis from congenital bipartite scaphoid we used, the revised carpal height ratio of Nattrass, the CT, and magnetic resonance imaging.

These examinations showed no collapse and they revealed evidence of articular cartilage around the fragments with the same thickness in all the carpus.

We believe that congenital origin is more probable but we recommend to follow the patient, with yearly standard wrist radiograph and use, the revised carpal height ratio of Nattrass to research a carpal shift or collapse.
