In this fMRI study, we looked for the regions supporting interaction between cortical arousal and attention during three conditions: detection, observation, and rest. Arousal measurements were obtained from the EEG low-frequency (LF) power (5-9.5 Hz) recorded continuously together with fMRI. Whatever the condition, arousal was positively correlated with the fMRI signal of the right dorsal-lateral prefrontal and superior parietal cortices, closely overlapping regions involved in the maintenance of attention. Although the inferior temporal areas also presented a correlation with arousal during detection, path analysis suggests that this influence may be indirect, through the top-down influence of the previously mentioned network. However, those visual-processing areas could account for the correlation between arousal and performances. Lastly, the medial frontal cortex, frontal opercula, and thalamus were inversely correlated with arousal but only during detection and observation so that they could account for the control of arousal.
