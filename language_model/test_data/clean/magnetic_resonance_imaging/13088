We present a case of a 55-year-old male diagnosed with glioblastoma (GB) involving the left frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes that developed aggression and committed a violent act against his wife. Aggression and violence have rarely been presented in the neuro-oncology literature, but have been well documented in stroke and dementia literature. We discuss the case along with the ethical principles as well as best management practices that may have been employed. As our therapies improve overall survival in brain tumors, aggression is an important behavior that the field must acknowledge.
