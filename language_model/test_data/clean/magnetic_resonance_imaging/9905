Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a malignant mesenchymal tumour, predominantly found in the deep soft tissues of lower extremities, whereas only 3% occur in the head and neck region. Primary synovial sarcoma of the parotid gland is exceptionally uncommon. This is a report of a 15-year-old boy with a synovial sarcoma arising in the parotid gland, and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest patient on record. The patient was treated primarily surgically, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Two years after this multimodal therapy, the patient is without signs of loco-regional recurrence or distant metastases. This paper highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the diagnosis and treatment of this very rare entity.
