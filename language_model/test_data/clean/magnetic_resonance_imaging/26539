Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the anal canal was retrospectively evaluated during a three year period in 67 patients with suspected perianal fistulae. In six cases the surgeon, who knew the results of the MRI, found a fistula not seen on MRI while MRI showed a fistula in one patient which could not be found at surgery. We recommend MRI in cases where an experienced surgeon has difficulties mapping the fistula tract.
