Primary malignant tumors of the pulmonary arteries occur infrequently. The clinical presentation and diagnostic imaging features of the tumor are usually nonspecific and correct diagnosis is often delayed. In this report, we present a case of pulmonary artery sarcoma. MRI and PET-CT were found to be useful for differentiating the tumor from a thromboembolism.
