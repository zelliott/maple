To investigate the acute effects on the central nervous system (CNS) of (56)Fe radiation, a component of high-energy charged particles (HZE) in space radiation, using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) noninvasively.

Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to whole-brain (56)Fe (0, 1, 2, and 4 Gy). At 1 week postirradiation, MRI scans were made using T2-weighted (T2WI), diffusion-weighted (DWI), and contrast enhanced T1-(CET1) imaging. T2 relaxation time and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were obtained from memory-related brain regions of interest (ROIs). Histopathology was correlated using ex vivo tissues.

No overt abnormalities were visualized using T2WI and DWI at 1 week postradiation. CET1 values did not differ significantly between the irradiated and control animals. Compared to 0 Gy, there were significant prolongations in T2 values and reductions in ADC after irradiation. In the absence of evident neuronal pathology, immunohistochemistry revealed astrocytic activation in 4 Gy animals.

At 1 week after whole-brain (56)Fe exposure, T2 and ADC values can differentiate radiosensitivity in regions critical for hippocampal-related memory. MRI may provide noninvasive assessment of the initial molecular/cellular disturbances in vivo after HZE irradiation.
