We present a case of primary testicular amyloidosis mimicking tumor in a cryptorchid testis. Examination revealed the absence of a palpable testis in the left hemiscrotum. The laboratory evaluation showed azoospermia and a low testosterone level. The radiologic investigation demonstrated a heterogeneous left inguinal mass suspicious for tumor in a cryptorchid testis. After radical orchiectomy, the histologic evaluation revealed primary amyloidosis of the testis. The pathogenesis and clinical presentation of testicular amyloidosis are reviewed.
