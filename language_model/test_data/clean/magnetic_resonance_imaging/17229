We report on a rare case of secondary chronic osteomyelitis of the left condyle. Haemophilus aphrophilus could be isolated from the abscess material. The condyle was resected and reconstructed with an endoprosthesis in the same operation.

Possible causes of the rare location of secondary chronic osteomyelitis are assembled in a review of the literature and compared with the actual case.

We suggest the inoculation of microorganisms through the needle of a local anesthetic injection, bacterial contamination during the tooth extraction, or bacteremia following the dental extraction to be possible causes for the infection.
