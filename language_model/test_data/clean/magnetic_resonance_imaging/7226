We describe the case of a 59-year-old man who presented with headaches suggestive of raised intracranial pressure. He had a normal computerised tomographic (CT) scan on two occasions over a period of two months during which time he continued to deteriorate. Eventually, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed the presence of bilateral subdural haematomas. This case thus illustrates that normal CT scans may not exclude an intracranial pathology--and, if in doubt, an MRI scan should be sought.
