To assess the state of the art of fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in China.

Both Chinese and English language literatures were searched in the databases of PUBMED (1998-2005) and CNKI (1998-2005), 41 published articles about fetal MRI were selected.

Fetal MRI can serve as an adjunct tool for ultrasonography because of its excellent soft tissue contrast, high spatial resolution, multiplanar capabilities, large field of view and simultaneous visualization of fetal and maternal structures. Since the development of ultrafast MRI sequences provides faster scan time and avoids motion artifacts, it is widely applied in detecting normal or abnormal fetal development, including the central nervous system, thoracic region, abdomen and others. In China, experience in fetal MRI has been scanty, but the technique will be extensively used in the near future because of its multi-faceted advantages.

Compared with ultrasonography, MRI as a complementary imaging for fetal screening is prospective in China or other parts of the world because of its multiple superiorities.
