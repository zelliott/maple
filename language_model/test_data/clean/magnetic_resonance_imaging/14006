To optimize direct magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography by determining the effect of dilution of gadolinium in iodinated contrast, saline, or albumin on T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and gradient-recalled echo (GRE) images, and the effect of scanner field strength.

Gadopentetate dimeglumine was diluted into normal saline, albumin, or iodinated contrast (0.625 mmol/liter to 40 mmol/liter). Samples were scanned at 1.5T and 0.2T. Signal intensity was measured using T1-weighted spin-echo (SE), T2-weighted SE, and two- and three-dimensional GRE (20 degrees-75 degrees flip angle) sequences. Graphical analysis of signal intensity vs. gadolinium concentration was performed.

Albumin had no effect on gadolinium contrast. Dilution of gadolinium in iodinated contrast decreased signal intensity on all sequences compared to samples of identical concentration diluted in saline at both 1.5T and 0.2T: with a 2 mmol/liter gadolinium solution at 1.5T, signal was decreased by 26.1% on T1-weighted images, 31.7% on GRE20 images, and 28.9% on GRE45 images, and the T2 value decreased by 71.1%; at 0.2T, signal was decreased by 23.5% on T1-weighted images. On all sequences, the peak signal shifted to the left (lower gadolinium concentration) when diluted in iodinated contrast. Peak signal was also seen at different gadolinium concentrations on different sequences and field strength: at 1.5T, peak in saline/iodine was 2.5/0.625 mmol/liter on T1-weighted images, and 2.5/1.25 mmol/liter on GRE20 and GRE45 sequences. At 0.2T, peak in saline/iodine was 0.625-2.5/1.25 mmol/liter on T1-weighted images, 0.625-2.5/1.25 on GRE45 images, 2.5-10.0/1.25-5.0 mmol/liter on GRE65 images, and 1.25-5.0/0.625-1.25 mmol/liter on GRE75 images.

Dilution of gadolinium in iodinated contrast results in decreased signal on T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and GRE images compared to dilution in saline or albuminfor both 1.5-T and 0.2-T scanners; if gadolinium is diluted in iodinated contrast for MR arthrography, a lower concentration should be used because the peak is shifted to the left. The use of iodinated contrast should be minimized, as it may diminish enhancement and lower the sensitivity and specificity of MR arthrography. Optimal gadolinium concentration for MR arthrography is dependent on scanner field strength and a broader range of gadolinium concentration can be used to provide maximal signal at low field strength.
