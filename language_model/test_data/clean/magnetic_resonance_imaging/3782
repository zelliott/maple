This article provides an overview of the technical considerations of endoscopy of the posterolateral skull base and cerebellopontine angle (CPA). Specific areas of focus are on the instrumentation requirements for neuroendoscopy of the CPA; the learning curve associated with this technique; and a complete description of the surgical techniques necessary to perform the procedure, along with outcomes and results. The article provides a general overview of the endoscopic approach to the CPA. For a variety of pathologies, the emphasis is on performing this technique for acoustic tumors and hearing preservation. Insights as to how the author's practice evolved in its use of neuroendoscopic procedures are provided.
