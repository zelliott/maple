Magnetic resonance imaging can visualize the soft tissue and the bone marrow of the hand. High spatial resolution requires the use of a surface coil. Signal-to-noise contrast was measured and compared for 3 different coils. Optimal results were obtained with a surface coil with a diameter of 8.5 cm. The wrist and the fingers of 10 volunteers each were examined. Images with a high spatial resolution and a good signal/noise contrast were obtained, enabling the delineation of small structures like Gynon's channel and the median nerve.
