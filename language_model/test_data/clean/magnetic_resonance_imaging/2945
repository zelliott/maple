Theoretically, the degree of contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance (MR) is affected by magnetic field strength. The authors conducted this study to compare the degree of MR contrast enhancement between 0.5 Tesla (T) and 2.0 T in VX carcinomas of rabbits.

In 12 rabbits with VX2 tumors, both 0.5 T and 2.0 T MR imaging was performed within 1 day before and after intravenous injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Each rabbit received an initial standard dose (0.1 mmol/KG) followed by and additional standard dose (total, double dose) during the MR study at each field strength. The degree of contrast enhancement in the VX2 tumors was assessed quantitatively.

With standard and double dose studies, overall mean tumor and muscle contrast-to-noise ratio was higher at 2.0 T than 0.5 T by 95% and 81%, respectively. The double dose study showed higher contrast-to-noise ratio than the standard dose study at both field strengths.

Results indicate that the effect of contrast enhancement increases with field strength.
