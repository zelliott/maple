In a non-randomized retrospective study n = 36 prolactinoma patients (n = 7 micro- and n = 29 macroadenomas) were evaluated before (E0), 4 (E1) and 52 weeks (E2) after applying 3 different treatment modalities: A dopamine agonist (DA) therapy (n = 14), B surgery as initial procedure (n = 12) and oral DA therapy, C DA preinjection, subsequent surgery (n = 10) and oral DA medication. T0 outline the effect of the 3 regimens upon serum prolactin (PRL) and tumour size reduction, clinical signs and symptoms, anterior/posterior pituitary lobe function and MRI/CT findings were evaluated in each patient at E0, E1 and E2. In group A, PRL normalization was achieved in n = 10 patients (71%), although the frequency of an empty sella was only one out of 12 macroprolactinoma patients (less than 10%). Patients of group C showed the lowest PRLE2 levels (32 +/- 11 ng/ml, normalization rate 60%), although not statistically significant when compared with the other groups (A: 41 +/- 28 ng/ml, B: 114 +/- 33 ng/ml, normalization rate 31%). According to MRI studies in groups B and C total removal was achieved in 33% and 50% of macroprolactinomas, respectively. The most favourable ratio of the leading pre/posttreatment signs and symptoms was observed in patients of group C. It was concluded that no superiority of either treatment regimen exists for prolactinoma patients. Each mode of therapy has its own benefits which may be applied to the different biological behaviour of a prolactinoma in the respective patient.
