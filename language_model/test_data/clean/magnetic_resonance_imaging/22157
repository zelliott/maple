A 78-year-old woman is described who presented with a diaphragmatic hernia through the foramen of Morgagni. A definitive diagnosis was confirmed by a sagittal view on magnetic resonance imaging prior to surgery. The hernia was repaired laparoscopically under an abdominal wall lifting technique without pneumoperitoneum, and her symptoms completely resolved postoperatively with no evidence of recurrence. The laparoscopic repair was considered a suitable and safe procedure for the treatment of a Morgagni hernia.
