We report 2 cases of uncommon osteoid osteoma in 2 children; they occurred at an exceptional age: 18 months and 2.5 years. They have also original location at the intramedullary diaphyseal tibial shaft. Osteoid osteoma is divided into cortical, medullary and subperiosteal location. Cortical osteoid osteoma is accompanied by intense reactive bone sclerosis, but medullary and subperiosteal types are associated with mild or non reactive bone sclerosis. In our cases, osteoid osteoma were associated with intense reactive bone sclerosis as noted in the cortical form.
