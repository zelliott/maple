We hypothesized that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans taken prior to radiosynoviorthesis may be predictive of response to the procedure in persons with haemophilia. Specifically, response would be inversely related to the severity of synovial hyperplasia. Radiosynoviorthesis was administered to 21 joints with recurrent haemorrhage (target joints). A detailed self-report of haemorrhage history, joint evaluation with scoring according to the World Federation of Haemophilia orthopaedic joint and pain scales, plain radiographs, and MRI studies of the joints were performed pre- and post-radiosynoviorthesis. To augment comparison of the MRI findings to those assessed using the Arnold-Hilgartner and Pettersson scales, a provisional MRI scale for evaluation of haemophilic arthropathy was designed. We found the MRI findings prior to the procedure were not predictive of clinical response; independent of the severity of synovial hyperplasia, most joints bled less and showed improvement by the WFH orthopaedic score. There was generally no change in the severity of synovial hyperplasia after the procedure. We conclude that MRI evaluation is not routinely indicated prior to radiosynoviorthesis.
