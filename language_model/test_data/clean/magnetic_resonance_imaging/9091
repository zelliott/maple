Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) of the breast is a rare malignant tumor, and its preoperative diagnosis is extremely difficult. Local recurrence of DFSP is frequent after incomplete resection because of either false diagnosis or inadequate standard surgical excision. We present a case of DFSP that showed disconcordant results using different imaging modalities, suggesting that the MRI finding of subcutaneously located highly vascular tumor with suspicious kinetics but together with negative Cho peak on (1H) MRS, might be suggestive of the diagnosis of DFSP.
