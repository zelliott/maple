Magnetic resonance (MR) images of five patients with acute tibial plateau fractures are presented and correlated with both clinical examination and findings at surgical intervention. The role of MR imaging in the evaluation of both osseous and soft tissue deformity in acute trauma, specifically in patients with tibial plateau fractures is discussed. The value of MR imaging as an alternative to computed tomography and arthroscopic evaluation of these patients is emphasized.
