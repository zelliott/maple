SUNCT has been reported in association with abnormalities of the brainstem and pituitary region. We present a patient with a history of left optic nerve hypoplasia, mild hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and SUNCT starting in adolescence. SUNCT with an early age of onset may be associated with congenital abnormality of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.
