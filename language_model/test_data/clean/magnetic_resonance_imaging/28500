We report the case of a 58-year-old man hospitalized for generalized seizures. A grade II glioma of the left frontotemporal region was diagnosed on brain CT scan and stereotaxic biopsy results. Radiotherapy was successful in treating this glioma. A glomus tumor of the left carotid was discovered by duplex Doppler examination of the carotid and confirmed on arteriography. Resection was performed to the adventitia. Branchial glomus tumors are rare, often benign tumors. The carotid is a common localization. Surgery is often indicated due to the risk of local invasion. Surgical procedure varies according to the size and localization of the tumor. This case demonstrates that glomus tumor of the carotid can coexist with a frontotemporal glioma.
