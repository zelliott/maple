A previously well 10-month-old infant boy presented with a large hepatic tumor. Its sonographic and computed tomographic appearances were similar to those reportedly found in mesenchymal hamartomas. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed a multiseptated mass with fluid-filled compartments and some displacement of major intra-abdominal vessels. This appears to be the first report of MR imaging of a mesenchymal hamartoma.
