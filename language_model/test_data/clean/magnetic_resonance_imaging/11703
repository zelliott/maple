The reported case was a patient with tumour situated in the region of the corpus callosum, with symptoms diagnosed initially as affective syndrome and later on as paranoid syndrome. With this diagnosis he was treated for 12 years in psychiatric out-patient clinics and hospitals with antidepressants and and neuroleptics. Brain imaging (CT and MRI) performed only after an epileptic seizure demonstrated a tumour in the anterior part of the corpus callosum with a broad oedema area. Neuropsychological examination revealed disturbances of emotional-motivation processes and defects in cognitive functions. Following surgical treatment only a slight improvement of functioning was noted. Histological diagnosis (PNET) suggested that the tumour was expanding during many years. Much earlier diagnosis with neurosurgical intervention could result in a better therapeutic effect.
