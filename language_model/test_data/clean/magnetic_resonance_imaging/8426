A 72-year-old female presented with a lump in the left superior-lateral eyelid. The magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-delineated mass in the left lacrimal gland. The tumor was isointense on both the T1 and T2 weighted images, and it was homogenously enhanced with Gd-DTPA. Surgery via the trans-cranial approach revealed a pinkish and elastic-hard tumor. Total resection was successfully performed. The hematoxilyn-eosin staining of the surgical specimen showed a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, which were composed predominantly of small lymphocytes, centrocyte-like cells, monocytoid cells, and occasionally transformed lymphocytes. The immunohistochemical findings for CD20, CD3, UCHL-1, CD23, CD5, cyclinD1, and bcl-2 were compatible with Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT)-type lymphoma. The patient received local radiation therapy (30 Gy/15 fractions). She remained in complete clinical remission of the disease about one and a half years after treatment.
