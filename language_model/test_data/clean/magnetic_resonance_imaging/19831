Soft tissue sarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors that arise from mesenchymal tissues. The majority of these tumors arise on the extremity or trunk. Despite their rarity, soft tissue sarcomas continue to generate vigorous academic interest, and as a result, the ever-expanding medical literature dealing with sarcomas continues to grow. Many general surgeons will see few of these tumors during their careers, and a review of the current literature and how it applies to patients afflicted with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk is warranted.
