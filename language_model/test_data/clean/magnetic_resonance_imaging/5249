White matter changes (WMC) and microbleeds (MBs) are common in the elderly and in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

To describe the prevalence, anatomical distribution and longitudinal changes of WMC and MBs in normal aging subjects compared to AD patients and to describe current evidence of their effects on the clinical course of AD.

Short literature review.

WMC and MBs are more frequent and progress more rapidly in AD patients than in cognitively normal elderly. New MBs occur in up to one quarter of AD cases without any therapeutic intervention. WMC and MBs influence the clinical course of AD.

WMC and MBs might represent treatment targets in clinical trials on AD.
