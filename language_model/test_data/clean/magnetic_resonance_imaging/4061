A 50-year-old male presented with a choroid plexus papilloma in the foramen magnum manifesting as dysesthesia in the right hand and severe headache. Magnetic resonance imaging clearly showed that the tumor was located in the cerebellomedullary cistern, without extension into the fourth ventricle. However, differentiation from hemangioblastoma or foramen magnum tumor was difficult by neuroimaging. Intraoperative observation found the tumor was located extraventricularly and attached to the choroid plexus of the foramen of Magendie. The tumor was grossly totally resected. Histological examination proved the tumor was a choroid plexus papilloma without malignancy. His neurological deficits resolved almost completely.
