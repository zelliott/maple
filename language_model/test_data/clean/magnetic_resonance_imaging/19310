Recent technical advances in MR imaging have led to several new applications in psychiatric imaging. There is a renewed interest in the further elucidation of the etiopathogenesis of some psychiatric disorders and clinical-radiological correlations are increasingly reported. Volume measurements are frequently used and in the near future, functional MR imaging carries high expectations. A brief survey is given of the recent applications of these new techniques in schizophrenia, affective disorders, dementia, anorexia nervosa, and other less common disorders.
