We previously reported large-scale reorganization of visual processing (i.e., activation of "foveal" cortex by peripheral stimuli) in two individuals with loss of foveal input from macular degeneration [Baker, C.I., Peli, E., Knouf, N., & Kanwisher, N. G. (2005). Reorganization of visual processing in macular degeneration. Journal of Neuroscience, 25(3), 614-618]. Here, we replicate this result in three new individuals. Further, we test the hypothesis that this reorganization is dependent on complete loss of foveal input. In two other individuals with extensive retinal lesions but some foveal sparing we found no evidence for reorganization. We conclude that large-scale reorganization of visual processing in MD occurs only in the complete absence of functional foveal vision.
