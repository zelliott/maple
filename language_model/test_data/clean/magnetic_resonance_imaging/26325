After successful percutaneous coronary arterial revascularization, 25% to 60% of subjects have restenosis, a recurrent coronary arterial narrowing at the site of the intervention. At present, restenosis is usually detected invasively with contrast coronary angiography. This study was performed to determine if phase-contrast MRI (PC-MRI) could be used to detect restenosis noninvasively in patients with recurrent chest pain after percutaneous revascularization.

Seventeen patients (15 men, 2 women, age 36 to 77 years) with recurrent chest pain >3 months after successful percutaneous intervention underwent PC-MRI measurements of coronary artery flow reserve followed by assessments of stenosis severity with computer-assisted quantitative coronary angiography. The intervention was performed in the left anterior descending coronary artery in 15 patients, one of its diagonal branches in 2 patients, and the right coronary artery in 1 patient. A PC-MRI coronary flow reserve value </=2.0 was 100% and 82% sensitive and 89% and 100% specific for detecting a luminal diameter narrowing of >/=70% and >/=50%, respectively.

Assessments of coronary flow reserve with PC-MRI can be used to identify flow-limiting stenoses (luminal diameter narrowings >70%) in patients with recurrent chest pain in the months after a successful percutaneous intervention.
