Thoracic tumors have been infrequently reported as a complication of neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1). To determine the prevalence and clinical features of thoracic tumors seen in children with NF1, we reviewed medical records and imaging studies for a group of 260 pediatric patients with NF1 followed in a multidisciplinary NF Center. Extrapleural thoracic tumors were seen in nine patients with NF1, corresponding to a prevalence of 3.5% in this hospital-based series of patients. Pathological studies of the tumors demonstrated plexiform neurofibroma in four cases and neurofibrosarcoma in one case. The remaining four cases were suspected to be plexiform neurofibroma based on clinical features but have not been confirmed histologically. Three patients presented with symptoms of chest pain, syncope, or wheezing; six patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis of the tumors. Physical findings frequently found in patients with thoracic tumors were scoliosis (especially focal scoliosis) and visible plexiform neurofibromas of the neck. We conclude that NF1 patients presenting with any of these signs and symptoms should be screened for thoracic tumors with chest X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging as needed. It is unknown whether screening asymptomatic NF1 patients with chest X-rays on a regular basis will result in an improved outcome.
