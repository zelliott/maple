Sequential spin-echo spin-warp MRI pulse sequences have been used to study soil-water transport processes including infiltration, redistribution, and drainage of water in soil columns. Those images provide a means for monitoring and quantifying spatial and temporal changes of soil-water distributions and the movement of wetting fronts. In addition, temporal-geometric changes of unstable wetting fronts during water redistribution were estimated from 2D images and the temporal development of the longest length of finger was described by a fractal relation t approximately L1.38. Bulk dispersion-time-dependent displacement and velocity spectra, as well as 2D maps of flow velocities and dispersion coefficients in soil macropores during saturated steady-state flow, were reconstructed from data obtained using the alternating-pulsed-field-gradient (APFG) pulse sequences.
