In this paper, we frame the strategy and motivations behind developments in statistical parametric mapping (SPM) for the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) data. This work deals specifically with SPM procedures for the analysis of event-related potentials (ERP). We place these developments in the larger context of integrating electrophysiological and hemodynamic measurements of evoked brain responses through the fusion of EEG and fMRI data. In this paper, we consider some fundamental issues when selecting an appropriate statistical model that enables diverse questions to be asked of the data and at the same time retains maximum sensitivity. The three key issues addressed in this paper are as follows: (i) should multivariate or mass univariate analyses be adopted, (ii) should time be treated as an experimental factor or as a dimension of the measured response variable, and (iii) how to form appropriate explanatory variables in a hierarchical observation model. We review the relative merits of the different options and explain the rationale for our choices. In brief, we motivate a mass univariate approach in terms of sensitivity to region-specific responses. This involves modeling responses at each voxel or space bin separately. In contradistinction, we treat time as an experimental factor to enable inferences about temporally distributed responses that encompass multiple time bins. In a companion paper, we develop statistical models of ERPs in the time domain that follow from the heuristics established here and illustrate the approach using simulated and real data.
