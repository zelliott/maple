To evaluate the accuracy of the acoustic reflection (AR) technique for determination of nasal cavity cross-sectional areas, the area-distance function of both sides of the nose was determined in 10 subjects and compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Interindividual variation for the correlation between MRI and AR was seen, but in general the areas from 1 to 6 cm into the nasal cavity measured by AR were larger than areas measured by MRI, especially where the surface was most convoluted. The total volume for this region was 6.47 +/- 1.83 (SD) cm3 for AR and 5.65 +/- 1.34 cm3 for MRI. It was demonstrated that this could be due to errors in calculation of the areas on the basis of MRI and AR. In the posterior part of the nasal cavity and the epipharynx, there was a convincingly higher correlation between acoustic measurements and a scan perpendicular to the assumed geometrical axis of the epipharynx than between acoustic measurements and coronal scanning. This indicates that the sound axis roughly follows the geometrical axis. In a model of two tubes (nasal cavities) joined in a larger tube (the epipharynx), closure of the posterior part of the latter revealed that the contralateral nasal cavity is likely to cause overestimation of the posterior part of the epipharynx during AR compared with MRI.
