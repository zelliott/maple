To investigate the role of N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) for the estimation of right heart failure and pulmonary pressure in patients with atrial septal defects (ASD) before and after percutaneous defect closure.

We performed correlation analysis for NT-proBNP and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) as well as right ventricular enddiastolic and endsystolic volume (RVEDV, RVESV) determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and up to one year following ASD closure. Additionally NT-proBNP concentrations were correlated with right atrial (RA) and RV enddiastolic pressure (RVEDP), ASD size and interatrial left-to-right shunt.

Baseline RVSP was 33+/-8 mmHg, which decreased significantly during follow-up. Initially, NT-proBNP levels were 240+/-93 pg/ml. After closure, a reduction to 116+/-62 pg/ml was obvious (p<0.01). Baseline MRI showed enlarged RV volumes in all individuals. At six and twelve months follow-up a significant reduction of RVEDV and RVESV was apparent. A positive correlation was noted between RV volumes and NT-proBNP (r=0.65, p<0.05). Furthermore RA pressure, RVEDP, RVSP and left-to-right shunt significantly correlated to peptide levels. No correlation was seen between ASD size and NT-proBNP.

NT-proBNP correlates to right ventricular dilatation, pulmonary pressure and left-to-right shunt in volume load of the right heart caused by an underlying ASD.
