The recent improvements in chemotherapy and surgical resection in Ewing sarcoma (ES) increased the overall survival as well as the importance of chest wall reconstruction. These improvements are in order to avoid asymmetrical growth, functional and cosmetic compromise after surgery. Chest wall reconstruction still remains a big issue in young patients with ES. We present a case of ES of the left chest wall, arising from a rib, in a 14-year-old patient. He was admitted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The patient underwent a chest wall resection of three ribs and a wedge lung resection of the upper lobe followed by chest wall reconstruction with Stratosâ„¢ rib titanium prostheses. This new device is suitable for reconstruction after major chest wall resection with good cosmetic and functional results. During the follow-up, there was no evidence of local and distant recurrence, the pain was under control and there were no functional alterations in the chest wall.
