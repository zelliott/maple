Although the interaction of brain volume with amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) and cocaine has been investigated in chronically dependent individuals, little is known about structural differences that might exist in individuals who consume ATS and cocaine occasionally but are not dependent on these drugs.

Regional brain volumes in 165 college aged occasional users of ATS (namely: amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) and cocaine were compared by voxel-based morphometry with 48 ATS/cocaine-naive controls.

Grey matter volume was significantly higher in the left ventral anterior putamen of occasional users, and lower in the right dorsolateral cerebellum and right inferior parietal cortex. A regression in users alone on lifetime consumption of combined ATS (namely: amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate and MDMA) and cocaine use revealed that individuals who used more ATS/cocaine had greater volume in the right ventromedial frontal cortex. A second regression on lifetime consumption of ATS with cocaine as a covariate revealed that individuals with a greater history of ATS use alone had more grey matter volume in the left mid-insula. Interestingly, structural changes in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula and striatum have been consistently observed in volumetric studies of chronic ATS and cocaine dependence.

The present results suggest that these three brain regions may play a role in stimulant use even in early occasional users.
