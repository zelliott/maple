Eighteen patients with abnormalities of the mandible and two normal volunteers were studied with MRI. Correlation was made with MR, CT, plain X-rays, clinical examination, and surgical findings when possible. In primary tumors of the mandible, MR was able to differentiate between solid and cystic lesions. In the cases of secondary invasion of the mandible by malignant tumors, MR was able to demonstrate replacement of the normal high signal bone marrow by low signal tumor. In some cases, the extent of marrow involvement shown on MR and confirmed at surgery was significantly underestimated by clinical examination, plain films, and CT. From this limited experience, it appears that MR may play an important role in imaging pathology of the mandible.
