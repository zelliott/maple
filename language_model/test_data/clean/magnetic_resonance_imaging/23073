We present a short and comprehensive report of our 39-month experience using a 3.0 T intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging (ioMRI) neurosurgical-MR twin room, including a description of the problems encountered and the associated time-delays. Forty-seven problems were experienced during the 189 ioMRI procedures (two ioMRI were performed in five of the 184 surgical procedures) performed in the 39-month period, including a blocked transfer table, failure of anesthetic monitoring material, and specific MRI-related problems, such as head and coil positioning difficulties, artefacts, coil malfunctions and other technical difficulties. None of these problems prevented the ioMRI procedure from taking place or affected image interpretation, but they sometimes caused a significant delay. Fifteen (32%) of these problems occurred during the initial learning curve period. The mean duration of the ioMRI procedure was 75 min, which decreased slightly with experience, although an average waiting-for-access time of 24 min could not be avoided. These results illustrate that although performing ioMRI at 3.0 T with the dual room is a challenging procedure, it remains safe and feasible and associated with only minor dysfunctions while offering optimal image quality and standard surgical conditions.
