Z-plasty of the obstructed and nonobstructed transverse vaginal septum using Grünberger's modification of Garcia's procedure.

Width of the vagina and quality of postoperative sexual life.

In all cases, a functioning vagina with at least a 4-cm width in the former area of the septum was created and no postoperative contractures occurred. Lubrication during copulation is perceived to be adequate. A satisfactory sexual life was reported by all of the patients. Cosmetically, the results were always satisfying.

The Grünberger modification of the Garcia Z-plasty method is a convenient and effective technique for the surgical treatment of transverse vaginal septa.
