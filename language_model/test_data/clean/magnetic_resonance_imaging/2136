The disintegration behavior of paracetamol tablets was studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the Snapshot FLASH method. The total time of the single experiment is 425 ms and allows the study of the disintegration process in real time. The study was carried out in vitro under acidic gastric pH conditions and may help to predict the behavior of paracetamol tablets in the stomach after oral administration. It was shown that in spite of identical conditions, the disintegration of the tablets under study was different. The distribution of protons of 4-(N-acetyl)aminophenol within the paracetamol tablet was shown to be homogeneous. The study was carried out in a non-destructive way by the SPI MRI method.
