To document the relationship of iris cavernous hemangiomas with multiorgan hemangiomas in a child.

A 7-year-old girl with kidney hemangiomas, brain hemangiomas, and skin hemangiomas developed blurred vision and darkening of the right iris. She had undergone 6 previous brain surgeries and multiple revisions of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus beginning at age 3 months.

Examination revealed visual acuity of 20/30 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. There was a reddish-purple lobulated cystic mass along the superior iris pupillary margin measuring 2 mm in greatest diameter confirmed by ultrasound biomicroscopy. The remainder of the ocular examination was unremarkable. The diagnosis was iris cavernous hemangioma in a patient with multiorgan cavernous hemangiomatosis. By 1-year follow-up, the iris hemangioma deflated, leaving a fibrotic, involuted scar.

Iris cavernous hemangioma can be associated with multiorgan hemangiomas that can be life threatening.
