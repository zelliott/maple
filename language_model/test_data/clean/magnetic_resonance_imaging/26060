MRI with an endorectal coil gives images of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles of higher quality than any other imaging modality. The use of an endorectal coil enables us to sample stronger radiofrequency signals from the prostate gland and seminal vesicles compared to a whole-body coil. This improves the contrast resolution in MR images and may give a higher spatial resolution by use of thin slices and a smaller slice gap. Intravenous MRI contrast is not used in our standard procedure. At Haukeland University Hospital, Norway, MRI with an endorectal coil is presently used as a tool for solving special problems in relation to detection and staging of prostate cancer, for example in patients with an abnormal s-PSA and negative sextant biopsies from the prostate gland. Furthermore, MRI with an endorectal coil may be used for the diagnosis of some benign diseases. The specific role of MRI with an endorectal coil in clinical use is not clarified; further research is needed. This article gives a short overview of technical aspects, imaging protocols, image reading, indications and diagnostic criteria for some diseases.
