Primary osteosarcoma of the skull (POS) in a young man with intracranial involvement is reported. After an initial transient remission by surgical intervention and chemotherapy, he began to deteriorate due to tumor recurrence and intracranial hemorrhage, and died 15 months following the time of diagnosis. The rarity and poor prognosis of POS are emphasized together with the review of the clinical and therapeutic aspects in the previously reported 98 cases in the literature.
