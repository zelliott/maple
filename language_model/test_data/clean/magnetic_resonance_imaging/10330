Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a progressive adult-onset tremor/ataxia syndrome caused by premutations in the FMR1 gene. In cranial MRI, the most characteristic findings are bilateral T2 hyperintense lesions within the middle cerebellar peduncles. Here we present a sibpair of two affected brothers presenting with very different symptoms (typical FXTAS versus essential tremor-like), disease progression, and MRI findings, illustrating broad intrafamilial variability of FXTAS. Also, their family history suggests further evidence of possible manifestation of FXTAS in women.
