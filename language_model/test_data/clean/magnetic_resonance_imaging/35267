A 9-year-old boy who since 3 years had been treated with a brace for presumed idiopathic thoracic scoliosis was referred because of severe syringomyelia on MRI of the spinal cord. Neuroimaging of the spinal cord had been performed because of back pain, although the patient had no neurological signs or symptoms. Besides extensive syringomyelia, the MRI revealed a type I Chiari's malformation which we assumed to be the primary cause of the syringomyelia and the subsequent scoliosis. Surgical decompression of the Chiari's malformation led to a remarkable reduction of the syringomyelia and to stabilisation of the scoliosis. In children with structural scoliosis, ancillary investigation in the way of neuroimaging of the spinal cord should be considered to exclude underlying spinal cord pathology, even in the absence of neurological abnormalities.
