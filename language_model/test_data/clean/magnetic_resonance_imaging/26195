Since the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions is not yet fully understood, we investigated the potential of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging for a better characterization of lesion pathology. Twenty-five MS patients were examined on a 1.5 T scanner. A single dose of gadolinium (Gd)-DOTA contrast agent was injected, and echoplanar images were acquired every 0.5 seconds for 1 minute. From the signal intensity-versus-time curves, the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) was evaluated for regions in plaques and in gray and white matter. The rCBV calculated for acute, Gd-enhancing plaques was corrected for the effects of blood-brain barrier leakage, using a new correction algorithm. Acute plaques had significantly higher blood volumes than normal-appearing white matter (P < = 0.01). Chronic plaques that appeared hypointense on T(1)-weighted images had lower rCBV than T(1)-isointense plaques (P < = 0.03). Our results indicate that the acute phase in MS is accompanied by vasodilation. In later stages of gliosis, the perfusion decreases with increasing axonal injury. Although the DSC technique is less sensitive than conventional MR imaging, the information provided is essentially different from that obtained with any other MR method.
