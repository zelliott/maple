Acoustic schwannoma is a slow-growing tumor and usually occurs in adult patients. We report a rare pediatric case of acoustic schwannoma with high proliferative potential. A 10-year-old boy was diagnosed as having a right cerebellopontine angle tumor. The tumor was subtotally resected. Histological examination revealed a typical acoustic schwannoma with a few mitotic figures. Chromosomal analysis showed no abnormality on the long arm of chromosome 22 associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. The lesion re-grew rapidly as an acoustic schwannoma, necessitating subtotal resection on three occasions and CyberKnife radiosurgery. The immunohistochemical MIB-1 staining indices of the specimens obtained at the first, second, and third operations were 2.3%, 4.6% and 14.7%, respectively. The immunohistochemical proliferative potential of acoustic schwannoma is discussed.
