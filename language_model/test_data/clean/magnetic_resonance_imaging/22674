To describe imaging findings of central nervous system involvement in patients with lipoid proteinosis.

Patients with lipoid proteinosis followed in the dermatology and neurology departments of the State University of Campinas between 2002 and 2004 were evaluated using high-resolution MRI and computerized tomography (CT).

We reviewed the charts of three patients (two women) with lipoid proteinosis with, ages ranging from 5 to 44 years. Symptomatic disease duration ranged from 2 to 39 years. MRI scans showed hypointense signal in FLAIR and T2 images in the amygdalae in two of three patients. Brain CT scans from two patients showed that MRI findings were calcifications. The calcification was more evident in patients with longer disease duration. Epilepsy was identified in one patient with longer disease duration. No other epileptogenic lesion was identified on MRI in this patient.

Lipoid proteinosis is associated with bilateral amygdalae calcification. These findings were more evident in patients with longer disease duration. Epilepsy, when present, may be related to these calcifications. Patients with lipoid proteinosis should be followed with MRI/CT in order to identify these abnormalities.
