Our aim was to establish an effective small-animal focal brain radiation model for research on brain injuries.

Groups of up to six rats were exposed to a range of doses from 120-40 Gy, at 10 intervals of a 6 MeV electron beam. Open-field motor functions and water maze learning-memory tests were performed after the irradiation at two-week intervals. Morphological changes were detected through repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) monthly and were compared with the histopathological findings to determine if they predicted late microscopic changes.

The development of necrosis proved to be dose-dependent. 120 Gy resulted in serious deterioration within 4 weeks in all rats. Localized necrosis in one hemisphere was detected 2 months after the irradiation with â‰¥ 70 Gy, and 3 months after 40-60 Gy consistent for all animals. The Morris water maze (MWM) tests proved to be the most sensitive tool for the early detection of a brain functional impairment. MRI screening provided useful information on the development of radiation necrosis, which defined the time point for histological examinations.

The described method permits accurate dose delivery to a definite part in one hemisphere of the brain for six rats at a time. Following complex examinations, a dose of 40 Gy and a follow-up time of 4 months are proposed for investigations on neuroradiation modifiers.
