A 60 year old right-handed man developed severe amnesia following a left medial temporal stroke as documented by cerebral MRI, MRA and SPECT scans. Neuropsychological evaluation 13 weeks after the stroke showed a profound retrograde amnesia characterised by memory loss for public facts and events over the previous four decades. In addition, autobiographical memory showed selective loss of personal episodic memory with relative preservation of personal semantic memory. The development of this degree of amnesia with these features following a unilateral temporal lobe lesion is unusual. The possible neuroanatomical mechanisms underlying the amnesia and how they relate to current theories of memory loss are discussed.
