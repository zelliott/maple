We report a case where tuberculous spondylitis was diagnosed in a 33-year-old man from Greenland. Very typically for Pott's disease, there was back pain, weight loss, and a characteristic kyphotic deformity. Computed tomography showed destruction of the thoracic vertebrae with paraspinal abscesses. The treatment was antituberculous therapy and surgery.
