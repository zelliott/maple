The accurate description and quantification of altered brain water resulting from different pathologic conditions is of critical clinical importance. In this work we determined the influence of total water content, hydration fraction and magnetic field strength on observed proton relaxation rates by means of in vitro and in vitro model studies and developed a scheme for determining water content at any field strength. Equations relating T1 relaxation times and brain water content are derived. This allows a non-invasive measure of brain water to be determined in the clinical setting.
