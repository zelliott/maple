To clarify the useful findings for determining whether the submandibular mass is intraglandular or extraglandular.

Forty-eight patients with swelling of the submandibular region were reviewed. The relationship between the lesion and the submandibular gland and the displacement of the anterior facial vein were analyzed.

The accuracy of the predictions based on the relationship between the lesion and the submandibular gland (SMG) was 87% on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT), 85% on CT sialography (CTS), and 91% on MRI. Although the displacement of the facial vein outside the lesion suggested an intraglandular lesion, and inside the lesion suggested an extraglandular lesion, these were not sufficient to differentiate the lesions in 7 out of 23 CECT cases and 4 out of 11 MRI cases.

The finding of a relationship between the lesion and the SMG is the most important finding of this study.
