Cervical vertebral artery fistulas are rare arteriovenous malformations between the vertebral artery and veins of the neighbourhood. The etiology of the fistulas may be traumatic or spontaneous. Management and the results in two patients with large arterio-venous fistulas of the cervical vertebral artery with severe deterioration of spinal function by using the detachable balloon technique are discussed. Complete angiographic and clinical cure was achieved in both patients and no complications related to the embolization procedure occurred. The detachable balloon technique is an effective method for selective occlusion of the fistula. Good radiographic monitoring facilities are required to make endovascular procedures effective and safe.
