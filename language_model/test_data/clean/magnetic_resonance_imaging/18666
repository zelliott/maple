We describe two cases of solitary necrotic nodule of the liver, an uncommon nonmalignant lesion that can mimic a metastasis. The nodule appeared hypoechoic, or targetlike, on sonography, hypodense without contrast enhancement on computed tomography, and hypointense on magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion-weighted images. These features, peculiar when considered together, are explained by the coagulative type of necrosis.
