To investigate the efficacy of two different high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) during Multiple Sclerosis (MS) relapses.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is the most sensitive neurophysiological ascertainment to quantify motor disability, to follow the recovery from an MS relapse, and to detect the response to treatment.

Twenty-four clinically definite relapsing - remitting MS patients presenting a relapse were randomly assigned to a treatment for 5 days with IVMP 1 or 2 g/day. The response to treatment of each patient was evaluated through Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Medical Research Council (MRC) score, and TMS by means of motor evoked potential (MEP) parameters.

Motor threshold (MT), central motor conduction time (CMCT) and MRC showed a higher improvement with the highest dose of IVMP. Silent period and EDSS improved with both treatments.

The dose of 2 g/day of IVMP is more effective in MS relapse.
