This study evaluated whether subclinical episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) were associated with an increased risk of silent cerebral infarct (SCI) and stroke in diabetic patients younger than 60 years who did not have other clinical evidence of AF and cerebrovascular disease at baseline.

In type 2 diabetic patients, one-fourth of strokes are of unknown cause, and subclinical episodes of AF may be a common etiologic factor.

A total of 464 type 2 diabetic patients younger than 60 years were included in a longitudinal observational study and matched to patients without diabetes. Patients underwent 48-h electrocardiographic Holter monitoring quarterly to detect brief subclinical episodes of AF (duration of AF <48 h) and were followed up for 37 months. The outcomes were SCI, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and stroke events during the follow-up period.

The prevalence of subclinical episodes of AF was significantly greater among patients with diabetes compared with matched healthy subjects (11% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.0001). During an average duration of 37 months, 43 stroke events occurred in the diabetic population and no events occurred in healthy subjects. Diabetic patients with silent episodes of AF (n = 176) had a higher baseline prevalence of SCI (61% vs. 29%; p < 0.01) and a higher number of stroke events (17.3% vs. 5.9%; p < 0.01) during the follow-up period than the other patients (n = 288). An episode of silent AF was an independent determinant of SCI (odds ratio: 4.441; p < 0.001; confidence interval: 2.42 to 8.16) and an independent predictor of the occurrence of stroke in diabetic patients (hazard ratio: 4.6; p < 0.01; confidence interval: 2.7 to 9.1).

Subclinical episodes of AF occurred frequently in type 2 diabetic patients and were associated with a significantly increased risk of SCI and stroke.
