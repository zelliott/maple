Initial magnetic resonance imaging studies of individuals with Krabbe disease were analyzed to determine whether the pattern of abnormalities corresponded to the phenotype.

This was a retrospective, nonblinded study. Families/patients diagnosed with Krabbe disease submitted medical records and magnetic resonance imaging discs for central review. Institutional review board approval/informed consents were obtained. Sixty-four magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed by two neuroradiologists and a child neurologist according to phenotype: early infantile (onset 0-6 months) = 39 patients; late infantile (onset 7-12 months) = 10 patients; later onset (onset 13 months-10 years) = 11 patients; adolescent (onset 11-20 years) = one patient; and adult (21 years or greater) = three patients. Local interpretations were compared with central review.

Magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities differed among phenotypes. Early infantile patients had a predominance of increased intensity in the dentate/cerebellar white matter as well as changes in the deep cerebral white matter. Later onset patients did not demonstrate involvement in the dentate/cerebellar white matter but had extensive involvement of the deep cerebral white matter, parieto-occipital region, and posterior corpus callosum. Late infantile patients exhibited a mixed pattern; 40% had dentate/cerebellar white matter involvement while all had involvement of the deep cerebral white matter. Adolescent/adult patients demonstrated isolated corticospinal tract involvement. Local and central reviews primarily differed in interpretation of the early infantile phenotype.

Analysis of magnetic resonance imaging in a large cohort of symptomatic patients with Krabbe disease demonstrated imaging abnormalities correspond to specific phenotypes. Knowledge of these patterns along with typical clinical signs/symptoms should promote earlier diagnosis and facilitate treatment.
