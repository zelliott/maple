The study of corpus callosal morphometry is important to unravel the underlying connectivity disturbance in schizophrenia. We studied the corpus callosal area in schizophrenia subjects compared to healthy subjects, while controlling for several confounders that could affect morphometric measures of the corpus callosum (CC). Areas of the whole CC and its sub-regions obtained by two geometric partitioning schemes were studied in 23 right-handed neuroleptic-naÃ¯ve, recent-onset, schizophrenia patients and compared with 23 right-handed age-, sex- and education-matched healthy subjects. The patients did not differ from controls in whole CC area. On tripartite division of the CC, the area of the anterior sub-region was significantly higher in patients compared to controls. On radial division into 5 sub-regions, the anterior truncus area was significantly higher in patients compared to controls. There was a significant effect of gender (F>M) on the area measures; however there was no significant diagnosis()gender effect. Age, age of onset, duration of illness and psychopathology ratings did not show any significant correlations with whole CC area and area of CC sub-regions. The finding of increased area of the anterior truncus that possibly comprises white fibres connecting the temporal association cortices could be indicative of an "abnormal functional hyperconnection" involving these regions in positive symptom schizophrenia. Additionally, the finding of females having larger areas of the whole CC and of the anterior and middle sub-regions could reflect a "normal hyperconnection" underlying increased ambilaterality in females.
