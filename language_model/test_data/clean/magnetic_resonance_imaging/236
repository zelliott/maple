Changes in liver microcirculation are considered essential in assessing ischemia-reperfusion injury, which in turn has an impact on liver graft function and outcome following liver transplantation (LTx). The aim of this study was to introduce dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) as a new technique for overall quantification of hepatic microcirculation and compare it to perfusion measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF; hepatic artery/portal vein) and thermal diffusion (TD). The study included 3 groups, measuring hepatic blood flow and microcirculation with the help of TD, LDF, and dMRI. In group I (9 landrace pigs; 26 +/- 5 kg), the native liver before and after partial portal occlusion was studied; in group II (6 landrace pigs; 25.5 +/- 4.4 kg), the liver 24 hours after LTx was studied; and in group III (14 patients), the liver on days 4 to 7 following LTx was studied. A close correlation was found between dMRI measurements and TD (r = 0.7-0.9, P < 0.01) in 4 defined regions of interest. Portal blood flow and partial occlusion of the portal vein were accurately detected by LDF flowmetry and correlated well with dMRI (r = 0.95, P < 0.01). In the clinical setting, representative TD measurements in segment 4b of the transplanted liver correlated well with dMRI analysis in other segments. Quantification of the portal blood flow and imaging of the whole liver could be performed simultaneously by dMRI. In conclusion, dMRI has been proved to be a sensitive modality for the quantification of liver microcirculation and hepatic blood flow in experimental and clinical LTx. It allows for a synchronous, noninvasive assessment of macrocirculation and microcirculation of the liver and could become a valuable diagnostic tool in advanced liver surgery and transplantation.
