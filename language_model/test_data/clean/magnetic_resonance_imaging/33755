The case of a patient with above-average intelligence and educational background, high motivation, and an approximate IQ-MQ difference of 40 points is documented. The patient has been examined repeatedly for nearly a decade. Extensive neuroradiological material of his focal bilateral brain damage in the dorsal diencephalon is available. A widespread range of cognitive tests was used to investigate his actual performance on all relevant aspects of intelligence, attention, subjective memory, immediate retention, learning, skill and problem solving abilities, concept formation, cognitive flexibility, priming, constructional ability, retrograde memory, and long-term retention. The total of more than 50 tests included German-language forms of the revised Wechsler Memory Scale and of the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test. The patient's short-term memory and attention were, in spite of his advanced years, average or well above average. He gave a number of examples of still intact skills and implicit memory abilities, though there was no uniformity in his performance on implicit memory tests (e.g., with respect to stored vs. new implicit information). He had no awareness of his severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia, documented over a large range of verbal and figural tests. Taken together, the results from our patient confirm the principal dichotomy between declarative and nondeclarative mnestic functions, but give evidence for some restrictions as well. They furthermore demonstrate that focal diencephalic damage may result in profound anterograde and selective retrograde amnesia, especially with respect to data-based material, and that disconnecting portions of the medial and basolateral limbic circuits has devastating consequences on memory.
