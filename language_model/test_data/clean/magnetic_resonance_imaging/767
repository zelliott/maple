Adult onset tic disorders are usually secondary in origin. We report a case of adult onset tic disorder following carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication with typical magnetic resonance imaging features.

A 36-year-old woman developed temporarily suppressible patterned movements on her face, neck, and shoulder associated with sensory discomfort after CO poisoning. Magnetic resonance images showed bilateral symmetric cavitary changes in the globus pallidus. Clonazepam relieved much of her symptoms.

Our patient developed a monosymptomatic tic disorder following CO intoxication. This further supports that altered outflow signals from the basal ganglia, especially the globus pallidus, may contribute to the development of tic disorders.
