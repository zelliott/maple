Bilateral superior oblique palsy is an uncommon ocular motility problem, the commonest cause being closed head trauma. Two cases, both adults, are presented in whom bilateral superior oblique palsy occurred as a result of neoplastic infiltration of the dorsal midbrain in the region of the anterior medullary velum. In the absence of a history of head trauma, the presence of an acquired bilateral superior oblique palsy is a definite sign of a single lesion in the region of the decussation of the trochlear nerves and appropriate imaging is indicated.
