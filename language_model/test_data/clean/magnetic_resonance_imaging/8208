MRI is known to be a superior modality for evaluating pericardial disease and masses because of its unmatched capacity for tissue characterization and high spatial resolution. New real-time sequences now complement the standard morphologic imaging of the pericardium with dynamic image acquisitions that also can provide hemodynamic information indicative of constriction. In the evaluation of masses, recently developed rapid imaging sequences have shortened examination times and improved lesion characterization. The full spectrum of pericardial disease and cardiac masses is reviewed, and the role of MRI explored.
