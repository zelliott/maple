In a series of 225 patients with astrocytomas (grades I-IV) of the basal ganglia and the thalamus, 20 had a movement disorder. In all patients the histological diagnosis was verified by stereotactic biopsy. Tremor was observed in twelve patients, dystonia in eight, chorea in three, and chorea/ballismus and myoclonus in one. The tumour involved the thalamus in 16 patients. Corticospinal tract dysfunction was evident in 70% of the patients with movement disorders and in 73% of those without. Demographic, clinical, histological and neuroradiological data of the patients with a movement disorder were compared with the data of patients without. CT data yielded no differences with respect to the involvement of anatomical structures. Movement disorders were significantly associated with low-grade astrocytomas.
