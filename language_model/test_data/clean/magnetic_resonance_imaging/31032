Human gnathostomiasis is an infection caused mainly by Gnathostoma spinigerum, a nematode. Infected humans can present with various clinical manifestations. Serology is the criterion standard for diagnosing gnathostomiasis, whereas MR imaging represents a complementary tool for assessing severity and extent of disease. We report two definite cases of gnathostomiasis that were confirmed by the immunoblotting technique. MR imaging of the cervical cords showed cord enlargement and diffuse high signal intensity, mainly of the gray-white matter regions. MR imaging of the brain showed hemorrhagic tract and scattered deep intracerebral hemorrhage with diffuse, fuzzy white matter lesions with nodular enhancement. Severe gnathostomiasis was unresponsive to treatment.
