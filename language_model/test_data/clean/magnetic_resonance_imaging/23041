Early manifestations of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are mainly associated with a primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Rapid increases in peripheral blood EBV DNA load are supposed to reliably predict PTLD. We report a boy who 6 months after living-related kidney transplantation presented with an extranodal esophageal manifestation of PTLD. Despite a primary EBV infection with tonsillitis, the peripheral blood EBV DNA remained low, hiding the progression to PTLD.
