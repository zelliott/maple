MRI of the pediatric chest appears useful in evaluating the mediastinum, the bony thorax, and the lung parenchyma. MR seems to be more useful than other imaging modalities in evaluation of the mediastinum, particularly in defining the extent of the lesions. Coronal images provide additional information to those obtained axially. MR can in a selected number of cases replace x-ray CT in evaluation of the pediatric chest.
