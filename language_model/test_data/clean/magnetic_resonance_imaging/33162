This work reviews magnetic resonance imaging in the developing human brain. It focuses on fetal brain imaged in vivo and in utero with complementary sections on abnormalities seen in clinical settings, and on potential of diffusion tensor imaging and of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The main purposes are to illustrate the normal fetal developing brain and its abnormalities commonly encountered in utero, and to emphasize the potential role of adjunct techniques such as diffusion imaging and spectroscopy that may help elucidate fetal brain maturation and its abnormalities.
