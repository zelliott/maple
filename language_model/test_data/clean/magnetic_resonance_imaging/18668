Thorotrast, a contrast medium used extensively before being banned in 1950s, delivers a densely ionizing, high linear energy transfer type of radiation that predisposes to malignancies. We report a case of peripheral cholangiocarcinoma and describe its computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging features in a patient who developed it 48 years after exposure to Thorotrast.
