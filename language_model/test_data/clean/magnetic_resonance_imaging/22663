Noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to determine vascular three-dimensional structure, detect the presence of subclinical atherosclerotic disease in high-risk patient subgroups, and optimize and follow therapy in individual patients. The outstanding soft-tissue-characterizing capabilities of MRI permit depiction of various components of atherothrombotic plaque, including lipid, fibrous tissue, calcium, and thrombus formation. However, noninvasive MRI visualization of coronary arteries is currently limited by the small size of the coronary arteries, the deep arterial location, and arterial motion. The combination of MR imaging and molecular probes offers exciting possibilities of direct visualization of biologic processes within atherosclerotic tissue. The self-contained intravascular MRI probe appears to hold promise in the identification of high-risk coronary atherosclerotic lesions with increased superficial lipid content.
