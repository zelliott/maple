A new method for determining brain tissue water using MRI, developed in the laboratory, has been tested and applied to the clinical setting. To evaluate the accuracy of the technique, samples of human brain tissue were harvested from patients scheduled to undergo surgical removal of tumour and in whom biopsies were required for clinical management. MR determined values from imaging water maps compared favourably with gravimetric measures of samples. From these data, we conclude that accurate non-invasive measures of brain oedema in man are now possible.
