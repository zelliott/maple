Balloon ablation catheters using various energy sources are being developed to perform pulmonary vein (PV) isolation to treat atrial fibrillation. Prior evaluations of 2D CT/MR images are limited by the frequent elliptical shape of the PV ostia, the nonorthogonal orientation of the PVs to the left atrial (LA) chamber, and difficulty in appreciating through-slice curvature. To provide anatomical data relevant to balloon catheter ablation, 3D surface reconstructions of LA-PVs were generated and analyzed to define ostial architecture and size.

Using MRI datasets obtained from 101 paroxysmal AF patients, the LA-PVs were segmented to generate 3D LA-PV surface reconstructions. Using both external and endoluminal projections, the PV ostial and antral regions were identified and evaluated. In the left PVs, a common left-sided ostium was identified in 94 patients, with an ostial circumference of 95 +/- 15 mm. Branching of the left PVs occurred 0-5 mm away from the common left ostium in 43 patients (43%), 5-15 mm away from the common os in 37 patients (37%), and >15 mm away from the common os in 14 patients (14%). In patients with either distinct left PV ostia, or common os <15 mm (87 patients), the individual LSPV/LIPV ostial circumferences were 67 +/- 12 mm and 58 +/- 9 mm, respectively. Mean left antral circumference was 114 +/- 17 mm. In the right PVs, the ostial circumferences of the RSPV/RIPV were 68 +/- 11 mm and 66 +/- 11 mm, respectively. Mean right antral circumference was 107 +/- 19 mm. Assuming ideal deformation of the LA chamber anatomy, the minimal diameters of a balloon ablation catheter required to isolate 95% of the RSPV, RIPV, LSPV, LIPV, LCPV, left antrum, and right antrum are 29 mm, 28 mm, 29 mm, 24 mm, 40 mm, 46 mm, and 47 mm, respectively.

Analysis of 3D surface reconstructions of LA-PV anatomy reveals that balloon catheter-based ablation of the PVs is likely feasible in most patients, but balloon ablation of the common PV antra would be problematic.
