A case of accumulation of CSF into the brain parenchyma simulating a brain tumor, secondary to an obstructed ventriculoperitoneal shunt, is presented. Until now, only seven cases of this rare complication have been described.

Magnetic resonance showed an expansive, low-density intracranial lesion on the right frontal and parietal lobe. This mass was biopsied, but no tumor was found and the diagnosis was brain edema.

The mistake in the diagnosis was due to the clinical symptoms and to the MR images.
