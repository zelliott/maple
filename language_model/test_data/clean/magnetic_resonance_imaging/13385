Lipomeningioma is a benign tumor of the meninges that contains mature adipose tissue. It demonstrates fat density on computed tomographic scan and mixed signal intensities on magnetic resonance imaging scan. Although the pluripotential nature of the mesenchymal cell has long been recognized, only a single case with this diagnosis has been documented in the literature to date. Three patients with this diagnosis seen at the Johns Hopkins Hospital during the last two years are presented, and the literature is reviewed.
