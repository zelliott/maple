Facial palsy after pre-operative embolization of glomus tumours is a rare complication. In our case, complete facial palsy occurred within four hours after embolization with polyvinyl alcohol foam. Three days later, embolization material was found in the perineural vessels of the facial nerve in its mastoidal segment. Six months after complete tumour removal, facial decompression with perineural incision, and steroid therapy, facial function recovered completely. In cases of embolization of both stylomastoid and branches of the middle meningeal artery with resorbable material, temporary facial palsy can occur.
