The olfactory system consists of the primary olfactory nerves in the nasal cavity, the olfactory bulbs and tracts, and numerous intracranial connections and pathways. Diseases affecting the sense of smell can be located both extracranially and intracranially. Many sinonasal inflammatory and neoplastic processes may affect olfaction. Intracranially congenital, traumatic, and neurodegenerative disorders are usually to blame for olfactory dysfunction. The breadth of diseases that affect the sense of smell is astounding, yet the imaging ramifications have barely been explored.
