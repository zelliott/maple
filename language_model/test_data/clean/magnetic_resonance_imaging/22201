Endoluminal sonography is an excellent technique in preoperative staging of rectal carcinoma. This minimally invasive technology makes individual planning of therapy possible and is a very good tool in postoperative follow-up and documentation. In comparison with the techniques of CT and MRI it is less expensive and the mobile unit can easily be moved e.g. into the operating theatre. There are no contraindications for this examination, postoperative tissue scars and metal implants will not disturb the imaging. We think that endoluminal sonography will be able to facilitate individual decision making in the treatment of rectal carcinoma.
