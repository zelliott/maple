A 59-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of right abducens nerve palsy without orbital pain. One month later right orbital pain appeared and two months later the pain changed to an aching severe pain and the right oculomotor, trochlear and trigeminal nerves were also involved. The administration of corticosteroid dramatically reduced these symptoms. The diagnosis was Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) based on these findings. THS starting with abducens nerve palsy alone is rare, representing only 5.1% of 118 patients. In our patient, the newly developed dynamic MRI was able to reveal the right cavernous sinus lesion. The diagnostic usefulness of dynamic MRI for cavernous sinus lesions has been demonstrated for such cases.
