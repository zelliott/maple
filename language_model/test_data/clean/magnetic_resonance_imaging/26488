To evaluate gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) for dynamic and delayed magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of focal liver lesions.

In 126 of 214 patients, MR imaging was performed before Gd-BOPTA administration, immediately after bolus administration of a 0.05- mmol/kg dose of Gd-BOPTA, and 60-120 minutes after an additional intravenously infused 0.05-mmol/kg dose. In 88 patients, imaging was performed before and 60-120 minutes after a single, intravenously infused 0.1-mmol/kg dose. T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo and T1-weighted gradient-echo images were acquired. On-site and blinded off-site reviewers prospectively evaluated all images. Intraoperative ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) during arterial portography, and/or CT with iodized oil served as the reference methods in 110 patients.

Significantly more lesions were detected on combined pre- and postcontrast images compared with on precontrast images alone (P <. 01). All reviewers reported a decreased mean size of the smallest detected lesion and improved lesion conspicuity on postcontrast images. All on-site reviewers and two off-site reviewers reported increased overall diagnostic confidence (P <.01). Additional lesion characterization information was provided on up to 109 (59%) of 184 delayed images and for up to 50 (42%) of 118 patients in whom dynamic images were assessed. Gd-BOPTA would have helped change the diagnosis in 99 (47%) of 209 cases and affected patient treatment in 408 (23%) of 209 cases.

Gd-BOPTA increases liver lesion conspicuity and detectability and aids in the characterization of lesions.
