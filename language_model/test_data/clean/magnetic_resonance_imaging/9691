Extraventricular neurocytoma is an uncommon neuronal tumor, located outside the cerebral ventricles, which shows histological features similar to those of central neurocytoma. Most extraventricular neurocytomas are situated in the intraaxial regions of the central nervous system. We report a rare case of an extraaxial neurocytoma in the sphenocavernous-petroclival region that was successfully treated by radiation therapy following partial removal and pathological evaluation of the tumor.
