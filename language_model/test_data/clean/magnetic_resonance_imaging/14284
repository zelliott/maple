With a retrospective analysis of images from 39 patients with histologically proven liver tumours we tried to determine the best MRT-parameter for detection of cavernous hemangioma (n = 19) and its differentiation from malignoma (metastases n = 17, HCC n = 5). The best differentiation was achieved with the contrast-to-noise ratio between lesion and liver in multi-echo-images with TR/TE = 2,000/210 ms and a definite limit with an accuracy of 84% for hemangioma and 91% for malignoma. The respective intensity ratios (lesion/liver) were 95% and 77%. T2-relation times and the T1- and T2-ratios were also calculated. In contrary to the literature we think that these parameters are not sufficiently discriminating.
