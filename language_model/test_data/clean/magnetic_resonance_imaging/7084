Magnetic resonance imagings (MRI) were made of intracranial venous angioma (six angiographically proved, four presumed). All draining veins were identified as a linear or a small round structure with a flow void. The stellate configuration was observed in seven of the ten patients. In two of the ten, the associated intraparenchymal hematoma was evident. Increased intensity of adjacent parenchyma on T2-weighted images was detected in four of ten patients, and a decreased intensity on the T1-weighted images was noted in three of eight. Thus, MRI is a pertinent diagnostic modality for evaluating intracranial venous angioma. Angiography does not seem to be required for confirmation in patients with typical MR findings.
