Success and diffusion of various sports have produced more frequent capsular-ligamentous lesions of the shoulder. Diagnosis up to now has relied on traditional radiology using many projections to demonstrate extremity lesions and their congruences; however for capsular-ligamentous lesions, arthrography in used successfully. Since the last few years new investigating methods are used (U.S., C.T., M.N.R.). After examining benefits of each diagnosing method compared to traditional radiology, the authors conclude that traditional radiology still has a pre-eminent role in diagnosing sports pathology of the shoulder.
