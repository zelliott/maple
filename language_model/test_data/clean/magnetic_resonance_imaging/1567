The purpose of this investigation was to correlate magnetic resonance (MR) images of medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) injuries with gross macroscopic findings. Twenty-seven knees with MPFL injury following an initial patellar dislocation were examined using axial proton-density and T2-weighted fast spin-echo MR imaging. MR findings were subsequently correlated with open exploration. MPFL injury was observed in 26 (96%) of the 27 knees. From the MR images, discontinuity, irregularity and/or high-signal intensity changes anterior to the femoral attachment were seen in 13 (82%) of the 16 knees with substantial-tear type injuries of the MPFL. In 8 (80%) of the 10 knees with avulsion-tear type injuries, detachment of the MPFL from the femoral attachment, accompanied with or without high-signal intensity changes, was confirmed. MPFL injury types could be accurately diagnosed on 21 (81%) out of 26 knees using MR imaging. MR imaging was an acceptable method in diagnosing MPFL injury types.
