Cerebral aspergillosis is a severe disease most commonly suspected in immunocompromised patients.

We report herein three cases of cerebral aspergillosis in immunocompetent adults. Sinus involvement was noted in two cases, but there was no extracerebral involvement in the third case. Mycology samples provided the diagnosis in two cases. In the third case, cerebral imaging visualized a tumor; the patient underwent surgery and the pathology exam of the surgical specimen established the diagnosis. All patients were given antifungal treatment and achieved a good outcome.

Cerebral aspergillosis is highly uncommon in immunocompetent patients. In addition to immunodepression, the notion of pulmonary or ENT involvement may be suggestive. In the brain, aspergillosis mainly involves the basal nuclei and the thalamus.
