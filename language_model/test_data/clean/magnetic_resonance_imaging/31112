Heterotaxy syndromes, right or left atrial isomerism, result from disruption of left-right axis determination and their manifestations include complicated heart defects. Recent studies in model organisms have revealed complex genetic pathways and several genes involved in this process. In affected humans, however, molecular studies have identified mutations in a small number of individuals, while in most the cause remains unknown. Furthermore, although family data suggest, autosomal recessive inheritance, such genes have not yet been identified. We have studied six members of a family, four children affected with right atrial isomerism (RAI) and their healthy parents, for disturbances of left-right axis development. The children, one female and three males who all had complicated heart defects, succumbed and had an autopsy. Their nonconsanguineous parents were examined by cardiac and abdominal ultrasound or MRI. In all four children the heart defects included single ventricle with dysplastic atrioventricular (AV) valve, total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (TAPVD), and malposition of great arteries (MGA) with pulmonary stenosis (PS). All had asplenia; two also had dextrocardia and abdominal situs inversus. The diagnosis of RAI was made postnatally in the first child and prenatally in others. Two siblings had no surgery and died as a newborn, one with obstructed supracardiac TAPVD and the other with regurgitating AV valve. Two children underwent heart surgery. One had repair of obstructive infracardiac TAPVD but died in infancy. The other underwent both hemi-Fontan operation and heart transplantation but died at the age of 2 years. This is the first report describing four children with RAI in the same family. The occurrence of RAI in male and female siblings without any indication of left-right axis abnormalities in their parents suggests autosomal recessive inheritance of human isomerism.
