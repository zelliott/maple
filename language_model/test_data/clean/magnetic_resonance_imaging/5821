This study examined the effects of an eight-week progressive resistance training on different strength manifestations, muscle mass and functionality in multiple sclerosis patients. Thirteen volunteered patients (average age 43 years; range 35-51) with a confirmed diagnosis by a neurologist and mild to moderate disability participated twice a week in an eight-week progressive resistance training program after an eight-week control period without training. Intensity ranged from 40-70% of their maximal voluntary contraction. Outcome assessments included magnetic resonance image of the right and left thighs, strength manifestations (maximal voluntary contraction, muscular endurance and power), and functionality by the Up and Go test. All outcome assessments remained unaltered during the eight-week control period. After the eight-week strength training period, isometric strength (+16%, p<0.01), muscular endurance (+84%; p<0.001), maximal power (+51%, p<0.001), muscular hypertrophy from slice 6/27 to slice 11/27 of both thighs (p<0.05), and functionality (p<0.001) improved significantly. Moderate resistance training programs can improve muscle function without injuries and can be a promising therapy to delay the functional deterioration in multiple sclerosis patients.
