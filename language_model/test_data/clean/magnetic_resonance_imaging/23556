Synovial sarcoma which mainly affects the periarticular tissues of the extremities in young adults is an uncommon seen soft tissue sarcoma with uncertain causative factors. We report a long-course primary synovial sarcoma of the left foot in a 46-year-old man. The initial symptom occurred when he was 26-year-old. During these 20 years, he underwent two operations, with the diagnosis of synovial cyst and nodular synovitis. This time, a lobulated 7 x 5.5 x 6 cm mass was found on computed tomography, and a final diagnosis of synovial sarcoma was made by histological study. The patient underwent a below knee amputation. We report this case aiming to discuss about the potential etiology of synovial sarcoma. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of this malignant mass.
