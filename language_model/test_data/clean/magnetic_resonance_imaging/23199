Most well-appearing children who have had an afebrile seizure can be managed as outpatients with instructions for an outpatient electroencephalogram and primary care physician follow-up. Laboratory studies are needed only in children younger than 6 months, in patients with prolonged seizures or altered level of consciousness, or in those with history of a metabolic disorder or dehydration. Emergent neuroimaging is not recommended in children with a first unprovoked afebrile seizure, although studies should be considered in children with a predisposing condition or focal seizures if younger than 3 years.
