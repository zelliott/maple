This review focuses on the role of CT and MRI in the diagnosis, follow-up, and surgical planning of aortic aneurysms and acute aortic syndromes, including aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, and penetrating aortic ulcer. It also provides a systematic approach to the definition, causes, natural history, and imaging principles of these diseases.

An understanding of the pathophysiology, natural history, and imaging features is the key to successful diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with these aortic diseases.
