The descriptive term papillary glioneuronal tumor (PGNT) has been repeatedly applied to a morphologic subset of low-grade mixed glial-neuronal neoplasia of juvenile and young adult patients. We report on a 13-year-old boy with PGNT of the left temporal lobe, who presented with headaches and a single generalized seizure. On magnetic resonance imaging, tumor was seen as a large, moderately enhancing paraventricular mass with cyst-mural nodule configuration and slight midline shift. Perifocal edema was virtually absent. Gross total resection could be performed, followed by an uneventful recovery. Histologically, the tumor exhibited similar, if not identical, features as reported previously. These comprised a patterned biphasic mixture of sheets of synaptophysin-expressing small round cells and pseudorosettes of GFAP-positive rudimentary astrocytes along vascular cores. Focally, the latter imprinted a pseudopapillary aspect on this otherwise solid lesion. Both cellular components expressed non-polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)-L species, and several overlapping areas of synaptophysin and GFAP immunoreactivity were present. The mean MIB-1 labeling index remained below 1%. Signs of anaplasia, in particular mitotic figures, endothelial proliferation, or necrosis were consistently lacking. We perceive PGNT as a clinically and morphologically well-delineated subgroup of extraventricular neurocytic neoplasia, whose paradigmatic presentation may allow for consideration as an entity.
