Persistent pain in the ankle after relatively minor trauma is common and usually resolves spontaneously. Two cases of persistent pain after minor trauma are presented that involved unusual characteristics of scintigraphic and magnetic resonance imaging, compatible with avascular necrosis of the talar body. This is a rare finding in the absence of steroid use or significant trauma to the foot. The unusual vascular anatomy of the talus is considered in the possible mechanism of injury.
