The use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the detection and staging of renal neoplasms was investigated in 104 patients with 106 renal cell carcinomas confirmed at surgery or autopsy. Overall, MR imaging demonstrated 101 of 106 lesions (95%), including all 93 tumors that were larger than 3 cm in diameter but only eight of the 13 smaller tumors (62%). MR imaging enabled accurate staging of 82% of all detected lesions but led to the understaging of nine lesions and the overstaging of nine. At present, MR imaging cannot be used as a screening modality for renal tumors. However, its negative predictive values of 98% and 99%, respectively, for the evaluation of tumor vascular extension and tumor spread to adjacent structures makes it an excellent staging modality that should be used when the CT findings are equivocal. MR imaging is not accurate in indicating bowel and mesentery involvement, but rapid technical advances and the introduction of bowel contrast medium may improve this present limitation.
