We report a new method for treating patients with symptomatic high-grade stenosis of the proximal vertebral artery associated with high-grade stenosis of the ipsilateral carotid artery.

Our patient had high-grade stenosis of the proximal right vertebral artery as well as high-grade stenosis of the ipsilateral carotid artery and suffered continued posterior circulation ischemic neurological deficits despite anticoagulation.

The patient was successfully treated with a carotid endarterectomy and thyrocervical-to-vertebral artery transposition in a single operation.

This procedure has the advantage in this setting of avoiding additional cross clamping on the diseased carotid artery that would normally be required for the vertebral-to-carotid artery transposition with carotid endarterectomy. Also, thrombosis at one anastamosis site would not endanger the other site as well.
