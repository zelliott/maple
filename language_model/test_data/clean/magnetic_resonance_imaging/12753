The treatment of infantile fibrosarcoma has traditionally been wide resection. Chemotherapy has been investigated as an adjuvant and primary treatment in cases in which surgery would cause unacceptable morbidity. Recurrences normally occur within a year of completion of the chemotherapy and display the same histology. We present a child with an infantile fibrosarcoma of the elbow, successfully treated with chemotherapy alone, who developed a calcifying aponeurotic fibroma and a spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma at the tumor site 12 years later.
