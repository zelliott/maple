MR imaging depicted vertically oriented folia instead of the normal horizontal folial pattern, hypoplastic cerebellar vermis, fusion of the inferior posterior cerebellum, and probable polymicrogyria in the superior cerebellar hemispheres in a child with hypotonia, nystagmus, ataxia, and psychomotor retardation. We propose that this newly discovered cerebellar malformation be added to the list of malformations associated with aplasia or hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, such as Dandy-Walker malformation, Joubert syndrome, tectocerebellar dysraphia, and rhombencephalosynapsis.
