We describe the steps, problems, pitfalls and modifications in the development of a collaborative medical modelling service for a general hospital in the United Kingdom. We emphasise the value of having as much control as possible in the hands of clinicians so that the maximum relevant information can be obtained at minimum cost. Three-dimensional imaging, modelling and planning are now essential parts of any reconstructive surgery unit and must be adapted to make them as user friendly as possible for clinicians.
