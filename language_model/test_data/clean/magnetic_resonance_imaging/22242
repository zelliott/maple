A magnetic resonance imaging method for measuring the T2 relaxation time constant is proposed. It is based on the assumption that, under very general conditions, the MR signal near a spin echo has a special symmetry arising from the refocusing nature of the 180 degrees RF pulse. A gradient echo sampling of the spin echo (GESSE) sequence is implemented to evaluate T2 by collecting multiple gradient echoes before and after the spin echo. This approach is a modification of the GESFIDE sequence proposed by Ma and Wehrli. However, our approach compares images that are not separated by any RF pulses and, as a result, is insensitive to slice profile imperfections. In addition, the calculated T2 value does not rely on any special assumptions about the MRI signal behavior in the presence of an inhomogeneous static magnetic field and, hence, is insensitive to the presence of static magnetic field inhomogeneities.
