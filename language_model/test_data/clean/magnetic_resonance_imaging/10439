In smooth-pursuit eye movements (SPEM) with gain close to one, SPEM should be controlled mainly by prediction of target motion because retinal slip is nearly zero. We investigated the neural mechanisms of visual-target prediction by the three fMRI experiments. (1) Overt pursuit task: subjects pursued a sinusoidally moving target which blinked (blink condition) or did not blink (continuous condition). (2) Covert pursuit task: subjects covertly pursued the same target with eyes gazed at fixation point. (3) Attend-to-stationary target task: subjects brought attention on a stationary target with eyes gazed at fixation point. In the overt pursuit task, the SPEM gain and the delay in the blink condition were not very different from the continuous condition, indicating good prediction of the blinking target motion. Activities in the dorsolateral prefrontal, precentral, medial superior frontal, intraparietal, and lateral occipito-temporal cortexes increased in the blink-continuous subtraction. The V1 activity decreased for this contrast. In the covert pursuit task, only the anterior/superior LOTC activity remained in the blink-continuous subtraction. In the attend-to-stationary target task, the blink-continuous subtraction elicited no activation. Consequently, the a/sLOTC activity is responsible for target prediction rather than motor commands for eye movements or just target blinking such as visual saliency.
