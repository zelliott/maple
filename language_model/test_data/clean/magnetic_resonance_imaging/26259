This paper reports the findings of facial nodal metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

The film records of 1916 patients with histologically confirmed NPC seen over a 5-year period were reviewed.

Eight facial nodes were demonstrated in three (0.2%) patients. There were three buccinator, two malar, two infraorbital and one mandibular nodes.

Facial nodal metastasis in NPC is unusual, but may be seen at presentation or during recurrence.
