A case of multifocal and recurrent ganglion cysts is described. An 11-year-old boy was referred because of symptomatic cystic masses in the extremities since the age of 2 years. Over the years, he had experienced intermittent appearance of these lesions, which were associated with pain, but without any systemic manifestations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cystic lesions with synovio-capsular thickening along the temporomandibular joints (TMJ), atlanto-axial synovial articulation, and tendons and joints of the right wrist and hand. Histopathological examination of one lesion showed anastomosing fibro-connective tissue surrounded by a wall of smooth muscle and fibrous connective tissue, findings that were consistent with ganglion cyst. The early onset of the disease, as well as the involvement of multiple and unusual sites, including the TMJ, implies a genetic susceptibility to these lesions that we refer to as 'cystic ganglionosis'.
