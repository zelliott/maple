The brain and the brain stem were investigated by magnetic resonance (MR) in 19 patients with complete acute peripheral facial palsy, diagnosed as Bell's palsy. Five patients with a median age of 57 years had changes on T2 weighted MR: One patient showed transient signal changes with increased signal intensity in the ipsilateral brain stem. Another patient had persisting abnormal signals both in the brain and the brain stem. Two patients presented regions of high signal intensity in the subcortical cerebral white matter and still another patient had increased signal intensity in the periventricular white matter. MR abnormalities anatomically related to the facial nerve or its nucleus were not demonstrated. The significance of the MR findings is not quite certain but the MR pattern in conjunction with the patient's high median age most likely indicate vascular disease.
