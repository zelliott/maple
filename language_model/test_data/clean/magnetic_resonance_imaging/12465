The case of a 5-year-old boy with ground-glass pattern craniofacial fibrous dysplasia (FD) presenting with progressive swelling in the right frontal region is reported. The imaging findings with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are presented. The differential diagnosis with inspissated mucocele is discussed as well. Fibrous tissue could be hypo dense on CT. Post-contrast enhancement of the lesion on MRI is the key for diagnosis.
