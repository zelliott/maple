Osteochondromas are common lesions in the metaphyseal segments of the long bones and are known to be able to degenerate into chondrosarcoma. We present the case of a 20-year-old patient with an osteosarcoma at the base of a cartilaginous exostosis and discuss the causal relationship between the two lesions on the basis of the radiologic and pathologic findings.
