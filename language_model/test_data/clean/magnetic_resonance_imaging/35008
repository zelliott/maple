We compared the influences of the parameters of several pulse sequences using two major commercially available gadolinium (Gd) contrast media for MR imaging. The phantom of Gd solutions of various concentration (0.1 - 10mmol/L) was prepared, and was scanned with a 1.5T clinical MR unit, using a spin-echo T1-weighted sequence, 2DFLASH, 3DFLASH, and 3DVIBE. The signal intensity was measured and the contrast enhancement ratio (CER) was calculated and plotted as a function of Gd concentration. The results were compared between the pulse sequences, and between the contrast media as well. Both 3DFLASH and 3DVIBE showed higher CER than other two sequences, showing similar CER curve configuration. There was no significant difference both in CER value and CER curve configuration between the two contrast media for each pulse sequence.
