Cochlear implantation (CI) is the treatment of choice in bilateral labyrinthitis ossificans (LO). The aim of this clinical case study was to evaluate audiologic and subjective outcomes after CI treatment for unilateral hearing loss (UHL) because of LO and to identify optimal timing for treatment.

Three subjects (age 40, 54, and 68 yr) with UHL because of LO were enrolled. Duration of deafness was 1.5, 12, and 120 months.

After extensive consultation, testing with conventional contralateral routing of signal hearing aid and bone-anchored hearing instrument, CI candidacy was confirmed and CI surgery performed.

Test of open-set speech recognition in background noise and sound localization were performed preoperatively, in unaided and aided conditions, and in the CI-aided condition, at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Subjective assessment via the Speech, Spatial and Qualities scale (SSQ) and the Tinnitus Visual Analogue Scale was performed at preimplant and 12 months postimplant.

The data show moderate-to-high hearing benefit after CI in 2 cases and no benefit for the third. SSQ and tinnitus scales show benefit from CI use in both cases. CI treatment should be performed as early as possible, ideally before signs of obliteration are evident. Counseling on all rehabilitation options is important.
