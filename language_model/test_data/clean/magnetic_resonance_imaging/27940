Stenosis of the tracheobronchial tree can be a life-threatening problem. Management options for symptomatic stenosis include serial dilation, cryotherapy, laser resection, and open surgical correction. Recently, balloon angioplasty catheters have been used to dilate stenotic airway segments. The experience in infants is limited and has for the most part utilized guide wires and fluoroscopy for balloon placement. We present two infants with symptomatic bronchial stenosis who underwent endoscopic angioplasty balloon catheter dilation. Operative technique involved catheter placement under direct vision with a rigid bronchoscope. Catheters (6F) with 8-mm-diameter balloons were used. Balloon expansion was controlled with a hand-held manometer. Both infants demonstrated significant lumen size improvement intraoperatively and marked clinical improvement postoperatively, substantiated by endoscopy and radiographs. One infant has required one repeat dilation and has subsequently been asymptomatic. The other infant has had no further respiratory problems. Our technique, using a rigid bronchoscope with direct visualization of catheter placement, obviates the need for guide wires and C-arm fluoroscopy as previously described. Endoscopic placement enables direct visualization of balloon position, and fine adjustments are possible if further dilation is necessary. Rigid bronchoscopic balloon catheter dilation can be a successful technique for bronchial stenosis and should be considered prior to attempting more invasive surgical correction.
