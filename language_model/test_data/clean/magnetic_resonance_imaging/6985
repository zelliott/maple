The correlations in the fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI signal between anatomically distinct regions of the cortex that are known components of functional systems have been previously studied as possible indicators of functional connectivity. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of sensorimotor brain activity, as assessed by task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), on functional connectivity indices in the same region. Regions of activation for sequential finger motion were determined using a task-based, block-design fMRI study. Functional connectivity measurements based on interregional correlations were acquired at rest and during continuous, sequential finger motion. Connectivity indices were determined using normalized mean correlations within and between three regions of interest activated for the finger motion task. Connectivity indices were also determined for a control region that was not activated for the task. Continuous motor tasks performed during BOLD measurements did not significantly affect the functional connectivity as compared to the connectivity at rest within or between regions known to be activated by the task. However, there appeared to be a trend suggesting a slight reduction in connectivity indices during the motor task. The connectivity within and between those areas not activated for the task remained unchanged between conditions. These results suggest that in the motor system investigated, the recruitment of neurons to perform a specific task may moderately reduce the degree of hemodynamic coupling within and between regions.
