A survey is given of the clinical picture, diagnosis and management of foramen jugulare paragangliomas (JFP), based on reports of 175 cases from the literature and personal experience of 26 cases. Special emphasis is given to the operative techniques. Improvements of diagnostic possibilities as well as operative techniques, including the pre-operative occlusion of tumour-feeding arteries by endovascular methods have markedly reduced the operative mortality to a rate between 0 and 5 percent. The rate of incomplete removal of C and D tumours dropped to about 15%. But very large and extensive tumours remain a real challenge. Teamwork between neuroradiologists, ENT-surgeons and neurosurgeons is mandatory.
