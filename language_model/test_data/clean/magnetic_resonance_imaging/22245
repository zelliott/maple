Before MRI can be used for guiding vascular interventions, the problem of dependably visualizing guidewires must be solved. Ideally, the position and curvature of the tip of the guidewire should be visible to facilitate steering through the vascular system. In this paper, various antennas are described that can be incorporated into a guidewire tip. These antennas allow the guidewire to be visualized with high contrast. Computer simulation and experimental evidence are presented showing the value of adding a passive MR signal source, with a short T1, internal to the coil. The internal source increases the available signal, narrows the apparent width of the guidewire, and allows the use of fast imaging sequences.
