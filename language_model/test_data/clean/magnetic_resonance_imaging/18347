Aortic dissection can be a life threatening condition which requires an early diagnosis. As initial signs and symptoms may be nonspecific and confusing, reliable imaging techniques are requested for immediate and accurate diagnosis. This retrospective study of 27 patients with proven aortic dissection assesses the relative value of angiography, CT, and MR imaging. Contribution of these imaging modalities is discussed and illustrated. Aortic dissection was correctly identified by angiography and CT respectively in 100% and 83% of the cases. MRI was diagnostic in all six examined cases. Both angiography and CT proved to be reliable imaging modalities; in addition, they can be easily performed in the critically ill patient. We consider MRI useful in the evaluation of suspected dissection in stable patients and follow-up of medical or surgical therapy.
