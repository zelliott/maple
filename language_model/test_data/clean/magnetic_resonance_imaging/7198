Two groups of substernal goiters should be considered fist; the "simples" ones localised in the anterior and superior part of the mediastin. They are most common and less dangerous. By opposition to the "complexes" ones which have relation with the vessels, the airways and the digestive tube. That surgeons would like to approach with security. The study of those retrosternal goiters requires two categories of complementary examinations. One for diagnosis: X Ray standard of the neck and the chest; Echography Biopsy and Radioactive Iodine scintigraphy. Others for localisations to prevent the risks, particularly vascular seeing in the surgery of the substernal goiters: TDM and IRM.
