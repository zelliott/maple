We used magnetic resonance imaging to differentiate residual and recurrent lung cancer from the surrounding radiation pulmonary fibrosis in a 62-year-old patient. The cancer's signal intensity was greater than the fibrotic lung tissue's intensity in an ECG-gated image with relatively short repetition and echo times and, also, in images with long repetition and echo times.
