Transcatheter chemo-embolization (TCE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was performed on 31 patients, and on 4 of the 31 patients, it was performed twice. The patients were examined by MR both before TCE and after TCE (1 week and 4-5 weeks respectively). On MR images, the change of the tumor signal intensity was classified into 3 groups. In group 1, (G1, 8 cases), obvious change of intensity was seen in the whole tumor. In group 2, (G2, 10 cases), it was seen in some parts of the tumor and in group 3, (G3, 17 cases), only a very slight change of intensity was seen in the whole tumor. In G1 and G2, the rate of AFP decrease was remarkable, but in G3, it was very slight. In G1 and G2, the change of the tumor signal intensity was divided into 2 types on a T2 weighted image. One, is the increase of the intensity, (6 cases). The other, is decrease of intensity, (12 cases). The former seemed to reflect the intra-tumoral hemorrhage accompanying tumor necrosis, the latter, seemed to reflect the coagulation necrosis. The ring of low and high intensity around the tumor appeared anew in 11 cases, and in 2 cases, it increased in size. These changes which have never been recognized on CT images, were thought to be a granulation tissue around the tumor. The influence of the accumulated lipiodol is slight for the change of intensity on the tumor.
