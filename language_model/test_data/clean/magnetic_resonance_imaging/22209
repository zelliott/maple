Previous studies have suggested that adenosine antagonists can interfere with normal glucose uptake in perfused rat heart. In the present studies, fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to study the effect of the adenosine antagonist, BW-A1433U, on the equilibrium exchange of fluorinated glucose analogs in human erythrocytes. Studies of the equilibrium exchange of both 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and 3-fluoro-3-deoxy-D-glucose with either one-dimensional magnetization transfer or two-dimensional exchange spectroscopy were performed, and significant inhibition was observed in all cases. From concentration-dependent studies, an inhibition constant for the equilibrium exchange measured at 37 degrees C of 24 microM was determined.
