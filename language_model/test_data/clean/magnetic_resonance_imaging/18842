Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a term for nondemented individuals with memory complaints and deficits greater than age-adjusted normal performance. Functional MRI (fMRI) may be a more sensitive method than other techniques to reveal functional abnormalities in individuals with MCI, only a proportion of whom progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD). fMRI was carried out while subjects (four MCI, five age-matched normal controls, and one AD) performed incidental encoding (deep and shallow) and recognition tasks for colored and black and white photographs contrasted to baseline fixation. fMRI revealed interesting dissociations between activation patterns and behavioral performance when comparing the MCI and AD to the NC.
