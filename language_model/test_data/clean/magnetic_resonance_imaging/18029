Cushing's disease in children is not rare but in infants it is quite rare and an important medical condition needing proper line of investigations and management options. Craniopharyngioma as a cause of Cushing's disease is well reported and practical inference of the condition is of clinical importance. Craniopharyngioma generally affects children at 5 - 10 years of age and is rarely seen in infancy. It usually manifests as endocrinological deficits such as short stature, delayed puberty, and obesity. We report the case of a 7 months old infant who presented with obesity and Cushing's disease associated with craniopharyngioma.
