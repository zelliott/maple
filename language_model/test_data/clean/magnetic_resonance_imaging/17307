This paper describes the construction of three dimensional (3D) encapsulation devices in large numbers, using a novel self-assembling strategy characterized by high mechanical stability, controlled porosity, extreme miniaturization, high reproducibility and the possibility of integrating sensing and actuating electromechanical modules. We demonstrated encapsulation of microbeads and cells within the containers, thereby demonstrating one possible application in cell encapsulation therapy. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the containers in fluidic media suggest radio frequency (RF) shielding and a susceptibility effect, providing characteristic hypointensity within the container, thereby allowing the containers to be easily detected. This demonstration is the first step toward the design of 3D, micropatterned, non-invasively trackable, encapsulation devices.
