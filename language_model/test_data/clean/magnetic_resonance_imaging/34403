Our goal was to determine the efficacy of MRI with rectal administration of perflubron in the evaluation of perirectal and pelvic fistulae, with an emphasis on development of an improved method for fistula visualization.

Fourteen pelvic and/or perirectal fistulae were evaluated in nine patients with MRI after the rectal administration of 200 ml of perflubron. Images were reviewed by two independent readers and evaluated for the presence or absence of fistulae. Qualitative assessment was also performed, rating the examinations for the ability to visualize the fistulae. Comparison was made with the clinical examination and/or operative findings, as well as available preperflubron imaging studies (CT = 10; fluoroscopy = 1; preperflubron MRI = 4).

MRI with rectal perflubron demonstrated all 14 fistulae (100%), while preperflubron imaging demonstrated only 7 of 14 (50%) fistulae (p < or = 0.008, Wilcoxon signed rank test). In addition, MRI with perflubron resulted in significantly improved qualitative visualization of fistulae (overall very good rating versus poor rating for preperflubron imaging, p < or = 0.006, Wilcoxon signed rank test).

MRI with rectal perflubron is a superior modality for imaging of fistulae, compared with conventional methods, since it allows a noninvasive means of demonstrating the presence of a fistula as well as offers improved qualitative assessment of fistulous disease.
