To determine the usefulness of extremely low field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of renal masses 19 patients with 15 tumors (13 renal and 2 renal pelvic carcinomas) and 8 cysts were examined in a 0.02 tesla MRI unit. The findings were compared with results of computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound. Cavography was performed in 6 patients. MRI enabled differentiation between cysts and solid tumors. Tumor extension into the inferior vena cava could be demonstrated in one case and liver metastases in two patients. The image quality was inferior to that reported at higher field strengths and the tumors were more precisely staged by CT and ultrasound. At present, it is unlikely that low field MRI will play any substantial role in the evaluation of renal masses.
