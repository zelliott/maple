The objectives of this article are to discuss the 10 distinct patterns of superior labral anteroposterior (SLAP) tears to facilitate adequate diagnosis and treatment. Correlations with clinical presentation, mechanism of injury, and treatment will enhance understanding.

Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of SLAP tears. Knowledge of glenolabral anatomy, related structures and variants, proper imaging techniques, and a systematic approach to MRI interpretation is important in the diagnosis and treatment planning of the 10 types of SLAP lesions. Arthroscopy offers a means for definitive diagnosis.
