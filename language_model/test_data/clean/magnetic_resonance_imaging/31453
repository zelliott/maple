The changes in Stensen's duct and remaining parotid tissue following superficial parotidectomy have not been studied previously. The aim of this clinical case control study is to describe these changes using sialography and CT-sialography techniques. Fourteen superficial parotidectomy cases underwent parotid sialography bilaterally. CT sialography was also done. Stensen's duct was patent in 11 cases (79%), and non-patent in three cases (21%). Its angle in relation to our reference line was 20 degrees in operated cases versus 37 degrees for the non-operated cases. Following superficial parotidectomy, the remaining parotid tissues usually remain functional and retain drainage through Stensen's duct. Furthermore, superficial parotidectomy changes the direction of this duct. Parotid sialography and CT sialography can still be used to study the status of remaining parotid tissue following superficial parotidectomy. The post-surgical changes should be reviewed with care before interpreting these studies.
