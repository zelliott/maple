We report two cases of large lipomas arising from the proximal thigh with an extremely uncommon shape. The tumors were elastic soft and movable. MRI examination revealed both tumors with high signal intensity as fatty tissue on both T1 and T2-weighted images. Needle biopsy of the specimens revealed lipoma. Marginal excision was carried out for both cases because of the patients' discomfort. No recurrence was found three and five years after surgery, respectively.
