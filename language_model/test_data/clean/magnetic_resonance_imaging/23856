A 36-year-old man presented with spinal myoclonus, ataxia, hearing loss, and unilateral pupillary dilation. MRI demonstrated hemosiderin deposition along the superficial surfaces of the brain, brainstem, cerebellum, and spine. The pupillary changes were localized to the preganglionic oculomotor nerve. In contrast to vasculopathic oculomotor nerve palsies, superficial siderosis may cause selective involvement of the superficially located pupillary fibers.
