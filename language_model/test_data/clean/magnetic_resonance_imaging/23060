The extent of resection marks one prognostic factor for patients with malignant gliomas. Among the methods used for the intraoperative control of the extent of resection, intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (ioMRI) has become a very attractive method. It was introduced in the in the final decade of the last century. The first available system was a low magnetic field strength unit employing 0.5 Tesla (T). While currently high-field systems (1.5 T and above) are being developed, different low-field ioMRI systems (0.5 T and below) have been used for brain tumor resection in far more centers than high-field ioMRI, corresponding to a greater number of publications. Undoubtedly, high-field ioMRI systems offer superior image quality and faster acquisition times. Yet, low-field ioMRI has influenced intraoperative decision-making and improved brain tumor resection. With this article, we review the use of low-field ioMRI in glioma surgery.
