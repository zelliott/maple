A 34-year-old man visited the hospital with chief complaints of headache, fever, and disturbance of consciousness. In view of his clinical condition, the course of the disease, and results of examination, he was diagnosed with viral meningitis and treated accordingly. However, his clinical condition worsened, and MRI revealed abnormal signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum, in the basal ganglia and in the internal capsule, as well as the presence of severe inflammation in the base of the brain. Since he had a high ADA level in the cerebrospinal fluid and was consequently suspected to have tuberculous meningitis, he was placed on antitubercular agents. Then, his clinical condition began to improve. Additional steroid pulse therapy further improved his condition, and abnormal signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the basal ganglia resolved. This valuable case suggests that an immune mechanism contributed to the occurrence of central nervous system symptoms associated with tuberculous meningitis.
