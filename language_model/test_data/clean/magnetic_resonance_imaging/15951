Chronic hyponatraemia and its therapy is a common and often underestimated problem of hospitalized patients. Usually, hyponatraemia is just one of many laboratory features found in such patients. However, rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia can have devastating neurological consequences, i.e. osmotic myelinolysis. In the following, we describe the mechanisms leading to myelinolysis due to rapid correction of hyponatraemia and answer the questions how much, and at which rate to correct chronic hyponatremia.
