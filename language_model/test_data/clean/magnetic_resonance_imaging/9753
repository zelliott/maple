A chronic expanding hematoma can persist and increase in volume for more than 1 month after the first hemorrhage. It is rare, uncommon in the hand, little known among physicians, and an imitator of malignancy. Our purpose was to report a case of this condition in the soft tissues of an 8-year-old girl's hand that simulated an aggressive lesion, and to conduct a review on this subject.
