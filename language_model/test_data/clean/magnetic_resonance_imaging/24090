This article reviews the experience available to date on microcirculation assessment in cancer of the cervix including correlation studies of magnetic resonance (MR) microcirculatory parameters with histo-morphometric predictors and direct correlation with patient outcome. The data suggest that MR microcirculation parameters do not always correlate with histo-morphometric parameters, while there is evidence that MR parameters predict patients' treatment outcome. These observations raise the issue that perhaps the histo-morphometric parameters, accepted gold standards for tumor angiogenesis and prognostic factors, reflect anatomical information at a "static" single time point and may not always provide sufficient information on the "dynamic" microcirculation function of the tumor. MR microcirculation assessment reflects both anatomical and functional information and may provide this additional information on the "dynamic" angiogenic and metabolic status of a tumor. Therefore, assessment of tumor microcirculation may augment the individual risk profile in cervical cancer patients and has the potential to impact on therapy selection and treatment outcome.
