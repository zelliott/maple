Three cases of lumbosacral meningomyelocele associated with cranium bifidum are reported. The meningomyeloceles were of the neural placode type and the cranium bifidum was an interfrontal encephalomeningocele in all cases. Two of the patients received ventriculoperitoneal shunts and had evidence of type II Chiari malformation on magnetic resonance imaging. No evidence of a Chiari malformation was revealed in the third patient. We discuss the etiology of the rare coexistence of these two major malformations.
