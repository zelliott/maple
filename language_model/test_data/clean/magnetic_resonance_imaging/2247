Assessment of the morphology of the urinary tract by gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T1-weighted MR-urography (MRU) and precontrast diuretic injection.

MRU was performed in 5 patients using Gd-DTPA-enhanced coronal T1-weighted 3D-gradient-echo sequences with different spatial resolution. Prior to contrast injection, 10 mg of furosemide were administered intravenously.

Secondary to the precontrast furosemide injection, the increase of the renal excretion rate allows complete visualisation of the entire collecting system within 10 minutes following Gd injection. Maximum intensity projections provide a three-dimensional overview of the ureters separate from the bladder. To achieve detailed anatomic imaging of the calices, both optimal distension and high resolution sequences are prerequisites which cannot be realized by means of survey urograms only.

Contrast-enhanced excretory MRU performed after injection of a diuretic offers a rapid approach to visualising the morphology of the nondilated urinary tract. Imaging of caliceal details must be done with high-resolution 3D-gradient-echo sequences.
