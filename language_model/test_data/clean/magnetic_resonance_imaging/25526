With the advent of laparoscopic surgery, a method characterized by a surgeon's lack of direct contact with the patient's organs and tissue and the availability of magnified video images, it has become possible to incorporate computer and robotic technologies into surgical procedures. Computer technology has the ability to enhance, compress, and transmit video signals and other information over long distances. These technical advances have had a profound effect on surgical procedures and on the surgeons themselves because they are changing the way surgery is taught and learned. This article provides an overview of the most important advances and issues developing from the use of computer and robotic technologies in surgery.
