Between 1989 and 1996, 21 skeletally immature patients were treated for osteosarcoma of the extremity. Their average age was 12.6 years (range 9-16 years). We classified the location and extent of the lesion in bone on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with reference to the growth plate and joint margin into five subtypes. This classification served as a guide for the level of resection and the type of reconstruction required for a limb salvage procedure. All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy using a modified T10 protocol before the definitive operation. These patients were followed up for periods ranging from 11-86 months, with a mean of 35. 5 months. Patients were assessed for (1) local tumour recurrence, (2) metastatic disease, (3) allograft complications and (4) extremity function and joint stability. Excellent function was retained in 2, good in 13 and fair function in 6 patients. The MRI classification proved useful for the resection and provides an insight into the possible functional outcomes.
