To describe the steady-state free-precession MR sequence and its application to the study of the inner ear.

The inner ear was imaged with CT and a 0.5-T MR unit in three dimension, to evaluate the various signals from the lumen of the labyrinth.

Normally, the signal from the perilymphatic and endolymphatic spaces is homogeneous. However, among our cases of neurosensory deafness, differences of signal and morphology were seen in patients with otosclerosis, ossifying labyrinthitis, and inner ear malformations.

Three-dimensional MR, used together with routine two-dimensional fast spin-echo, is another diagnostic too]l that can provide new data in the evaluation of the normal and unhealthy inner ear.
