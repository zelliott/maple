Prosthetic joint infection is a well-described complication following primary joint replacement. The association between an epidural abscess and joint replacement surgery following the use of epidural anaesthetics has been previously documented. There is however, no report in the literature of an epidural abscess forming as a result of haematogenous spread from an infected prosthetic joint. This case report presents such a scenario and highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of infected prosthetic joints to avoid further systemic complications.
