The presentation of subdural hematoma is often more subtle in the elderly than in younger patients, due in part to cerebral atrophy and in part to the interaction with other medical conditions to which the elderly are prone. With the advent of computed tomography, the diagnosis of subdural hematoma has become easier and noninvasive. This improvement in diagnostic capability has enhanced the understanding of the epidemiology and presentation of subdural hematomas in the elderly. The role of magnetic resonance imaging is also discussed, as is the pathophysiology, management, and prognosis in the elderly patient.
