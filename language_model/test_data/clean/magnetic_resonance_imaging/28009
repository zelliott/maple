New and exciting vascular imaging technologies are assuming increasingly important roles in the management of vascular disease. Non-invasive modalities such as computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and duplex ultrasound supplement the information obtained by invasive techniques including angiography, angioscopy and intraluminal ultrasound. This paper outlines the modern and developing vascular imaging techniques that are rapidly becoming integral components of therapeutic devices as well as advanced diagnostic systems.
