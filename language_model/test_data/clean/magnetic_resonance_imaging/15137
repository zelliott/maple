Neurological symptoms rapidly resolve after a transitory ischemic attack (TIA). Diffusion-weighted MRI and new clinical studies have greatly increased our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical impact of TIA. This review presents an update on pathophysiology, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of TIA.

This article is based on our clinical experience, European guidelines for acute cerebrovascular disease and recent medical literature found by searching Medline.

TIA is a warning of a potential cerebrovascular disaster. About 10-13% of TIA patients will have a stroke within a few months, half of them within a few days. A more urgent approach to TIA diagnosis and treatment should prevent many strokes and deaths. All TIA patients should therefore be referred as an emergency to a stroke unit.
