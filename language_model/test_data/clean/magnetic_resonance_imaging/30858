Statistically tumors are the most likely cause of space-occupying intracranial lesions. However, many non-neoplastic diseases also manifest as mass lesions and may be indistinguishable from tumors. The most common of these are inflammatory and dysplastic lesions, which intraaxially imitate mostly glioma, lymphoma, and metastases and extraaxially meningeoma and neurinoma. Aside from a willingness on the part of the diagnostic radiologist to question the most obvious diagnosis, on clinical history and findings are prerequisites for a sound radiological differential diagnosis. The aim of this article is to provide a practical overview of the differential diagnosis of intracranial mass lesions with emphasis on non-neoplastic abnormalities.
