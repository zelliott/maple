Subpubic cartilaginous cysts are rare cystic lesions that have been radiologically identified only in recent years, and the our understanding of the cautions to be observed in the diagnostic approach and the radiologic characteristics is still incomplete. The medical literature search revealed three reported cases of a subpubic cartilaginous cyst diagnosed histopathologically and one case that was suggested by radiological findings. Definitive diagnosis of all the cases was confirmed by excisional biopsy. This report discusses the radiological features and the important issues necessary in the diagnostic approach of subpubic cartilaginous cysts.
