Orbital cavitary rhabdomyosarcoma has been previously reported in 2 cases. The case presented here was a 15-year-old boy who had proptosis, pain, periorbital hyperemia, and visual loss in his OD, which progressed in 6 weeks. Radiologic studies demonstrated a well-demarcated, multilobulated, large mass with cavities, extending from the anterior orbit to the apex, suggesting a diagnosis of venolymphatic malformation with an intrinsic hemorrhage. On surgery, a multilobular, hemorrhagic cystic mass was almost completely excised. Histologic examination revealed a diagnosis of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. After postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the tumor did not recur during a follow-up period of 45 months. This case, together with the previous ones, suggests that cavitary orbital rhabdomyosarcomas may have some distinct clinical, radiologic, and surgical characteristics.
