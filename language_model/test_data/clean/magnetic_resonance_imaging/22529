Extracranial metastases of pineal germinomas are rare.

The case of a metastasis of a primary intracranial germ cell tumor via a temporary-ventriculo-peritoneal shunt as a cause of acute abdominal pain is reported. The germ cell tumor markers were useful in establishing the diagnosis.

With an appropriate clinical history, intra-abdominal metastases via a temporary ventriculo-peritoneal shunt should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain.
