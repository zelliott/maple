Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is a type of highly malignant soft tissue sarcoma with a predilection for the extremities of adults. We report a patient with MFH in the infraspinatus muscle for which wide resection including total resection of the infraspinatus muscle was performed, followed by transfer of the latissimus dorsi muscle for shoulder reconstruction in a one-stage operation with good postoperative function.
