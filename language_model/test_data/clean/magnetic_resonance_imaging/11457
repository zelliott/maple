The present study investigated changes in neuronal activation with fMRI related to Honig's model of working memory, which is much less studied compared with other working memory models. In contrast to other studies which have applied recognition procedures, the primary aim with the present study was to examine brain activation when subjects had to continuously recall and forget items held in working memory. The results showed that the mid-ventrolateral frontal cortex was particularly activated in the left hemisphere, whereas the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex was particularly activated in the right hemisphere during execution of the working memory task. The findings are discussed in relation to process- and domain-specific accounts of working memory.
