Magnetic resonance imaging is the optimal modality for characterizing the ligaments, tendons, muscles, and neurovascular structures of the wrist and hand. Continued refinement in pulse sequence and coil design permits high-resolution examination of the many small structures and complex anatomy of this region. In this context, frequent anatomic variants and common false positives such as normal areas of high signal intensity in ligaments and tendons must be recognized to avoid misdiagnosis and improper treatment. This article discusses the osseous and soft tissue anatomy of the wrist and hand, as well as normal variants.
