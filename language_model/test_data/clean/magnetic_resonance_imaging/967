The objective of our study was to evaluate the success rate for radiofrequency ablation of renal tumors and to determine the risk of serious complications.

No serious complications occurred after 27 CT-guided radiofrequency ablation sessions in 22 patients. In total, no residual tumor was detected on follow-up contrast-enhanced CT or MRI 1-35 months (mean, 7 months) after final tumor ablation in 20 (91%) of 22 patients. Two patients with residual viable tumor deferred further treatment. Complete tumor ablation was achieved after a single treatment session in 83% of patients, and in 8% of patients after subsequent ablation sessions. Size was the major determinant for achieving tumor eradication with a single session of ablation, with all 11 tumors 3 cm or smaller being completely ablated after one session. Tumor location, histology, and the presence of renal disease did not correlate with treatment success. Contrast-enhanced CT performed immediately after ablation is reliable to exclude residual viable tumor. CT-guided radiofrequency ablation of renal tumors is safe and has a high rate of success in the treatment of small renal tumors, with no evidence of recurrence at midterm follow-up of treated patients.
