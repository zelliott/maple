35 kidney transplanted patients (15 without pathological findings and 20 with histologically proven chronic rejection) were investigated with a combination of dynamic MR and bolus application of Gd-DTPA. The occurrence of susceptibility artifacts and T2 effects at the junction between papilla and renal calix were analysed. There are two groups of patients. The first one shows only artifacts due to susceptibility. The second group indicates the so-called "dark ring pattern" (susceptibility artifacts and T2 effects). These effects are discussed in terms of their dependence on concentration and their dependence on the degree of transplant malfunction. The appearance of "dark-ring patterns" and of susceptibility artifacts indicate the functional status of the glomerular filters.
