We report a patient with cervical hematomyelia associated with oral anticoagulant therapy, which is a very rare case. Intraspinal hemorrhage is a rare but life-threatening complication of anticoagulant therapy. Early diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prevents major morbidity and mortality from intraspinal hemorrhage.
