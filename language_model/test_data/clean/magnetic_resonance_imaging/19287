Neurocysticercosis produces a variety of neurologic syndromes resulting from the cysticerci infestation of the central nervous system by the larvae of Taenia solium. Because of increased immigration to the United States from endemic areas, the incidence of neurocysticercosis has increased, especially in California, Texas, Arizona, and other southwestern states. Neuroimaging studies play a significant role in the diagnosis and management of patients with neurocysticercosis.
