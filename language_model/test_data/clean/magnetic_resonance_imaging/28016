Adamantinoma of the long bones in a very rare tumor that mainly affects the tibia. Its diagnosis is difficult both radiologically, as the lesion appears as a poorly specific metaphyseal lacuna with or without periosteal reaction, and histologically. Its prognosis used to be guarded because of recurrence and of possible metastatic diffusion, but it has been considerably improved by wide resection with reconstruction. On the occasion of a new case, the authors describe the appearance observed with MRI and the merits of this examination for the preoperative assessment.
