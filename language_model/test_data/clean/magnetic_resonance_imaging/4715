We examined a 74-year-old man because of difficulty seeing green and the presence of prosopagnosia. His visual acuity was 0.8 in both eyes. He was not congenitally color blind, and there was no family history of color blindness. A left superior homonymous quadrantanopsia was found. The dyschromatopsia ws identical in both eyes. The patient showed red-green deficiency on testing with Ishihara plates a deutan defect with Tokyo Medical College plates, strong blue-yellow defects and medium red-green defects with Standard Pseudochromatic Plates II and a tritan defect with the Panel D-15. He failed the New Color separation test with scores of 160 and could not carry out the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test, but his color naming test results were normal. Visual evoked cortical potentials to black-and-white checkerboard and color pattern reversal (Red and Blue-Green, Green and Red-Purple, Purple and Yellow-Green: isochromatic paired checks) stimuli were normal. Bilateral inferior occipital lesions were found by computed tomography and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Our findings suggested that luminance and color channels up to area 17 in our patient were intact. We believe that our patient's acquired cerebral dyschromatopsia is rare.
