In this work, we aimed at correlating focal atrophy in periventricular structures with cognitive function, in the spectrum from healthy subjects to severe Alzheimer disease: 28 subjects with normal cognition and 84 patients presenting various degrees of cognitive impairment were included in the study. The cognitive level of each subject was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Atrophy in periventricular structures was inferred by modeling and analyzing local shape variations of brain ventricles: for a given subject, we distinguished between the severity of atrophy, estimated as local enlargement (in mm) of the ventricular surface relative to an average normal subject, and the extent of atrophy, defined as the percentage of the ventricular surface (global or per anatomical region) significantly different from an average control. Linear regression across subjects was performed to evaluate the correlation between atrophy and MMSE score. The severity of atrophy showed good correlation with MMSE score in the left thalamus, the left temporal horn, the left corona radiata, and the right caudate nuclei. The extent of atrophy showed no significant correlations. In conclusion, the MMSE scores correlate with localized depth of atrophy in well-defined periventricular structures.
