Adrenocortical carcinomas frequently hypersecrete multiple adrenocortical steroids and their precursors. CT scan and MRI usually demonstrate necrotic lesions or areas of calcification in this uncommon tumor. Therapy in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma is less satisfactory. Surgical excision is the primary mode of therapy. Up to the present, mitotane (o, p'-DDD) treatment combined with chemotherapy has been the only palliative measure for patients with nonresectable or extensively recurrent tumors.
