To describe the case of a 16-year-old patient with nanophthalmic uveal effusion associated with renal failure that was treated with scleral window surgery and topical administration of mitomycin C (MMC).

Case report.

Total uveal effusion was restored in the nanophthalmic eyes. Partial-thickness scleral flap with deep sclerostomy was performed and topical MMC was administered to one quadrant of the equatorial sclera. The subretinal fluid resorbed gradually.

Topical MMC might relieve the blocked transscleral outflow of intraocular fluid in the small area of a sclerostomy in young patients with nanophthalmos or in patients with renal failure in whom uveal effusion occurs repeatedly.
