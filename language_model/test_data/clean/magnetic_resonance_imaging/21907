Nodular liver infiltration with multiple myeloma is very rare and its findings on MR images have not been, to our knowledge, previously described. The authors report a case of light chain multiple myeloma nodular liver involvement and describe its appearance on US and MRI. Despite their rarity these lesions have distinct MRI features and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of multiple lesions with high SI on T1-weighted images.
