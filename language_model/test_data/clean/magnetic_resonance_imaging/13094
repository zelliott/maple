Conventional whole-body MRI at 1.5 T does not provide adequate image quality of small fetuses, thus reducing its potential for use as an alternative to invasive autopsy. High-field whole-body MRI at 9.4 T provides good images of small animals. We therefore compared the diagnostic usefulness of high-field MRI with conventional MRI for post-mortem examination of human fetuses.

We did whole-body MRI at 9.4 T and 1.5 T on 18 fetuses of less than 22 weeks' gestation, using three-dimensional T(2)-weighted fast-spin echo sequences, before doing invasive autopsy. Images obtained with MRI for each system were compared with the findings of invasive autopsy in a blinded manner. Tissue contrast of 14 different regions was compared on 1.5 T and 9.4 T images that were provided by paediatric radiologists separately and in a random order, and image quality was scored on a four-point scale. The primary endpoint was diagnostic accuracy.

Spatial resolution, tissue contrast, and image quality of all organ systems were much better with high-field MRI than with conventional MRI. All structural abnormalities that were detected with invasive autopsy and internal examination of visceral organs were also detected with high-field MRI, whereas conventional MRI was not diagnostically useful in 14 (78%) cases.

Whole-body high-field MRI is a feasible option for post-mortem examination of human fetuses, and can provide good tissue characterisation even in small fetuses (5 g). The use of MRI at 9.4 T might be helpful in the development of a minimally invasive perinatal autopsy system.
