We present a technique to measure the longitudinal relaxation time constant of venous blood (T(1b) ) in vivo in a few seconds. The MRI sequence consists of a thick-slab adiabatic inversion, followed by a series of slice-selective excitations and single-shot echo planar imaging readouts. The time intervals between excitations were chosen so that blood in macroscopic vessels is fully refreshed between excitations, making the blood signal follow an unperturbed inversion recovery curve. Static tissue, which experiences the inversion and all excitation pulses, quickly reaches a steady state at a low signal as a result of partial saturation. This allows blood-filled voxels to be discriminated from those containing static tissue, and to be fitted voxel-by-voxel to a simple inversion recovery model. The sequence was tested on a flow phantom with the proposed method, yielding T(1) values consistent to within 3% of those obtained using a conventional inversion recovery sequence with a spin-echo readout. The method was applied to seven adult volunteers and 18 neonates. The blood T(1) of the neonates (1799 ± 206 ms; range, 1393-2035 ms) was found to be more variable than that of adults (1717 ± 39 ms; range, 1662-1779 ms). A linear correlation between the inverse of T(1b) and the haematocrit was established in 12 neonates (R(2)  = 0.90).
