The potentialities of NMR-tomography in renal cancer patients with symptomatic hypertension were assessed. Altogether 15 patients (9 men and 6 women) aged 24 to 74 were investigated; previously examined 25 persons were entered into the control group. A NMR-tomograph with the magnitude of the magnetic field of 0.235 T using the "spin-echo" method. The results of the investigation were compared with those of the control group and with the results of x-ray computerized tomography, abdominal aortography, dynamic scintigraphy of the kidneys, and ultrasound investigation. NMR-tomography was shown to possess high resolution permitting visualization of a kidney tumor irrespective of its site and its size exceeding 2-3 cm. It also permits obtaining additional data on the state of the kidney parenchyma, cortical and medullary substance, determining the level of ureteral obstruction, and detecting the presence of vertebral metastases.
