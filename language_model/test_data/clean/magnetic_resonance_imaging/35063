The objective of our study was to assess the negative predictive value (NPV) of double-contrast MRI (DC-MRI) with SPIO and gadolinium, and to determine the role of DC-MRI in screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients.

We retrospectively included 160 DC-MRI scans done as second-line investigations in 119 patients with cirrhosis over a 25-month period. Two radiologists independently classified the MRI scans as strongly suggesting HCC (HCC Group), showing benign nodules (benign nodules Group), showing no nodules (no-nodules Group) or indeterminate; they assigned a diagnostic confidence score (DCS) using a 0-10 scale. The reference standard was histology or results of follow-up investigations. Mean follow-up was 16.9 months (12-28 months).

The radiologists disagreed for two scans (kappa = 0.98). Of 112 scans [benign nodules Group (n = 32) and no-nodules Group (n = 80)], 11 were excluded (3 patients lost to follow-up and 8 who died with no known cancer) while a HCC was detected during follow-up in 8 patients, yielding a NPV of 92% (93/101) (95% confidence interval, 85%-97%). The DCS was in the 4-6 range (indicating uncertainty) for only 6 (3.75%) scans.

DC-MRI is reliable and reproducible. Its high NPV suggests a role as a second-line investigation after ultrasonography, for HCC screening.
