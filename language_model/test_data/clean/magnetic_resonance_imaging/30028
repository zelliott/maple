Infections of the parotid gland with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are rarely described. Here, we report on an infection of the parotid gland caused by Mycobacterium avium and give a literature-based overview about this entity. In the light of a global increase of mycobacterial infections, unusual manifestations have to be considered and should be included in the differential diagnosis when dealing with solid lesions of uncertain aetiology in the head and neck region.
