Neuropathic arthropathy (NA), or Charcot joint, is a chronic and progressive degenerative arthropathy associated with an underlying neurologic disorder. NA of the elbow is a rare entity, with few cases reported in the literature. We report the cases of 2 patients with NA of the elbow. In case 1, the probable etiology was an intramedullary lesion, most likely syringomyelia and likely diabetes mellitus. In case 2, the probable etiology was syringomyelia and likely diabetes mellitus. The aim in NA treatment is to manage the underlying disease and reduce the rate of deformity to its lowest level. Management of NA is usually conservative. The diagnosis of NA should be considered in destructive cases without an evident pain report, and the underlying neurologic problem should be addressed.
