Although the incidence of congenital heart disease remains constant among newborns, improved medical and surgical techniques have dramatically prolonged life expectancy and produced a new, growing group of patients harboring these lesions: adults with congenital heart disease. Conventional imaging techniques in these patients may be limited because of patient size, chest configuration, or poor ventricular function. MR imaging provides a noninvasive means of directly demonstrating their developmental abnormalities and the sequelae of pathophysiologic changes caused by these lesions. Combined use of spin echo and gradient reversal echo acquisition techniques allows complete evaluation of cardiac morphology and function in these patients. An new medical and surgical therapies prolong the lives of these patients, the role of MR imaging for physiologic assessment and surgical planning will expand further.
