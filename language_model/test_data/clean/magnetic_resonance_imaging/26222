We report on a boy with normal mental development who had muscle hypotonia and congenital dislocation of the hip and knee joints. Histochemical and biochemical examinations of his muscle specimen revealed no succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. Since the NADH cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase activities were normal, we concluded that he had an isolated SDH deficiency. Our patient provides further evidence for the clinical variability of this disorder.
