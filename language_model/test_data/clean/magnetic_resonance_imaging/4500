A new technique, based on adiabatic delays alternating with mutations for tailored excitation (DANTE) inversion sequences, is presented for generating uniform contrast tags across the myocardial wall even in the presence of B1 inhomogeneities. The utility of this pulse was demonstrated using a surface coil for both transmission and signal reception in phantom and animal heart tagging studies. The experimental data demonstrated uniform grid contrast over a sixfold variation of B1 magnitude, sharp tagging profiles, and the ability to follow the cardiac wall motion through the deformation of the fine rectangular tagging grid at different phases throughout the cardiac cycle.
