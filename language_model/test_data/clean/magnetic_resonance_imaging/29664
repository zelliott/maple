We report a case of an occult intrasacral meningocele. An 11-year-old boy presented with atypical bowel symptoms, severe constipation, and stool incontinence. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging disclosed an intrasacral cyst containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We diagnosed an occult intrasacral meningocele and performed perforation of the cyst and closure of the fistula. The patient was free from constipation and stool incontinence after the operation.

We discuss the clinical features and neuroradiological findings of this rare condition.
