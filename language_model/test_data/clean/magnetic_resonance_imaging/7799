A 52-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to shortness of breath that developed one week after the diagnosis of influenza infection. He had a past history of myocarditis associated with influenza B infection 16 years before the current admission. The patient's left ventricular function showed diffuse hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 28%. Due to the progression of heart failure, the infusion of catecholamines and insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump were required. The patient was discharged uneventfully on the 23rd hospital day. A significant increase in the serum antibody titer against influenza A virus subtype H3N2 led to a diagnosis of recurrent fulminant influenza myocarditis.
