We report a patient with methylmalonic acidemia who developed an acute extrapyramidal disorder after severe ketoacidosis. The neurologic findings resulted from bilateral destruction of the globus pallidus. A 10-year-old girl was the term product of an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Poor feeding and vomiting were noted after one month. She was hospitalized at 6 months of age with vomiting, coma and tachypnea. Analysis of urinary organic acids revealed a massive amount methylmalonic acid. She was not vitamin B 12-responsive and was maintained on a low-protein diet. At 33 months of age, she was able to walk and speak, but she developed acute severe ketoacidosis. Involuntary movements and spastic paraplegia became evident two days after admission. Subsequently, the patient has had metabolic ketoacidosis once or twice a year. Her intelligence quotient was 47. Neurologic examination revealed spastic paraplegia and generalized hypotonicity with mild dystonia. Some relief from dystonic symptoms has been obtained through the use of L-dopa. A brain CT scan at 5 years of age disclosed bilaterally symmetric lucencies of the globus pallidus. T2-weighted brain MRI at 8 years of age showed bilateral symmetric high intensities of the globus pallidus.
