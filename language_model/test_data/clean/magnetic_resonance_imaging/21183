Extranodal lymphoma of the head and neck comprises a heterogeneous group of tumours with different histological types, modes of presentation and prognosis. Lymphomatous involvement of skeletal muscles and particularly muscles of mastication and facial expression is extremely rare, but primary muscle lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of muscle masses. This article highlights clinical, radiological and histopathological findings of primary extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving masseter and buccinator muscles in an immunocompetent patient.
