The correlations between concentrations of the adhesive circulating molecules cICAM-1 and cVCAM-1 in the peripheral blood of patients with relapses-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in different clinical phases and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity are presented. The patients in clinically active phase with Gd-enhancing lesions had elevated blood levels of cICAM-1. However, 5 patients without Gd-enhancing lesions exhibited elevated cICAM-1 and cVCAM-1 levels in active phase comparing to those in remission stage that indicate a high level of sensibility of these immunologic parameters.
