A revision of 15 cases of back pain and radiological features characteristic of anterior or posterior limbus vertebrae is presented. We comment on the radiological findings observed in the various imaging studies performed (conventional radiology, CT and MRI), which were attributed to the herniation of disc material into the vertebral body. In three patients who were followed up 12 years after the diagnosis, the initial roentgenograms of limbus vertebrae progressed in adult hood into radiological images characteristic of Schmorl's hernia as a sequela.
