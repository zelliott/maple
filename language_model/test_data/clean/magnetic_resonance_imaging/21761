Two cases of paranasal schwannomas are reported. These tumors are rare. Its symptomatology is no specific explaining the late diagnosis. The contribution of radiology and endoscopy for this pathology is analysed. Ct scan and MRI state precisely the extension and the relations of the tumor. Endoscopy improves the endonasal exam pre and post operative and may be an option for the surgical treatment of these tumors. In connection with that we present an original approach of the pterygopalatine fossa under endoscopic control via the middle meatus.
