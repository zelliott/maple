A retrospective case series.

To demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and results of the posterior transpedicular approach for circumferential decompression and instrumented reconstruction of thoracolumbar spinal tumors.

Patients presenting with spinal tumor disease requiring 3-column instrumented stabilization are typically treated with a combined anterior and posterior surgical approach. However, circumferential decompression and instrumented stabilization may also be achieved through a single-stage, midline posterior transpedicular approach.

Fifty consecutive patients (27 women and 23 men) underwent surgery between 2003 and 2010 at a single institution by the senior author. Mean age was 55.9 years (range, 25-79 yr).Single or multilevel, contiguous subtotal vertebrectomy was performed ranging from T1 to L4 (38 thoracic and 12 lumbar). Three-column spinal stabilization was achieved using posterior pedicle screw fixation and vertebral body reconstruction, with a titanium cage introduced through the posterior transpedicular route. The mean follow-up period was 17 months (range, 1-54 mo).

The mean operating time was 4.2 hours. The mean estimated blood loss for a subgroup of 9 patients with hypervascular tumor pathology was 3933 mL (range, 2700-5800 mL). The mean blood loss in the remaining 41 patients was 1262 mL (range, 250-2500 mL).Postoperative neurological status was maintained or improved in all patients. Mean postoperative stay was 7.7 days (range, 3-12 d). At last review, 14 patients were alive, with a mean survival of 36 months (range, 13-71 mo). The mean survival for the 36 patients who died was 19 months (range, 2 weeks to 54 mo).

This is the largest reported series of patients with spinal tumor disease undergoing circumferential decompression and 3-column instrumented stabilization through the posterior transpedicular approach.This surgical approach provides sufficient access for safe and effective circumferential decompression and stabilization, with reduced complications compared with costotransversectomy or combined anterior transcavitary and posterior approaches.
