Isolated capitate fractures are rare and may be underdiagnosed, especially when fracture displacement is minimal or absent. Our case report of a nondisplaced capitate waist fracture exemplifies the need for careful evaluation because initial plain radiographs were considered normal and appropriate treatment was delayed. This report also documents the use of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing such fractures.
