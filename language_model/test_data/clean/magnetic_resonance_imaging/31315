A 36-year-old multigravida, G2P1, underwent routine ultrasound scan at 22+1 weeks of gestation, which revealed a single normally growing fetus with left intrathoracic mass and left displacement of the cardiac apex. The left intrathoracic wedge-shaped hyperechogenic mass, measuring 32 x 25 mm in size, was situated at the lower portion of the left lung. A combination of color and power Doppler ultrasound allowed visualization of a vessel arising from the descending aorta, which supplied the mass. The diagnosis of extralobar pulmonary sequestration was made. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed and revealed a well-defined mass with homogeneous high-signal intensity when compared with normal lung tissue in the left upper lung field, which was compatible with pulmonary sequestration. The pulmonary mass was followed up by color and power Doppler every 2 weeks. The peak velocity of 11.85 cm/sec and the diameter of the feeding artery of 1.19 mm gradually decreased and disappeared 8 weeks later. The intrathoracic mass disappeared 10 weeks later at 32+1 gestational weeks. Repeat MRI also revealed spontaneous regression of the mass in favor of resorption of sequestration. The fetus was delivered at 38+1 gestational weeks. A male newborn weighing 2,520 g was spontaneously delivered with an Apgar score of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. In our patient, it is suggested that progressive decreases in the peak velocity of the feeding vessel heralded the spontaneous regression of pulmonary sequestration not associated with hydrops/hydrothorax.
