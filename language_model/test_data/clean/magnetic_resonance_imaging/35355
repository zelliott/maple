An 8-year-old boy was referred due to difficulty in walking. T1-weighted MRI detected a well-marginated lesion expanding from the epidural region in the spinal canal to the paravertebral area through the Th9 and Th10 intervertebral foramen. The patient underwent a biopsy under video-assisted thoracoscopy and the tumor was diagnosed as Ewing's sarcoma family of tumor (ESFT). Imaging confirmed that the tumor completely disappeared and his neurologic functions were recovered perfectly at the end of treatment. Very few cases of skeletal ESFT of epidural extension in childhood have been documented. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery remains the best option for the diagnosis of endothoracic tumors in children.
