Although there is a peak in the incidence of epilepsy in the elderly compared with the general population, complex partial seizures represent less than 15% of the seizure types reported. We report on a 92-year-old woman with a 2-year history of daily complex partial seizures. Prolonged video/EEG recording showed bilateral anterior mesial temporal interictal spikes, which predominated on the left, and two typical seizures arising from the left temporal area. Cranial MRI scanning showed multiple lacunar infarcts without temporal lobe involvement or mesial temporal atrophy. Our case appears to be oldest patient in the literature with newly diagnosed mesial temporal lobe epilepsy confirmed by video/EEG recording.
