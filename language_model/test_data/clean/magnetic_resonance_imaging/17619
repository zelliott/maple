The purpose of the study was to report two cases of cervical and para-pharyngeal bone tumors.

Patients were two 29 and 67-year-old men. Presentation of the lesions included respectively a right cervical mass and a left para-pharyngeal mass. Clinical features and radiological, anatomopathological and therapeutic characteristics of the tumors were retrospectively studied.

A cervical approach was made in both cases. Tumor biopsies revealed a vertebral aneurismal cyst and a corporeo-pedicular chordoma respectively.

Vertebral bone tumors with cervical expression are very uncommon entities. Diagnosis could be systematically evoked in patients with a cervical or para-pharyngeal tumor presenting vertebral lysis.
