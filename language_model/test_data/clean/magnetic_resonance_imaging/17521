Fifteen patients with simultaneous presentation of meningiomas with other intracranial tumours are reviewed. The associated tumours included a brain metastasis in six cases, glioma in three, pituitary adenoma in two, craniopharyngioma in one,acoustic schwannoma in two and brain lymphoma in one. A correct preoperative radiological diagnosis was made in 12 patients; in three others the associated tumour was discovered at operation and by histological studies. A one-stage removal of both tumours through the same approach was performed in nine patients, whereas six others underwent two-stage operations with an interval of 1 - 13 months. The literature relating to meningiomas associated with other intracranial tumours is reviewed and the possible pathogenetic correlations are discussed. A diagnostic pitfall may occur for metastasis into a meningioma, glioma surrounding a meningioma and different suprasellar lesions. The surgical indication and management of meningiomas may be significantly influenced by the presence of another different intracranial tumour.
