Although practicing state-of-the-art diagnostic medicine is impossible without access to magnetic resonance imaging, this high-ticket technology is a mixed blessing in an era of cost containment. The good news is that MRI's diagnostic capabilities continue to grow, and the prices for scanners are dropping. However, MRI services remain expensive, and reimbursement is declining. To get the maximum benefit from MRI, physicians must stay up to date with the latest advances, a task that hospitals can facilitate through educational programs. Hospitals need to plan carefully for the introduction or expansion of MRI services, but the end result will be better patient care.
