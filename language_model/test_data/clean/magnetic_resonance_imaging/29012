An active MR tracking system was implemented on a 0.2 Tesla open MRI system. Interventional devices with receive-only microcoils at their tips were developed and investigated on the scanner. Microcoils having a diameter of about 1 mm and 20 turns were found to provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratios for stable tracking. Positional accuracy and precision were found to be acceptable under practical conditions. Simulation of MR-guided biopsy using biplane images with tracking was performed in a gelatin phantom and dog livers. Successful tracking of catheters with integrated microcoils was also demonstrated in the aorta and IVC of live dogs.
