Women with X-chromosome monosomy or Turner syndrome (TS) are at increased risk for aortic dilation and dissection. To better understand the pathology and develop tools to monitor the risk of aortic disease, we investigated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (NT-proBNP) levels in women with TS and healthy female controls.

We evaluated NT-proBNP levels in women with karyotype-proven TS and healthy female volunteers in relation to ascending aortic diameter and descending aortic diameter measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.

The NT-proBNP levels were strongly and positively correlated with ascending aortic diameter and descending aortic diameter in both cohorts. The TS group (n = 114, age 37.4 ± 12 yr) had greater body surface area-indexed aortic diameters and higher NT-proBNP levels than the control group (n = 27, age 46.4 ± 11 years): 88.3 ± 62.7 versus 53.5 ± 35 pg/mL, P = .0003. Within the TS group, NT-proBNP levels were higher in those with dilated ascending aorta (n = 42, 112.4 ± 75.7 pg/mL) compared with those with normal aortic dimensions (n = 72, 74.2 ± 49 pg/mL, P = .0014). Abnormally high NT-pro BNP levels were seen in 3 of 4 TS women who presented with previously undetected aortic aneurysm and/or dissection.

The NT-proBNP levels are positively associated with aortic diameters in women with and without TS, suggesting a role for BNP in arterial wall homeostasis. Further study is necessary to determine whether NT-proBNP measurement may be used to monitor aortic diameter and/or detect aortic pathology in individuals at risk for aortic disease.
