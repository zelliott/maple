A PET study was performed in six normal volunteers to elucidate the functional localization of the sensory afferent component during finger movement. Brain activation during the passive movement driven by a servo-motor was compared with that during an auditory-cued active movement which was controlled kinematically in the same way as the passive one. A newly developed device was used for selectively activating proprioception with a minimal contribution from tactile senses. Active movement was associated with activation of multiple areas, including the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), bilateral secondary somatosensory areas and basal ganglia and ipsilateral cerebellum. In contrast, only the contralateral primary and secondary somatosensory areas were activated by the passive movement. It is likely that the contribution of proprioceptive input to the activation of the premotor cortex, SMA, cerebellum and basal ganglia, if any, is small. However, the present results do not rule out the possibility that the cutaneous afferent input or the combination of cutaneous and proprioceptive input participates in the activation of those areas during the active movement.
