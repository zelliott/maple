The purpose of the study is to describe, based on shoulder MRI and MR arthrography with arthroscopic correlation, a posterior joint capsule fold.

A retrospective review of 410 shoulder MRIs and direct MR arthrograms with arthroscopic correlation in positive cases (when available) was obtained with IRB approval and HIPPA compliance. The study was performed by three musculoskeletal radiologists. The criteria utilized to establish the diagnosis of posterior synovial fold included: (1) axial T1-weighted (T1W) on MR arthrography or axial T2* GRE-weighted on MRI demonstrating rounded thickening of the posterior shoulder joint capsule with a thickness at least 2 mm in diameter. (2) The posterior synovial fold extends in an oblique craniocaudal direction from the posterior-inferior joint capsule adjacent to the posterior-inferior glenoid labrum (7 o'clock) and continues superiorly away from the glenoid labrum to the posterior-superior joint capsule (11 o'clock).

Although uncommon, the posterior synovial fold was present in 2% (8/410) of studies reviewed and found predominantly in women (75%, 6/8). Four patients had arthroscopic confirmation of the posterior synovial fold. A higher percentage of posterior synovial folds were observed on shoulder MR arthrography (2.7%, 4/150) than on shoulder MRI (1.5%, 4/260).

Although rare, the posterior synovial fold can be recognized and should not be confused with a posterior labral tear. Further investigation is needed to assess its histologic properties and its clinical significance.
