A 50-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of disorientation and nocturnal restlessness. The patient presented chronically progressive dementia. No myoclonus or periodic synchronous discharge (PSD) was found over time, with abnormal evidence in MRI-FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) images alone. Brain biopsy and prion protein gene analysis led to the final diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) induced by the point mutation at codon 232 (Met to Arg). To date the cases of M232R mutation-induced CJD have been reported to present clinical symptoms and pathological evidences similar to sporadic CJD cases, and differential diagnosis between the types has been believed to be difficult. Our case suggests that some types of CJD induced by point mutation at codon 232 cannot be easily inferred from clinical findings.
