Pituitary abscess secondary to an adenoma is rare. To date, only 19 cases have been reported. This is the first report of a patient who presented with bilateral total ophthalmoplegia. A 59-year-old male patient presented with headache, nausea, vomiting, decreasing visual acuity, diplopia and bilateral ophthalmoplegia with ptosis. Magnetic resonance imaging was suggestive of a pituitary abscess with adenoma. Transphenoidal surgery was performed and, during debulking of the tumour, the abscess was seen and excised. After the operation, the patient received antibiotic therapy and his neurological condition improved. Pituitary abscess with adenoma is a serious condition that has a high mortality rate. Therefore, early diagnosis and surgical intervention with antibiotic therapy are necessary.
