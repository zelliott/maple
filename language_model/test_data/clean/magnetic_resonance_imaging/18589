The abnormality of mismatch negativity (MMN) in schizophrenia is thought to be associated with perceptional disturbance and cognitive dysfunction. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the change of the normal functional hemispheric lateralization in schizophrenia by employing the equivalent current dipole (ECD) model of auditory MMN with individual MRI and high-density electroencephalography (EEG). The MMNs resulting from auditory stimuli with passive oddball paradigm in a group of schizophrenics (n = 15), and also a group of age-, sex-, and handedness-matched normal controls, were recorded by 128 channel EEG. The location and power of ECD sources at the peak point were calculated. Individual 3-D brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) were used for realistic head modeling and for source localization. For both groups, the MMN source was determined to be located in the superior temporal gyrus (STG). However, the normal functional hemispheric asymmetry of ECD power was significantly altered in the schizophrenics (chi(2) test = 16.13, p < 0.001). Left MMN ECD power and the asymmetry coefficient (AC) were negatively correlated with the positive scores from Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (r = -0.673, p = 0.008), especially with the hallucinatory behavior subscale (r = -0.677, p = 0.008). These findings support the deficits in preattentive automatic processing of auditory stimuli, especially in the left hemisphere, and indicate the correlation between positive symptoms, especially auditory hallucination, and left temporal lobe dysfunction in schizophrenia.
