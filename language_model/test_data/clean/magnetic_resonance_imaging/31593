Imaging of the temporal bone is under continous developement. In the recent decades the technical advances of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography have contributed to improved imaging quality in assessment of the temporal bone. Dedicated imaging protocols have been developed and are routinely employed in most institutions. However, imaging interpretation remains challenging, since the temporal bone is an anatomically highly complex region and most diseases of the inner ear occur with low incidence, so that even radiologists experienced in the field may be confronted with such entities for the first time. The current review gives an overview about symptoms and imaging appearance of malformations and acquired lesion of the inner ear.
