Forty-one patients with 45 pelvic mass lesions were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All lesions were initially considered to be benign ovarian masses with this diagnosis confirmed in 36 lesions. The characteristics on MRI are analysed and features useful in predicting histological type identified. Our results indicate that a high, though not absolute, level of diagnostic specificity should be obtainable in identification of ovarian pathology.
