The terminal phase of pontine glioma is reportedly characterized by disturbance of consciousness. The authors retrospectively reviewed 8 children who died of pontine gliomas in their hospitals. The hospital records were analyzed specifically in regard to neurological status and terminal case. All children became mute and quadriplegic with cranial nerve palsies. The oldest child, 17 years in age, unquestionably showed the classical locked-in syndrome for the last 4 months. Six of the remaining 7 (average 5 years of age), while labeled as semicomatose, responded to calling by blinking and/or vertical eyeball movement. The authors consider that they were indeed awake in the locked-in state until very near death. This would raise a serious ethical problem of whether or not they should be intubated and kept ventilator-dependent at the time of respiratory failure, which often occurs.
