Syringomyelia is defined as a dilatation of the central canal of the spinal cord which often leads to neurologic impairment. Syringomyelia has not previously been reported as a late complication for the treatment of brain abscess. In this report, we review a case involving this unusual association.

A 25 year-old woman sustained a nocardia brain abscess initially presenting as a pulmonary infection. Treatment led to the development of multiloculated hydrocephalus and syringomyelia.

Treatment included placement of multiple ventriculoperitoneal shunts and a syringo-pleural shunt. This resulted in stabilization of neurologic symptoms.

The possibility of developing syringomyelia should be considered in any case involving post-infectious hydrocephalus.
