Although most insulinomas are small, they have been successfully detected by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging recently. However, preoperative localization of the insulinomas by arterial stimulation with venous sampling is crucial when they show atypical findings on these imaging modalities. We report a case of a large benign insulinoma located at the pancreatic tail; this tumor was diagnosed correctly by super selective arterial stimulation with venous sampling.
