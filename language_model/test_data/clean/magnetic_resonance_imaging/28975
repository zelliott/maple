The aim of this study was to determine whether associations exist between temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disk displacement, and craniofacial morphology in an adolescent sample. Craniofacial lateral cephalometric radiographs and magnetic resonance images of the TMJs were obtained of 119 females between the ages of 10 and 17 years. Once the effects of age had been considered, associations between TMJ internal derangement and craniofacial morphology were studied in 5 facial regions making use of 5 separate multiple regression analyses. In females, associations between altered facial morphology and altered disk position were present within each of the facial regions investigated; the mandibular regions showed the strongest associations. This study shows that functional alteration in TMJ disk dynamics may be another factor to consider when craniofacial growth is forecasted for orthodontic treatment planning.
