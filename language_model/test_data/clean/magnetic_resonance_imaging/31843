We report an unusual case of a young man with a traumatic brachial plexus injury who presented with a large right-sided neck swelling 1 month after trauma. Clinical and diagnostic evaluations revealed a giant cervical pseudomeningocoele with meningitis and hydrocephalus. Following treatment for meningitis, the patient underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which produced total resolution of the pseudomeningocoele. The management is discussed.
