The authors present the case of a 60-year-old man with obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a large basilar artery tip aneurysm, in whom direct surgical clipping of the aneurysm neck was considered hazardous. After endosaccular aneurysm occlusion, his symptoms (headache, intellectual impairment, and gait disturbance) and ventricular dilation immediately improved without placement of a ventricular shunt. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of its kind treated solely endovascularly.
