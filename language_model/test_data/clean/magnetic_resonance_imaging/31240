Osteoarthritis is a disease affecting all joint structures, not just hyaline articular cartilage. It develops as a consequence of injurious activities acting on a vulnerable joint. The correlation between structural changes of the disease and joint symptoms is poor. Risk factors include age, obesity, and joint injury. Risk factors for symptoms include bone marrow edema, synovitis, and joint effusion.
