A questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the relative comfort of a comprehensive range of diagnostic procedures. The mean comfort ranking and variability in comfort were examined. Pure tone audiometry and speech audiometry are the most comfortable tests, while caloric testing and transtympanic electrocochleography are the least comfortable. However, caloric testing and glycerol dehydration are not significantly different in comfort to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and brainstem evoked response testing is more comfortable than other diagnostic tests, including MRI. The reasons for these differences and the implications for diagnostic management are discussed.
