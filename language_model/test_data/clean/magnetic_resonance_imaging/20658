Many nanovectors used for therapy (drug targeting, radiation therapy) or diagnostic such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have a composite structure consisting of an organic core or organic coverage encapsulating magnetic nanoparticles and they are commonly dispersed in liquid suspensions for intravenous injection. Here is presented the application of a new Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) mode in transmission, so called Wet-STEM, for transmission imaging of droplets of such suspensions. This is illustrated by Wet-STEM images from PLLA/Re nanospheres (about 100-300 nm in diameter) loaded with magnetite nanoparticles (about 10 nm in diameter) and from iron oxide core (about 5 nm in size) MRI contrast agents, both examples in aqueous suspensions. It is shown that the Wet-STEM mode allows both the collective behavior of such nanovectors in suspension to be characterized and the inner composite structure of individual vectors to be revealed. Such experimental results are discussed by comparison with Monte Carlo computer simulations of the distribution of the electrons scattered through the samples in rather large solid angles (between 20° and 47°) corresponding to the detection conditions.
