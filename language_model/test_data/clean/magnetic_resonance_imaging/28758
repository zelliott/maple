To measure magnetic resonance parameters T1 and T2 of the fetal lungs and investigate the relationship of these parameters to changes in volume and gestation.

Prospective cross-sectional study.

Large teaching hospital in Nottingham and the Magnetic Resonance Centre at the University of Nottingham.

Normal pregnancies from 20 weeks to term.

T1, T2, and lung volume were measured in the fetus using echo-planar magnetic resonance imaging.

The relationship of T1 and T2 to gestational age and lung volume.

Linear regression demonstrated a significant relationship (P < 0.001) between gestational age and lung volume, T1 and T2. There was also a significant relationship between lung volume and T1 and T2 (P < 0-001).

Relaxation time measurements give additional information to lung volume estimation in the assessment of lung physiology in utero. We have demonstrated the progressive changes which take place in the fetal lungs between 20 weeks and term. The physiological changes which can be demonstrated with this non-invasive technique may have an important application in the demonstration of fetal lung maturity in a prospective non-invasive manner.
