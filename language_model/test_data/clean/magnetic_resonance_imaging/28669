The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the MRI findings associated with acute tibial plateau fractures.

MR scans of 29 patients with acute tibial plateau fractures were analyzed retrospectively. The images were evaluated for the presence of injuries involving the menisci, cruciate and collateral ligaments. The presence of a lipohemarthrosis or a simple joint effusion was also noted. The tibial plateau fractures were classified according to the scheme devised by Schatzker.

Evidence of internal derangement of the knee was found in 28 (97%) patients. Tibial collateral ligament (55%) injuries and lateral meniscus (45%) tears were noted most frequently. Medial meniscus tears were seen in 21% and fibular collateral ligament injuries were diagnosed in 34%. Forty-one percent had anterior cruciate ligament injuries while the posterior cruciate ligament was injured in 28%. Twelve (41%) patients demonstrated the characteristic MRI features of a lipohemarthrosis. Simple joint effusions were found in the remaining 17 (59%) patients.

MR imaging in patients with acute tibial plateau fractures commonly demonstrates associated ligamentous and meniscal injuries. By imaging in multiple planes, MRI can aid in the accurate characterization of tibial plateau fracture patterns and severity.
