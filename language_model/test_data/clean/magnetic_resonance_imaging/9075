We report an extremely rare case of metachronous inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour in the temporal bone.

Case report and review of the world literature on metachronous inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour.

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour in the temporal bone is rare, and metachronous inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour in the temporal bone has never been reported in the English medical literature. We report a case of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour in the right temporal bone in a 27-year-old woman presenting with right-sided otalgia and progressive hearing loss. A metachronous lesion was discovered in the left temporal bone one year later. The patient underwent surgical excision of the tumour via canal wall down mastoidectomy for both lesions. Long term steroids were prescribed after both surgical procedures. At follow up three years after the last procedure, the patient remained free of disease.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of metachronous inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour in the temporal bone.
