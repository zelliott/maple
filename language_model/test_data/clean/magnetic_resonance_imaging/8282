Although distant metastasis from larynx carcinoma is more common in the late stages, it may sometimes occur in the initial period of the disease. The tumor spread may be by a lymphatic or nonlymphatic route. A 40-year-old male patient presented with complaints of hoarseness and shortness of breath. Indirect laryngoscopic examination showed a vegetable mass extending from the left laryngeal side of the epiglottis to the left vocal cord. Level 3 lymphadenopathies were noted in the jugular region. Biopsy result revealed epidermoid carcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging performed due to complaints of back pain and foot numbness demonstrated aggressive spinal cord metastases. The patient died on the tenth day of hospitalization.
