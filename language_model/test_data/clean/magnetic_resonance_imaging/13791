Benign cystadenomas or cystic teratomas are most frequently diagnosed in pregnancy. In the latter half of pregnancy ovarian tumors are particularly difficult to diagnose. In this report we present a case of a huge mucinous cyst adenoma of the ovary diagnosed in the 26th week of pregnancy. To our knowledge this is the first report of a case of unthreatened late pregnancy with a huge mucinous cyst adenoma of the ovary.
