Hemangiolymphangioma (HL) is an extremely rare malformation of both the lymphatic and blood vessels. We present a case of fetal axillary HL that was diagnosed sonographically at 36 weeks' gestation. Sonographic examination revealed a large, multilocular, cystic mass consistent with lymphangioma. At birth, a giant hemangioma was noticed involving the right hemitruncus. Based on clinical and sonographic findings, a diagnosis of HL was made. Surgical treatment was considered but was refused by the parents. The neonate died at 14 days of age, possibly due to an intralesional hemorrhage.
