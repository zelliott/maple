We encountered a 73-year-old man with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and Baker's cyst. Venography revealed that the right popliteal vein was compressed by Baker's cyst and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) had developed. DVT associated with Baker's cyst is rather common and these two conditions are thought to be causally related. Baker's cyst is the most frequent mass lesion in the popliteal region. We suggest that Baker's cyst is a risk factor for PE as well as surgery and trauma.
