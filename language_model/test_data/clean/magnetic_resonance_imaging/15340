In patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis (HD), silent cerebral infarctions (SCIs) are associated with high mortality. Levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) increase with renal dysfunction and may be a novel predictor of cerebrovascular events. We examined if HGF is a predictor of SCI in HD patients. Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were used to divide 50 patients undergoing HD into 2 groups, a group with SCI (age, 61 +/- 8 years, mean +/- SD; n = 27) and a group without SCI (age, 60 +/- 7 years; n = 23). These patients received 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The number of patients with diabetes or hypertension was not different between the 2 groups. We made the following observations: (1) The percentage of smokers was higher in the group with SCI than in the group without SCI (P < .05). (2) Plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower and HGF levels were higher in the group with SCI compared with the group without SCI (P < .05 and P < .005, respectively). (3) Systolic ambulatory blood pressure and mean heart rate at night were higher in the group with SCI than in the group without SCI (P < .05). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified HGF as a significant risk factor for SCI (odds ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.57-3.38; P < .005). Our findings indicate that HGF may be a novel useful predictor of SCI in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing HD.
