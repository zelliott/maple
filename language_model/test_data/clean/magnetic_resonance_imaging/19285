Tuberculosis of the brain is a disease of pathologic complexity and clinical subtlety-characteristics that manifest in the radiologic presentation of the disease and may make the task of interpreting radiologic data difficult. Much of the difficulty, however, reflects differences between the pathologic processes of tuberculosis and other infective diseases of the brain, and once these differences are appreciated, interpreting radiologic images becomes clearer.
