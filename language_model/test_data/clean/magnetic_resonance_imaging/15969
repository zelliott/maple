Women with fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene premutations (55-200 CGG repeats) were until recently believed to be unaffected. It is now known that up to 8% of older female FMR1 premutation carriers develop fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Female carriers may also develop primary ovarian insufficiency, thyroid disease, hypertension, seizures, peripheral neuropathy, and fibromyalgia. We present a 60-year-old woman with FMR1 premutation who had depression, anxiety, and conversion disorder with seizures. The FMR1 premutation with its associated mRNA toxicity is postulated as an underlying neurobiological mechanism of conversion symptoms, through functional and structural neural dysconnectivity.
