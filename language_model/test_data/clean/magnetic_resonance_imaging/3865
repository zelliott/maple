Laparoscopic splenectomy became the gold standard recently for the removal of spleen. One of its rare indication is wandering spleen (WS). WS is characterized by incomplete fixation of the spleen. Patients usually have an asymptomatic abdominal mass. When they are symptomatic, abdominal pain with a mobile mass is the major finding. Laboratory data are nonspecific, but the diagnosis can be confirmed by imaging studies; computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography are preferred modalities. It can predispose one to life-threatening complications such as splenic infarction, portal hypertension, pancretitis, and hemorrhage, due to torsion of its vascular pedicle. Herein, we present a female patient, a 24-year-old, 18-week primigravida. She was admitted with an intra-abdominal mass and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography revealed a mass behind the uterus. Magnetic resonance imaging was planned, and the spleen was seen at this area. We performed laparoscopic splenectomy for the treatment of a WS, which would be dangerous for pregnancy. The patient was discharged without any postoperative complication on the third day postoperatively. A healthy baby was delivered at term. Minimally invasive procedures should also be the primary choice in the treatment of such pregnant women. This is the first case of laparoscopic splenectomy in a pregnant woman for WS in the English literature.
