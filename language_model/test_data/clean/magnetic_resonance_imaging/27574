Papillary tumor of the pineal region (PTPR) is a rare variety of CNS neoplasms and, since its first definition in 2003, only 64 cases have been described. PTPR is a primary neoplasm morphologically characterized by papillary structure staining for cytokeratin, transthyretin, neurone-specific enolase and S-100 protein. We report on a case of about 4 years' clinical history and neuroradiological follow-up of PTPR, in a 47-year-old Indian patient, with the aim of increasing the knowledge of its natural history. We describe through CT and MRI scans the natural evolution of this neoplasm, enhancing changes and morphologic structures involved, together with the final surgical treatment and pathological details. A mean growth rate average was calculated for this kind of lesion. In conclusion, the inexorable progressive growing nature of this tumor leads us to advocate an aggressive attitude among neurosurgeons and radiotherapists, with a precocious surgical approach when the suspicion rises.
