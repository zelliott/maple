In polyarteritis nodosa involvement of the central nervous system is infrequent; small cerebral infarcts are the most common neuroradiological finding. We report a 10-year-old boy with polyarteritis nodosa and intracranial haemorrhage. MRI showed an intracerebral haemorrhage. Angiography revealed two peripheral aneurysms in the posterior cerebral circulation, previously reported on only two occasions, and multiple microaneurysms in the hepatic, renal, mesenteric and even the lumbar arteries.
