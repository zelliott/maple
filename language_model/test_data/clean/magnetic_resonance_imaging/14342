A simple, inexpensive, non-magnetizable, pulsatile air-driven pump has been devised for use in magnetic resonance environments. The pump has a variable stroke volume and stroke rate, is easily cleaned and sterilized, requires relatively small priming volumes and causes no observable hemolysis when blood is used as the perfusate. This device is usable for phantoms, isolated organs or in situ preparations.
