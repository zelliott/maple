Clinical diagnosis of cervical carcinoma fails to detect the location and extent of tumor invasion to cervical stroma and parametria. This study attempted to assess the accuracy of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation for the extent of cervical carcinoma.

A total of 41 patients with primary untreated cervical carcinoma underwent MRI throughout the staging evaluations before surgical treatment.

Without Gd-DPTA, T1-weighted images were less effective than T2-weighted images for MRI of pelvic organs. Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted images provided information similar to those of T2-weighted appearances, and distinguished the normal parametrium or vaginal wall from malignant invaded lesions more clearly.

The enhancement with Gd-DTPA may increase the ability of MRI to provide a positive spread/metastasis staging.
