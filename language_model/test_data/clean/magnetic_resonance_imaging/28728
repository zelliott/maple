We assessed combining of surface-anatomy scanning (SAS) MRI and MR venography (MRV). We obtained SAS images with a half-Fourier single-shot fast spin-echo sequence, then MRV of the identical section with a two-dimensional phase-contrast technique. We then added the two sets of images. The combined images, which were obtained within 10 min, provided information about the surface anatomy and cortical veins. This simple technique is useful for demonstrating brain surface structures, especially in patients from whom one plans to excise a lesion.
