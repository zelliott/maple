The authors report their experience of cerebral magnetic r√©sonance imaging (MRI) in the neonatal period. MRI offers many advantages compared to CT scan or ultrasonography in the study of malformations, tumors, infections and anoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, MRI is limited by the duration of the examination the need for total immobility which is achieved in the neonate via administration of chloral hydrate, and lack of accessibility. MRI is a non invasive method for following in vivo brain development during infancy.
