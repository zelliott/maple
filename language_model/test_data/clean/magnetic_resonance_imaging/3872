We report on a 28-year-old man with severe headache. Imaging studies included CT and MR. A large sphenoid mucocoele was demonstrated as well as findings compatible with fibrous dysplasia of the facial bones. Both disorders had been previously unknown. Imaging findings suggested that the sphenoid mucocoele was related to an obstruction caused by the expansile bone of fibrous dysplasia. These findings were confirmed surgically. Fibrous dysplasia with subsequent outflow obstruction is an extremely rare cause of sphenoid mucocoele development.
