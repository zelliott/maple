Many attempts to isolate a dysfunctional site in the brain of schizophrenic patients have converged in a neuropathological conception of the disease based on frontal lobe hypoactivity. Recent data from studies using cytoarchitectony, computerized tomographic scans, cerebral regional blood flow, smooth pursuit eye movements and neuropsychological assessments are discussed. Current data on the hypofrontality hypothesis in schizophrenia seem to suggest an associationist rather than a localisationist perspective of the disorder.
