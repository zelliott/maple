The complexity of the congenital anomalies of the spine can make the neuroradiologic diagnosis challenging. Knowledge of spinal embryology greatly helps in the understanding and classification of these anomalies. We use the classification devised by Tortori-Donati and Rossi and find it helpful from clinical and imaging standpoints. We believe that most patients who have known or suspected congenital spinal anomalies benefit from MR imaging.
