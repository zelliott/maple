Mouse models are crucial for the study of genetic factors and processes that influence human disease. In addition to tools for measuring genetic expression and establishing genotype, tools to accurately and comparatively assess mouse phenotype are essential in order to characterize pathology and make comparisons with human disease. MRI provides a powerful means of evaluating various anatomical and functional changes and hence is growing in popularity as a phenotypic readout for biomedical research studies. To accommodate the large numbers of mice needed in most biological studies, mouse MRI must offer high-throughput image acquisition and efficient image analysis. This article reviews the technology of multiple-mouse MRI, a method that images multiple mice or specimens simultaneously as a means of enabling high-throughput studies. Aspects of image acquisition and computational analysis in multiple-mouse studies are also described.
