Sj√∂gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is a rare autosomal recessive neurocutaneous disorder caused by deficiency of the microsomal enzyme fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase. Patients present the classical triad of congenital ichthyosis, mental retardation and spastic di- or tetraplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain usually shows hypomyelination involving the periventricular white matter. Cerebral proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) reveals a characteristic abnormal lipid peak. We report three cases of SLS from different families with the typical clinical triad. The MRI and (1)H-MRS findings are discussed.
