To emphasise the pattern of lymphatic dissemination in the parapharyngeal space from thyroid cancer.

Among 696 patients treated for thyroid cancer between 1986 and 2001, parapharyngeal metastasis was diagnosed in three patients, previously treated for papillary thyroid carcinoma.

All three patients have been treated by surgical resection through lateral cervical approach. Two of them were controlled regionally whereas the remaining one had a submucosal pharyngeal metastasis locally resected 27 months after parapharyngeal resection.

Parapharyngeal metastasis is rare, but should be a recognized pattern of lymphatic dissemination from thyroid carcinoma to avoid unnecessary radioiodine and because surgical resection is efficacious with acceptable morbidity.
