Two patients with seizure-associated miosis and ptosis are described. In both there are magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities of the temporal lobe. In one patient, increased magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity is present in the temporal lobe contralateral to ptosis and miosis. In the other, there is temporal lobe asymmetry with the smaller temporal lobe ipsilateral to the miotic pupil and ptotic lid. The relevant human and experimental literature related to cortical control of pupil size and lid movement is reviewed. Based on the available literature and the findings in these two patients, it is proposed that the increased signal intensity in the temporal lobe of one patient represents an irritative stimulus causing contralateral miosis and ptosis, whereas the temporal lobe hypoplasia in the second patient permitted impulses from the contralateral normal temporal lobe to predominate, resulting in miosis and ptosis homolateral to the hypoplastic temporal lobe.
