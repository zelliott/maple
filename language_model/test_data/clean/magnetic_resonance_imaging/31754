In most cases the definite diagnosis of neuralgic amyotrophy is not possible, so it is based on the typical course of symptoms after other diagnoses have been excluded. We report an otherwise healthy woman who presented with symptoms typical of neuralgic amyotrophy. However we could diagnose a vertebral artery dissection that probably caused the symptoms by compression of the cervical roots. The differential diagnosis of neuralgic amyotrophy and vertebral artery dissection is discussed.
