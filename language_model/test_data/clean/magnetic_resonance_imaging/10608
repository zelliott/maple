The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the lateral femoral condyle and lateral menisci. From 1993 to 2002, 38 knees (28 patients) were diagnosed with OCD of the lateral femoral condyle. OCD locations were graded by the Cahill and Berg classification. The types of lateral menisci were classified by Watanabe's classification. The relationship between OCD of the lateral femoral condyle and lateral menisci was examined. On the anterior-posterior view, 25 OCDs were located in zone 4 and 13 in zone 5. The types of lateral menisci were complete discoid in 19 knees, incomplete discoid in 15, and normal in 4. Ten of the 19 complete discoid menisci were damaged. Complete discoid menisci without tears were found in OCDs located in zone 4; incomplete discoid menisci were found in OCDs located in zone 5. The authors found a relationship between the type of OCD and the state of the lateral meniscus.
