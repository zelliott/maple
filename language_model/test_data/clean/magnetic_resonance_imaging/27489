We introduce a novel method of prospectively compensating for subject motion in neuroanatomical imaging. Short three-dimensional echo-planar imaging volumetric navigators are embedded in a long three-dimensional sequence, and the resulting image volumes are registered to provide an estimate of the subject's location in the scanner at a cost of less than 500 ms, ~ 1% change in contrast, and ~3% change in intensity. This time fits well into the existing gaps in sequences routinely used for neuroimaging, thus giving a motion-corrected sequence with no extra time required. We also demonstrate motion-driven selective reacquisition of k-space to further compensate for subject motion. We perform multiple validation experiments to evaluate accuracy, navigator impact on tissue intensity/contrast, and the improvement in final output. The complete system operates without adding additional hardware to the scanner and requires no external calibration, making it suitable for high-throughput environments.
