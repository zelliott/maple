Orbital metastasis caused by prostate cancer is rare. We report a case of prostate cancer diagnosed from the initial ocular signs with complaints of decreased vision and exophthalmos. The orbital tumor was surgically removed and endocrine therapy was performed subsequently. Metastatic carcinoma of the prostate should be considered in the elderly male with exophthalmos.
