Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are often initiated on antiepileptic drugs without a clear indication. We compared the percentage of patients with spontaneous ICH who had seizures at onset or during hospitalization, and examined empiric use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in these patients in 2 cohorts 10 years apart.

Using a clinical data registry at a tertiary care adult hospital, we retrospectively selected admissions for spontaneous ICH between 1/1/99-12/31/00 (Cohort A, n=30) and 1/1/09-12/31/10 (Cohort B, n=108). Clinical, neurophysiological and radiological data were collected in both cohorts.

In Cohorts A and B respectively, AEDs were started in 53.3% and 50.0%, and continued on discharge in 50.0% and 20.4% of patients; 86.6% and 59.1% of patients discharged on AEDs did not have a clinical/electrographic seizure or epileptiform EEG findings. Seizures occurred in 6.6% and 13.0% in Cohorts A and B respectively. The presence of a seizure at presentation (p=0.01) and during hospitalization (p=0.02) were predictors for continuing AED on discharge.

In both cohorts, a significant number of patients were discharged on AEDs without a clear indication, though there is a change in practice between the two cohorts.
