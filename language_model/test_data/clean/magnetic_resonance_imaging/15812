To report the first case of mandibular branch haemangioma of the trigeminal nerve causing erosion of the petrous carotid canal. The radiological and histological findings in this case are reviewed.

A 60-year-old woman presented with severe, right-sided facial pain and paraesthesia. There were no associated symptoms of facial weakness or diplopia. A magnetic resonance imaging scan with gadolinium enhancement was performed. This showed a lesion slightly compressing the right Meckel's cave and eroding the right petrous carotid canal, occupying the foramen ovale and extending to the pterygoid muscle. The lesion was removed via a subtemporal approach.

Haemangiomas are usually found on the skin and in other soft tissues. However, this rare tumour should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions occupying Meckel's cave and the foramen ovale.
