The superior tissue contrast and flexible imaging planes afforded by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) versus competing technologies permit optimal depiction of the pelvic viscera. Targeted protocols developed for specific pelvic visceral organs highlight important anatomic features that may not be imaged by other modalities. Therefore, a solid understanding of normal and variant pelvic anatomy is crucial for appropriate interpretation of pelvic MRI studies. This article discusses the protocol strategies and relevant anatomy with commonly encountered anatomical variants in a segmented/organ-specific manner, using gender as a broad split given the substantial variance in relevant organs.
