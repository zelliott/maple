The case of a 35-year-old pregnant patient is described who presented with acute bilateral visual loss. As the reason for this a retinal arteritis could be demonstrated. The patient also suffered from acute unilateral hearing loss in combination with cerebral changes detectable by MRI. After exclusion of other causes the diagnosis of Susac syndrome (retinocochleocerebral microangiopathy) was made and appropriate therapy was initiated.
