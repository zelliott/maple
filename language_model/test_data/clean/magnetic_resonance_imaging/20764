Bucket handle tears of both menisci in the setting of acute or chronic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears of the same knee have rarely been reported in the literature. This article presents a case of a bucket handle tear affecting both the medial and lateral menisci in a patient with chronic ACL rupture. Both bucket handle tears were displaced and locked in the intercondylar notch. A new magnetic resonance image (MRI) sign suggested on sagittal view is called the triple PCL sign, comprising the intact posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and the 2 displaced fragments in the intercondylar notch from the two bucket handle tears. The precise diagnosis of this condition is of obvious importance for optimal operative planning. While finding the displaced fragment from the medial meniscus is expected to cause the double PCL sign, the torn ACL may have made it easier to visualize the bucket handle tear of the lateral meniscus in the same sagittal plane as the PCL. Only 5 other reports mention bimeniscal bucket handle tears of both the medial and lateral menisci in association with an ACL tear. None have shown the suggested triple PCL sign because of lack of overlap between the 2 bucket handle tears in the coronal plane while lying in the intercondylar notch causing them not to fall in the same sagittal plane. Our patient showed some overlap between the 2 meniscal fragments while lying in the notch to create the triple PCL sign on sagittal MRI.
