A renal cell carcinoma was incidentally discovered with sonography in a 32-year-old pregnant woman. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to provide further information about tumor stage without causing adverse effects on the fetus. The patient underwent radical nephrectomy at the third month of pregnancy and subsequently delivered a normal full-term child. Pathology revealed regressive aspects which can be possibly ascribed to high progesterone levels during pregnancy.
