We report a rare case of double aortic arch with a hypoplastic right dorsal arch segment, which was also associated with tetralogy of Fallot. Accurate characterization of the hypoplastic right arch segment by MRI preoperatively determined the optimal surgical approach to releasing the symptomatic vascular ring. MRI was also useful in assessing and monitoring associated tracheomalacia.
