Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has enjoyed enormous clinical success since the first demonstration of the method more than 30 years ago. An increasing number of pharmaceutical manufacturers seeking new biomarkers for assessing drug efficacy and toxicity are turning to MRI. A specific application of MRI promises to revolutionize pathology for the basic scientist in the same way MRI has forever altered the standard of care in the clinical domain. More specifically, this application is the use of magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) in conjunction with new staining methodologies that now make MRM routinely available to the widest range of investigators.
