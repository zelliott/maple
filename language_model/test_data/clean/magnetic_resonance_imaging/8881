The main objective of this study was to investigate the relation between brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels within the first 96 hours after ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) and the development of left ventricular (LV) dilatation at 6-month follow-up. Eighty-two patients with first STEMIs, reperfused within 12 hours of symptom onset, were prospectively included. Plasma BNP was determined on admission and at 1- and 6-month follow-up. Clinically significant LV dilatation, defined as a >20% increase in LV end-diastolic volume at 6-month follow-up, was assessed using echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance. Thirty-two percent of patients developed clinically significant LV dilatation. BNP values on admission and at follow-up were significantly higher in patients who developed clinically significant LV dilatation at 6 months (182 +/- 117 vs 106 +/- 91 pmol/ml). After adjusting for age, infarct size, E-wave deceleration time, and the LV ejection fraction, BNP on admission was an independent predictor of LV dilatation, whether assessed by echocardiography (B = 0.075, p = 0.04) or cardiac magnetic resonance (B = 0.085, p = 0.04). In conclusion, high BNP levels on admission and at follow-up predict LV dilatation after STEMI. The early determination of plasma BNP upon admission for STEMI could be helpful in identifying patients at higher risk for LV dilatation, in whom aggressive management is warranted.
