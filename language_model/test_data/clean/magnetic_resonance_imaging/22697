Ameloblastic carcinoma is a rare odontogenic tumor exhibiting histologic evidence of malignancy in the primary or recurrent tumor, regardless of whether it has metastasized or not. Most ameloblastic carcinomas are presumed to have arisen de novo, with few cases of malignant transformation of ameloblastoma being apparent. A case is reported of a 21-year-old caucasian female with ameloblastic carcinoma in the left angulus area of the mandible resembling an odontogenic cyst in the panoramic radiograph. In addition to the panoramic radiograph, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images were taken preoperatively. This report demonstrates that CT or MR examinations may be crucial in differentiating odontogenic tumors from cysts.
