A one-month-old girl was refereed to our department because of urinary tract infection. Ultrasonography showed grade III left hydronephrosis and cystic mass at the dome of the urinary bladder. Voiding cystourethrography revealed grade 4 vesicoureteral reflux associated with Hutch's diverticulum. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple cysts at the dome of the urinary bladder. The vesicoureteral reflux was repaired and the urachal cyst removed.
