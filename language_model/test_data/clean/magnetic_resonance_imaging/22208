Spindle cell tumors (leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma) have been described in immunocompromised children after transplantation and in association with HIV infection. Previous reports have described tumors of respiratory (lung, bronchi), gastrointestinal (stomach, bowel, liver), and subcutaneous origins. We report a case of leiomyosarcoma of the kidney in an HIV-infected child.
