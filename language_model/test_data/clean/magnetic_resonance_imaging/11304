Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles are used as a contrast agent in liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). SPIO particles exert their greatest influence on T2-weighted MR signal intensity. The time-to-echo (TE) value that provides optimal contrast has not been systematically studied over the range of clinically relevant field strengths. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the TE dependence of the post-SPIO tumor to liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). The hypothesis was that there is a TE that provides an optimal CNR. Subjects having probable metastatic hepatic lesions secondary to colorectal carcinoma were studied. Pre- and post-SPIO images were acquired at TE-effective (TE(eff)) equal to 46, 76, and 106 msec by using a turbo spin echo pulse sequence at 0.2 T and 1.5 T. The CNR for all lesions greater than 1 cm in diameter was determined in pre- and post-SPIO images. A paired statistical design was used to identify TE-related CNR dependencies. The primary findings were as follows. (1) CNR differences attributable to TE(eff) variation over the range of 46-106 msec were less than 34%. For 0.2 T, TE(eff) = 46 msec yielded a statistically significantly greater CNR than did TE(eff) = 76 or 106 msec. The same was true at the higher field strength, but differences were not significant. (2) Signal-to-noise measures suggested that SPIO reduced the lesion signal. (3) Post-SPIO CNR was significantly greater at 1.5 T than at 0.2 T. The observations indicate that over the field strength range of 0.2-1.5 T, CNR differences attributable to the TE(eff) variation, while being statistically significant in some cases, are small relative to those resulting from the SPIO administration.
