Limbic encephalitis (LE) associated with glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD-Ab) is rare. We describe a 30-year-old male with acute LE and GAD-Ab, with follow-up during 2 years of cognitive status including verbal episodic memory, number of seizures recorded by high-resolution video-EEG, brain MRI, 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET and GAD-Ab titres. Treatment with corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulins, immunosuppressors and antiepileptic drugs resulted in improved memory status, disappearance of seizures and decreased GAD-Ab titres. Review of the other cases of literature and this case is in favour of the existence of autoimmune LE associated with GAD-Ab and supports the link between memory, temporal seizures and possibly GAD-Ab titres.
