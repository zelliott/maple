The aim of this study was to characterize the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in chronic solvent encephalopathy (CSE) patients and to study whether the findings are associated with solvent exposure indices.

The brain MRI scans of 71 CSE patients were independently re-evaluated and rated by two experienced neuroradiologists. All the work tasks were analyzed and the chemical composition of lifetime exposure was categorized.

The MRI scans of 27/71 CSE patients (38%) were classified as abnormal. Brain atrophy in any brain area was found in 17/71 CSE patients (24%). Abnormal white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were found in 20/71 CSE patients (28%). Cerebral and cerebellar brain atrophy was associated with the duration of exposure in years, and vermian atrophy was associated with alcohol consumption. Periventricular and brainstem WMH were related to age.

Slight brain atrophy is associated with CSE and there is a correlation between brain atrophy and the duration of exposure in years. However, all the MRI findings in CSE are non-specific and thus MRI is useful mainly in the differential diagnosis of CSE.
