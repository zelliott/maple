In a 34-year-old woman a parapharyngeal mass was found which led to snoring, apnoeas, a feeling of pressure in the pharynx and paraesthesias around the mouth. MRI imaging showed a parapharyngeal mass, most likely a cyst. Patient underwent excision of the mass via an external approach. Histological examination confirmed the parapharyngeal cyst. The literature is inconclusive as to the origin of such cysts. They might be a relic of the 2nd branchial sac, they might be causally related to the cervical sinus of His, they might be a relic of the connection between the thymus and the 3rd branchial pouch, or they might represent cystic differentiation of epithelium found in lymphoid tissue. MRI or CT is of great importance for information on the anatomical relation of the cyst with the great vessels and other surrounding structures. Excision via external approach is possible but transoral excision with or without mandibulotomy is also an option.
