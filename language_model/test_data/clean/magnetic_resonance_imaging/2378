Three children with intracerebral abscesses were treated endoscopically. Two of the treated abscesses were located in the left temporal lobe and one in the right parietal lobe. The presenting symptoms included headaches, seizures, hemiparesis and signs of infection. Burr hole craniotomy, insertion of a peelaway sheath, obtaining of a specimen, introduction of endoscope, and complete irrigation under view was performed. After this a draining catheter was positioned in the abscess. All three abscesses grew multiple organisms. The patients received longstanding intravenous treatment with antibiotics. The follow-up period in this group ranges between 5 and 32 months. The initial neurological deficits were relieved in all three patients. The follow-up MRI studies revealed minor residual changes without evidence of significant sequelae. Neuroendoscopic treatment of brain abscesses has additional advantages compared to stereotactic aspiration or more complete drainage and lavage.
