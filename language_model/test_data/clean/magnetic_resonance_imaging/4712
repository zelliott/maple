Gastrinomas are usually diagnosed clinically and localized before surgery using various imaging modalities including ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and venous sampling. The authors present a case in which CT, MRI, and angiography were negative in attempting to localize the gastrinoma, but In-111 pentetreotide localized the lesion, which was proven surgically.
