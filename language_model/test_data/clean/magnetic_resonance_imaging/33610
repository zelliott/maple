Cushing's disease resulting from intrasellar corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-secreting gangliocytomas is very rare, and only two such cases have been reported in the literature to date. The authors present a third case in which an adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma was found in addition to a gangliocytoma in a 10-year-old girl with clinical and endocrinological symptoms of Cushing's disease. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed a suprasellar and parasellar tumor. A green-colored, heterogeneous tumor and a small adenoma were removed transsphenoidally. Histological examination revealed a large gangliocytoma immunoreactive for CRH and a small, mucoid cell pituitary adenoma immunoreactive for ACTH. This is the first case of such a tumor causing Cushing's disease in a child. It might exemplify induction of an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma by means of chronic overstimulation of CRH.
