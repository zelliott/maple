We analyse the contribution of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to the study of the inner ear for the evaluation of normal anatomy and pathology of the membranous labyrinth. Our protocol is discussed with emphasis on 3D SSFP images (tridimensional Steady State Free Precession) and high resolution 2D SEF images (bidimensional Fast Spin Echo). We comment briefly on the indications of the method in neurosensory hearing loss and the way in which it complements CT.
