Ultrasound, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Nuclear Medicine (NM) were used to evaluate short-term changes and renal complications (within the first 10 days) induced by extracorporeal lithotrity (ESWL) from two separate lithotripters. To this end, a consecutive prospective study with 18 randomly selected patients, all candidates to ESWL, was conducted. ESWL was performed using a piezoelectric lithotripter in 10 patients and an electrohydraulic equipment in 8 patients. Qualitative evaluation of images was done with ultrasound and NMR (changes in renal morphology: shape, cortico-medullary definition, size, changes in perirenal space), and with isotopic renogram (global renal function); while quantitative evaluation was done with NMR (measurement of signal intensity on cortex, marrow and muscle), and with isotopic renogram (semiquantitative assessment of unilateral renal function and renal excretory function). ESWL with piezoelectric and electrohydraulic lithotripter shows a low short-term complication rate: changes of cortico-medullary differentiation (ultrasound in 27.8% cases, NMR in 5.6%) and perirenal striations (NMR in 11%). No renal function changes were found. These observations have not been quantitatively corroborated; we have not found statistically significant differences between changes produced after ESWL either with piezoelectric or electrohydraulic lithotripters.
