We report a rare case of MALT-type lymphoma of the lacrimal gland in a 29-year-old woman. CT scan demonstrated a solid homogenous mass in the right lacrimal gland fossa and the palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland with contrast enhancement. The mass displayed slight hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images with fat saturation. The mass demonstrated an arc-like contour, and involved both the palpebral lobe and orbital lobe of the lacrimal gland. These characteristic findings may be helpful in the diagnosis of this malignancy.
