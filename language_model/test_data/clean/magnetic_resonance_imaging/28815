To better define the survival and cellular composition of human fetal neurotransplants in vivo, we performed quantitative 1H MRS to determine the concentration of the neuronal amino acid [N-acetylaspartate] within MRI-visible grafts. In all, 71 grafts in 38 patients [24 Parkinson's disease (PD), 14 Huntington's disease (HD)] were examined, as well as 24 untreated PD and HD patients and 13 age-matched normal controls. MRI appearances of edema were present in three out of 71 grafts, the remainder being consistent with histologically identified viable neural transplant tissue. N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine, choline, myoinositol and glutamine plus glutamate (Glx) were identified in all post-transplant putamens, with abnormal metabolites, lactate and/or lipid detectable in only three patients. Of 71 grafts, 19 occupied more than 60% of the MRS-examined volume (VOI) (mean 84.2 +/- 3%; range 61-100%). In those, [NAA] was 8.50 +/- 0.99 mM in eight PD spectra and 6.59 +/- 0.81 mM in 11 HD spectra, and was not significantly different from controls. In contrast, transplanted fetal neurones contain less than 0.4 mM of the neuronal amino acid NAA. This suggests that established fetal neurotransplants in the human putamen of both PD and HD patients are populated by adult neurones, axons and dendrites.
