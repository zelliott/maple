Protracted febrile myalgia (PFM) includes severe myalgia of the upper and lower extermities accompanied by fever lasting up to 6 weeks, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and leucucytosis. We report a 13-year-old girl with PFM, and discuss the magnetic resonance imaging findings of the involved calf muscles. To our knowledge these are the only images of the pathology in the literature.
