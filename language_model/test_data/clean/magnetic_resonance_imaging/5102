  The clinical features of pituitary adenomas were retrospectively analyzed, focusing on the factors that contribute to the development of pituitary hemorrhage. Although many causes of pituitary adenoma hemorrhage have been identified, it is difficult to distinguish which conditions are truly causative. We determined the independent variables that contribute to pituitary hemorrhage in pituitary adenoma.

  Two hundred and eighty-eight consecutive patients diagnosed as pituitary adenoma were enrolled. These patients underwent tumor removal through endoscopic transsphenoidal approach. The subjects were divided into hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic groups, based on magnetic resonance images and histological findings. The predisposing factors were reviewed in the medical records for all patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the relationships between variables of pituitary adenoma hemorrhage.

  We investigated 81 patients in whom hemorrhage from pituitary adenoma occurred. The incidence of pituitary hemorrhage was 28.1% (81/288). The predisposing factors surveyed for pituitary hemorrhage were significantly associated with macroadenoma, non-functional adenomas, anticoagulation therapy, end-stage renal disease, dopamine agonist treatment, and underlying malignant disease (all P < 0.05). Sex, age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and previous radiation therapy were not related to pituitary hemorrhage.

  In this pooled cohort, the predisposing factors of pituitary adenoma characteristic for pituitary hemorrhage were macroadenoma and non-functional adenoma. Patients who received dopamine agonist and anticoagulation therapy are implicated as precipitating factors. Underlying end-stage renal disease and malignant disease are also factors that contribute to pituitary adenoma hemorrhage.
