A case of Ramsay-Hunt syndrome has been studied with pre- and postcontrast MR imaging, using a three-dimensional Fourier transform fast imaging with steady precession sequence with axially oriented sections and coronal reformatted images. A clear demonstration of the abnormal enhancement of the labyrinth and of the intratemporal cranial nerves was obtained. This demonstration assisted us in establishing the diagnosis of Ramsay-Hunt syndrome.
