To evaluate the cross-sectional radiological appearances and to review the clinical presentation and outcome of patients with leiomyosarcomas of the inferior vena cava (IVC LMS). These are rare aggressive tumours that present late with non-specific symptoms and have a poor prognosis.

From January 2002 to December 2008, the radiological images of 23 sequential patients with pathologically proven IVC LMS were independently reviewed by two experienced radiologists. The clinical presentation, treatment including surgical details, and outcome were recorded.

There were 19 females and four males with a mean age of 53 years. CT typically demonstrated a large, lobulate, non-calcified heterogeneous mass with peripheral enhancement. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images demonstrated a mass with a low signal intensity and T2-weighted MRI images demonstrated a mass with a high signal intensity. Clinical presentation included leg oedema, back and abdominal pain with almost 50% of patients presenting with metastases. Eleven patients underwent ablative surgery. The mean survival time of all patients in the study was 34 months and that of the 11 post-surgical patients was 56 months.

There are a variety of diagnostic features on both computed tomography (CT) and MRI which aid the diagnosis of this unusual vascular neoplasm. CT is vital in determining the location of the tumour within the IVC and MRI accurately depicts its extent and the potential for surgical resectability, which offers the only chance of survival.
