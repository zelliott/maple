Lumbar herniated disks result in lumbar pain with neurologic involvement. Medical treatment and rehabilitation provide improvement for this type of lumbar pain at the early stages. When conservative treatment fails, the surgical option offers the possibility of improving patients' health status. Moojen considers that the application of interspinous spacers provides good results. The purpose of this research is to assess the clinical and imaging results in patients with contained lumbar herniated disk treated with the DYNAMIC INTERSPACER interspinous spacer, a Mexican product.

The efficacy of the interspinous device was assessed by means of a near-investigational and longitudinal study conducted at "General Ignacio Zaragoza" ISSSTE Regional Hospital in patients with a diagnosis of lumbar pain.

The mean age of the sample is 46.1 years, with an age range of 26-55 years. The treated levels were 6 L5-S1 and 5 L4-L5; two levels were treated in two patients. The mean preoperative VAS score was 8.1. The mean VAS score at postoperative year three was 1.6.

Multiple types and brands of foreign interspinous devices are applied in Mexico which results in patients' clinical improvement. We proved that the use of the Mexican interspinous device can clinically improve patients with lumbar pain due to herniated disk. A decrease in the compression of the sac or the nerve roots by the hernia was observed in the comparative preoperative and postoperative MRI images.
