We report a 16-year-old boy, born to consanguineous parents, with mental retardation, gait disturbances and dysarthria; brain magnetic resonance showed features consistent with rhombencephalosynapsis. This condition is characterised by a hypoplastic single-lobed cerebellum. The interest of this case is the presence of common ancestors, pointing to an autosomal recessive inheritance of the malformation.
