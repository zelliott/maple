Two patients with multiple sclerosis are reported in whom psychopathological symptoms were present for many years. An exact psychiatric classification of the clinical syndrome was not possible. At no time during the illness were abnormal neurological findings observed. Multiple sclerosis was proven following necropsy in one patient. In the second patient a possible diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was made. This patient was found to have multiple lesions in the white matter which were evident on MRI and in the isoelectric focusing (IEF) of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands were found.
