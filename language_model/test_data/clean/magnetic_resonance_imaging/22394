We report a case of retroperitoneal liposarcoma. A 66-year-old male was referred to our hospital for a retroperitoneal tumor that was detected during gallbladder stone examination. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an extrarenal lipomatous tumor, 20 x 14 x 8 cm in size, in the right retroperitoneal space. He underwent surgical excision of the tumor with concomitant resection of the right kidney and adrenal gland. The resected tissue weighed 730 g. Histological examination revealed a well differentiated liposarcoma. He received no adjuvant therapy.
