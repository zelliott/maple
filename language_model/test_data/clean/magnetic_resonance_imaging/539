In 1998, one of us (MJM) published an article discussing several patients with Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome or hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia with secondary cerebral complications. These were intracerebral haemorrhage, ischaemic infarct and intracerebral abscess. We outlined the background of the syndrome as well as its genotype and predicted an increasingly important role for genetic testing. Our aim in this paper is to examine the progress of one of the patients as well as recommending follow-up guidelines for patients with pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae that have been treated.
