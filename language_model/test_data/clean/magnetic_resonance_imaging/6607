Does the primate brain contain a dedicated and localized neural circuitry for processing generic numerical information? The human parietal cortex, particularly the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), has long been implicated in processing symbolic (verbal) number information. If the IPS is indeed the site of generic numerical processing, however, its neurons should also encode nonsymbolic numerosity information. Two recent studies by Shuman and Kanwisher and by Piazza et al. published in this issue of Neuron tested this assumption...with quite different results.
