This study was designed to explore causes for local recurrence of presacral lesions after intended curative surgery and discuss prevention strategies.

Medical data of presacral lesions in our hospital from January 2001 to September 2009 were retrospectively studied, including preoperative examinations, intraoperative findings, and postoperative histopathologies.

Of 39 patients (29 women and 10 men) with presacral lesions, who ranged in age from 14 to 71 (mean, 39.56) years, 7 patients were diagnosed with recurrent presacral lesions on admission. Preoperative pelvic MRI, pelvic CT, and endorectal ultrasonography (ERUS) were performed in 23, 22, and 8 cases, respectively. MRI/CT showed that five cases had two coexisting lesions and three cases had lobulated or dumbbell shaped lesions, all of which were confirmed by intraoperative findings. ERUS suspected involvement of the rectal wall in three cases: adhesion to the rectal wall in two cases, and tumor invasion in the remaining case. During the operation, 26, 8, and 2 cases were resected by the transsacral, transabdominal, and combined abdominosacral approach, respectively. Four patients underwent simultaneous coccygectomy, and three patients received simultaneous resection of the sacrum and coccyx. Simultaneous partial resection of the invaded sigmoid colon or rectum was performed in two patients, respectively. By postoperative pathological examination, three cases were found to have ruptured cystic lesions, three had previous cyst rupture history, and five had infected lesions.

Presacral lesions are likely to be multiple, lobulated, infected, ruptured, and adhesive to the sacrococcyx and rectum, which contribute to the high local recurrence rate. Preoperative CT/MRI/ERUS and careful intraoperative exploration are required to direct surgical treatment and to reduce local recurrence. Optimal selection of surgical approach also is very important to reduce local recurrence. Presacral lesions attached to the sacrococcyx or rectum require simultaneous partial resection of the sacrococcyx or rectum to reduce local recurrence.
