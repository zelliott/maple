The pre-prosthetic treatments of two female patients with osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joints were presented in this paper. In the first case report, an 83-year-old patient wore complete dentures (CDs) for 30 years. The second patient (71 years of age) wore a three-year-old upper CD and a lower removable partial denture with a two-unit fixed dental prosthesis. Pain was successfully eliminated by the stabilization splint on the upper CD. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to confirm the diagnosis and clinical follow-up of the splint treatment.
