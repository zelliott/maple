Hydromyelia, or hydrosyringomyelia is frequently associated with the Chiari I malformation of the cerebellar tonsils. Descent of the cerebellar tonsils is considered a congenital anomaly with a few reports of 'acquired' Chiari I malformation. We report a patient with a giant craniopharyngioma and hydrocephalus who at presentation had a concomitant Chiari I malformation and hydromyelia. The patient underwent gross total resection of the tumor and, with no further treatment, demonstrated spontaneous resolution of the Chiari I malformation and hydromyelia during the postoperative period. This suggests that the Chiari I malformation and the resulting hydromyelia were 'acquired', and were caused by an intracranial mass effect. This provides further evidence for an associative mechanism of cerebellar tonsillar descent and the development of hydromyelia.
