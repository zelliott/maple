Osteochondromas are essentially the most common primary bone tumors. These benign cartilage producing neoplasms are generally asymptomatic and have a relatively small potential for adverse effects. HME, the familial form of this tumor, is associated with a greater incidence of complications, the most significant of which is sarcomatous degeneration to secondary chondrosarcomas. Various imaging techniques can be used to characterize these lesions, but in the absence of symptoms or signs of complications, plain-film radiography is usually sufficient for diagnosis as this tumor has a characteristic radiographic appearance. Once this benign tumor is identified and more serious forms of tumor are ruled out, treatment is generally not needed. If a malignancy is suspected, however, complete surgical excision is the preferred treatment as this usually ensures long term survival.
