The endoscopic removal of third ventricular colloid cysts has been developed as an alternative to microsurgical transcortical-transventricular and transcallosal approaches.

To examine the value of endoscopic technique by reviewing the large number of endoscopically treated patients with long-term follow-up in 2 neurosurgical centers.

A retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients admitted for resection of a third ventricular colloid cyst to the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (Nijmegen, The Netherlands) and the HÃ´pital Henri Mondor (Paris, France) between 1994 and 2007. Both clinical and radiological symptoms and operative results were evaluated.

Postdischarge clinical follow-up was available for 85 patients over a mean period of 4 years 3 months. Permanent morbidity occurred in 1 patient (persisting preoperative memory deficit). Follow-up imaging of 80 evaluable patients showed that total or nearly total cyst removal was possible in 46 individuals (57.5%). Residual cyst was present in 34 patients (42.5%), and 6 required repeated endoscopic surgery for symptomatic regrowth. Recurrent cysts were mainly seen within the first 2 years after surgery.

It is debatable whether the higher numbers of recurrent or residual cysts can be justified by the slightly lower complication rates achieved with endoscopic removal. However, results have been improving over the years. Moreover, the modifications observed on control magnetic resonance images justify the need for regular control imaging for at least the first 2 years postoperatively.
