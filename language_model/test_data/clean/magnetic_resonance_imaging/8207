Accurate distinction between viable and infarcted myocardium is important for assessment of patients who have cardiac dysfunction. Through the technique of delayed-enhancement MRI (DE-MRI), viable and infarcted myocardium can be simultaneously identified in a manner that closely correlates with histopathology findings. This article provides an overview of experimental data establishing the physiologic basis of DE-MRI-evidenced hyperenhancement as a tissue-specific marker of myocardial infarction. Clinical data concerning the utility of transmural extent of hyperenhancement for predicting response to medical and revascularization therapy are reviewed. Studies directly comparing DE-MRI to other viability imaging techniques are presented, and emerging applications for DE-MRI are discussed.
