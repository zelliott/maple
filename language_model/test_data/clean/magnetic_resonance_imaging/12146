An MRI tomograph was used to examine 396 patients with suspected disc pathology of the lumbosacral region. Forty two patients in whom disc herniation was diagnosed underwent surgery. MR proved to be a reliable and accurate method for the diagnosis of disc herniation, revealing its site and size as well as compression on the neural structures. The limits of MR are discussed and integrated diagnostic protocol in lumbosacral disc pathology is proposed.
