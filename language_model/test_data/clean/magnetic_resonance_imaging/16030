MR imaging is a useful modality for evaluating athletes presenting with elbow pain. Osteochondral injuries and ligamentous injuries are well seen on MR imaging. Ligamentous injuries may be associated with clinical instability syndromes, the secondary signs of which may be evident on MR images. Enthesopathies and distal biceps tendon injuries are common clinical problems that may be seen in both professional and recreational athletes. Nerve compression syndromes may be investigated using MR imaging; however, the usual aim of imaging is to exclude an underlying space-occupying lesion. This article reviews the basic anatomy of the elbow joint and discusses the common osteochondral injuries, ligamentous injuries, instability syndromes, and tendinous pathologies at the elbow joint. The role of imaging in compressive neuropathies is briefly discussed.
