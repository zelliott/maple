Results of surgical treatment of 253 patients with glial tumors and 47 patients with metastatic tumors of the brain are analyzed. An analysis with CT and MRT was used in the preoperative diagnosis for the calculation of the tumor volume and the dislocation degree. Microsurgical technologies used in the treatment allowed to shorten the period of postoperative rehabilitation, to reduce the development of neurological deficit that created conditions for early postoperative X-ray and chemotherapy.
