A case report of spinal extradural angiolipoma, a rare tumor that can cause spinal cord compression, is presented with a complete review of the literature related to this disorder.

To discuss venous thrombosis involving the angiolipoma in the development of subacute paraparesis.

This case shows that venous thrombosis of a spinal angiolipoma can precipitate the subacute onset of paraparesis.

Medical history, physical findings, and the results of imaging and histopathologic studies were analyzed to elucidate the pathogenesis of the patient's subacute onset of paraparesis. A bilateral T3-T7 laminectomy was performed, and although the tumor was extremely hemorrhagic, it was mobilized easily off the compressed dura to achieve resection.

The postoperative course was uneventful. One month after her surgery, the patient's myelopathic symptoms had resolved, and the she was able to return to work.

Because the prognosis after surgical management of these lesions is favorable, the diagnosis of thrombosis involving a spinal angiolipoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of subacute spinal cord compression.
