Juxtacortical spots on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images can be frequently detected in patients with migraine. However, the origins of the cerebral lesions (including juxtacortical spots on FLAIR images) found in the previous studies are not known. We sought to investigate the association between juxtacortical spots on FLAIR images and right-to-left shunt (RLS) in migraine patients.

Juxtacortical spots on FLAIR images were arbitrarily defined as small areas of hyperintensities in the juxtacortex and cortico-subcortical junction. The presence of RLS was examined by a transcranial Dopper (TCD) with the agitated saline test. The degree of RLS was categorized into four grades according to the number of microemboli: no shunt, <10 microbubbles (MB), >10 MB single spots pattern, and >10 MB shower/curtain pattern. We compared the results for migraine patients (n = 49) with those for healthy controls (n = 49).

Juxtacortical spots on FLAIR images occurred in 38/98 subjects; of them, 27/49 (55.1%) had migraines and 11/49 (22.2%) were healthy controls (P = 0.002). The independent factors associated with juxtacortical spots on FLAIR images were female, migraine patients, and RLS by multivariate analysis. In migraine patients, RLS was independently associated with juxtacortical spots on FLAIR images.

Our results suggest that juxtacortical spots on FLAIR images were frequently found in migraine patients and might be associated with the presence of RLS in those patients. Further studies are needed to assess whether juxtacortical spots have clinical implications in patients with migraine.
