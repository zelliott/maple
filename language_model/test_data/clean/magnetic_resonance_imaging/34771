The prognosis for patients with ependymomas is related to the adequacy of surgical clearance. It is, however, often not possible to obtain a macroscopically complete resection of tumors arising in the posterior fossa. This may be because of the involvement of structures, the sacrifice of which would result in unacceptable morbidity, or because of metastatic lesions at diagnosis. For those patients in whom initial surgery was incomplete, elective second-look surgery may allow more complete clearance of tumor.

We have performed second-look surgery for fourth ventricle ependymomas in five patients: two women, aged 26 and 27 years, and three male patients, aged 4 months, 19 months, and 18 years. The 19-month-old male patient underwent early second-look surgery without receiving any interim chemotherapy. Second-look surgery on the other four patients was performed after they had received chemotherapy. No additional major morbidity was associated with the subsequent surgery, which achieved macroscopically complete clearances in four of the five patients. Three of four patients who underwent macroscopically complete resections were well, without clinical or radiological evidence of recurrent tumor, at 23, 25, and 34 months after their second operations. The 10-month-old patient who underwent early second-look complete resection relapsed locally at 33 months after surgery. Complete resection was not possible in one patient who had progressive tumor 8 months after second-look surgery.

For patients in whom complete excision of fourth ventricle ependymomas is not possible at initial surgery, second-look procedures may enable macroscopic clearance to be achieved with little morbidity. A larger study is needed to evaluate this approach to treatment.
