Malignant meningiomas are associated with a high rate of local recurrence, but seldom give remote metastases. Here, we report a case with carcinomatous meningitis occurring 13 months after treatment of the initial tumor. MRI showed no significant abnormalities. CSF contained abnormal cells, and electronic microscopy after cytocentrifugation confirmed their identity with the initial tumor.
