An international workshop on the noninvasive measurement of iron was conducted by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) on April 17, 2001, to assess the current state of the science and to identify areas needing further investigation. The workshop concluded that a clear clinical need is evident for quantitative, noninvasive, safe, accurate, and readily available means of measuring body storage iron to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with iron overload from such disorders as hereditary hemochromatosis, thalassemia major, sickle cell disease, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplasia, among others. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) potentially provides the best available technique for examining the 3-dimensional distribution of excess iron in the body, but further research is needed to develop means of making measurements quantitative. Biomagnetic susceptometry provides the only noninvasive method to measure tissue iron stores that has been calibrated, validated, and used in clinical studies, but the complexity, cost, and technical demands of the liquid-helium-cooled superconducting instruments required at present have restricted clinical access to the method. The workshop identified basic and clinical research opportunities for deepening our understanding of the physical properties of iron and iron toxicity, for further investigation of MRI as a method for quantitative determinations of tissue iron, especially in liver, heart and brain, and for development of improved methods and more widely available instrumentation for biomagnetic susceptometry.
