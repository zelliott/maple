Posterior fossa ependymoma usually arise in the fourth ventricle. Though extension of this tumor into the cerebellopontine angle and subarachnoid space through the foramina of Luschka or Magendie is well described, a primary extraaxial cerebellopontine angle location of a posterior fossa ependymoma is distinctly uncommon. The authors report imaging in such an unusual case of a primary cerebellopontine angle ependymoma.
