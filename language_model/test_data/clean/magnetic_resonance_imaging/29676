Complications after meniscal repair have been associated with inside-out and outside-in techniques. After the introduction of devices for meniscal repair, reports of chondral damage have been increasing. However, meniscal cyst formation after use of suture materials for meniscal repair is a very rare complication. We report a case of meniscal cyst formation after use of nonabsorbable sutures for meniscal repair.
