A cephalometric study was carried out on 98 patients assigned to 3 groups including 48 patients with sleep apnea, 25 patients with chronic rhonchopathy without apnea, and 25 controls, respectively. 44 patients benefited from lateral teleroentgenographic investigations and 54 had sagittal-median NMR sections visualized. Various distance, angle and area measurements were obtained. The authors found that anomalies were the more severe that snoring was associated with sleep apnea. These arguments speak for an evolutional character of the disease. The various cephalometric anomalies were primarily related to the hyoglossal apparatus, more rarely to the maxillary-mandibular basal bones. After this analysis, the authors propose a therapeutic strategy for the management of chronic snoring associated with sleep apnea.
