A right frontal and left cerebellar diaschisis, resulting from a right pontine infarction, is reported in a patient with complete left hemiplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging and CT scan supported the existence of the pontine infarction. The SPECT-HMPAO-99mTc showed a relative hypoactivity in the right frontal lobe and left cerebellar hemisphere.
