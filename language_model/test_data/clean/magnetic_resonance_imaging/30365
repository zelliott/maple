The authors report an autopsy case of acute encephalopathy in which generalized convulsion and coma occurred after ingestion of Pleurocybella porrigens (angel's wing mushroom). The patient was a 65-year-old man who had undergone hemodialysis for 3 months due to chronic renal failure. Pathologic examination of the brain revealed extensive postinfarction-like cystic necrosis in the bilateral putamens and multiple spotty necroses in the deep cerebral and cerebellar cortices. In 2004, similar acute encephalopathy related to ingestion of the mushroom was endemic in Japan, the pathogenesis of which remains to be elucidated.
