An important aspect of schizophrenia symptomatology is inner-outer confusion, or blurring of ego boundaries, which is linked to symptoms such as hallucinations and Schneiderian delusions. Dysfunction in the cognitive processes involved in the generation of private thoughts may contribute to blurring of the ego boundaries through increased activation in functional networks including speech- and voice-selective cortical regions. In the present study, the neural underpinnings of silent verbal thought generation and speech perception were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Functional connectivity analysis was performed using constrained principal component analysis for fMRI (fMRI-CPCA). Group differences were observable on two functional networks: one reflecting hyperactivity in speech- and voice-selective cortical regions (e.g., bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG)) during both speech perception and silent verbal thought generation, and another involving hyperactivity in a multiple demands (i.e., task-positive) network that included Wernicke's area, during silent verbal thought generation. This set of preliminary results suggests that hyperintensity of functional networks involving voice-selective cortical regions may contribute to the blurring of ego boundaries characteristic of schizophrenia.
