The surgical management of craniovertebral junction abnormalities depends on accurate radiological identification of the static and dynamic relationships. Four cases are presented to show the importance of flexion/extension magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional computerized tomography scanning in the evaluation of these relationships. With these techniques, anterior and/or posterior decompressive procedures can be appropriately planned to reduce and stabilize craniovertebral abnormalities. Long-term neural deficits can be reversed by these procedures.
