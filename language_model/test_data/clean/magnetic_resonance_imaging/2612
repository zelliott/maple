We review the data from structural neuroimaging studies (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) related to depressive disorders. In addition, we review the relevant functional neuroimaging research, including studies of normal emotional processing, studies of the functional neuroanatomy of major depression, and neurochemical neuroimaging studies of depression. Finally, we discuss existing neurobiological models of depression and offer modifications based upon the body of neuroimaging research we have presented.
