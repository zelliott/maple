Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a subacute demyelinating opportunistic infection of the central nervous system which frequently occurs in AIDS. CT and MR, together with clinical and virological findings, can suggest a correct diagnosis in most cases, thus avoiding stereotactic biopsy which is too invasive considering the lack of therapy and the poor prognosis of this disease. In this study we reviewed the CT and MR findings of 16 proved AIDS-related PML cases. PML lesions appeared as hypodense on CT, hypointense on T1w, hyperintense on PDw and T2w MR images. CT was less sensitive than T2w MR images and underestimated the number of lesions and/or disease extent. On the basis of our findings during the progression of the lesions we observed two different patterns of PML presentation and evolution i.e., "single" and "multifocal". Single lesions generally involve subcortical white matter (arcuate fibers) of parietal lobe and spread to the contralateral hemisphere across the corpus callosum; multiple "patchy" lesions can be localized variably in the cerebral hemispheres and also in the brainstem and cerebellar hemispheres.
