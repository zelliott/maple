We report a 72-year-old patient who developed acute limbic encephalitis initially considered of uncertain aetiology. Detailed information on clinical presentation, MRI appearance, antibody levels, cognitive impairment assessment, treatment and evolution of the patient is reported here. Since the early 2000s, many antibodies implied in central nervous system autoimmune disorders have been identified. Anti-glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) antibodies have been recently identified as associated with limbic encephalitis, as was the case in our patient.
