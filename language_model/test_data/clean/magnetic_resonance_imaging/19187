Malignant B-cell lymphomas of the dura mater are very rare. A case of primary centroblastic/centrocytic lymphoma of the dura mimicking a bilateral convexity meningioma is presented.

A 50-year-old woman was referred to our institution with a 6-month history of headache and two Jacksonian seizures. Computed tomography revealed a parafalcine and bilateral convexity lesion. Cerebral angiography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed prior to surgery. At surgery the tumor was removed subtotally. The patient was treated postoperatively by combined chemo- and radiotherapy.

Laboratory studies and follow-up examinations revealed no evidence of systemic lymphoma nor of any immunocompromised state. According to the presented case combined surgery and chemoradiotherapy seems to be an effective treatment for this rare lesion.
