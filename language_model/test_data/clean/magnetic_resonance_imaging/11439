The pineal region is a heterogeneous area that includes the pineal gland and several parapineal structures. Pineal region masses include germ cell tumors (GCTs), pineal parenchymal cell tumors, glioma, meningioma, metastases, and non-neoplastic masses such as pineal cysts, lipoma, epidermoid, vascular malformations. Although MRI has allowed an improvement in distinguishing true pineal masses from parapineal masses impinging into the region of the gland, it is still difficult to differentiate the pineal GCTs from pineal parenchymal tumors with only images, and the clinical informations such as age, sex, and the tumor markers are very important.
