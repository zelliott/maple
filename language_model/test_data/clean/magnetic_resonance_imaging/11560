Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is able to demonstrate a wide range of abnormalities in the paranasal sinuses, which are often reported as incidental findings on scans performed for indications other than the evaluation of paranasal sinus pathology. However, the clinical significance of these findings remains undefined. We present a prospective study that determines the prevalence of abnormalities in the paranasal sinuses in a population undergoing MRI scans for suspected intracranial disease. These findings are correlated with clinical data pertaining to nasal and sinus symptoms.

Prospective, cross-sectional study.

Patients undergoing MRI scans for suspected intracranial pathology were asked to complete a questionnaire pertaining to symptoms of nasal/sinus pathology. The T2-weighted scans of 86 patients (mean age = 51 years) were then reviewed for evidence of paranasal sinus pathology using a standardized method for evaluation and reporting of results. These results were then correlated with those obtained from the patient questionnaire.

Radiologic abnormalities were found in the paranasal sinuses of 33 (38%) patients. Abnormalities were most commonly seen in the ethmoid sinuses (44.8%) followed by the maxillary (38%), sphenoid (14%), and frontal (3%) sinuses. Analysis of the clinical data revealed no significant relationship between the presence of clinical symptoms of nasal and sinus pathology and abnormalities on MRI scan.

The assessment of inflammatory sinus pathology remains controversial. Based on the results of this study, incidental abnormalities of the paranasal sinuses detected on MRI scan do not appear to be related to clinical symptoms.
