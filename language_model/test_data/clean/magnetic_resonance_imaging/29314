A more differentiated therapy regimen concept for gastric cancer requires more precise pre-operative diagnostic imaging. There are several methods for pre-operative locoregional tumor staging in gastric cancer: percutaneous abdominal ultrasound with hydrotechnique (HUS), endoluminal ultrasound in the stomach (EUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The advantages and indications for each method are described and an overview of the medical literature is given. The results in the literature are compared to our own findings, which were obtained in prospective studies comparing the four different imaging methods. On the basis of our experience and the literature, we conclude that the indication for the different diagnostic imaging methods primarily depends on the type of therapy concept followed in the respective surgical department. Endoscopy with biopsy remains the primary diagnostic procedure. Endosonography (EUS) is another diagnostic procedure, which can be performed simultaneously with endoscopy. Only special questions or reasons warrant the use of other imaging methods.
