Two brothers with hepatoblastoma were noted to have a family history of early onset colon cancer. Genetic testing of the younger brother revealed a deletion in exon 15 of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene (2710-2711delAG), consistent with a diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). We review the clinical and molecular aspects of the relationship between hepatoblastoma and FAP, and the implications for diagnostic testing and cancer screening in affected patients.
