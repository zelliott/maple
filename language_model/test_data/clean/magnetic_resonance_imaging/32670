According to the new definition proposed by the TIA working group, transient ischemic stroke (TIA) is "a brief episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain or retinal ischemia, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than one hour, and without evidence of acute infarction." Patient presenting with a TIA should be investigated and treated urgently because the risk of ischemic stroke is about 10% at one month with 50% of these events occurring during the first 48 hours. Atherosclerosis, cardioembolism and small vessel disease account for the majority of TA. Aspirin should be started as soon as possible after brain imaging has been performed. Other treatment such as oral anticoagulants or carotide surgery may be necessary, depending on the result of the electronical work up.
