Osteoarticular tuberculosis in children is rare in developed countries. We report three patients who were monitored between 3 1/2 years and 8 years. The primary focus was located in the distal epiphysis of the femur, distal epiphysis of the tibia, and the calcaneus. The lesions were initially radiolucent and ill defined, appearing afterward surrounded by a sclerosis halo; these features may disguise them as other infectious lesions or pseudotumoral processes. A poorly defined set of symptoms and a lack of specific signs may delay their diagnosis and treatment. Histopathological examination and culture identification are in the most accurate methods to reach a definitive diagnosis. Lesion scrapping and chemotherapy during sat least 9 months was effective in two patients.
