A new association of Vanishing White Matter (VWM) and premature ovarian failure (POF) was recently described as a sole entity called ovarioleukodystrophy. Seven out of eight patients reported by Fogli et al. had translation initiation factor (eIF2B) mutations, specific to the VWM. The only patient without mutations had a distinctive neurological presentation that included cognitive deterioration without motor signs and white matter abnormalities restricted to the frontal lobe. We describe here a case suggestive of ovarioleukodistrophy carrying no eIF2B mutations.
