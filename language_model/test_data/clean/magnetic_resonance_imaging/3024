The magnetic resonance in an 8-year-old boy with hypopituitarism and cervical syringomyelia are presented. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain clearly demonstrated syringomyelia in the cervical spinal cord and transection of the pituitary stalk, findings identical to those reported in the literature. Both disorders have been seen in association with a difficult labor, so we suggest that this is not a chance finding.
