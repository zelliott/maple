Anterior mandibular lingual salivary gland defects are rare. They may be evident on routine radiographic exam. Because the differential diagnosis can be exhaustive, differential interpretation and diagnosis are crucial. A case of large bilateral radiolucent lesions of the anterior mandible that was an anterior mandibular salivary gland defect is reported in a young female. This lesion was initially visualized on a panoramic radiograph. Further evaluation was undertaken with dental cone-beam computed tomography. Confirmation of bilateral anterior mandibular lingual salivary gland defects was made using magnetic resonance imaging, negating the need for surgical biopsy.
