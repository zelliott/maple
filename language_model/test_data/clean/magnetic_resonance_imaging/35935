This paper presents the views of a coordination chemist on the synthesis and the properties of new contrast agents containing gadolinium. Attention is drawn to various macrocyclic complexes such as the polyaza polycarboxylic chelates, the cryptates as well as compounds obtained by template synthesis. The structural factors influencing the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the gadolinium complexes are discussed with special emphasis on the polyaza polycarboxylic derivatives. Some of the macrocyclic complexes under investigation are more stable than Gd-DTPA.
