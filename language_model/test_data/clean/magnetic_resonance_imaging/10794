Fetus in fetu is an extremely rare condition in which a fetiform calcified mass is contained within the newborn or infant, often in the retroperitoneal cavity. We report a case of a fetus in fetu in the posterior mediastinum of a newborn. The prospective diagnosis was made by fetal US and MRI and confirmed by postnatal plain radiograph, CT and MRI.
