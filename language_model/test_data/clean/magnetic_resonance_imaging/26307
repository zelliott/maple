We describe the MRI and US features of two patients with endometrial stromal sarcoma of the uterus. Both lesions appeared as voluminous polypoid masses within an expanded endometrial cavity on both US and MRI. They had mixed echo-texture and heterogenous signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences. T2-weighted images were most helpful in detecting the endometrial nature of the disease and its relationships with surrounding myometrium.
