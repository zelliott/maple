We report a 26-year-old man with eosinophilic fasciitis who presented with progressive joint contractures of all four limbs. In this patient, the serum aldolase concentration was elevated while the serum creatinine kinase concentration was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging showed gadolinium enhancement of fascial structures in the lower limbs. With the clinical improvement by the treatment with oral corticosteroid, the aldolase concentration was decreased, and the fascial hyperintensity on magnetic resonance images was reduced. The phenomenon of increased an aldolase concentration accompanied by a normal creatinine kinase concentration may be characteristic of eosinophilic fasciitis. Serial magnetic resonance images and serum aldolase concentration are useful for monitoring the therapeutic response in this condition.
