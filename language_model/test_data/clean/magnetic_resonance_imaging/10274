A 61-year-old woman developed metastatic angiosarcoma in her left orbit. Diagnosis was confirmed with an incisional orbital biopsy and special markers. Treatment and palliation involved the use of multiple cycles of paclitaxcel, doxorubicin, and ifosfamide along with adjuvant radiotherapy. The measured outcome was tumor mass reduction and mortality. Angiosarcoma was confirmed with histologic analysis. The patient responded to the chemotherapy with reduction of the tumor mass. However, the disease progressed off the medications. She finally died. However, she survived longer than the patient in the only other similar case report. Chemotherapy may be a useful palliative adjunct in the control of metastatic orbital angiosarcoma. Chemotherapy is unlikely to be curative but useful and an adjunct to surgery and radiation therapy.
