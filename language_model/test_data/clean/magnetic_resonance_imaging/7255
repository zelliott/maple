A large midline posterior fossa medulluloblastoma and a cerebellar arteriovenous malformation with associated clot were moved with postoperative mutism. Mutism was immediate and resolved into an ataxic dysarthria with residual mild dysarthria at 3 months. The literature is reviewed, and the clinicopathological and neurophysiological data of cerebellar function in speech are discussed. Acute injury to the midportion of the cerebellum with or without dentate nuclear involvement can cause a spectrum of speech disturbances. The more widespread the injury to the midportion of the cerebellum with dentate nuclei involvement the greater the risk of developing postoperative mutism.
