One of the major challenges of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis is to develop simple and reliable methods to correlate brain regions with functionality. In this paper, we employ a detrending-based fractal method, called detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), to identify brain activity from fMRI data. We perform three tasks: (a) Estimating noise level from experimental fMRI data; (b) Assessing a signal model recently introduced by Birn et al.; and (c) Evaluating the effectiveness of DFA for discriminating brain activations from artifacts. By computing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we find that the ROC curve for experimental data is similar to the curve for simulated data with similar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This suggests that the proposed algorithm for estimating noise level is very effective and that Birn's model fits our experimental data very well. The brain activation maps for experimental data derived by DFA are similar to maps derived by deconvolution using a widely used software, AFNI. Considering that deconvolution explicitly uses the information about the experimental paradigm to extract the activation patterns whereas DFA does not, it remains to be seen whether one can effectively integrate the two methods to improve accuracy for detecting brain areas related to functional activity.
