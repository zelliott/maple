A novel microimaging method is described for measuring the effective diffusion coefficient (D infinity) of water in saturated, microporous materials. A simple multicompartment computer simulation was used to show how the value of D infinity, when combined with measurements of water proton relaxation times and pulsed field gradient spin-echo amplitudes, allows the pore size distribution and pore connectivity to be characterized.
