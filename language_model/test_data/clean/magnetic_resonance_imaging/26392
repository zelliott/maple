The aneurysm of the descending aorta complicating a pseudocoarctation, itself due to a congenital elongation with kinking of the aorta is a rare entity.

We report a case of aortic aneurysm discovered in a 72 years old woman without notable antecedents, which was referred for recurrent bronchitis. The X-ray showed a calcified opacity of the upper mediastinum, 5 cm of large. A thoracic CT-scan evoked the presence of a circulating sacciform aneurysm with calcified walls, developing on the final part of the aortic arch, which was with abnormally ascending way going up to the cervico-thoracic orifice and carrying out an aspect of aortic kinking. The assessment was complemented by a RMI as well as an aortic opacification. A thoracic scintigraphy showed an hypoperfusion of the left lung. The remainder of the cardiac assessment was normal. The patient was operated under femoro-femoral extracorporeal circulation through a left posterolateral thoracotomy of the 4th intercostal space. The examination showed a 7 cm diameter calcified aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta complicating a tight stenosis in connection with an elongation and a kinking. The upper section of the aorta was shifted towards the pleural dome. The aortic section above aneurism was of normal size whereas the lower section was dilated. The aneurism was excised and a prosthetic graft was carried out. The surgery follow-up was marked by an hemodynamic stability, without neurological deficit. A ventilatory assistance was necessary during 5 days. Currently with 8 months follow-up, the patient goes well.

A prosthetic replacement in front of this type of aneurism is legitimate given the risk of the occurrence of complications secondary to the pseudocoarctation (arterial hypertension, aortic insufficiency) or to the aneurism itself, dissection or compression of vicinity (pulmonary artery).
