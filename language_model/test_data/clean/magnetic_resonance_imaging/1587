Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the caudate nucleus have reported reversal asymmetry and alterations of its size, suggesting a striate cortical disorder related to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The objective was to evaluate whether alterations of the asymmetry and size of the caudate nucleus head exist in a sample of well-controlled 7- to 11-year-old Colombian children, with different types of ADHD. Two groups of cases-ADHD of the combined type and ADHD of the inattentive type-and one control group, were selected. Multiple methods for assessing ADHD (rating scales, psychologic.interview, neurologic history and examination, and neuropsychologic evaluation) were used to confirm the diagnoses. Participants with a history of language disorder, learning disabilities, depression, and other major neurologic and psychiatric conditions were excluded. Finally all groups had 15 children, matched by sex (7 male, 8 female), age, socioeconomic status, and grade. Height, weight, head circumference, and encephalic index were statistically controlled. Three T1-weighted volumetric (three-dimensional) MRI slides of the caudate nucleus head were obtained with a 1.5-Tesla Gyroscan apparatus. The control group had a significantly higher Wechsler Full-Scale IQ than the groups with ADHD of the combined type and ADHD of the inattentive type (P < .001). Volumes from the left caudate nucleus head were significantly larger than volumes from the right in all groups (P < .001). There were no group differences when volumes were compared between groups. All of the groups had left caudate nucleus head volumes significantly higher than right, although there were no between-group differences. The results in relation to previous studies are discussed.
