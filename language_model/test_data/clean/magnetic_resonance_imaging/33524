Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) is one of the most important methods for noninvasively evaluating the state of water in the biological system. It could be useful for evaluation of the early changes of cataract. In this study, in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to rat galactosemic cataract, which is a model of the human diabetic cataract, and compared with the histological findings. The relationship between the relaxation times (T1, T2) and the water contents were discussed. The T1 and T2 values were prolonged and the high intensity area of the lens cortex was enlarged from the early stage of the cataract (two days after the intake of galactose). These changes preceded the histological changes. This suggests that MRI is applicable for the evaluation of anti-cataract agents, for example aldose reductase inhibitors, against human diabetic cataract.
