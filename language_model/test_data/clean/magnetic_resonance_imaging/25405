Synovial sarcomas primarily occur chiefly in the para-articular regions of the extremities and extremely rarely in the prostatic region. We report a patient with synovial sarcoma of the prostatic fascia. The patient underwent retropubic radical prostatectomy and at 6 months of follow-up, no evidence of another lesion or local recurrence was found.
