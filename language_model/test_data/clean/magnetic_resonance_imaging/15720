Mice are used in many studies to determine the role of genetic and molecular factors in mammalian development and human congenital diseases. MRI has emerged as a major method for analyzing mutant and transgenic phenotypes in developing mice, at both embryonic and neonatal stages. Progress in this area is reviewed, with emphasis on the use of MRI to analyze cardiovascular and neural development in mice. Comparisons are made with other imaging technologies, including optical and ultrasound imaging, discussing the potential strengths and weaknesses of MRI and identifying the future challenges for MRI in mouse developmental biology.
