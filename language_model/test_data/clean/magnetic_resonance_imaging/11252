Split cord malformation (SCM) is an uncommon developmental anomaly characterized a cleft spinal cord. In type I, each of the hemicords is contained within an individual dural tube whereas in type II there is a common dural tube housing both hemicords. Commonly diagnosed in childhood, adult presentation is exceptional.

We report the case of two women whose type II SCM was discovered at the age of 40 and 54 years.

The first patient complained of chronic lombar and radicular chronic pain with dysuria. Physical examination revealed a radicular syndrome with abolition of the left Achille reflex and a lombar hair tuft. MRI showed a disc herniation at the L5-S1 level, with a partial SCM at the level of the L2 vertebra, spina bifida and tethered cord. The second patient complained of lombar pain with perineal irradiation for 6 years. Physical examination showed a lombar cutaneous angioma. MRI revealed a thoraco-lombar SCM at the T12 to L1 level, with spina bifida. No spur could not be identified in either patient. No further surgical treatment was given.

Based on these two observations, we propose a review of literature reporting 90 cases of adult SCM.
