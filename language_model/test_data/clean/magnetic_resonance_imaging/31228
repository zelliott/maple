The outcome of children and adolescents with Ewing sarcoma is impacted by many prognostic factors and often measured by estimates of: event-free, relapse-free, disease-free, or overall survival. However, the preferred assessment following radiation therapy is local control.

A review of large group experiences over the past several decades was undertaken to assess the optimal radiation dose and volume for patients with localized, osseous Ewing sarcoma. New approaches and techniques to improve local control were also investigated.

With multidisciplinary therapy, 5-year overall local control rates range from 58 to 93%. Following definitive irradiation, they are 53-86%. Recommended radiation therapy doses are 55.8-60.0 Gy. In the postoperative setting, gross disease requires 55.8 Gy; microscopic disease requires 45 Gy. Altered fractionation schemes have not improved local control. The appropriate irradiated volume is an involved field to the pretreatment tumor volume plus 2.0-2.5 cm margin, followed by a boost to the post-induction chemotherapy tumor volume with margin. Good radiation quality control with central review improves local control. Use of an involved radiation field requires accuracy in defining tumor volume. Techniques to improve local control include risk-adapted multidisciplinary therapy, intraoperative boost radiation, and high radiation doses as delivered by 3-dimensional conformal radiation. Intensity modulated and proton beam radiotherapy may offer an advantage at special sites.

Innovative uses of radiation in the multidisciplinary setting will continue to provide excellent local control, improved function, and quality of life for young patients with localized Ewing sarcoma of bone.
