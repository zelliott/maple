There are many procedures in treating patients with multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Successful treatment of multilevel CSM requires adequate decompression and stability of the cervical spine that prevents further neurological deterioration. Multilevel laminectomy and instrumentation with lateral mass plates is associated with minimal morbidity, provides excellent decompression of the spinal cord, produces immediate stability of the cervical spine, prevents kyphotic deformity, and precludes further development of spondylosis at fused levels. Neurological outcome is equal or superior to multilevel anterior procedures because of minimal complication and prevent spinal deformity associated with laminoplasty or noninstrumented laminectomy. From the study of 7 patients with multilevel CSM who were treated with multilevel laminectomy and posterolateral mass plating. The neurological outcome of all 7 patients was improved without complications after follow-up for 6 months.
