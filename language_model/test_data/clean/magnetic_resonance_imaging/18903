To evaluate the feasibility of Interactive Scan Control (ISC), a new MR image navigation system, during percutaneous puncture in cryosurgery.

With the ISC system in place, percutaneous MR-guided cryosurgery was performed in 26 cases, with the ISC system being used in 11 cases (five renal tumors, three uterine fibroids and three metastatic liver tumors). The ISC system comprised infrared cameras and an MR-compatible optical tracking tool that was directly connected to a cryoprobe. Tumor sizes ranged from 1.2 cm (metastatic liver tumor) to 9.0 cm (uterine fibroid), for a mean size of 3.9 cm. With ISC, one to three cryoprobes with a diameter of 2 mm or 3 mm were advanced into the tumors with the guidance of an MR fluoroscopic image. Two freeze-thaw cycles were used for cryosurgery. During the cryosurgery, the formation of iceballs was monitored on MR images. Follow-up dynamic CT or MRI as well as physical examinations were conducted after two weeks and six weeks.

Placement of probes was successfully performed under the control of the ISC system. During cryosurgery, engulfment of the tumors by iceballs was carefully monitored by MRI. Necrosis of the cryoablated area was confirmed in all renal tumors by follow-up dynamic CT. The size regression of the uterine fibroids was observed through follow-up MRI. Two of the three cases of metastatic liver tumor were ablated completely. Additional therapy for a residual tumor was performed on one patient with a metastatic liver tumor. A small amount of pneumothorax was the only complication found in a patient with a metastatic liver tumor.

MR-guided cryosurgery with this new navigation system was feasible with low morbidity and allowed for safe and accurate puncture with a cryoprobe.
