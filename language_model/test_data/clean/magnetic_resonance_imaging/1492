Recent studies have shown that the diffusional signal decay in human brain is non-monoexponential and may be described in terms of compartmentalized water fractions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which provides information about tissue structure and orientation, typically uses b values up to 1000 s x mm(-2) so that the signal is dominated by the fast diffusing fraction. In this study b factors up to 3500 s x mm(-2) are utilized, allowing the diffusion tensor properties of the more slowly diffusing fraction to be mapped for the first time. The mean diffusivity (MD) of the slow diffusion tensor was found to exhibit strong white/gray matter (WM/GM) contrast. Maps depicting the principal direction of the slow tensor indicated alignment with the fast tensor and the known orientation of the WM pathways.
