Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease which affects many organs, including the heart. Cardiac sarcoidosis has a reported incidence of about 25 % and carries a poor prognosis. It can occur in the form of conduction abnormalities, pericardial and valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis is difficult, requiring a high index of suspicion and the use of electrocardiography, echocardiography, nuclear medicine imaging, myocardial biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging. Corticosteroids have been the cornerstone of treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis, but other immunosuppressives have also been used, along with standard heart failure therapy, antiarrhythmic medications, pacemakers and implantable defibrillators. Cardiac transplantation is an option for patients who do not respond to medical treatment. We briefly review the current armamentarium for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis.
