The above paper was intended to evaluate the usefulness of MRI in the study of pathologies involving the testis, on the basis of the authors' experience and of the relevant literature. Pathologies considered included cryptorchidism, torsion of the spermatic cord, epididymitis, orchitis, and testicular tumors. MRI proved very useful in cryptorchidism, thanks to the multiple planes and good contrast resolution between different tissues. It also yields valuable information allowing to distinguish between malignant transformation of the retained testicle and its fibrotic involution. In malignant pathologies, MRI is useful for differential diagnosis between seminomatous and non-seminomatous tissues, while for purposes of staging its accuracy is only 36% but is nevertheless superior to that of U.S. (45%). In the case of other pathologies, MRI findings are non specific, and the technique should therefore be employed only when U.S. findings are unsatisfactory.
