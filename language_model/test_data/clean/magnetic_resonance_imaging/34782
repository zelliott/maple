Intraoperative brain mapping is a surgical adjunct used during lesionectomy or epilepsy surgery in functional cortex. This procedure is typically performed at academic institutions by fellowship trained neurosurgeons. However, most of the technology is straightforward and adaptable to the private practice setting. This paper outlines our intraoperative methodology for brain mapping during lesion resection in eloquent cortex.
