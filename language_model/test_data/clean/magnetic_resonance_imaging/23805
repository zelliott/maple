Three patients with Sjogren's syndrome are presented in whom frequent tonic/dystonic spasms of the limbs developed during the course of the illness. These patients' clinical findings suggested spinal cord involvement, a localization that was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging in two patients. In one patient the painful movements responded to treatment with phenytoin and in one other to baclofen. Sjogren's syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of conditions that produce tonic/dystonic limb spasms.
