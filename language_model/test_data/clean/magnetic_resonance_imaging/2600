We report a 38-year-old man systemic lupus erythematosus who presented with an acute onset of paraplegia and urinary retention. The man had a 12-year history of nodular cutaneous mucinosis and arthralgia. In 1994, he was admitted to our hospital with a sudden onset of weakness and numbness of the right leg followed by an emergence of similar symptoms in the left leg. His elder sister had died at 16 years of age after suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus for 6 years. On examination, the patient had skin rash on his chest, back, head, forehead, and extremities. The neurological examination revealed that his tongue deviated to the right on protrusion. The muscle power was reduced to 2-3/5 in the right leg and to 4/5 in the left leg. The sensory disturbance was noted in the lower extremities with predominant involvement of the right leg. Reflexes were increased in the right biceps, triceps, both patellas, and Achilles tendons. Babinski sign was noted bilaterally. Urinary retention and constipation were also noted. The results of the blood cell count and hepatic and renal function tests were normal. Serum levels of C-reactive protein and complements (C3, C4, CH50) were also normal. Serological examinations showed increased anti-DNA antibody (14 U/ml, [normal, < 6]). Antinuclear antibody was positive at a titer of 1:1380. CSF study showed an increased protein concentration of 83 mg/dl and an IgG level of 14 mg/dl with a normal number of cells. MR images revealed a T1-low, T2-high signal lesion at the upper part of the left ventral medulla. MR images of the brain and spinal cord were normal. The patient was diagnosed as having SLE. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day) pulse treatment that was started 25 days after the onset of neurological symptoms, produced partial relief. Our case presented with paraplegia with a focal lesion in the left upper ventral part of the medulla on MR images. The incidence of male SLE is low, and paraplegia is a rare complication of SLE. Thus, the medullary lesion in SLE observed in our case appears to be rare. SLE should be considered as a cause of acute onset paraplegia or myelopathy.
