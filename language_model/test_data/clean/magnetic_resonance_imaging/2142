The aim of the study was to implement a vibrotactile stimulator using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A fMRI compatible vibration device consisting of a pneumatically driven dual membrane pump was developed. Brain activation during 50 Hz vibrotactile stimulation of the right hand-palm were compared to a right 2 Hz finger-to-thumb-tapping in ten healthy, right-handed male volunteers. The vibration paradigm showed a comparable activation pattern with respect to finger-to-thumb-tapping in the contralateral perirolandic region. The advantage of the new vibration device is the possibility to elicit the vibratory-tonic-reflex due to the higher amplitude in context with the high frequency than established devices. This reflex is considered to be responsible for the activation in the primary motor cortex and the current paradigm might prove useful in future neurosurgical planning in patients with perirolandic lesions.
