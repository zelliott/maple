Tumoral calcinosis is an uncommon and benign condition characterized by the presence of slow-growing calcified periarticular soft tissue masses of varying size. They are usually asymptomatic and nerve compression is rare. We describe the case of a 54-year-old female patient on long-term hemodialysis for chronic renal failure presenting sciatica in the left lower limb secondary to an extensive uremic tumoral calcinosis that affected the hip and thigh. The pathogenesis of uremic tumoral calcinosis as well as the treatment and clinical outcome are analyzed. The uncommon nerve compression due to tumoral calcinosis are reviewed. In conclusion, uremic tumoral calcinosis is a not previously reported infrequent cause of sciatic nerve compression.
