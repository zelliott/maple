In this second part of the tutorial on sequences in MRI, the characteristics and properties of the most frequently used sequence techniques are dealt with. The differences between spin echo and gradient echo procedures are discussed in detail. Newer sequence types, such as fast spin echo sequences or echoplanar sequences, which lead to a substantially shorter examination period, are explained. The authors also go into the problems that need to be borne in mind in the selection of parameters.
