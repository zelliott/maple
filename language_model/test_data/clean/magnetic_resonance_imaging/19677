We retrospectively evaluated the functional results of patients who were treated surgically for post-traumatic isolated subscapularis tendon ruptures.

The study included six patients (5 males, 1 female; mean age 63.3 years; range 53 to 70 years) who were operated on for isolated post-traumatic subscapularis ruptures. The mean interval between the development of symptoms due to trauma and operation was 4.3 months (range 1 to 9 months). Mechanism of injury, complaints, clinical findings, imaging methods, arthroscopic and surgical findings, repair techniques, and postoperative follow-up data were assessed. Evaluations were based on physical assessment, radiographic examination, and the UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) score. The mean follow-up was 29.6 months (range 13 to 53 months).

The mean UCLA score was 11.3 (range 9 to 14) preoperatively. It increased to 25.8 (range 12 to 31) postoperatively (p<0.05). The results were good in four patients, fair in one patient, and poor in one patient. Magnetic resonance images obtained in five patients at the final follow-up showed total rupture in the patient with poor outcome, partial rupture in the patient with fair outcome, and maintenance of tendon integrity in the remaining patients.

A careful clinical examination may enable the diagnosis of subscapularis tendon ruptures. Magnetic resonance imaging may provide additional information. In most patients, the repair of the tendon is possible by proper protection of the axillary nerve and appropriate mobilization.
