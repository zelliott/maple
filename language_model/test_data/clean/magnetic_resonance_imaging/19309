Fast, low-angle shoot functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), based on the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) effect, was combined with optical recording of intrinsic signals (ORIS) and 2-deoxyglucose labeling in gerbil barrel cortex. We observed over the activated barrel a positive BOLD signal and increased levels of deoxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin during each period of prolonged (30 sec) D2 vibrissal stimulation. These data show that the hemodynamic basis of this fMRI signal is not necessarily a washout of deoxyhemoglobin, as generally assumed. Instead, they suggest that a positive BOLD signal can also be caused by a local increase of blood volume, even if deoxyhemoglobin levels are persistently elevated. We also show that this alternative interpretation is consistent with theoretical models of the BOLD signal. The changes in BOLD signal and blood volume, which are most tightly correlated with the periodic stimulation, peak at the site of neuronal activation. These results contribute to the understanding of the hemodynamic mechanisms underlying the BOLD signal and also suggest analysis methods, which improve the spatial localization of neuronal activation with both fMRI and ORIS.
