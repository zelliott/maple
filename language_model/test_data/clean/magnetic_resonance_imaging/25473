The aim of this report was to determine the feasibility of fetal cardiotocography during MR imaging and the safety of 1.5-T MR imaging on the basis of fetal heart activity and fetal movements.

Fetal cardiotocography is feasible during MR imaging using modified standard equipment. The use of 1.5-T MR imaging appears to be safe and to have no negative short-term effects on the heart rate or movement incidence of healthy third-trimester fetuses under our experimental conditions.
