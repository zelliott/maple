Three cases of granular cell tumor (GCT) of the subcutis are presented. Computed tomography showed a mass isodense with muscle with an ill-defined margin. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass with inhomogeneous low signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted-images. Another characteristic feature of subcutaneous GCT is its attachment in part to muscle. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis in all cases.
