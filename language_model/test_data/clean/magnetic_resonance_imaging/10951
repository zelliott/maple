Carcinoid tumors are non-pancreatic digestive neuroendocrine tumors well differentiated. Most of time they are developed from enterochromaffin cells of the digestive tract. Most of them are localized in ileum, rectum, stomach and appendix. Only bronchi are a frequent extra-digestive localization (20 to 25%). Most of these tumors are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during a laparotomy or secondary to the exploration of a carcinoid syndrome. From a case report and a recent review of literature, diagnosis, histology and treatment of small bowel carcinoid tumors are summarized.
