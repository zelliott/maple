The purpose of this study was to demonstrate feasibility of intraurethral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for in vivo assessment of the female urethra and to determine the anatomy of the urethra and periurethral attachments as depicted using an endourethral MR coil. Twenty-three continent volunteers were studied with a 14F endourethral MR coil. Intraurethral MRI allowed detailed visualization and measurements of the muscular layers of the urethral sphincter and permitted the evaluation of supporting ligaments. This technique may become useful in the evaluation of anatomical defects associated with female urethral sphincter deficiency.
