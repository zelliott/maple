Bal√≤'s concentric sclerosis (BCS) is a rare primary demyelinating disease of central nervous system (CNS) and is considered to be a variant of multiple sclerosis (MS). It is characterized by a severe, rapidly evolving course with CNS lesions consisting of concentric rings of demyelination alternating with myelination in the white matter. We report a patient with BCS from mainland China diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. In addition to two contrast enhanced open ring lesions. MRI also showed multiple small white matter lesions in both the hemispheres. The patient had a good response to corticosteroids and had a benign prognosis during a follow-up period of two years.
