Eclampsia is rare in molar pregnancy. Sudden cortical blindness in eclampsia is an uncommon but very dramatic experience for the patient. Because of its rarity, blindness associated with eclampsia may pose a significant problem for the obstetrician.

We describe cortical blindness and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) complicating molar pregnancy-related eclampsia. The clinical presentation in our patient was consistent with PRES associated with eclampsia together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.

Preeclampsia and eclampsia are regarded as common causes of PRES, which is considered to be the result of vasogenic brain edema caused by a rapid raise in blood pressure. Clinical and imaging findings are usually reversible. Early diagnosis and elimination of possible causes are important in order to avoid permanent visual or brain injury. Imaging (especially MRI) should be carried out in eclamptic patients with visual disturbance in order to exclude other causes of blindness.
