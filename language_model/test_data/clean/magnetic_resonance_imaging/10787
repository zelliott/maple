We used fMRI to investigate the effects of tactile co-activation on the topographic organization of the human primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Behavioral consequences of co-activation were studied in a psychophysical task assessing the mislocalization of tactile stimuli. Co-activation was applied to the index, middle and ring fingers of the right hand either synchronously or asynchronously. Cortical representations for synchronously co-activated fingers moved closer together, whereas cortical representations for asynchronously co-activated fingers became segregated. Behaviorally, this pattern coincided with an increased and reduced number of mislocalizations between synchronously and asynchronously co-activated fingers, respectively. Thus, both synchronous and asynchronous coupling of passive tactile stimulation is able to induce short-term cortical reorganization associated with functionally relevant changes.
