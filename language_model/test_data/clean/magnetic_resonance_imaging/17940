Interstitial thermal therapy is a minimally invasive treatment modality that has been used clinically for ablating both primary and secondary brain tumors. Here a multi-element interstitial ultrasound applicator is described that allows for increased spatial control during thermal ablation of tumors as compared to existing clinical devices. The device consists of an array of 56 ultrasound elements operating at 6 MHz, oriented on the seven faces of a 3.2 mm flexible catheter. The device was first characterized using the acoustic holography method to examine the functioning of the array. Then experiments were performed to measure heating in tissue-mimicking gel phantoms and ex vivo tissue samples using magnetic resonance imaging-based thermometry. Experimental measurements were compared with results obtained using numerical simulations. Last, simulations were performed to study the feasibility of using the device for thermal ablation in the brain. Experimental results show that the device can be used to induce a temperature rise of greater than 20 °C in ex vivo tissue samples and numerical simulations further demonstrate that tumors with diameters of greater than 30-mm could potentially be treated.
