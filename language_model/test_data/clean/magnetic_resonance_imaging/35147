We report two cases of hypertrophic pachymeningitis with ophthalmological disturbances. One patient suffered from hypertrophic pachymeningitis supposedly secondary to a focal neurosarcoidosis and had a sixth nerve paresis. The second patient suffered from a diffuse idiopathic hypertrophic chronic pachymeningitis (a rare form) and displayed disturbances in vision and ocular motility.

Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a condition with a wide spectrum of etiologies and clinical manifestations, and needs to be considered as the cause in patients with alterations in ocular motility
