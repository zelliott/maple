Ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) can be used as a negative contrast agent on T2- weighted images, with the use of a high concentration resulting in a significant T2 shortening effect. Ten healthy volunteers underwent MR cholangiography (MRC) using Turbo Spin Echo. High-concentration FAC was administered at a normal dosage, but was diluted in a smaller amount of water than usual. Although all precontrast images showed high intensity intestinal fluid, which aggravated visualization of the bile duct, all postcontrast images obtained 6 to 14 minutes after administration showed blackening out of the fluid, improving the overall image quality of MRC.
