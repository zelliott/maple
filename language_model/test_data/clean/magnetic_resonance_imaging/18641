Two consecutive cases of children with vertebrobasilar thrombosis (VBT) were treated with high-dose intra-arterial urokinase within 4 h of presenting to the emergency room, after full evaluation by CT scan, MRI and MR angiography. Complete resolution of neurologic symptoms was achieved in both cases. Based on our limited pediatric experience, previous treatment of VBT at our institution and a review of the relevant literature, the authors suggest that VBT be specifically ruled out at initial diagnosis, and if present, full consideration be given to immediate treatment with intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy. This may lead to a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with VBT in children. A large prospective multi-institution study is needed to further evaluate the efficacy of this approach to childhood stroke.
