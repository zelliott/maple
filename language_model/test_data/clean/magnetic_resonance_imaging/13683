The MRI characteristics of a multifocal inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver are described. Emphasis is placed on the appearances following intravenous administration of both non-specific and liver-specific MR contrast agents. On post-gadolinium gradient-echo (GE) images an early, intense, and peripheral enhancement was followed by a homogeneous, complete, and persistent enhancement. Lesions showed no uptake following administration of ferumoxides particles nor mangafodipir trisodium, respectively. During follow-up, a peripheral hyperintense rim appeared on precontrast T1-weighted images, a feature not previously described.
