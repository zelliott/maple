A direct bolus imaging method, which was developed for flow quantitation, was applied to the cervical regions of four normal volunteers to perform magnetic resonance angiography. A transverse section of 10 mm thickness was selectively excited to tag blood flow in the supraclavicular region and a projected image of the tagged bolus viewed in terms of anteroposterior direction was obtained after the echo time (TE). Like cine magnetic resonance imaging, multiple images representing four to 16 cardiac phases were obtained with repeated excitations. With a relatively long TE, ranging from 50 to 200 msec, we advanced tagged blood farther downstream, so as to elongate the visualized bolus along the vessel. Within the visualized bolus, the outer layer close to the vessel wall, where the blood flow velocity was slow, stretched like long tails behind the central part of the bolus producing arrow-head shapes, and the tails were assumed to represent the vascular structure. Bilateral common carotid and vertebral arteries were visualized in each image size approximately 5 cm obtained at the systolic phase. Since prolonged TE yielded less signal intensity, the bolus was not clearly visualized when TE was longer than 100 msec. The cine display of images with multiple cardiac phases produced good evaluations of dynamic changes of pulsatile flow, and this method is expected to be a useful diagnostic tool which combines the capability of flow quantitation with non-invasive angiography. The accuracy of this method in delineating a stenotic lesion was also evaluated using phantom with steady flow, since it is one of the most important capabilities of a clinically used angiographic method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
