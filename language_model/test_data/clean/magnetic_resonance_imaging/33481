A case of tectal glioma with mild choked disc is reported. An 11-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital because of visual disturbance and choked disc. Neurologically, the patient had nothing but choked disc. Magnetic resonance imaging (1.5T) was performed. Relative T1 weighted image showed a lesion of low signal intensity, and T2 weighted image showed high intensity, about 1.0 x 1.0 cm in size, at the pineal region. The sagittal view showed a mass at the tectum, and stenosis of the aqueduct. It was diagnosed as tectal glioma. Left occipital craniotomy was performed and the tumor was removed subtotally. Histological examination demonstrated a fibrillary astrocytoma. Radiochemotherapy was performed postoperatively. Tectal glioma is very rare. The differential diagnosis from germ cell tumor or pineal cyst is essential for treatment. The authors performed an operation in order to remove the tumor and determine the course of treatment.
