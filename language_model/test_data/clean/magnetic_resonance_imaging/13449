Recently, a new technique has been demonstrated which effectively refocusses the dephasing effects of spins moving during application of MR imaging gradients. This paper presents an analysis of imaging axes significance in spin dephasing for motion occurring along the slice select, read and phase-encoding directions. A flow phantom under constant flow conditions in all experiments was used to provide complete spin dephasing when "traditional" imaging gradients were used. The MAST technique was used to refocus along various combinations of imaging axes, and variable number of terms from the Taylor expansion of motion along them. Results indicate that motion along any imaging axis can be refocussed effectively when MAST gradients are used along only the slice select and read axis.
