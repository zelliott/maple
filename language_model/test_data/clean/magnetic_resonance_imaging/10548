Early diagnosis of cerebral hypoxic ischemic complications during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is important to guide further treatment. However, diagnostic methods available during ECMO are limited, especially in adults and older children. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive and noninvasive method for assessment of vessel patency and brain parenchymal changes, and for measurement of brain perfusion. The use of MRI during ECMO has, to our knowledge, never been reported. We report the first animal experiment with MRI examination during ECMO. After a preliminary test with the mobile ECMO system in the MRI environment, a healthy pig was put on venoarterial ECMO, transported to the MRI department, and examined with sequences for anatomy and function of the brain and thorax. The results showed that the ECMO system was not adversely affected by the magnetic field at a distance from the camera where positioning and examination of the animal was possible. High-quality anatomical and functional images of the brain, heart, and thoracic vessels were acquired. The results suggest that MRI may be used for early diagnosis of cranial complications in patients on ECMO. MRI may also provide a useful tool for further research on flow dynamics and brain perfusion during ECMO.
