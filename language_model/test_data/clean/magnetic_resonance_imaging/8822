The aetiology of Poland syndrome remains unclear. It has been postulated that a developmentally normal foetus experiences a destructive process that subsequently results in cascading consequences eventually resulting in its characteristic features. We report the case of a male patient with Poland's anomaly who presented at birth with a large lymphangioma also affecting the right side of his chest. We propose that the pressure exerted by the space occupying lesion during embryological development lends further support to the existence of a subclavian artery supply disruption sequence as the causative insult.
