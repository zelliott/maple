To assess characteristics of MS lesions and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) with various imaging modalities. Glucose metabolism was investigated with FDG-PET, metabolite concentration with proton NMR spectroscopy, and lesion detection with routine brain MRI.

Thirteen patients were studied in a stable phase of their disease, and two during an acute episode. Nine healthy volunteers served as controls.

Three patients had a normal brain MRI, 12 had typical lesions. MR images were registered to the PET planes. Lesions and contra-lateral control areas were analyzed, 10/15 lesions showed relative hyper-metabolism and 2 hypo-metabolism. NAA concentration was significantly decreased in both lesions and NAWM.

In stable MS, most large lesions have a relatively increased glucose utilization and decreased NAA concentration. NAWM showed a significantly decreased NAA concentration compared to healthy subjects, but no difference in glucose metabolism. Active lesions in acute MS are also hyper-metabolic. This finding opens a new window on the classification of white matter lesions based on glucose utilization.
