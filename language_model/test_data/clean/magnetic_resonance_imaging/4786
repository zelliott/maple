Cardiac echinococcosis is a very rare disease, especially in girls. We report a case of interventricular septum echinococcosis. A 14-year-old girl was referred for chest pain. Magnetic resonance imaging and two-dimensional echocardiography revealed a cyst in the distal interventricular septum. We concluded that MR imaging is useful in diagnosis and planning of surgery. Cardiac hydatid cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with anginalike pain in endemic areas.
