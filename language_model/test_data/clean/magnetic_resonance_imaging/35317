To analyze the enhancement of the prostate using ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in patients with prostate cancer.

Sixty patients were enrolled. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the central and peripheral zones (CZ and PZ, respectively) of the prostate were evaluated on T2- and T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging before and 24 hours after USPIO-enhanced MRI. The changes in SNR after USPIO-enhanced MRI were analyzed and correlated with serum prostate-specific antigen and histopathologic Gleason scoring based on surgically removed prostate gland.

Decrease in SNR was noted in each zone of the prostate after USPIO-enhanced MRI (P < 0.001). Mean SNR decrease in the CZ was higher than that in the PZ (P < 0.05). High-grade prostate cancer was associated with a higher decrease in SNR (P < 0.05). The SNR change was negatively correlated with serum prostate-specific antigen at low or intermediate levels (P < 0.05).

Enhancement of the prostate gland after USPIO administration may be associated with primary prostate cancer.
