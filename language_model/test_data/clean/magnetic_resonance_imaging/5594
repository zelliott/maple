Duodenal duplication is a rare congenital disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. The presentation is highly variable. We report a case of duodenal duplication presenting with hemorrhagic ascites in a 3-month-old girl. The diagnosis of duodenal duplication can be made preoperatively by resonance magnetic imaging. Surgical resection of the duplication was performed. Microscopic examination of the specimen confirmed the duodenal duplication. To our knowledge, this is the 1st reported case of hemorrhagic ascites caused by duodenal duplication and demonstrated by resonance magnetic imaging.
