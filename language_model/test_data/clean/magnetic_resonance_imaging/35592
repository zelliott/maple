To review brain imaging studies of bladder control in subjects with normal control and urge incontinence; to define a simple model of supraspinal bladder control; and to propose a neural correlate of urgency and possible origins of urge incontinence.

Review of published reports of brain imaging relevant to urine storage, and secondary analyses of our own recent observations.

In a simple model of normal urine storage, bladder and urethral afferents received in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) are mapped in the insula, forming the basis of sensation; the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) provides monitoring and control; the prefrontal cortex makes voiding decisions. The net result, as the bladder fills, is inhibition of the pontine micturition center (PMC) and of voiding, together with gradual increase in insular response, corresponding to increasing desire to void. In urge-incontinent subjects, brain responses differ. At large bladder volumes and strong sensation, but without detrusor overactivity (DO), most cortical responses become exaggerated, especially in ACG. This may be both a learned reaction to previous incontinence episodes and the neural correlate of urgency. The neural signature of DO itself seems to be prefrontal deactivation. Possible causes of urge incontinence include dysfunction of prefrontal cortex or limbic system, suggested by weak responses and/or deactivation, as well as abnormal afferent signals or re-emergence of infantile reflexes.

Bladder control depends on an extensive network of brain regions. Dysfunction in various parts may contribute to urge incontinence, suggesting that there are different phenotypes requiring different treatments.
