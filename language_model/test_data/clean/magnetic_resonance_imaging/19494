Desmoplastic fibroma of bone is a very rare benign tumor, which may be locally aggressive. In contrast to the well-documented radiological appearance, the literature on MR imaging features of this tumor is scarce. The MR imaging characteristics in our case are compared to those previously reported. Although there is a considerable overlap in the MR imaging features with other bone tumors, an interesting MR feature of desmoplastic fibroma is the presence of low to intermediate signal intensity foci on T2-weighted images, which radiographically does not correspond to calcifications. This feature may help narrow the differential diagnosis.
