The median artery of the forearm appears early in embryological development and normally involutes before birth. In rare cases, it persists into adult life. Although usually asymptomatic, it can be a cause for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). This report describes the MR appearance of a persistent median artery in a patient with CTS. The symptoms were relieved after resection of the aberrant vessel.
