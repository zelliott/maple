This study examined BOLD changes prior to interictal discharges in the EEG of patients with epilepsy. From a database of 143 EEG-fMRI studies, we selected the 16 data sets that showed both strong fMRI activation in the original analysis and only a single spike type in the EEG. Scans were then analyzed using seven model HRFs, peaking 3 or 1 s before the event, or 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 s after it. An HRF was calculated using a deconvolution method for all activations seen in each analysis. The results showed that seven data sets had HRFs that peaked 1 s after the event or earlier, indicating a BOLD change starting prior to the spike seen on the scalp EEG. This is surprising since the BOLD change is expected to result from the spike. For most of the data sets with early peaking HRFs, the maximum activation in all of the statistical maps was when the model HRF peaked 1 s after the event, suggesting that the early activation was at least as important as any later activation. We suggest that this early activity is the result of neuronal changes occurring several seconds prior to a surface EEG event, but that these changes are not visible on the scalp. This is the first report of a BOLD response occurring several seconds prior to an interictal event seen on the scalp and could have important implications for our understanding of the generation of epileptic discharges.
