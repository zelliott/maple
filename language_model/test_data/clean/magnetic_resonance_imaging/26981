Seven children with sciatic neuropathy associated with an underlying neoplasm are reported. Clinical presentation, electrophysiological data, imaging, pathology, and/or autopsy results are described. Pain and weakness, primarily foot drop, were the most common presenting symptoms. The mechanism of sciatic neuropathy was varied and included: nerve infiltration by the adjacent neoplasm (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemic or lymphomatous infiltration); an expanding, intrinsic neurogenic tumor (perineurioma); or intraoperative stretch injury (osteosarcoma resection). The prognosis for sciatic nerve recovery was good among children who survived their associated cancer. Three children died from the cancer or complications of treatment. One child with perineurioma remained clinically stable, and two children improved after treatment of their neoplasm.
