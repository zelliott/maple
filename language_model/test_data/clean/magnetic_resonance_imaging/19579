To evaluate the feasibility of using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to guide and monitor endovascular therapeutic procedures.

Endovascular therapeutic procedures were performed with MR imaging guidance in eight dogs by using a 1.5-T MR unit with echo-planar imaging capabilities. Carotid arterial aneurysms were surgically created in four dogs. The ability to depict, track, and position catheters, guide wires, and Guglielmi detachable coils was assessed. Catheters were first positioned with fluoroscopic guidance. Tracking and depiction were achieved with MR imaging by using commercially available catheters filled with a gadopentetate dimeglumine solution and a fast, two-dimensional, time-resolved, variable-rate k-space sampling technique.

When either a catheter or the coaxial space between a catheter and a guide wire was filled with a solution of gadopentetate dimeglumine, catheter movement was always depicted. In the animals with aneurysms, it was possible to depict movement of a catheter into and out of the aneurysm. This was achieved by superimposing reconstructed images obtained during catheter movement onto a previously acquired MR angiogram ("road map"). Prototype Guglielmi detachable coils were successfully positioned and detached. Aneurysm obliteration was monitored with the acquisition of new road map images.

The results demonstrate the feasibility of using MR imaging to guide endovascular therapeutic procedures.
