Self-motion or object motion can elicit optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), which is an integral part of dynamic spatial orientation. We used functional MR imaging during horizontal OKN to study cerebral activation patterns in sensory and ocular motor areas in 10 subjects. We found activation bilaterally in the primary visual cortex, the motion-sensitive areas in the occipitotemporal cortex (the middle temporal and medial superior temporal areas), and in areas known to control several types of saccades such as the precentral and posterior median frontal gyrus, the posterior parietal cortex, and the medial part of the superior frontal gyrus (frontal, parietal, and supplementary eye fields). Additionally, we observed cortical activation in the anterior and posterior parts of the insula and in the prefrontal cortex. Bilateral activation of subcortical structures such as the putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and the thalamus traced the efferent pathways of OKN down to the brainstem. Functional MRI during OKN revealed a complex cerebral network of sensorimotor cortical and subcortical activation.
