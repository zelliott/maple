The giant cell tumor is considered to be a locally aggressive benign tumor and has a low tendency toward distant metastasis. They are primarily present in the long bone and are rare in the skull. The osteoclast-like giant cells do not demonstrate mitotic activity and contain large numbers of nuclei. Herein, we described a case of giant cell tumor in the temporal lobe. Heterogenous enhancement is shown on CT imaging in solid areas of tumor. The appearance intermediate to high signal intensity on T1-weighted and very low signal intensity on T2-weighted MR imaging were due to the presence of hemosiderin from prior hemorrhage.
