Cystadenocarcinoma is a rare salivary gland tumour. Only a few case studies have provided pre-operative images of these tumours. This report demonstrates the case of a 28-year-old male with cystadenocarcinoma arising from an ectopic salivary gland with lymph node metastasis in the right upper neck. Ultrasound including Doppler images showed two masses with scant vascular flow. One was a hyperechoic mass enclosed within a low echoic cystic lesion and the other was a solid hypoechoic mass. Contrast enhancement CT scans demonstrated a ring enhanced mass and weakly homogeneous enhanced masses in the right upper neck. Dynamic studies showed increased enhancement in delayed phase CT that was the same as that in other malignant salivary gland tumours. Moderate to slightly high signal intensity was seen on T(1) weighted MR images and axial T(2) weighted MR images showed one heterogeneous mass in a high signal lesion and a moderate to high signal intensity mass. The authors discuss the pre-operative findings of ultrasound with Doppler imaging of this neoplasm, and CT findings including dynamic study images and MRI, comparing the findings with the post-operative pathological features of the tumour.
