To evaluate with contrast MR the evolution in size, signal, and contrast enhancement of optic pathway lesions in four patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.

The four reported patients are children with ages ranging from 21 months to 13 years affected by neurofibromatosis type 1 and optic pathway lesions. No treatment of the optic pathway lesions was carried out in these patients. They have been followed by serial contrast MR.

In all patients a change in size, signal, and enhancement of optic pathways lesions was noted with time, and in the last follow-up study a marked reduction in size and enhancement of optic pathway lesions was observed in all cases.

Modification and regression of optic pathway lesions with spontaneous disappearance of the enhancement is demonstrated. This finding could have a crucial influence on the therapeutic approach of the optic pathway lesions.
