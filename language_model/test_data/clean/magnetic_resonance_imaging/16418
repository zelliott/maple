We report an unusual case of a patient with an epidural fluid collection with signal characteristics mimicking an epidural hematoma. The patient presented with myelopathy caused by thoracic spinal cord compression after a traumatic injury to the chest and back. The injury was caused by high-pressure injection of industrial-grade lubricant grease. This case demonstrates that cord compression can be caused by exogenous material in the setting of trauma that can mimic an acute epidural hematoma.
