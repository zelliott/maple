Krabbe disease may present during infancy, late infancy, or adulthood. Earlier-onset disease is associated with shorter survival times. We present a case of infantile onset Krabbe disease with prolonged survival, initial intracranial optic nerves and optic chiasm hypertrophy, and serial changes on cranial magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
