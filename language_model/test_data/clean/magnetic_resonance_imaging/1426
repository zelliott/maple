The measurement of the velocity of perfused flow in tissue in vivo is complicated by the presence of stationary as well as moving spins and by a variety of dephasing phenomena which affect signal amplitudes. This paper describes a technique by which, using flow-sensitized spin-echo sequences with a set of very long TE times, the velocity of the moving component can be assessed.
