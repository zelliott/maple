Currently, nonneoplastic, noninflammatory, cerebral intraventricular cysts can be divided into two groups: neuroepithelial (neuroglial) cysts, and the colloid cysts. The neuroglial (neuroepithelial) cysts and colloid cysts were considered to be derived from the primitive neuroepithelium, but recent immunohistochemical investigations suggest an endodermal origin of the colloid cysts. The neuroepithelial cysts were divided into the major categories by their size and location. Colloid cysts were characterized by its features. Differential diagnosis of the intraventricular cysts were presented.
