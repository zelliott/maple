Hemangiopericytoma is an aggressive tumor associated with high recurrence and metastasis. Metastases are usually delayed, long after diagnosis of the primary lesion. Metastatic hemangiopericytoma to the spinal cord is especially rare.

To report a rare clinical presentation of a metastatic intradural, intramedullary hemangiopericytoma to the cauda equina from a cerebellar hemangiopericytoma.

Case report with a review of the literature.

Clinical history, physical findings, and magnetic resonance imaging studies of a patient with a metastatic intradural, intramedullary hemangiopericytoma to the cauda equina are reported.

A case report is presented of a female with an intradural, intramedullary lesion at the L4-S1 level, presenting initially with progressive pain and motor weakness affecting the left lower extremity. She had a history of a cerebellar hemangiopericytoma, which had been treated with total resection and radiotherapy 4 years earlier. This patient developed urinary urgency and frequency. Pathological analysis revealed a hemangiopericytoma, which had a similar character to a cerebellar lesion. After radiotherapy, the tumor was mostly diminished and her symptoms totally resolved.

Hemangiopericytomas have a strong tendency to both local recurrence and metastasis. Common metastatic sites are the skeletal system, lung, liver, and abdominal cavity. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no reports of spinal intradural, intramedullary metastasis of hemangiopericytoma.
