Spinal instrumentation techniques have expanded dramatically during the past several decades, but the search for the perfect operative approach and fixation system continues. Fixation devices are designed for the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral segments using anterior, posterior, transverse, videoarthroscopic, and combined approaches. In most cases, bone grafting also is performed, because instrument failure occurs if solid bony fusion is not achieved. Radiologists must understand the operative and instrumentation options. Knowledge of expected results, appearance of graft material, and different forms of instrumentation is critical for evaluating position of implants and potential complications associated with operative approaches and spinal fixation devices.
