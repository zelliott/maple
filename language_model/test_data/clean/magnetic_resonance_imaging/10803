We describe a rare neurogenic tumour presenting as a pilonidal sinus. This case illustrates the pitfalls associated with the management of a commonly occurring surgical condition. Pilonidal sinuses are often the province of trainee surgeons and while ependymomas are rare, this example emphasises the need to send the pilonidal sinus tract for histological examination.
