We sought to determine whether nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation times of water in tissue would be useful to detect molecular damage in lung tissue within 2 weeks after irradiation. Tissue samples were obtained from the lungs of rats at various times between 1 and 14 days after exposure of a hemithorax to 20 Gy 60Co gamma irradiation. The spin-lattice relaxation time, T1, was measured by the inversion recovery method, and the spin-spin relaxation time, T2, was measured by both the Hahn spin-echo (Hahn T2) and the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG T2) methods. The T2 of lung tissue could be divided into two components, T2 fast (T2f) and T2 slow (T2s), which reflected changes in the intracellular and extracellular water, respectively. The CPMG T2f increased significantly 3 days after irradiation (66.3 +/- 2.3 ms compared to 60.8 +/- 2.6 ms), and the CPMG T2s increased significantly 1 day after irradiation (155 +/- 11 ms compared to 138 +/- 7 ms), prior to the observation of abnormalities upon examination of the lung by light microscopy. The CPMG T2 values increased further up to 14 days after irradiation when significant increases were observed in values for T1, Hahn T2 and water content. Our results indicate that the molecular derangement in irradiated lung tissue was detected by the CPMG T2 measurement in the very early stage, and that MRI may be superior to conventional radiographs for detecting the early damage to lung tissue after irradiation.
