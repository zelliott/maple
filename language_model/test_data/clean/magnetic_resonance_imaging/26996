The purposes of this review are to describe the clinical presentation and diagnostic test characteristics in the care of women with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and to discuss the role of newer imaging modalities in improving diagnostic accuracy in the detection of these diseases.

Despite major advances in both diagnostics and therapeutics, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases remain two of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among women worldwide. More research is needed into sex differences in these diseases, particularly to discern whether accurate imaging can lead to early diagnosis, change in clinical management, and overall improvement in patient outcomes.
