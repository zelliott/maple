A 26-year-old man developed progressive, massive ascites and hematemesis due to rupture of esophageal varices. Combination diagnostic modalities of color doppler ultrasonography, enhanced computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging led to the case being diagnosed as acute Budd-Chiari syndrome with severe stricture of the intrahepatic inferior vena cava. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty this resulted in great improvement of the clinical manifestations.
