An enhanced understanding of the cellular characteristics contributing to ongoing brain injury following intrapartum hypoxia-ischemia has resulted in the implementation of targeted neuroprotective strategies in the newborn period. This review briefly covers the pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic injury with an emphasis on reperfusion injury; the role of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of such injury, and focuses on potential strategies both supportive and neuroprotective to prevent ongoing injury with a specific emphasis on modest hypothermia.
