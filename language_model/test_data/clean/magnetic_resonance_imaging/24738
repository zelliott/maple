A 33-year-old male patient with uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot was hospitalised for multiple peripheral arterial emboli. Bilateral above-knee amputation had been done after unsuccessful femoral embolectomy. A large thrombus was detected in the apical portion of the left ventricle which was the source of the embolus.The patient complained of mild frontal headache and progressive right-sided weakness shortly after an echocardiographic examination. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a left middle cerebral artery territory infarct. Patients with grown-up cyanotic congenital heart disease are at increased risk of thromboembolic cerebrovascular events. This report highlights the necessity for physicians to be alert for uncommon causes of acute stroke.
