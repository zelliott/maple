A retrospective analysis of the morphology and signal behaviour of T1, proton and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences has been carried out on 21 haemangiomas and 2 lymphangiomas of the peripheral soft tissues which had been examined by MRT. In 11 cases the diagnosis was confirmed histologically and in 12 by angiography. The majority of haemangiomas (19 cases) and both lymphangiomas showed hyperintense signals on T2-weighted spin-echo sequences; 2 lesions did not conform to this behaviour. MRT was a sensitive method for demonstrating vessels with high flow velocities so that it was possible to distinguish high flow haemangiomas by MRT. Apart from one thrombosed haemangioma, all 9 haemangiomas examined with iv Gd-DTPA showed homogeneous contrast uptake except for vessels with high flow velocities. One lymphangioma examined with iv Gd-DTPA was characterised by non-homogeneous contrast uptake.
