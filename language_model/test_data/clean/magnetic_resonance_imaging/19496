Stereotactic radiosurgery can be used to treat malignant tumors involving the skull base. While it avoids extensive sacrifice of the normal structures surrounding the tumor, radiosurgery does not eradicate the tumor mass immediately. We present a patient with a large hypervascular malignant tumor involving the skull base that resulted in intracranial hypertension. He was successfully treated with stereotactic radiosurgery combined with intra-arterial chemotherapy and embolization of the arteries feeding the tumor. We discuss radiosurgery, chemotherapy, embolization and other therapeutic modalities for treating large malignant tumors involving the skull base.
