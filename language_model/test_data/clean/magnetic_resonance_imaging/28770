An exhaustive literature review of the last two decades discloses 47 laryngeal malignant neoplasms in children and adolescents. The most frequent malignant neoplasm is the embryonal variant of rhabdomyosarcoma. The timely diagnosis of a laryngeal neoplasm depends on maintaining a high index of suspicion in a patient with progressive airway obstruction, dysphagia or dysphonia, and conducting an efficient work-up-including magnetic resonance imaging and direct laryngoscopy under general anesthesia in association with bronchoscopy-in order to define the extent of the lesion, rule out multiple lesions, establish and maintain an airway, and perform a biopsy of the tumor. The authors observed that several risk factors, such as previous radiation therapy for juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis, intrauterine exposure to ionizing radiation, chemical carcinogens, smoking or tobacco exposure were lacking in those patients with a detailed clinical history. Probably, cancer of the larynx in these unusual patients is the final result of an interaction of immunological and genetic factors. The choice of therapy depends on several factors, including the clinical stage at presentation, histological type and potential radio-chemosensitivity of the tumor.
