A report is presented on two patients who received surgery on a disc prolapse between the lumbar vertebrae 4 and 5 as treatment for compression of the fifth lumbar root, but in whom the clinically relevant disc prolapse was located higher (lumbar vertebrae 1/2 or thoracic vertebra 12/lumbar vertebra 1). Magnetic resonance tomography made a major contribution to the later diagnosis of the high disc prolapses. Besides precise localization of the lesion, MRT made it easier to understand why such a high disc prolapse can cause a compression syndrome of the fifth lumbar root.
