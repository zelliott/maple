To reach the upper thoracic vertebrae, a number of extensive approaches have been proposed combining thoracotomy, sternotomy, or clavicle resection with anterior dissection into the superior mediastinum. We present a simple anterior cervical approach for patients with disease limited to one vertebral level, in which midline ventral decompression is the goal of surgery. Regardless of the anterior approach used, the caudal extent of exposure is limited to T3 by the great vessels of the mediastinum, whereas the angle of the approach to the cervicothoracic junction is dictated by the manubrium. In the anterior cervical approach, lateral exposure to the uncovertebral joints is easily achieved. Five patients are reviewed in whom this anterior cervical approach was used at the first or second thoracic level. Decompression and instrumentation resulting in neurological improvement and axial stability were achieved in all five patients. The surgical anatomy of the cervicothoracic junction is reviewed with attention to the recurrent laryngeal nerves and the thoracic duct as they relate to the side of approach chosen.
