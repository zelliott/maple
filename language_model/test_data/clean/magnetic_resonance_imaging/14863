Isolated posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) avulsion fracture from the tibial attachment in children is extremely rare. The initial diagnosis is often missed in clinical practice. The present report describes the outcome in a long-term follow-up case of an 11-year-old boy involved in a motorcycle accident. The lesion was fixed through an open posterior approach with anatomic reduction. The patient has been followed for 4 years, and his final assessment revealed stable painless knee with an excellent functional outcome. The procedure is described and a surgical video outlines the pre-operative clinical examination. The particularity of this case is the long-term follow-up and the excellent outcome. We reviewed similarly reported cases in the literature and the different methods used in current practice.
