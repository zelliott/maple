We describe a patient with posterior spinal artery (PSA) syndrome due to vertebral artery (VA) dissection. A 63-year-old woman developed neck pain, bilateral shoulder and arm numbness, and paraparesis after prolonged neck extension during a dental procedure. Neurological examination revealed sensory deficits in the legs, paraparesis, cerebellar ataxia, urinary retention and constipation. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed T2-hyperintense lesions in the posterolateral C4-C7 cord with partial enhancement. T1-hyperintensity and stenosis were found in the right VA at C3-C5. These clinicoradiological findings suggested bilateral PSA syndrome and unilateral VA dissection. This is the fourth report of VA dissection-induced PSA syndrome.
