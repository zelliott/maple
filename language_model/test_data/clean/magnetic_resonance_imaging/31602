Intrapartum asphyxia is defined as metabolic acidemia measured at birth with pH less than 7.00 and base deficit greater or equal to 12 mmol/l. Neonatal complications of intrapartum asphyxia include multiorgan failure and neonatal encephalopathy. Most severe consequences are death and neurological or sensorial impairment. Cause of permanent neurological impairment can be attributed to intrapartum asphyxia if three criteria are met: intrapartum history of a threatening event with acute fetal heart rate deterioration, biological markers of asphyxia, neonatal encephalopathy. Moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy in asphyxiated term infants is associated with a high risk of cerebral palsy (especially quadriplegic or dyskinetic type) and/or cognitive disorders. Prognosis of neonatal encephalopathy can be accurately assessed by MR imaging.
