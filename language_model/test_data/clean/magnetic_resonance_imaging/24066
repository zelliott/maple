We present two cases of the Morning Glory Syndrome (MGS), with the most detailed MR images to date of this rare congenital optic nerve dysplasia. Though the embryology of this syndrome remains controversial, we feel the MR appearance can be diagnostic of the non-familial syndrome and be reliably distinguished from the similar appearing optic disc coloboma, which may be genetically inherited. MR imaging also allows the most sensitive detection and characterization of any associated intracranial anomalies, thus enabling more accurate determination of prognosis for the patient and their family.
