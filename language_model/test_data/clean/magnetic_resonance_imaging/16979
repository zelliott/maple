Long-standing dislocation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is rare. The management of this disorder is still controversial. This paper presents the authors' experience of managing long-standing dislocation of the TMJ, and their attempt to develop guidelines for the management of this problem. They also show magnetic resonance images of two patients with long-standing dislocation of the TMJ.
