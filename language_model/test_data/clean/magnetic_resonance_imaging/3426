The abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a potentially fatal entity that occurs as a result of an acute increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). The authors report on a girl with a giant ovarian cystic mass, and clinical signs of ACS and intracranial hypertension (ΙΗ). The possible mechanism of IH secondary to ACS is discussed.
