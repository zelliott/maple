To analyze the relationship between Class III malocclusion and pathological changes in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) structures using magnetic resenonce imaging (MRI).

Twenty-four Class III malocclusion adult patients and 10 normal control cases were included in the study. The characteristics of lateral pertygoid muscle (LPM) in the sample group and the control group were assessed.

More pathological changes of LPM were found in Class III malocclusion adult patients (36 TMJ). The changes included hypertrophy, atrophy and contracture. And there was no relation between the pathological changes of LPM and the symptom of temporomandibular disorders (TMD).

The frequency of pathological changes of LPM was greater in patients with Class III malocclusion than in the control group.
