An allogenic transplantation of the total-pancreas with duodenum was carried out in the minipig model. The oral duodenum was closed blindly and the aboral part was led out as a stoma. The portal vein of the transplant was anastomosed end-to-side in the inferior vena cava and the celiac artery of the transplant in the distal aorta. Investigations for early diagnosis of rejection were carried out in this model parallelly respectively one by one. CT/MRT, selective angiography, laboratory chemical parameters were unsuitable for early detection. The pancreatic succus cytology and nuclear medical investigations show reproducible changes caused by rejection before the blood-sugar level was increased.
