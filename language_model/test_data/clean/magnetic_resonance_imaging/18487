Gd-DTPA enhanced dynamic MR studies were evaluated in six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma associated with portal vein tumor thrombus. The portal vein tumor thrombus was clearly visualized as a low intensity lesion. The hepatic segment supplied by the portal vein showed high intensity, probably due to decreased portal blood flow and compensatory arterial blood flow. Tumors located in this segment were shown as areas of relatively low intensity compared with segmental high intensity areas. Thus dynamic MR study was found to be a useful method for differentiating the tumor from the surrounding nontumorous tissue with decreased portal blood flow.
