Fifty patients with spinal injury above L2 were studied with MRI; forty-two had initial and followup studies permitting correlation of MRI abnormalities with neurologic improvement. Two discrete patterns of MRI abnormality were identified, presumably representing cord hemorrhage and edema respectively. A third pattern appeared to represent a mixed type of injury. The correlation between the MRI patterns of cord injury and neurologic recovery was excellent. The ability of MRI to demonstrate and characterize acute cord injury appears to exceed that of other diagnostic techniques.
