We studied 18 formalin-fixed brains using MRI, and correlated our data with subsequent gross and microscopic examinations. 9 of our patients died from brain diseases (stroke due to infarction 4, stroke due to hemorrhage 1, encephalitis 2, head injury 1, brain tumor 1). 9 of our patients died from non-CNS diseases (stomach cancer 1, colon cancer 1, liver cirrhosis 1, myocardial infarction 2, trauma 4). In MRI of postmortem brain, T1WI and T 2WI was able to clearly show the myelination process of brainstem, basal ganglia, internal capsule and optic radiation in a 2 months-old-boy. The findings were similar to MRI of live infants. In normal adult postmortem brains, the T1WI showed a relatively low signal intensity of white matter as compared to gray matter. The pictures were similar to proton density images, not T1WI of normal adult brains. The reason why the signal intensity of the white matter was lower than the gray matter may have been due to lysis of lipid of myelin sheath in the formalin solution. Postmortem MRI was able to detect the periventricular hyperintensity (corresponding to arteriosclerotic encephalopathy) and subcortical hyperintensity spots (which corresponding to the widening of the Virchow-Robin perivascular space because of arteriosclerosis) in the brains of our elderly patients. Postmortem MRI detected the intracerebral hemorrhage, which appeared as a dark signal in both short and long TR images. However, MRI did not show blood in the ventricles, sulci, or superficial hemorrhages in the cortex of brain. Brain edema was revealed in the postmortem MRI and appeared as low signal intensity in T1WI and hyperintensity in T2WI. It was associated with a significant mass effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
