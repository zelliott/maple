We report an 8-year-old boy with a primary intrasellar mixed germ-cell tumor who underwent the trans-sphenoidal approach for tumor removal. Initially he suffered from diabetes insipidus. Precocious puberty and left abducens nerve palsy were also observed. Elevation of serum testosterone, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were found on admission. The histological study revealed mixed cellular types of tumor including germinoma, choriocarcinoma, embryonic cell carcinoma, and teratoma. Postoperative radiation to a total of 5000 cGy was performed. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered before and after radiation. The boy was disease-free during a 6-month follow-up period. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed no presence of tumor. The signs of precocious puberty disappeared, and the diabetes insipidus was easily controlled. The abducens nerve regained normal function. Serum HCG, AFP, and testosterone levels all returned to normal. Serum antidiuretic hormone increased to reach the lower limit of the normal range.
