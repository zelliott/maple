We report a case of focal spared area of segment VIII in fatty liver. The patient was a 73-year-old man. Abdominal ultrasonography showed focal hypo-echogenicity with an irregular margin in segment VIII. Abdominal computed tomography and enhanced computed tomography showed a high-density mass in segment VIII of the right lobe. MRI examination revealed that the mass in S8 was high-intense on the T1 out of phase image and iso-intense on the T1 in phase image. The lesion was not observed on T2 weight images. He had a sigmoid colon cancer and was performed a sigmoidectomy and partial resection of the liver. A microscopic examination of the liver specimen revealed normal hepatic parenchymal cells, while the surrounding liver had a fat deposition.
