A 66-year-old man presented with a downbeat nystagmus. The underlying cause was unknown. A dolichoectasia of the vertebrobasilar artery was the only identifiable abnormality at Magnetic Resonance Image which also disclosed distortion of the anterolateral aspect of the medulla. Compression of the caudal brain-stem by an enlarged and tortuous vertebrobasilar arterial system may be the cause of downbeat nystagmus in cases unassociated with the more commonly recognized causes.
