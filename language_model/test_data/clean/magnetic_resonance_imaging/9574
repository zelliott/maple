The high incidence of recurrent tendon tears after repair of massive cuff lesions is prompting the research of materials aimed at mechanically or biologically reinforcing the tendon. Among the materials studied upto now, the extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds of human origin have proved to be the safest and most efficient, but the current laws about grafts and transplants preclude their use in Europe. In order to overcome this condition in 2006, we started a project regarding the production of an ECM scaffold of human origin which could be implanted in Europe too. In 2009, the clinical study began with the implantation of dermal matrix scaffolds in 7 middle-aged patients affected with large/massive cuff lesions and tendon degeneration. Out of 5 cases, followed for at least 1 year in which the scaffold was employed as an augmentation device, there were 3 patients with complete healing, 1 partial re-tear, and 1 total recurrence. The absence of adverse inflammatory or septic complications allows to continue this line of research with a prospective controlled study in order to define the real advantages and correct indications offered by scaffold application.
