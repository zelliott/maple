The patient was a 14-year-old male diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) with acute onset of multifocal central nervous system symptoms. He showed increased cerebrospinal fluid cell counts and high myelin basic protein levels, which responded well to steroid pulse therapy. Spinal MRI showed a centrally-located long spinal cord lesion (LCL) involving 17 vertebral bodies from C2 to T11 that later expanded into the white matter, and lesions on the ventral side of the medulla. The cause of LCL has been reported to be heterogeneous. In this case, LCL is considered to be associated with ADEM, an acute autoimmune response to myelin, and vascular inflammation of the gray matter of the spinal cord.
