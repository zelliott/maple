As yet, human cerebellar lesion studies have not taken advantage of direct magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cerebellar nuclei in individual patients. In the present study, susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) was used to visualize lesions of the dentate nuclei in patients with chronic focal lesions. Fifteen patients with cerebellar lesions either due to stroke or tumor surgery underwent SWI imaging using a 1.5T MRI scanner. Dentate nuclei were seen as hypointensities in all patients. Three of the patients underwent additional SWI imaging at 3T and 7T. Compared to 1.5T, corrugation of the dentate wall was seen with greater precision and the dorsal, iron-poorer part was seen more fully. Lesion-symptom mapping was performed based on the 1.5T MR images. Patients were divided into two groups with and without upper limb ataxia. A region-of-interest-(ROI)-driven normalization technique was used which had initially been developed by Diedrichsen et al. (2011) for functional MRI (fMRI) of the dentate nuclei. Compared to conventional normalization of the cerebellum, overlap of dentate lesions improved and lead to increased sensitivity of lesion-symptom maps. Subtraction analysis revealed that the more dorsal and rostral parts of the dentate nuclei were related to upper limb ataxia. Findings were in good accordance with the dentate hand area shown in recent fMRI studies. These data provide evidence that direct identification of dentate lesions together with the ROI-driven normalization technique allows for improved lesion-symptom mapping at the level of the cerebellar nuclei already at conventional 1.5T MRI field strength.
