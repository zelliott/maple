Fistulas manifest frequently in Crohn disease and can result in significant morbidity and often lead to the need for surgical intervention. Historically, it has been more difficult to obtain complete fistula closure in patients with perianal Crohn disease. Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agents and the use of more accurate imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging and rectal endoscopic ultrasound have enhanced the ability to manage fistulizing Crohn disease. A combined medical and surgical approach usually presents the best option for most patients.
