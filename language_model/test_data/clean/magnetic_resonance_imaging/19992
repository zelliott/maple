The authors sought to determine the natural history of and optimal treatment for suprasellar cysts (SSCs).

Three hundred forty-two patients harboring intracranial cysts presented to the authors' neurosurgery unit between January 1986 and August 2004. The patients' records were reviewed to assess symptomatology, results of imaging studies, and outcome according to mode of treatment. Thirty-three patients (9.6%) were eligible for this study. Nine SSCs were diagnosed prenatally and 24 were identified postnatally (range 0 months-18.2 years, mean 5.6 years). The mean follow-up period was 66.8 +/- 44.6 months (standard deviation). Seven cysts were left untreated, six (66%) detected before birth and one (4.5%) after birth. Of the 26 patients who required surgery, three were admitted elsewhere for complications of shunt surgery. A ventriculocystostomy (VC) was performed in all three of these patients, but the treatment failed in two. The primary treatment in the remaining 23 children was: open fenestration in two patients, VC in seven, ventriculocystocisternostomy (VCC) in 13, and cystoperitoneal (CP) shunt in one patient. Both open fenestration procedures were successful, as was the CP shunt insertion. The success rate of primary endoscopic surgery, although not statistically significant, was higher for VCCs (11 [85%] of 13 patients) than for VCs (four [57%] of seven patients). None of the patients' preoperative endocrine disorders resolved postoperatively. The distribution of intellectual and developmental quotients paralleled the normal range. Intellectual performance was unrelated to patient-specific factors or to treatment modalities.

Most SSCs are of moderate size, are stable and asymptomatic, and have a favorable outcome. Treatment is required when the cyst evolves or the patient is symptomatic, but endocrine disturbances alone are not an indication for surgery. When hydrocephalus is present, endoscopic fenestration is the primary treatment of choice. The goal of the procedure should be to open the cyst into both the ventricles and the cisterns. Intellectual capability after treatment at outcome is not related to age at diagnosis, initial or final cyst size, presence or absence of hydrocephalus, or type of endoscopic treatment.
