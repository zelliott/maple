To establish the myelination process of brain of Chinese infants, our study consisted of seventy-five infants ranging in age from 5 days to 2 years old. They were studied with a 1.0 T superconductive MRI. In the new born, myelination could be seen in the brainstem, middle cerebellar peduncle, and posterior limb of the internal capsule in both T1WI and T2WI. Then the myelination process rapidly progressed month by month. Myelination of the centrum semiovale and optic radiation could be seen in T1WI in the newborn up to 3 months old, and in T2WI at 3-5 months old. The myelination of the splenium and the genu of corpus callosum were seen at 3-6 months in T1WI and 5-6 months in T2WI. Myelination of the occipital lobe and frontal lobe were seen at 3-6 months and 5-10 months in T1WI, and 8-14 months, 10-16 months in T2WI respectively. In 7-10 months, the brain appeared as an "early adult pattern" in T1WI; while, in T2WI, the brain appeared as an "early adult pattern" at 14-18 months old. The understanding of the myelination process in infants is important and essential for the judgement of the infantile brain and for the diagnosis of many CNS diseases of infants.
