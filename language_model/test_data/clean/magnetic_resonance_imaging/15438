Both CT and MRI defined the extent of histologically proven recurrent disease, although it was impossible to radiographically distinguish recurrent disease from postoperative scar tissue or mucoperiosteal thickening.

A retrospective analysis of radiographic findings of patients with known inverted papilloma (IP) was performed to identify those characteristics that should prompt preoperative biopsy in patients with polypoid nasal masses.

The radiologic studies from a group of 77 patients with biopsy-proven IP of the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses were reviewed. Fifty-three computed tomography (CT) scans, 17 cases of plain sinus radiography and 7 cases of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were analyzed.

Although no preoperative MRI examinations were available for comparison, CT was the most helpful study for evaluation of primary, nonrecurrent inverted papilloma. CT demonstrated disease-related abnormalities in 90% of studies. The finding of frequent unilateral bony remodeling was demonstrated in 43% of scans. Plain sinus X-rays were abnormal in 70% of cases of primary tumor, with all positive studies showing nonspecific unilateral opacification of the maxillary antrum.
