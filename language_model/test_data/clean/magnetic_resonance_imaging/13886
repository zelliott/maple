Magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agents are now routinely used for detecting and characterizing focal liver lesions. Liver specific, hepatobiliary, MRI contrast agent mangafodipir trisodium (Mn-DPDP) is taken up by the functioning hepatocytes and excreted by the biliary system. Contrast uptake leads to persistent elevation of T1-weighted signal of normal liver parenchyma within 10 minutes of injection. Most tumors of non-hepatocellular origin typically are hypointense relative to enhanced liver parenchyma on T1 weighted images and are more conspicuous than on unenhanced images. Whereas, tumors of hepatocellular origin such as focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), adenoma, and well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) have been shown to accumulate Mn-DPDP, providing characterization information to discriminate hepatocellular from non-hepatocellular tumors. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to illustrate the appearance of various liver tumors on mangafodipir enhanced liver MR imaging.
