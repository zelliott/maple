We assessed the utility of preoperative clinical assessment and functional brain imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET) in predicting the clinical outcome of stereotaxic pallidotomy for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Twenty-two PD patients undergoing posteroventral pallidotomy were assessed preoperatively with the Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantation (CAPIT) ratings measured on and off levodopa; quantitative FDG/PET was also performed before surgery. Preoperative clinical and metabolic measurements were correlated with changes in off-state CAPIT ratings determined 3 months after surgery. Clinical outcome following pallidotomy was also correlated with intraoperative measures of spontaneous pallidal single-unit activity as well as postoperative MRI measurements of lesion volume and location. We found that unilateral pallidotomy resulted in variable clinical improvement in off-state CAPIT scores for the contralateral limbs (mean change 30.9 +/- 15.5%). Postoperative MRI revealed that pallidotomy lesions were comparable in location and volume across the patients. Clinical outcome following surgery correlated significantly with preoperative measures of CAPIT score change with levodopa administration (r = 0.60, p < 0.005) and with preoperative FDG/PET measurements of lentiform glucose metabolism (r = 0.71, p < 0.0005). Operative outcome did not correlate with intraoperative measures of spontaneous pallidal neuronal firing rate. We conclude that preoperative measurements of lentiform glucose metabolism and levodopa responsiveness may be useful indicators of motor improvement following pallidotomy. Both preoperative quantitative measures, either singly or in combination, may be helpful in selecting optimal candidates for surgery.
