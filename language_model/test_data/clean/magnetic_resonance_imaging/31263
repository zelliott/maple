Kawasaki disease contributes to coronary artery aneurysm in 25% of patients. Cardiovascular imaging has an important role in diagnosis and follow-up of these cases. Echocardiography is the bedside technique of choice during the acute phase of the disease. MRI can be a valuable tool especially in adolescents, where sometimes echocardiography fails to detect coronary abnormalities and it has also the advantage of simultaneous perfusion, function and viability evaluation. If MRI is not available, a combination of echocardiography and SPECT gives an overview of anatomy, function and perfusion. MSCT is of limited value for follow-up because of radiation and the misleading data due to coronary calcifications. X-ray coronary angiography is kept mainly for cases where an invasive procedure should be performed.
