The incidence of acute colonic diverticulitis (ACD) is increasing. To allow rational therapeutic decisions to be made, a timely diagnosis is required. The feasibility of "on-admission-MRI" to establish the diagnosis has not yet been studied. Therefore, a prospective observational study was carried out in 20 patients with an established diagnosis of ACD. The diagnostic criteria for the MRI diagnosis of ACD were the demonstration of at least one diverticulum, pericolic exudation, and edema of the colonic wall. MRI was diagnostic in all but one patient. It is concluded that MRI has considerable diagnostic potential in ACD and should be formally evaluated.
