Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has routinely been used to improve the accuracy of multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and monitoring, detect the effects of disease-modifying therapy, and refine the utility of clinical assessments. However, conventional MRI measures, such as the use of lesion volume and count of gadolinium-enhancing and T2 lesions, have insufficient sensitivity and specificity to reveal the true degree of pathological changes occurring in MS. Newer metrics of MRI analysis, including T1-weighted hypointense lesions (black holes) and central nervous system (CNS) atrophy measures, are able to capture a more global picture of the range of tissue alterations caused by inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss, and neurodegeneration. There is mounting evidence that these MRI measures correlate well with existing and developing neurological impairment and disability. In so doing, these MRI techniques can help elucidate the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology and natural history of MS. The current understanding is that T1 black holes and CNS atrophy more accurately reflect the neurodegenerative and destructive components of the MS disease process. Therefore, the short and long-term studies that aim to measure the degree and severity of the neurodegenerative MS disease process should incorporate these MRI metrics as part of their standard routine MRI protocols.
