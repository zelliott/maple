Two patients are reported in whom the presence of triventricular hydrocephalus and aqueductal obstruction or stenosis due to multiple expanding lacunae in the mesencephalothalamic region possibly corresponds to abnormally dilated perivascular spaces. Placement of a ventriculoperitoneal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt in one patient and the performance of a third ventricle cisternotomy in the other reversed the hydrocephalic syndrome, but did not modify the complex neuroophthalmological disturbance and rubral tremor presumably related to the compressive effects of the lacunae on adjacent parenchyma. In one patient the number and size of the lacunae were increased 4 years after CSF shunt placement. A review of the literature revealed two cases in which magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a similar, poorly understood pathological condition.
