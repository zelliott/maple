Therapeutic management of low-grade gliomas (LGG) is a challenge because they have undergone anaplastic transformation with variable delay. Today, only progressive volume growth on successive MRI allows an in vivo monitoring of this evolution. On the other hand, multinuclear spectroscopy and perfusion available during MRI may also provide assessment of metabolic changes underlying morphological modifications. To overcome this drawback, we developed a mathematical model of the metabolism and the hemodynamic of gliomas, based on a physiological model previously published, and including the MR parameters. This allows us to suggest that some specific profiles of metabolic and hemodynamic changes would be good indicators of potential anaplastic transformation.
