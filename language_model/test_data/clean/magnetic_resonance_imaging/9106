A 47-year-old man presented with a rare case of dural cavernous hemangioma of the cerebellar falx incidentally detected as a mass lesion in the posterior cranial fossa. Neurological examination revealed no deficits or physical symptoms. Computed tomography demonstrated a well-demarcated hyperdense mass, with no calcification, in the cerebellar vallecula. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the extra-axial mass as homogeneously isointense on T(1)-weighted images, and hyperintense on T(2)-weighted images, compared to the adjacent cerebellar parenchyma that had no hypointense halo. The cerebellar vermis was slightly compressed ventrally, the adjacent brain parenchyma was not swollen, and there was no evidence of hydrocephalus. The mass and the attached cerebellar falx were homogeneously enhanced by contrast medium. The dural enhancement was considered a dural tail. No other intracranial vascular malformations were found. The preoperative diagnosis was posterior cranial fossa meningioma attached to the cerebellar falx. Median suboccipital craniotomy exposed the reddish mass attached to the cerebellar falx. The arachnoid plane was well preserved. Total en bloc resection was performed with minimal blood loss. The postoperative course was unremarkable. The resected mass had a reddish-brown mulberry appearance, with spongy cross section with multiple blood-filled spaces. Histological examination identified dilated blood-containing channels lined with flattened endothelium and separated by fibrous tissue, but no luminal thrombus or hemorrhage. The histological diagnosis was dural cavernous hemangioma of the cerebellar falx. Preoperative radiosurgery or embolization is recommended for most of the dural cavernous hemangiomas, but surgery for the present dural cavernous hemangioma of the cerebellar falx was performed safely.
