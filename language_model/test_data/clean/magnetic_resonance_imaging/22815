Imaging of the athletic hip has changed significantly over the past 10 years to address clinical concerns of intra-articular pathology and femoroacetabular impingement. Currently, high-resolution direct MR arthrography of the hip provides the best means for evaluating intra-articular pathology. However, radiography remains important for the diagnosis of subtle bony irregularities associated with femoroacetabular impingement. Therefore, a comprehensive imaging strategy requires conventional radiographs and MRI to evaluate intra- and extra-articular sources of pain. Because of newer surgical techniques, MR interpretations should provide description of labral tears and assessment of cartilage defects, as well as, capsule/iliofemoral ligament injury, femoroacetabular impingement, and tears of the ligamentum teres to aid preoperative planning and help provide prognostic information.
