The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with autogenous hamstring tendon by use of remnant preservation and a femoral tensioning technique.

A total of 53 patients who had ACL reconstruction by use of remnant ACL stump preservation and a femoral tensioning technique were evaluated. Clinical evaluation at a minimum of 2 years after surgery included range of motion, Lachman test, pivot-shift test, KT-2000 arthrometer testing (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and clinical scores. Plain radiographs were evaluated for tunnel enlargement. MRI was obtained for evaluation of graft continuity, cyclops-like mass lesion, and positioning of the tibial tunnel. Second-look arthroscopy was performed in 33 patients.

The clinical scores improved postoperatively. There were statistically significant differences between preoperative and postoperative Lachman tests, pivot-shift tests, and KT-2000 arthrometer measurements. Postoperative MRI was available in 48 patients, and it showed intact graft in 45 patients, 2 partial tears, and 1 complete loss of graft. There were cyclops-like mass lesions in 12 patients, but none showed an extension limitation or pain at extension. The position of the tibial tunnel on the sagittal and coronal view was similar to the position of the normal ACL tibial insertion. The measured tibial tunnel widening on the radiographs at final follow-up was 2.2 Â± 1.5 mm.

Reconstruction of the ACL by use of preservation and femoral tensioning of the remnant tissue showed good clinical results without increased concerns regarding incorrect tunnel formation. Postoperative MRI showed an increased incidence of cyclops-like mass lesions, but no clinical significance was observed.

Level IV, case series.
