The dural tail on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images, frequently observed in meningiomas, has been used to distinguish between cerebellopontine angle meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas. We report on a 66-year-old female with vestibular schwannoma showing the dural tail on contrast-enhanced MR images. Histological examination revealed that the dural tail corresponded to the thickened dura mater comprising of collagen fibres and scattered hyalinization with no tumoral invasion.
