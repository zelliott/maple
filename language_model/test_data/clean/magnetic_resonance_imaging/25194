A patient with absence of the basal ganglia and refractory epilepsy without impairment of pyramidal or extrapyramidal motor function is reported. Imaging findings suggest a vascular insult as etiology. Preserved motor function could be explained by neuronal plasticity involving contralateral corticostriatal and pallidothalamic connections and points to a lesion received in early pregnancy.
