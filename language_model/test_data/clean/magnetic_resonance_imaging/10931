The contrast agents Gd-EOB-DTPA and Gd-BOPTA can be administered by bolus injection and are appropriate for use in MRI both as vascularization markers and markers of hepatobiliary excretion. This contribution presents an overview of the specific characteristics of contrast media and the status of clinical development. In comparison to CT and to MRI with unspecific extracellular Gd-chelates, liver-specific contrast agents offer advantages in differentiating unclear liver lesions, increasing the detection rate, and examining the bile duct system.
