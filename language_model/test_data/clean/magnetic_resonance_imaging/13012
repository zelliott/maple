Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a spinal deformity with unknown cause. Previous studies have suggested that subclinical neurologic abnormalities are associated with AIS. The objective of this prospective study was to characterize systematically neuroanatomic changes in patients with left thoracic AIS vs right thoracic AIS and healthy control subjects by using volume-based morphometry.

Our current study involved 9 girls with left thoracic AIS and 20 girls with right thoracic AIS vs 11 and 17 matched female control subjects, respectively. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM), deformation-based morphometry (DBM), and tensor-based morphometry (TBM) were used to analyze the MR images aligned with a specific brain template of local adolescent girls. The statistical t test was used in VBM and TBM, and the Hotelling T(2) test was applied in DBM.

Using VBM, we found statistically significant differences (P < .05) in the white matter attenuation of the genu of the corpus callosum and left internal capsule (left thoracic AIS < control subjects). In contrast, no significant differences were observed between patients with right thoracic AIS and control subjects.

White matter attenuation in the corpus callosum and left internal capsule, responsible for interhemispheric communication and conduit of the corticothalamic projectional fibers, respectively, were found to be significantly lower in left thoracic AIS compared with control subjects; however, this was not the case in right thoracic AIS. Confirmation of the findings is required in future research, which needs to evaluate the relationship of white matter abnormality to curve laterality, pathogenesis, and prognosis in patients with AIS, with biologic significance and possible therapeutic correction.
