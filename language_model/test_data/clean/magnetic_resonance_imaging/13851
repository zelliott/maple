The clinical presentation of intracranial venous angiomas are usually headache, seizures or dizziness. Very often these anomalies are found incidentally on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We reviewed 35 patients, which were examined in our department between 1994 and 2000. Only one patient became symptomatic with an intracranial haematoma, which was removed surgically. In three patients an associated cavernous angioma was found, which was removed successfully with preservation of the coexisting venous angioma. There is no indication in operating a venous angioma because the risk of postoperative deterioration caused by venous infarction is high. When removing cavernous angiomas the associated venous angioma has to be preserved.
