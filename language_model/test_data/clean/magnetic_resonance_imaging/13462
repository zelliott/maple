Echo-planar imaging using a magnetic field strength of 0.5 T has resulted in an improvement in image quality compared with recent images published at 0.1 T. The sensitivity of the technique to main magnetic field inhomogeneity and transient eddy currents has necessitated innovations in gradient and radiofrequency coil design. These improvements are described, and new variations in the echo-planar pulse sequence which provide better contrast and allow separate imaging of water and fat distributions are presented.
