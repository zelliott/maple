A 30-year-old Caucasian male with systemic lupus erythematosus suffered acute catastrophic-onset transverse myelitis. Two years earlier aseptic meningitis, another rare CNS lupus manifestation, had been diagnosed. MRI showed involvement of the medulla oblongata and the entire spinal cord. Therapy with intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone and intravenous cyclophosphamide is discussed.
