We present a conus medullaris tuberculoma in a 12-year-old girl. She presented with low backache, weakness of both lower limbs and urinary disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a D10-L1 intramedullary mass. The tumour was excised and the biopsy was suggestive of tuberculoma. The patient received antituberculous therapy postoperatively and improved. The relevant literature is discussed briefly.
