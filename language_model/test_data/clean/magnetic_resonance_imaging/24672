Focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) are the first cause of surgery in paediatric epilepsy surgery. The pre-surgical assessment in FCD is often complex, since they are lesions that can be highly epileptogenic and at the same time can preserve neurological functioning and may not be displayed in magnetic resonance imaging. The success of the operation largely depends on the proper identification of the lesion and the possibility of performing a complete resection of the dysplastic tissue. In this work we review the literature related with this topic, in relation to the authors' experience.

The study reviews some of the advances made as regards the pre-surgical assessment and the neurosurgical management of epilepsy in children with FCD; results from the surgical series regarding the classifications of FCD and the post-surgical prognostic factors are commented on; some anatomo-clinical phenotypes that are distinctive in children with FCD and their surgical management are described; and current challenges and the future of the surgical treatment of epilepsy in FCD are also briefly discussed.

The advances being made in the methods of pre-surgical diagnosis and surgical procedures are making it possible to offer successful treatment at earlier ages in patients with FCD who were previously considered 'non-lesional' and in patients with localised lesions in the 'eloquent cortex'. The identification of anatomo-electro-clinical phenotypes of FCD makes it possible to establish surgical approaches and post-surgical prognostic expectations that are well suited to each situation, which are better in the transmantle-type FCD IIb and in bottom-of-sulcus dysplasias than in multilobe FCD, which are mostly FCD I.
