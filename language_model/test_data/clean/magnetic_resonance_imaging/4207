Eleven patients with previous polio were studied. The concentration of energy-related metabolites and energy charge was measured from the vastus lateralis muscle, as was isometric muscle strength of knee extension. Cross-sectional area of the quadriceps femoris muscle was calculated from magnetic resonance imaging. Reinnervation was studied using macroelectromyography. Muscle weakness, pain, and newly acquired muscle weakness in the legs was estimated by the patients. The findings in the legs in which the patients experienced new loss of muscle function were compared with the stable legs. There were no significant differences between these groups in any of the objectively measured variables. Only hip pain correlated with new loss of muscle function. Creatine phosphate was decreased in 5 patients. The symptoms and subjective muscle strength did not correlate with any of the objective measurements. There were no significant relationships between energy-related metabolites and postpolio symptoms.
