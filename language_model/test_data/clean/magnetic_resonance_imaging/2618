At least 20,000 Norwegian women have silicone breast implants, either for breast augmentation or for reconstruction. One of the complications associated with breast implants is rupture of the implants. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be the most accurate imaging modality for evaluating the integrity of breast implants. Recognition of the different types of implants and the appearance of normal implants on MRI is very important for distinguishing these from intracapsular and extracapsular ruptures. Examples are shown of MRI findings in normal and ruptured implants.
