To describe a patient with acinic cell carcinoma of the lacrimal gland presenting with atypical manifestations including erosion of the orbital roof and intracranial extension. We compare his clinical manifestations with two previously reported cases.

Case report.

A 51-year-old man presented with a firm, tender, palpable mass in the superior temporal portion of his right orbit. CT scan demonstrated a large homogeneously enhancing mass displacing the globe inferiorly and eroding the roof of the orbit. MRI of the orbit showed intracranial extension of tumor. Biopsy revealed an acinic cell carcinoma of the lacrimal gland.

Acinic cell carcinoma is a rare neoplasm occurring primarily in the major and minor salivary glands.
