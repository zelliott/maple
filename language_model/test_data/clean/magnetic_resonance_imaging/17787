A number of B1 mapping methods have been introduced. A model to facilitate choice among these methods is valuable, as the performance of each technique is affected by a variety of factors, including acquisition signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The Bloch-Siegert shift B1 mapping method has recently garnered significant interest. In this paper, we present a statistical model suitable for analysis of the Bloch-Siegert shift method. Unlike previously presented models, the analysis is valid in both low SNR and high SNR regimes. We present a detailed analysis of the performance of the Bloch-Siegert shift B1 mapping method across a broad range of acquisition scenarios, and compare it to two other B1 mapping techniques (the dual angle method and the phase sensitive method). Further validation of the model is presented through both Monte Carlo simulations and experimental results. The simulations and experimental results match the model well, lending confidence to its accuracy. Each technique is found to perform well with high acquisition SNR. However, our results suggest that the dual angle method is not reliable in low SNR environments. Furthermore, the phase sensitive method appears to outperform the Bloch-Siegert shift method in these low-SNR cases, although variations of the Bloch-Siegert method may be possible that improve its performance at low SNR.
