The new imaging methods, cine computerized tomography (cine-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are reviewed as tools for cardiac output (CO) measurement. Both modalities provide accurate and highly reproducible measurements of stroke volume and CO at rest. The methods are less applicable during heavy physical exercise. Because of cost and lack of equipment the methods are not practical for measurements of CO alone in the foreseeable future. However, cine-CT and MRI may be of value for CO measurements when additional characteristics, such as wall motion, myocardial structure and tissue perfusion, need to be assessed.
