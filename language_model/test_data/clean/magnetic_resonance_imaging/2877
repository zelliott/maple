Fungal sinusitis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic or recurring sinusitis resistant to adequate medical treatment. A high index of suspicion is necessary for the diagnosis, and the clinical examination is rarely conclusive. The definitive diagnosis depends on the pathologist in most cases. We reviewed retrospectively the imaging findings, specifically computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR), in a series of fungal sinusitis patients. Non-enhanced CT scan is more sensitive than conventional X-ray in detecting the classical focal areas of hyper-attenuation and calcification seen in soft-tissue masses of fungal sinusitis. MR findings of hypo-intense signals on T1-weighted sequences which progress to signal-void area on T2-weighted sequences, are characteristic features of fungal sinusitis; however, it is reserved for cases where intracranial invasion is suspected or CT findings are inconclusive.
