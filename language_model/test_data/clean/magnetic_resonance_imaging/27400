Retrieval of remote memory is considered to differentially involve the anterior and posterior temporal neocortices. Previous neuropsychological studies suggest that the different posterior temporal cortical regions are involved in the retrieval of remote memory of different categories of stimuli, whereas the anterior region is involved more generally in remote memory retrieval. In the present study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging of human brains, we tested this dissociation by examining the more precise characteristics of the anterior and posterior temporal cortical regions. Two categories of stimuli, faces and scenes, were used for paired stimuli to be retrieved, and the brain activity during retrieval of paired stimuli that were learned immediately before the scanning was compared with that during retrieval of paired stimuli that were learned âˆ¼8 weeks earlier. We found that the different posterior temporal cortical regions were activated during retrieval of different categories of remote memory in a category-specific manner, whereas the anterior temporal cortical region was activated during retrieval of remote memory in a category-general manner. Furthermore, by applying a multivariate pattern analysis to psychophysiological interactions during retrieval of remote memory relative to recent memory, we revealed the significant interaction from the category-specific posterior temporal cortical regions to the category-general anterior temporal region. These results suggest that the posterior temporal cortical regions are involved in representation and retrieval of category-specific remote memory, whereas the anterior cortical temporal region is involved in category-general retrieval process of remote memory.
