Our goal was to describe the MR findings of subcutaneously injected silicone in male-to-female transsexuals and to determine the most optimal combination of pulse sequences for discrimination of injected silicone from the surrounding structures. Seven male-to-female transsexuals were referred for MRI in order to detect the injected silicone in the subcutaneous tissues and to visualize distant migration and possible complications. Conventional spin-echo (SE) T1-weighted and turbo SE proton-density/T2-weighted, plain short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and two STIR sequences with, respectively, water and silicone suppression were applied at 1.5 T. Three observers trained in MRI analysed the images separately for the abnormalities and rated the images using a four-level scale. The STIR with water suppression provided the highest contrast between silicone and the surrounding adipose tissue. Silicone-specific STIR pulse sequences provided clear images for the evaluation of the amount and patterns of local and distant spread of injected fluid silicone. Magnetic resonance imaging readily identifies the subcutaneously injected silicone, its distant migration and the amount of tissue disorganization around the silicone deposits. Two silicone-specific STIR sequences are usually sufficient for imaging the spread of silicone.
