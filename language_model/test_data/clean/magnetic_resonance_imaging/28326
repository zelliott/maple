NMR Relaxation and Imaging have been applied to study preparation processes of ceramic porous samples. Relaxation analysis gives a clear characterization of the materials, with high sensitivity. Differences in the method of preparation and steps as low as 25 degrees C in the firing temperatures are well detectable. Furthermore, the images permit distinguishing the different samples. The effects of the contrast in relaxation times dominate those due to the different porosities of the samples. Scanning Electron Microscopy confirms the interpretation that the changes in relaxation times are due to different pore space structures associated with the different firing temperatures. The higher the firing temperature, the larger are the pores and the higher is the amount of compact, sintered matrix, leading to higher relaxation times.
