The purpose of our study was to prospectively and directly compare capability of O2-enhanced MRI, MDCT, and perfusion SPECT/CT to clinical outcome measurements in candidates for lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS).

Twenty-five consecutive candidates for LVRS (20 men and five women; age range, 45-76 years) underwent MDCT, O2-enhanced MRI, and perfusion SPECT/CT before and after LVRS. Clinical outcomes for each candidate were evaluated in terms of differences between pre- and postoperative percentage forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%FEV1), Pao2, and 6-minute walking distance. Quantitatively assessed upper/lower lung ratios on O2-enhanced MRI, MDCT, and SPECT/CT were calculated from regional relative enhancement ratios, functional lung volumes, and radioisotope uptakes between upper and lower lungs. Qualitatively assessed upper/lower lung ratios on O2-enhanced MRI, MDCT, and SPECT/CT were estimated using visual scoring systems. To evaluate the correlation for individual upper/lower lung ratios and clinical outcomes, all upper/lower lung ratios were correlated with clinical outcomes. Improvements in mean relative enhancement ratio were directly correlated with clinical outcomes to assess the capability of O2-enhanced MRI to assess therapeutic effect.

All quantitatively (-0.63≤r≤-0.47, p<0.05) and qualitatively (0.41≤r≤0.57, p<0.05) assessed upper/lower lung ratios showed moderate and statistically significant correlation with clinical outcomes, and improvement in mean relative enhancement ratio showed moderate or good correlation, both statistically significant (-0.44≤r≤0.71, p<0.05).

O2-enhanced MRI shows potential for more accurate evaluation of postoperative clinical outcome for LVRS candidates than SPECT/CT and can be considered at least as reliable as MDCT.
