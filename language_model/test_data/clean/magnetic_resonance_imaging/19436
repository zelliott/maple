Studies based on whole-head MEG recordings are providing more and more impressive results. In such recordings, the MEG sensors are several centimeters away from the scalp and the positions of the MEG sensors with respect to the head differ from subject to subject, and from session to session for the same subject. In this paper, a method is presented and tested to estimate the scalp MEG distributions from whole-head MEG measurements. The goal is to remove the discrepancy of MEG measurements caused by the various sensor positions with respect to the head, as well as to reduce the smearing effect caused by the distance of the MEG sensors from the scalp. The MEG measurement was first projected to a hypothetical dipole layer within the head volume conductor model using the inverse solution. The scalp MEG estimation was then obtained from the resultant dipole layer by the forward solution. The results from simulation studies, phantom experiments, and the auditory evoked field analysis demonstrated that, with reasonable signal to noise ratios, this method is a feasible way to achieve our goals.
