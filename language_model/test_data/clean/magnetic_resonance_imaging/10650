Kienb√∂ck's disease in a 15-year-old girl was treated successfully by temporary scaphotrapezoidal joint fixation using longitudinal K-wires. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging begun 3 months after surgery showed progressive increases in signal intensity on T1-weighted sequences of the lunate and was almost normal 6 months after surgery. The K-wires used for the temporary joint fixation were removed 6 months after surgery. The signal intensity of the lunate on magnetic resonance images remained normal 2 years after surgery. At that time plain x-ray showed no sign of lunate sclerosis and there was no cystic shadow or sign of advanced collapse. At 2 years after surgery the patient does not complain of wrist pain, can lead a normal daily life, and plays sports without difficulty.

Therapeutic, Level IV.
