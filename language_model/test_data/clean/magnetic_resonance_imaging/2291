Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested that patients with schizophrenia fail to recruit appropriate focal patterns of cortical responses to cognitive tasks. We investigated whether patients with schizophrenia show a normal focal response to a simple motor task. Seven strongly right-handed patients with schizophrenia and seven strongly right-handed normal subjects performed motor tasks of increasing complexity. Patients were unable to recruit as focal a response even to a simple, automatic sequential finger movement task. They showed greater ipsilateral activation in the primary sensorimotor and lateral premotor regions and had a significantly lower laterality quotient than normal subjects. These phenomena increased with the complexity of the task. These results demonstrate a functional disturbance in the cortical motor circuitry of patients with schizophrenia.
