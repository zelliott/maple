Scoliosis is a structural lateral curvature of the spine with a rotatory component. Imaging in scoliosis is important. Most cases of scoliosis are idiopathic, and imaging is used routinely in monitoring the changes of the deformity that take place during growth. Imaging is also crucial in determining the underlying etiology in non-idiopathic cases of scoliosis and is used in pre- and postoperative monitoring.
