We report here a case of masticatory disturbance evoked by trigeminal schwannoma, in which we have evaluated the changes in occlusal force and masticatory sensation before and after treatment for the tumour. The patient was a 43-year-old woman and her chief complaint was a loss of masticatory sensation on her left side. MR imaging revealed an enhanced tumour in the left cavernous sinus/Meckel's cave. The left masseter muscle function and occlusal force showed remarkable decreases before treatment; however, the sensory thresholds of her facial skin and dental pulp were not significantly different from the control side, indicating that her loss of masticatory sensation was not due to sensory disturbance but to occlusal force weakness. Gamma-knife radiosurgery resulted in a significant improvement in masticatory sensation following an increase in occlusal force.
