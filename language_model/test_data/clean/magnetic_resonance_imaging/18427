The neurogenic myopathy of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is degeneration of anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and associated muscle weakness. In three patients with the severe type, according to Dubowitz's classification, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower extremity showed severe atrophy of the entire muscle bundles of the thigh and the calf. Nine intermediate type patients had ragged atrophy of muscle bundles of the thigh and the calf with selective preservation of adductor longus muscle. Five patients with the mild type had fatty infiltration of muscle bundles and increased intermuscular fat planes. MRI was insufficient for the evaluation of cervical cord abnormalities. MRI of the lower extremity was a reliable complementary modality for the diagnosis and follow-up of SMA patients.
