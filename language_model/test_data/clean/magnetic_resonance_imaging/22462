Giant pituitary adenomas are uncommonly large tumors, greater than 4 cm in size that can produces endocrine symptoms, visual loss and cranial nerve palsies. We report the rare occurrence of seesaw nystagmus as the presenting sign of giant pituitary adenoma. A 50-year-old man presented with headache associated with visual loss and seesaw nystagmus. Perimetry revealed bitemporal hemianopia and magnetic resonance imaging showed a giant pituitary adenoma. After surgery, nystagmus disappeared. Our case is relevant in understanding its pathogenesis since it documents seesaw nystagmus in a patient bitemporal hemianopia due to a large tumor but without mesencephalic compression.
