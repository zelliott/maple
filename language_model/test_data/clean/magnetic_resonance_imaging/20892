We evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of gadoxetic acid- and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH).

We retrospectively evaluated 11 patients with 11 FNHs. Both gadoxetic acid- and SPIO-enhanced MR imaging were performed. A 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination was used with the gadoxetic acid dynamic study. SPIO-enhanced MR imaging included T₂- and T₂*-weighted images. We quantitatively and qualitatively compared lesion-specific enhancement of both contrast media.

The mean signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the FNH lesions differed significantly on pre- and postenhanced imaging of each contrast medium (P<0.05); mean contrast-to-noise (C/N) ratio did not (P>0.05). All observers described all lesions as hyperintense in the arterial phase on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging and observed the presence of central scar, fibrous septa, and rim most clearly in gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatobiliary phase images.

Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging was more useful than SPIO-enhanced MR imaging in characterizing FNH.
