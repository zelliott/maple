The maintenance of a gradient of potassium and sodium ions across the cell membranes is essential for the physiological function of the mammal organism. The measurement of the spatial distribution of pathologically changing ion concentrations of (23)Na and (39)K with magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising approach in clinical diagnostics to measure tissue viability. Existing studies were focused mainly on (23)Na imaging as well as spectroscopy with only one post-mortem study for (39)K imaging. In this paper a triple resonant RF coil setup for the rat head at 9.4T is presented for imaging of both nuclei ((23)Na and (39)K) and the acquisition of anatomical proton images in the same experiment without moving the subject or the RF coil. In vivo MR images of (39)K and (23)Na in the rat brain were acquired as well as anatomical proton images in the same scanning session.
