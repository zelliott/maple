High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is an innate danger signal for the initiation of host defence and tissue repair. The aim of this study was to analyse serum HMGB1 concentration and its correlation with infarct transmurality and functional recovery in patients with ST-elevation (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

We prospectively examined patients with first-time STEMI (n = 46) or NSTEMI (n = 49), treated according to current guidelines. Contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed 2-4 days after infarction for the estimation of infarct transmurality and was repeated after 6 months for the estimation of residual left ventricular function. HMGB1 was measured 2-4 days after infarction.

High-mobility group box 1 concentration was related to infarct size and to residual ejection fraction in patients with STEMI (r(2) = 0.81 and r(2) =0.40, respectively, P < 0.001 for both) and NSTEMI (r(2) = 0.74 and r(2) = 0.25, respectively, P < 0.001 for both). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve-derived cut-off values of 6.2 and 5.9 ng mL(-1) for patients with STEMI and NSTEMI, respectively, were predictive of infarct transmurality greater than 75% (STEMI: area under the curve (AUC) = 0.93, standard error (SE) = 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.81-0.98; NSTEMI: AUC = 0.96, SE = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.86-0.99). HMGB1 cut-off values of 7.2 and 6.4 ng mL(-1) for patients with STEMI and NSTEMI, respectively, were predictive of residual ejection fraction 6 months after myocardial infarction (MI) (STEMI: AUC = 0.81, SE = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.66-0.91; NSTEMI: AUC = 0.81, SE = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.68-0.91).

High-mobility group box 1 serum levels represent a highly valuable surrogate marker for infarct transmurality and for the prediction of residual left ventricular function after MI.
