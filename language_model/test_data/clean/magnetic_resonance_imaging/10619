The management of seven patients with choroid plexus tumors, 4 adults and 3 children (mean age 17.5 years) at our institution was reviewed. There were 4 cases of papilloma and 3 of carcinoma located in the lateral ventricle in 1 case, the third ventricle in 1 case, and the fourth ventricle in 5 cases. Total surgical excision was attempted in all patients. Total resection was achieved in three patients, resulting in no deficit in two and persistence of preoperative dysphagia in one. There was no recurrence after total resection. Subtotal resection was achieved in four patients, one of whom underwent second surgery resulting in total resection, and one patient died of respiratory disturbance after the third operation because of regrowth of the tumor. Complete excision could not be achieved in 3 of the 5 tumors located in the fourth ventricle because of extension to the brainstem. The median survival was 59.5 months for patients with papilloma, and 67.7 months for those with carcinoma. Adjuvant therapy was also required for carcinoma, one patient was treated by radiotherapy, and two by radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. Only one patient with papilloma was treated by radiotherapy plus chemotherapy postoperatively.
