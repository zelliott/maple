Lipoma arborescens is a rare benign intra-articular lesion that principally affects the knee joint. We present a case of lipoma arborescens involving the glenohumeral joint and associated with prominent large bony erosions. The gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of this lesion are also described. The characteristic MRI findings permit precise preoperative diagnosis of this rare condition even if it occurs in an atypical location and there are confusing radiological findings.
