We evaluated T/M ratios and T2 values of 6 malignant lymphomas and 8 squamous cell carcinomas in the head and neck in order to differentiate these two entities. T/M ratios were calculated by dividing intensity of tumor by that of muscle in same slice images. T2 values were calculated from T2-weighted images and proton-weighted images. Statistical difference of T/M ratios was found between malignant lymphomas and squamous cell carcinomas, but no difference of T2 values was seen between two groups. T/M ratio was considered to be a useful and quantified index for evaluation of head and neck tumor.
