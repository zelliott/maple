Hepatic neoplasms constitute approximately 5% to 6% of all pediatric intra-abdominal masses, most of which are malignant. When compared with traditional multiphase computed tomography protocols that are often used in adults, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is particularly desirable for evaluating liver lesions in children because of the lack of ionizing radiation and superb soft tissue contrast resolution. The goal of this article is to discuss common benign and malignant pediatric hepatic lesions and their key MR imaging findings. Particular emphasis is placed on the utility of new hepatocyte-specific contrast agents to narrow the differential diagnosis.
