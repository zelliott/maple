Previously reported studied to quantify articular cartilage have used labor-intensive manual or semi-automatic data-driven techniques, demonstrating high accuracy and precision. However, none has been able to automate the segmentation process. This paper describes a fast, automatic, model-based approach to segmentation and thickness measurement of the femoral cartilage in 3D T1-weighted images using active shape models (ASMs). Systematic experiments were performed to assess the accuracy and precision of the technique with in vivo images of both normal and abnormal knees. Segmentation accuracy was determined by comparing the results of the segmentation with the boundaries delineated by a radiologist. The mean error in locating the boundary was 0.57 pixels. To assess the precision of the measurement technique, the mean thickness of the femoral cartilage was calculated for repeated scans of five healthy volunteers. A mean coefficient of variation (CV) of 2.8% was obtained for the thickness measurements.
