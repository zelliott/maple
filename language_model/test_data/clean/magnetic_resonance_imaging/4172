Intracranial aneurysms are lesions with high morbidity and mortality, but in most cases represent treatable disease. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and in some cases MR angiography can make valuable contributions to their diagnosis and characterization. The ultimate tool for imaging these lesions, however, remains catheter angiography. This article focuses on saccular aneurysms, with a brief discussion on atherosclerotic fusiform aneurysms and mycotic aneurysms.
