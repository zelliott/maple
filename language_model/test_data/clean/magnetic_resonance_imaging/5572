As well as dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever-dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), other atypical manifestations of dengue virus infection have also been reported. The frequency of CNS involvement in dengue remains unknown, although isolated cases with neurological manifestations have been reported in Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Burma, Puerto Rico and India. We present two cases of encephalitis associated with DF and DHF from New Delhi, India.
