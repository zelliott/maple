Laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT) is an approach to the treatment of brain tumors especially in poorly accessible regions. Its clinical applicability with tumor cell destruction has been shown in several studies. However, no data are known about specific effects on tumors cells due to LITT in the time course of the lesion.

LITT was performed in adult Lewis rats with implanted glioma cells in the brain using a standard exposure of 3 W for 30 seconds. Before and following LITT, neoplastic lesions were monitored by MRI. Proliferation of implanted cells and gliosis were assessed by several histological techniques and immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining.

Our experiments show a destruction of neoplastic cells by LITT but surviving tumor cells at the margin of the lesion. Apoptosis was detected following LITT restricted to residual neoplastic cells. Marginal survival of tumor cells lead to a secondary outgrowth into the necrotic lesion adjacent to sprouting capillaries.

LITT is a suitable technique for the treatment of brain neoplasms. However, further investigations are necessary to prevent tumor recurrences after LITT.
