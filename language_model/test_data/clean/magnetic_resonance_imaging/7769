Peritumoral cyst formation is commonly associated with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system. Results of a proteomic profiling of hemangioblastoma cyst fluid suggested that cyst formation, whether intratumoral or peritumoral, is a consequence of vascular leakage because protein profiles of cyst fluid and blood serum were similar. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of in vivo and ex vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses of hemangioblastoma cyst fluid that investigates on the mechanism leading to peritumoral cyst formation.
