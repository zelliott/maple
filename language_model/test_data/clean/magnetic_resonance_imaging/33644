Progressive neurological deterioration may occur after meningomyelocele repair. Magnetic resonance imaging almost invariably demonstrates a conus medullaris in an abnormally low position, whether neurological symptoms develop or not. Surgery of a secondary tethered cord is indicated when progression of neurological symptoms is documented. We performed a longitudinal study of posterior tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in children and adolescents after neonatal meningomyelocele repair. All patients were able to walk. Declining or negative posterior tibial nerve SSEPs were recorded in 15 patients; 14 of these had clinical signs of a secondary tethered cord. After surgery of the tethered cord, the SSEPs improved in 8 of 10 patients. Posterior tibial nerve SSEPs may contribute to the diagnosis of secondary tethered cord. After untethering, the evoked potentials demonstrate recovery of spinal cord function and might help to delineate prognosis.
