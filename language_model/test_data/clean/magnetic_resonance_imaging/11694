Dysembryoplastic neuroectodermal tumor (DNT) is a rare brain neoplasm. Although the tumor pathology is relatively well charactererized, its full clinicopathological spectrum is still discussed, and ultrastructural data on it are very limited. Here, the authors describe detailed ultrastructural pathology of 7 cases of DNT. Each tumor consisted of 3 major elements: neoplastic cells (oligodendroglial-like cells, OLC), elongated processes forming neuropil-like structure, and expanded "mucoid" extracellular space, the latter giving an impression of cellular elements floating within it. Neoplastic cells had round, oval, or elongated nuclei, no discernible nucleoli, and a relatively narrow rim of cytoplasm. Some nuclei were irregular and invaginated, and pseudoinclusions (invaginations of cytoplasm penetrated into toroid-like nuclear formations) were observed. Part of the cytoplasm sequestrated within pseudoinclusions often appeared degenerated with large blebs and electron-lucent vesicles, and some of these contained, in turn, semicircular profiles of unknown significance. Chromatin was clustered below the nuclear membrane. The cytoplasm contained a few mitochondria, round rather than elongated, a few stacks of rough endoplasmic reticulum, and scanty microtubules and clear vesicles. The second element consisted of innumerable cellular processes. Some of these were elongated and formed stacks connected by symmetric or asymetric adhesive plaque junctions. Others had shorter "neck" containing microtubules extending into bulbous extensions. Dense-cored vesicles were occasionally observed, both in the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells and within processes. In one cell, cross-sectioned annulate lamellae were found. In the cytoplasm of a few cells, unusual inclusions reminiscent of ribosome-lamellae resembled "laboratory tubes" with cone-like endings. At higher power, walls of the "tubes" resolved into layered structures composed of several laminae; between these, ribosome-like structures were visible. The authors conclude that OLC exhibit clear-cut characteristics of neuronal cells and not true oligodendocytes.
