To describe a difficult case of a large extra-abdominal desmoid fibroma of the posterior neck and back; to discuss the pathologic findings and treatment options of this case and to review the current literature for a rare presentation of this disease.

A case report and review of the current relevant English literature, carried out using PubMed Medline, are presented.

We present a challenging case in which a locally invasive desmoid of the posterior neck and back had grown to such an extent that complete surgical excision in one procedure was not possible.

Extra-abdominal desmoid fibromas are rare tumors with multiple treatment options. The literature supports incomplete surgical resection when necessary to reduce postoperative morbidity. Further options described for residual or recurrent disease include repeat surgical excision, radiation therapy, and possible chemotherapy. For particularly large tumors, close observation and a planned second stage procedure are an appropriate choice.
