To evaluate mangafodipir trisodium as a potential contrast agent at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the stomach.

Mangafodipir trisodium was injected intravenously into three swine at a dose of 5 micromol per kilogram of body weight. For comparison, gadopentetate dimeglumine was injected into three other swine at a dose of 0.1 mmol per kilogram of body weight. T1-weighted three-dimensional MR images were acquired in all six swine at 1.5 T before and approximately 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 minutes after contrast material administration. Extracted stomach specimens were imaged at 3.0 T. In vivo and ex vivo images were evaluated visually and quantitatively for contrast enhancement of the stomach, and in vivo images were evaluated for the presence of reflux from the duodenum.

Mangafodipir trisodium produced prolonged and selective enhancement of the inner surface of the stomach, in contrast to the more general enhancement seen with gadopentetate dimeglumine, and reflux from the duodenum could not account for this selective enhancement. Ex vivo images confirmed that T1 enhancement in the stomach wall with mangafodipir trisodium was limited to the inner surface. Gadopentetate dimeglumine did not produce selective enhancement of the inner surface of the stomach.

Mangafodipir trisodium preferentially enhances the inner surface of the stomach on MR images acquired in swine and, therefore, may have potential for use as a contrast agent at MR imaging of the human stomach.
