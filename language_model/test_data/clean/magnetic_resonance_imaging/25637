Basal cephaloceles of the child are rare pathologies which require accurate preoperative imaging work-up. The CT and MR studies of six children with surgically proven basal cephalocele were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the role of CT and MR in the preoperative work-up of a basal cephalocele of the child. In five patients, MR allowed to define the nature and topography of the cephalocele, and allowed an accurate depiction of the optic tract, ante- and post-hypophysis and associated agenesis of corpus callosum when present. 3-D CT allowed in one case a more precise depiction of the basal bony defect. MRI allows in a non invasive and non ionising way the best depiction of herniating meninges, brain or ventricles as well as associated cerebral anomalies.
