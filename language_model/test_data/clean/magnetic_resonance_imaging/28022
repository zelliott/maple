Stenosis of the lumbar spinal canal is contributing to 3-5% of all patients operated on a lumbar nerve root compression syndrome. Morphologically, a reduction of the midsagittal diameter of the spinal canal to less than 12 mm or stenoses of the lateral recessus or foramen intervertebrale have been described. In our department 37 patients with a lumbar spinal stenosis have been surgically treated between 1982 and 1987. Spinal stenosis is a disease of aged patients mostly suffering for a long history. The main symptoms are lumbar and sciatic pains, neurological deficits and a claudicatio intermittens spinalis. Neuroradiologically, the diagnosis can be confirmed by CT, myelography or MRI. These studies were demonstrating the stenosis in 69% at the level of L4/5, multiple stenoses have been found in 22% of all cases. An additional disc herniation existed in 35% of the patients. Concerning the specific complaints of the patients and their neuroradiological findings, the extent of the surgical decompression was decided on individually in each patient. We performed 22 laminectomies, 11 hemilaminectomies, in 3 cases an extended flavectomy and in one case an implantation of a dorsal column stimulation device. The postoperative follow-up period, ranging from 3 months to 3 years, demonstrated a complete recovery in 53%, a marked reduction of complaints in 44% of all cases. One patient did not respond to surgical treatment, but in the remaining cases surgical treatment led to satisfactory results.
