Clinicopathologic report.

The clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings of a patient with optic nerve sheath hemangiopericytoma were reviewed.

An excisional biopsy of an optic nerve sheath tumor from a 35-year-old woman showed a staghorn vascular pattern consisting of CD34-positive tumor cells.

Hemangiopericytoma may occur rarely in the optic nerve sheath.
