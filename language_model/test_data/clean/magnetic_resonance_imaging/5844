To evaluate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in mouse with (1)H and hyperpolarized (HP) (3)He MR imaging.

Axial slices of the lung volume were acquired with HP (3)He and (1)H MRI at 4, 24, and 48 h after LPS exposure. A quantitative ventilation index was calculated from two HP (3)He acquisitions. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for a cell count was performed following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The LPS exposure resulted in a significant increase of cells in BAL, with maximum at 48 h. Lesions on (3)He images were characterized by ventilation defects, whereas lesions on (1)H images were hyperintense and were attributed to edema. The number of lesions was at maximum at 48 h. At this time point, and for both (3)He and (1)H MRI, the volume of the lesions was significantly higher for LPS-exposed mice compared to controls. At 4, 24, and 48 h the ventilation index from the (3)He data was significantly smaller for the LPS-exposed animals compared to controls.

The time point 48 h after LPS exposure was advantageous for MRI evaluation. Functional read-out with (3)He MRI seems to be more sensitive than conventional (1)H MRI.
