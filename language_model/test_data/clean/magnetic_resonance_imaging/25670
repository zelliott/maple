We assessed cognitive performance and its relationship with clinical and anatomic disease severity in MS with mild to moderate handicap; 34 definite MS and 18 healthy subjects matched for age and education were submitted to a neuropsychological test battery. Both groups were examined for anxiety. MS patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging examination. MS performed worse than controls on all WAIS-P subtests and had learning, short- and long-term verbal memory impairment. Cognitive deficits were not related to abnormal emotional states, but were found to be associated with attentional process and information-processing speed impairment. Cognitive impairment did not correlate with severity of physical disability. The most severe memory deficits were found in patients with extensive periventricular damage.
