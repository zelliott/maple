Talus bipartitus is an exceptional congenital malformation consisting in the presence of two non-fused bony talar fragments. We report the case of an adolescent girl who complained of mechanical pain in the left ankle which became increasingly invalidating. Plain radiographs, CT-scan and MRI led to the diagnosis of this congenital anomaly: talus bipartitus. Surgical correction by subtalar arthrodesis provided improvement at the cost of reduced ankle mobility. Surgical treatment should be proposed for talus bipartitus in patients with invalidating pain or stiffness when rehabilitation fails to provide sufficient improvement.
