Extradural or ectopic meningiomas are, as previously described in the literature, very rare lesions. Extradural meningiomas may often be confused preoperatively with primary skull or soft tissue tumors. The origin of these lesions is controversial and their exact pathogenesis is unknown. Meningiomas may be seen in different anatomical locations, but are generally localized in the head and neck region or in perineural tissues. Total surgical resection of the lesion is recommended. The authors report here the case of a 52-year-old woman presenting with severe epistaxis and left exophthalmia. A left frontal mass that filled both the frontal sinus and left orbita was seen in a radiological examination. The patient underwent a left frontobasal craniotomy with total resection of extradural mass. The authors also review the literature concerning extradural or ectopic meningiomas and find 134 cases reported between 1951 and the present time. The authors emphasize that early detection and identification of the initial lesion should be coupled with total surgical resection for a complete curation.
