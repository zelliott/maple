The feasibility of in vivo high-resolution magnetic resonance micro-imaging of fine anatomic structures of human toes was tested. Five healthy subjects were investigated on an experimental 3 Tesla whole body scanner, using standard 3D gradient echo sequences. A radio-frequency surface coil was used for signal detection. Feet, toes and surface coil were comfortably fixed using a home built device for positioning and reduction of motion artifacts. The spatial resolution of 117 x 313 x 375 microm(3) allowed detailed visualization of anatomic structures like skin layers, vessels and nerves. In addition, oval structures with diameters ranging from 500 to 1000 microm were observed in all subjects, which could represent the sensory nerve endings of Vater-Pacinian bodies. Thus, high resolution MR micro-imaging at 3 Tesla may provide improved morphologic information in distal extremities of humans in vivo.
