In six healthy adults we examined the sources underlying P1 and N2 of the motion VEP. For this purpose was acquired, in addition to the VEP, MRI images and patterns of regional cerebral blood flow with SPECT for three of the subjects. With the same motion stimulus we also examined the spatial distribution of N2 in children. In both adults and children left and right half-field responses were compared. It was found that N2 is generated by extrastriate activity and that motion stimuli are not equivalently processed in the two cerebral hemispheres. In adults, N2 dominates in one hemisphere irrespective of the visual half-field used for stimulation whereas children show an ipsilateral maximum for N2 upon half-field presentation.
