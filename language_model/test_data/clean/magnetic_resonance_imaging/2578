A case of central neurocytoma that was confirmed with ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies has been reported. Ultrastructurally, thin cytoplasmic processes of tumor cells showed differentiation into neuronal cells containing parallel bundles of microtubules and abortive synapses with dense-core vesicles and/or clear vesicles. It was frequently found that the clusters of tumor cell processes were close to or around the microvessels. Microvessels were composed of endothelial cells without fenestrations and had tight junctions in the endothelial clefts. Neurosecretory granules in thin cell processes appeared close to microvessels and may have been secreted around microvessels.
