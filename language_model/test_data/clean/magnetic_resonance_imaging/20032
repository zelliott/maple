To assess whether subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and its treatment is followed by volume loss in temporomesial structures.

One hundred fifty-five consecutive patients with aneurysmal SAH were randomly assigned to surgical or endovascular treatment. Volumetric MRI was performed in 77 SAH patients with good or moderate clinical outcome 1 year after hemorrhage. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was used to evaluate the cognitive performance of the subjects. Thirty healthy individuals were imaged as MRI controls.

The normalized hippocampal (HC) volumes were 24.7/23.7 (right/left), and the amygdaloid (AM) volumes were 21.0/20.5 in the matched control population. In SAH patients, the corresponding volumes were smaller, HC 23.2/21.3 (p = 0.072/0.002) and AM 18.4/18.7 (p = 0.012/0.045). In addition, the AM ipsilateral to the ruptured aneurysm was smaller in patients who had undergone surgical treatment (15.7) vs endovascular treatment (20.3; p < 0.001). Treatment modality did not significantly affect the measured HC volumes. The hippocampal but not amygdaloid volumes correlated with the scores of several neuropsychological tests.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage and its treatment may be followed by atrophy in temporomesial structures. A clear correlation was demonstrated between neuropsychological performance and reduced temporomesial volumes.
