Lithiasis is the most common disease of salivary glands after mumps. The purpose of this review is to analyze the respective role of the different available imaging techniques for the diagnosis of lithiasis and related complications since the treatment of salivary lithiasis has evolved with the emergence of minimally invasive and non surgical techniques. In spite of its limitations, US represents an excellent first line imaging technique because it is non-invasive and widely available. Non contrast helical CT with multiplanar reconstructions seems to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of lithiasis, especially when small and poorly calcified since these may not be visible on standard radiographs. CT allows accurate characterization of the number and position of lithiasis. MR Sialography is increasingly replacing the more invasive conventional sialography for the non invasive visualization of the ductal system of major salivary glands even though conventional sialography has a higher spatial resolution.
