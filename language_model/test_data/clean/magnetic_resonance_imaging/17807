Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a fatal neurologic disorder caused by an infectious agent called a human prion protein. CJD can be classified as sporadic CJD, familial CJD, variant CJD, and iatrogenic CJD. We report a 64-year-old man diagnosed with CJD three months after cataract surgery. Although sporadic CJD is the most common type, the patient's cataract surgery elicited the possibility of an iatrogenic transmission. It is important to consider whether visual symptoms are a manifestation of sporadic CJD, rather than cataract surgery resulting in iatrogenic CJD. Preceding cataract surgeries have been reported with CJD, but there is no proven causality. This case highlights consideration of sporadic versus iatrogenic cause when seen in association with cataract surgery.
