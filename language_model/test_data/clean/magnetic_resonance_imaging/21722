A case of cavernous hemangioma in the internal auditory canal was reported. The chronology of this case was similar as one of Ménière's disease. The neurotological findings in this case were no specific findings to differentiate cavernous hemangioma from acoustic neurinoma. The high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) revealed calcium stippling in the lesions, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a low signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Comparison of HRCT and MRI findings is most useful for differential diagnosis of intracanalicular tumors.
