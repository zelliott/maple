The goal in this study was to highlight the potential of currently available imaging techniques for surgical planning of procedures in and around the limbic system.

The authors review traditional and newer imaging techniques as applied to neurosurgical planning. Today MR imaging techniques play a preponderant role. The various applications of functional techniques such as diffusion weighted, diffusion tensor, perfusion, and functional MR imaging methods are discussed.

In addition to the high-resolution studies of anatomy that can be acquired, especially at higher field strengths (>or= 3 T), MR imaging now also offers the possibility of acquiring functional, metabolic, hemodynamic, and molecular information on normal and pathological brain processes.

The knowledge obtained using the various imaging techniques contributes substantially to understanding the disease processes in a way that drastically improves surgical planning.
