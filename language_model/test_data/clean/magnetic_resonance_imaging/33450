A case of parosteal osteosarcoma is reported. In spite of the pathognomonic plain radiographic signs of parosteal osteosarcoma, it is very uneasy to differentiate it from myositis ossificans circumscripta in the mature stage. CT and MRI defined the extent of the tumor into the soft tissue, the medullary and cortical invasion and gave more information about the composition of the lesion.
