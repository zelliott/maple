The age-related modifications of magnetic resonance imaging parameters in the skin have been studied in vivo. Modification of these parameters should provide important information about alterations in water structure and content in aged skin. Relaxation times, T1 and T2, and relative proton density, which corresponds to the mobile water proton fraction of tissues, have been measured on people under age 40 and over 70 on a sun-protected area. Results have confirmed in vivo skin layer differentiation through relaxation times performed in a previous study. Moreover, relative proton density quantification has shown that epidermal mobile water is at least twice as abundant as dermal mobile water. No significant age-related T1 and T2 modification could be established, basically because of a large dispersion of values. The main result concerns the upper part of dermis (about 200 microns in thickness) which contains significantly more mobile water protons in chronologic aged skin than in young adult skin. This increase has been related both to an increase of total water content in dermis with age and to an apparent decrease of collagen and proteoglycan content. Associated with alterations of their structure, this decrease reduces macromolecular-water interaction sites. This finding has to be compared with ultrasound evaluation of aged skin, which is characterized by modifications of the echogenicity, related to collagen bundles size and density, in the outer part of dermis, too. Both of the imaging techniques tend to consider the outer part of dermis as one of the privileged sites of skin aging.
