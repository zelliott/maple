We performed compulsory superselective transcatheter arterial embolization on local hypovascular liver metastases under balloon occlusion using a 1-mm (3 F) coaxial microballoon catheter in 2 cases. One case was a metastasis from breast cancer (maximum diameter 5.5 cm) at segment 7. The other case comprised metastases from rectal cancer (maximum diameter 8 cm) at segments 7 and 8. Absolute ethanol (50%) mixed with Lipiodol (50%) was used for embolization. No major treatment-related complications occurred. No local recurrence was observed in either case in follow-up CT and MR studies of up to 16 and 9 months respectively. This technique may thus be applied as an alternative to surgical resection in the treatment of local hypovascular liver tumors.
