To describe the main characteristics of patients with primary Sjögren syndrome (SS) and white matter abnormalities (WMA) seen by a specialist SS unit.

The study cohort included 321 consecutive patients fulfilling the 2002 classification criteria for primary SS. We retrospectively analyzed the results of neuroimaging studies performed in patients who presented with neurological symptoms. Patients were further evaluated by three neurologists to determine fulfillment of the McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Fifty-one (16%) patients had at least one neuroimaging study, and 25 of these had WMA. WMA were classified as vascular pathological changes in 21 patients: 10 had multiple small focal lesions, 7 had beginning confluence of lesions and 4 had diffuse involvement of the entire region. WMA were classified as inflammatory/demyelinating lesions (MS-like) in 4 patients who fulfilled the MRI Barkhof criteria. Patients with inflammatory/demyelinating lesions were younger (53.7 vs. 73.5 years, P = 0.001) and had a lower frequency of hypertension (25% vs. 86%, P = 0.031) and altered glomerular filtration rate (0% vs. 70%, P = 0.047) in comparison with patients with vascular lesions. The multivariate age-sex adjusted model including the seven variables which were statistically significant in the univariate analysis (antimalarial therapy, leukopenia, anti-La/SSB antibodies, diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and HDL-c levels) identified hypertension (P = 0.019) and HDL-c levels (P = 0.032) as independent predictors of WMA in primary SS patients.

Neuroimaging studies disclosed WMA in 49% of patients with primary SS and suspected neurological involvement. WMA were identified as vascular pathological changes in 80% of the patients, and hypertension and HDL-c levels as predictive factors for this association.
