A 26-year-old patient underwent endoscopic third ventriculostomy for the treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus. 3D volume data sets were obtained at 3 T before surgery and three times after surgery. Off-line analysis of individual imaging data (initial linear registration, intensity adjustment, and final nonlinear registration of pre- to postoperative MR images) yielded 3D displacement fields representing the postoperative structural brain change. In principle, such an analysis technique can be used in any clinical follow-up for which careful observation of tissue readjustment is of particular importance.
