Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory demyelinating peripheral nerve disorder. It is known that gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reflects alteration of the blood-nerve barrier secondary to inflammation. Enhancement of the cauda equina roots with gadolinium on lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging have been demonstrated in several reports. Although about 50% of GBS patients clinically exhibit facial nerve involvement, it has never been demonstrated on MRI. We aimed to observe facial nerve involvement in a GBS patient who has prominent facial diplegia. With the guidance of the literature, we predict that MRI in selected GBS patients may be an adjunct tool for the clinician in both diagnosis and monitoring the treatment response.
