Three cases of multiple gliomas with postmortem findings including a rare case of multicentric glioma are presented. A 59-year-old female was hospitalized with decreased mental activity and gait disturbance. Computed tomographic (CT) scans and magnetic resonance (MR) images showed two independent mass lesions in the left frontal and the right temporal lobes, shown by postmortem to have no communication. Histologically, they were a gemistocytic astrocytoma and an anaplastic astrocytoma, respectively. Therefore, multicentric glioma was diagnosed. A 66-year-old male was admitted with slow mentation and gait disturbance. CT scans and MR images demonstrated two mass lesions; one overriding the bilateral frontal lobes through the corpus callosum and the other in the left temporal lobe. Postmortem examination showed that both lesions were glioblastoma and the left temporal tumor was accompanied by subarachnoid dissemination. A 29-year-old male was hospitalized with gustatory hallucination and convulsions of the right upper extremity. CT scans revealed two mass lesions in the right frontal and the left temporal lobes. MR images demonstrated communication between the two lesions through the corpus callosum. The left temporal tumor developed into the occipital lobe and another new lesion appeared in the right temporal lobe despite chemotherapy and irradiation. Postmortem examination revealed communication between the three masses through the corpus callosum. Histologically, all three tumors were glioblastoma. Multicentric gliomas have been reported at various incidences from 2.3 to 9.1%. However, multicentric gliomas with multiple tumors of different histologies are very rare and only 16 cases have been reported. MR imaging is more valuable than CT scanning to detect communication between two or more lesions.
