The authors report a case of a 6 month-old male presenting with increasing head circumference and a large benign intraventricular meningioma which was grossly removed at the initial surgery. Twenty-four months later, the patient returned with subcutaneous and osseous metastatic lesions at the site of the previous craniotomy, revealing the same histology as the original tumour. The presentation, pathology and management of this unique case are discussed.
