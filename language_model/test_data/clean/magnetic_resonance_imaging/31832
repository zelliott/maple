Retrospective comparison of Linac radiosurgery (RS) in 93 single brain metastases with or without a 2-mm margin.

A total of 153 patients had Linac RS (between April 1992 and June 2004), with 139 patients (90.8%) evaluable in June 2005. Sixty-one patients (44%) had extracranial lesions and 65 patients had neurologic symptoms (47%). RS alone: 105 patients (66%); RS +whole brain radiotherapy: 34 patients (24%). Single metastasis: 93/139 patients; classic RS: 42/93 patients; 2-mm margin: 51/93 patients; 30 multiple lesions patients were excluded.

15 Mv X-ray Linac, circular minibeams, 8-30 mm, four to six noncoplanar coronal arcs. Isodose was 60-80%; doses were 10-20 Gy.

12 months-13 years; median, 14 months.

Local control (LC) was not improved in 51 margin patients vs. 42 classic RS patients: 1 year: 69.1% and 72.4%. Two-year LC rate: 64% and 54.7%, respectively. Survival: median classic RS: 11.3 months; margin RS, 19 months (p = 0.34) and 1 year, 41.6% and 60.2%, respectively. Margin RS patients had a significantly higher rate of severe parenchymal complications: 19.6% vs. 7.1% (p = 0.02); surgery was necessary in 4 of 51 cases vs. 1 of 42 classic RS cases.

No increase of 1- and 2-year LC rate in margin RS or survival and median survival: 11.3 vs. 19 months (NS) 2-mm margin associated with more severe parenchymal complications (p = 0.02). This procedure is therefore not recommended. Late CT images and 1-mm margin as recommended by pathologists, use of three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and fuzzy method to calculate volumes may yield better results. Stereotactic hypofractionation requires further studies.
