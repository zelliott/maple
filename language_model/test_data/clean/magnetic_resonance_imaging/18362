Magnetic resonance images were used to measure the volume of the head of the caudate nucleus in 20 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and 16 normal control subjects. The obsessive-compulsive patients showed a significant increase in the volume of the right side of the head of the caudate nucleus compared with that of control subjects. This finding was not correlated with demographic, psychopathological, or clinical characteristics.
