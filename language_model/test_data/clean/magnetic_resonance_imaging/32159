Schizophrenia patients were known to have oculomotor abnormalities for decades and several studies had found antisaccade impairment to be a biological marker of schizophrenia. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural circuits responsible for antisaccade deficits in schizophrenia. Ten normal controls and 10 DSM-IV schizophrenia patients performed antisaccade tasks and control tasks during fMRI. Data were analyzed and task-specific activations were identified using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM-2). In normal subjects, antisaccade tasks activated bilateral frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobules, inferior parietal lobules, occipital visual cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, and lentiform nuclei (P<0.001). By contrast, schizophrenia patients failed to show activation in bilateral lentiform nucleus, bilateral thalamus, and left inferior frontal gyrus during antisaccade performance. Our findings suggest that schizophrenic antisaccade deficits are associated with dysfunction of fronto-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits previously demonstrated to be responsible for suppression of the reflexive saccade. Left inferior frontal gyrus, which was known to be responsible for response inhibition on "go/no-go" testing, also plays an important role in schizophrenic antisaccade deficit.
