We report a case of testicular abscess with low-grade inflammation. A 55-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of right scrotal pain and swelling for approximately 3 weeks. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness and a hen's egg-sized mass in the right scrotum ; however, fever and scrotal erythema were absent. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an enlarged right testis and spermatic cord, and an ultrasonography scan indicated loss of blood flow to these regions. Right testicular necrosis due to spermatic cord torsion or testicular cancer was suspected, and high orchiectomy was performed. However, abscess formation was detected in the testis, and testicular abscess caused by Escherichia coli was diagnosed. The clinical course of this case was unusual because of the small extent of inflammation observed. Typically, testicular abscess is characterized by severe systemic and local inflammation.
