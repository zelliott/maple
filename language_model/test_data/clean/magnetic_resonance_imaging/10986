A magnetic resonance (MR) imaging method with the potential for assessing hepatic iron overload from measurements of hepatic magnetic susceptibility in vivo is described. Using the blood in the portal and hepatic veins as an internal reference, this technique uses the orientation dependence of signal phase to measure the susceptibility of the liver parenchyma. Computer simulations were done to investigate the requirements on spatial resolution and contrast ratio between the vessels and the background liver tissue for data acquisition. Validation studies were conducted using tube-embedded gel phantoms doped with iron-dextran from 0 to 10 mg Fe/mL to mimic healthy and iron-overloaded livers. The phantom measurements were conducted without motion and flow, under respiration-like oscillatory motion, and with flow. Studies on six normal human subjects demonstrated excellent reproducibility and precision. All images were collected at 1.5 T using a 3D T(1)-weighted turbo field echo sequence for inflow MR angiographies with full flow compensation and capable of cardiac synchronization, navigator gating, and motion correction.
