Using computer-simulated random-site percolation networks as templates, three-dimensional percolation cluster objects were fabricated. The pore space was filled with water and experimentally investigated with the aid of NMR microimaging. A pulse sequence for six-dimensional spin density/velocity NMR imaging was employed for the combined record of the three-dimensional spin-density distribution and the three-dimensional velocity vector field of water percolating through the pore space. An evaluation procedure for the NMR image data was established that reliably renders the characteristic parameters (fractal dimensionality, fractal dimensionality of the backbone, correlation length).
