We present two cases of hepatic angiomyolipoma in which the size and internal composition of the tumor changed during the course of follow-up study. The tissue elements composing the tumor are thought to grow or regress independently during the disease's clinical course. Radiologists should be aware that hepatic angiomyolipoma can change in size and internal composition during its natural course.
