The interaction between arterial loops and the vestibulocochlear nerve is considered to be responsible for such clinical symptoms as progressive sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and vestibular dysfunction. Previously, neurovascular relationships were best demonstrated with invasive Gas-CT-cisternography, although this technique resulted in a low detection rate of 38%. Magnetic resonance angiography offers a non-invasive method for imaging vessel loops in the cerebellopontine angle without contrast medium in more than 90% of cases. A comparison between gas-CT-cisternography and magnetic resonance angiography in 9 patients revealed a superior simultaneous depiction of both anterior inferior cerebellar arteries with magnetic resonance angiography.
