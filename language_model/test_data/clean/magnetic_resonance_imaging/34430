The authors document the association of peripapillary staphyloma and an atypical variant of hemimegalencephaly with the linear nevus sebaceous syndrome.

Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome is an uncommon neurocutaneous disorder that has a propensity to involve the eyes.

Clinical, histopathologic, and neuroimaging findings are examined in a child with linear nevus sebaceous syndrome.

In addition to bilateral peripapillary staphylomas, ophthalmologic abnormalities included a corneal dermoid, a complex conjunctival choristoma, macular hypoplasia, and optic nerve hypoplasia with contralateral optic atrophy. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a rare form of hemimegalencephaly characterized by hypoplasia of an optic radiation within the enlarged, dysgenetic cerebral hemisphere.

The spectrum of oculocerebral dysgenesis in the linear nevus sebaceous syndrome can be expanded to include peripapillary staphyloma and atypical hemimegalencephaly with hypoplasia of an optic radiation.
