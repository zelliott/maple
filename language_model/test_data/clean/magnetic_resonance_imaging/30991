We present three patients with large intraparenchymal isolated degenerating cysticerci in whom the diagnosis was primarily based on in-vivo proton MR spectroscopy, and subsequently confirmed histologically. We suggest that the presence of succinate alone or more succinate acetate indicates the presence of degenerating cysticerci and differentiates them from anaerobic brain abscesses, which show acetate alone or in higher concentration than succinate, even when the clinical and imaging features are similar.
