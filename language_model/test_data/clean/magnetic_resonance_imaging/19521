Two cases of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) are presented with emphasis on MR appearances. One case is the diffuse type of XGP secondary to chronic obstruction caused by transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis. The other case is the focal or "tumefactive" type of XGP which mimics renal cell carcinoma.
