Development of neovasculature is a necessary requirement for tumour growth and it provides additional opportunities for therapeutic intervention. However, current antiangiogenic therapies have limited efficacy, mostly because of the development of resistance. Hence, characterization of new antiangiogenic molecular targets is of considerable clinical interest. We report that a calmodulin-binding domain (CaM-BD) deletion mutant of the growth factor receptor bound protein 7 (Grb7) (denoted Grb7Δ) impairs tumour growth and associated angiogenesis in vivo. We implanted glioma C6 cells in rat brains transfected with an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) chimera of Grb7∆, its EYFP-Grb7 wild type counterpart, and EYFP alone. We systematically followed intracerebral growth of the tumours, their cellularity and the functional performance of tumour-associated microvasculature using magnetic resonance imaging, including anatomical T1W and T2W images and functional diffusion and perfusion parameters. Tumours grown from implanted C6 cells expressing EYFP-Grb7Δ developed slower, became smaller and presented lower apparent cellularity than those derived from cells expressing EYFP-Grb7 and EYFP. Vascular perfusion measurements within tumours derived from EYFP-Grb7∆-expressing cells showed significantly lower cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (MTT) values. These findings were independently validated by histological and immunohistochemical techniques. Taken together, these findings confirm that the CaM-BD of Grb7 plays an important role in tumour growth and associated angiogenesis in vivo, thus identifying this region of the protein as a novel target for antiangiogenic treatment.
