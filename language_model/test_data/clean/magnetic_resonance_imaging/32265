The goal of the present study was to determine if there are global or regionally specific decreases in callosal area in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In addition, this study examined the corpus callosum of healthy older adults who have subjective cognitive complaints (CC) but perform within normal limits on neuropsychological tests. We used a semi-automated procedure to examine the total and regional areas of the corpus callosum in 22 patients with early AD, 28 patients with amnestic MCI, 28 healthy older adults with cognitive complaints, and 50 demographically matched healthy controls (HC). The AD, MCI, and CC groups all showed a significant reduction of the posterior region (isthmus and splenium) relative to healthy controls. The AD group also had a significantly smaller overall callosum than the controls. The demonstration of callosal atrophy in older adults with cognitive complaints suggests that callosal changes occur very early in the dementing process, and that these earliest changes may be too subtle for detection by neuropsychological assessments, including memory tests.
