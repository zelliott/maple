A 14-year-old girl was referred to our hospital for examination of a right adrenal tumor, incidentally found by abdominal ultrasound sonography. Computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed a 44 x 20 mm solid tumor in the right adrenal region. Endocrinological examination were within normal limits except for slightly increased serum aldosterone. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed and the tumor was histologically diagnosed as ganglioneuroma originated from the right adrenal medulla.
