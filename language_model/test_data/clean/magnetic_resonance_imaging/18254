A maternal biliary cyst diagnosed in pregnancy is extremely rare. The condition can be asymptomatic or can present with chronic and intermittent abdominal pain, rupture of the cyst, and liver function test abnormalities. Management depends on the gestational age and the patient's condition when it is diagnosed.

We present a case of a symptomatic type IV biliary cyst with abnormal liver function tests diagnosed in the second trimester of pregnancy and treated with a percutaneous drainage. The patient delivered vaginally at term and developed obstruction of the percutaneous drain with superimposed bacterial infection postpartum. She was lost to follow-up intermittently throughout her treatment.

Symptomatic biliary cyst in pregnancy may require palliative invasive intervention until delivery.
