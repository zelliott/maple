A part of patients with the therapy resistant epilepsy can be cured by surgical interventions. The more concordant the presurgical evaluation data, the better prognosis the patient has postoperatively. In case of discordant examination data, multimodal evaluation or case-specific decision might be successful. We report on a five-year-old boy with bilateral (left-dominated) cortical dysplasia and therapy resistant epilepsy. The ictal EEG did not help to localize the seizure onset zone, semiology had little lateralization value; however, FDG-PET showed left hemispheric hypermetabolism. The child became almost seizure-free and showed improved development after left-sided hemispherotomy.
