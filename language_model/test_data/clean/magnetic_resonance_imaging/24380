Intratendinous ganglia are rare. We report the case of a sedentary woman with chronic mechanical anterolateral pain of the knee and an extensive ganglion of the patellar tendon as indicated on magnetic resonance (MR) and ultrasound (US) examinations. There was evidence of a high-riding patella, patellar malalignment and patellar tendon-lateral femoral condyle friction syndrome with significantly close contact between the patellar tendon and the lateral facet of the femoral trochlea. The ultrasound-guided aspiration of the ganglion enabled a localized injection of an anti-inflammatory drug (cortivazol) and the cytopathological examination of the fluid, which confirmed the diagnosis. Clinical improvement was maintained with knee rehabilitation and was satisfactory at follow-up after 1Â year. To our knowledge, we report the first case of a ganglion of the patellar tendon subsequent to patellar tendon-lateral femoral condyle friction syndrome. We found that this case was illustrative of mucoid degeneration in connective tissue due to chronic repetitive microtraumas. Additionally, this case provided the opportunity to discuss the management of this condition in a sedentary individual with a high-riding patella and patellar malalignment.
