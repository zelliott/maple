Aseptic bone necrosis in adults is usually caused by circulation defects or metabolic diseases but may also occur without any obvious reason. In these "idiopathic" cases, alcoholism seems to play a prominent role. In addition to the frequently affected femoral heads other bones may be involved. Here a remarkable pattern of localizations is reported: the bilateral idiopathic necroses of the heads of both humerus and femur. Untreated aseptic bone necroses close to a joint commonly leads to severe secondary arthrosis and destruction of the joint within a short time. Therefore, only a diagnosis in an early stage of the disease offers the chance of a successful joint-preserving therapy. In cases of clinically suspected aseptic bone necrosis but still negative or doubtful X-ray findings, bone scans or MRI are reliable methods of verifying the diagnosis.
