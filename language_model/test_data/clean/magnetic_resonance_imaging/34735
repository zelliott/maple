A new approach based on the calculation of the phase variance in a region of interest on the phase images of a simple gradient echo sequence, was used to assess the properties of trabecular bone in the distal radius. The phase variance reflects the distribution of field inhomogeneities due to the difference in magnetic susceptibility between bone and marrow in a way similar to T2*. However, the phase variance monitors the intervoxular differences, whereas T2* studies the intravoxular inhomogeneities. In this study of the radius of seven volunteers, both techniques were compared with parameters characterizing trabecular bone structure derived from high resolution MR images. Parameters such as the apparent bone area fraction, trabecular number, thickness and spacing, and box-counting fractal dimension were determined.
