Pilomatrix carcinoma, the malignant counterpart of pilomatrixoma, is rare, with only 55 cases reported, and only four cases with visceral metastases described in the literature. Here we present a case report and a literature review on this rare tumour. A 74-year-old male with a pilomatrix carcinoma from the left temporal region presented in July 1996 and the tumour was excised. One month after diagnosis, metastases to both lungs and to a regional lymph node were found and histologically verified. The patient also developed metastases in the abdomen, back and thoracic spine. The latter resulted in spinal cord compression and paraplegia. Despite systemic chemotherapy with intravenous cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil and localised radiotherapy to the thoracic spine, progression and deterioration led to death within 3 months from time of diagnosis. Pilomatrix carcinomas are usually indolent. In our patient, however, the malignant disease progressed rapidly and it appeared to be resistant to both chemotherapy and irradiation.
