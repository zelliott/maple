Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) has been the preferred investigation to delineate the anatomy of the biliary tract in a patient with a bile duct stricture after cholecystectomy. Recently magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) has been described to evaluate the obstructed biliary tract. This paper reports a comparison of MRC with PTC in evaluating patients with an iatrogenic bile duct stricture.

This was a prospective study of 26 patients who had surgery for a bile duct stricture after cholecystectomy. Before operation all patients underwent both MRC and PTC, the results of which were compared with the intraoperative findings.

Both PTC and MRC were comparable with regard to image quality, detection of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, assessment of the level of injury and detection of abnormalities such as intraduct calculi, cholangitic liver abscesses and atrophy of liver lobes. MRC provided additional information in four patients, including detection of associated fluid collections (n = 3) and portal hypertension (n = 1). In eight patients more than one puncture had to be performed during PTC to delineate the complete anatomy.

MRC is an accurate and non-invasive imaging procedure for preoperative evaluation of patients with a bile duct injury after cholecystectomy, and is capable of providing additional information which may not be available with PTC.
