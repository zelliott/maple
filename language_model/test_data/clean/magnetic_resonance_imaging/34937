Intracerebral hemorrhage is an uncommon sequel of Churg-Strauss syndrome. We describe a 27 y old Taiwanese male patient who was clinicopathologically diagnosed as Churg-Strauss syndrome. The patient experienced a sudden onset of blurring of vision and slowness of motion and speech. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed lobar hemorrhage on right parieto-occipital and left parietal areas. The cause of cerebral hemorrhage was probably due to poorly controlled high blood pressure and vasculitis. He received pulse therapy of methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide followed by oral prednisolone. His neurological symptoms responded well to such a regimen. Cerebral hemorrhage is a major cause of morbidity and death in patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome. Uncontrolled high blood pressure may cause cerebral hemorrhage. Careful monitor of blood pressure is critical for the management of Churg-Strauss syndrome patients.
