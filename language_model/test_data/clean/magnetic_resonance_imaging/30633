Solitary fibrous tumours are rare and they were first described in the pleura of the lungs. However this rare tumour is being increasingly recognised in the oro-facial region and other extra-pleural sites among adults. We present a paediatric case of a solitary fibrous tumour of the parotid gland in an 11-year-old girl who was also diagnosed as having type I neurofibromatosis.
