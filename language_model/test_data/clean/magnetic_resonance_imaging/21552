A 57-year old man, who had suffered from herpes simplex encephalitis and had been cured without antiviral agents, was admitted to our hospital three years after the encephalitis. He had a complete loss of memory for events subsequent to the encephalitis and a retrograde amnesia for the several years leading up the encephalitis. MRI revealed the abnormalities located in the limbic system, especially the medial portions in the bilateral temporal lobes of the cerebrum were completely destroyed. We consider that this case suggests the specific affinity of herpes simplex virus especially for the medial portions in the temporal lobes of the cerebrum.
