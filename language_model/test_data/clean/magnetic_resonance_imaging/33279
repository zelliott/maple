The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the reproducibility of trabecular bone structure measurements of the distal radius at 1.5 and 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Root mean square reproducibility errors ranged from 0.69% to 4.94% at 1.5 T MRI and from 0.38% to 5.80% at 3.0 T MRI. Thus, reproducibility errors of trabecular bone structure measurements are overall in an acceptable range and similar at 1.5 and 3.0 T MRI.
