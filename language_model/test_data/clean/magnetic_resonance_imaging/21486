Computer assisted medical interventions (CAMI) aim at minimizing the invasive part of some medical or surgical techniques. This general objective is discussed, together with its scientific consequences. The general methodology of CAMI is then laid out, with special emphasis on its three fundamental steps: perception-reasoning-action. Each of these steps is illustrated with feasibility demonstrations in various domains. We then conclude by analysing the part this sort of technique could play in an hospital, together with the colaborations such a project implies.
