The aim of this study was to determine the value of delayed-phase imaging (DPI) of gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA)-enhanced MR imaging for the evaluation of focal hepatic tumors compared with precontrast imaging and early dynamic phase imaging. The MR images were obtained in 48 patients with 98 focal hepatic tumors. Three-dimensional gradient-echo (GRE) imaging obtained before and 30, 60, and 1 h after administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadobenate dimeglumine. Each image set was analyzed qualitatively (lesion detection, conspicuity, delineation, and enhancement pattern on DPI) and quantitatively [signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), tumor-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)]. Improved lesion-to-liver contrast during the dynamic phase imaging was observed compared with precontrast images. The DPI showed a homogeneous enhancement of liver parenchyma and distinctive enhancement features of focal liver lesions: metastases (85%) showed a target shaped enhancement, and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) showed an inhomogeneous (58%) or homogeneous enhancement (21%). The DPI showed better performance for the detection of metastases than other images by increasing lesion delineation ( p<0.05). The absolute CNR of metastasis measured from periphery of the tumors on DPI was greater than precontrast and arterial phase imaging ( p<0.05). The Gd-BOPTA during both dynamic and delayed phases provides valuable information for the characterization of focal liver lesions, and furthermore, Gd-BOPTA-enhanced DPI contributed to the improved detection of liver metastasis compared to precontrast and early dynamic imaging.
