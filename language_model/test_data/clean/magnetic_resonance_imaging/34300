Subclavian artery aneurysms are uncommon. The most common causes of these aneurysms are atherosclerosis and traumatic pseudoaneurysm. We report two cases of rare congenial left subclavian artery aneurysms. Diagnosis with aortography and treatment with resection with bypass grafting are the optimal approaches to avoid life-threatening and limb-threatening ischemia.
