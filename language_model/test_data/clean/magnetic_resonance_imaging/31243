Advances in MR imaging of arthritis include contrast-enhanced, dynamic, and quantitative imaging techniques. These advances may result in MR imaging becoming the gold standard in diagnosing early RA. MR imaging is a useful technique in diagnosis, follow-up, and evaluation of remission in rheumatic diseases of the joints. Early diagnosis of RA, in the first 6 months after the onset of symptoms, may lead to earlier control and prevent future erosions and deformities.
