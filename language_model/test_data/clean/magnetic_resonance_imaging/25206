The article reviews the current MR imaging techniques commonly utilized for imaging liver tumors. Breath-hold T1-weighted GRE sequences, FSE T2-weighted sequences, and properly timed contrast-enhanced 3D SGE are important for lesion characterization. New liver-specific contrast agents improve lesion detection and are useful in lesion characterization.
