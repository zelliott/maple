A novel nonparametric approach for correcting intensity nonuniformity in magnetic resonance (MR) images is described. This approach is based solely on the assumption that the various sources of nonuniformity in MR imaging give rise to smooth variations in image intensity, and that these variations can be extracted and corrected for. The advantage of this computationally fast method is that it can be applied early in quantitative analysis while being independent of pulse sequence and is insensitive to pathological processes. This algorithm has been tested on both simulated and real data. Application to tissue segmentation and functional MR imaging has shown a marked improvement in quantitative analysis. J. Magn. Reson.
