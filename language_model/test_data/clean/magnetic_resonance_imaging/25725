Fast spin echo (FSE) images were compared with conventional images in 46 patients with intradural spinal disease to determine their accuracy in the detection and delineation of lesions.

The images were interpreted by two neuroradiologists, who read individually. A total of 720 blinded readings formed the basis for this evaluation. A gold standard for each patient was selected, based on the blinded readings of the conventional studies.

In the sagittal plane, the FSE sequences were found to have an accuracy of 93% and 93% for the first reader and 93% and 85% for the second reader. For the axial plane, the corresponding figures were 86% and 82% for the first reader and 64% and 77% for the second reader. These figures compared favorably with conventional sequences. Similar delineation of lesions was noted in 78% of cases. In the remaining cases, there were no significant trends.

Because of these findings, FSE sequences appear as accurate as conventional sequences. In this study, they were capable of supplanting conventional sequences in the evaluation of intradural pathology of the spine in the sagittal plane, although conventional sequences were still preferred in the axial plane.
