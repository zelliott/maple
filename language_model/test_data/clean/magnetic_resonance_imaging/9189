Reducing body myopathy is a rare progressive myopathy identified by characteristic pathological findings and secondary to dominantly acting mutations in the X-linked FHL1 gene. We report muscle MRI findings in two patients affected by reducing body myopathy and in their carrier mothers. All four showed a distinctive pattern of muscle alteration, with a predominant involvement of postero-medial muscle at thigh level and of soleus at calf level, with a striking sparing of glutei muscles that also appeared to be hypertrophic. These findings may help in the differential diagnosis of these disorders.
