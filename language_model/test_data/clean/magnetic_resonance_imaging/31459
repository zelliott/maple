Local drug delivery has recently attracted much attention since it represents a strategy to increase the drug concentration at the target location and decrease systemic toxicity effects. Ultrasound can be used in different ways to trigger regional drug delivery. It can cause the local drug release from a carrier vehicle and the local increase of cell membrane permeability either by a mechanical action or by a temperature increase. Ultrasound contrast agents may enhance these effects by means of cavitation. Ultrasound can be focused deep inside the body into a small region with dimensions on the order of 1 mm. Several types of drug microcarriers have been proposed, from nano- to micrometer sized particles. The objective of real-time imaging of local drug delivery is to assure that the delivery takes place in the target region, that the drug concentration and the resulting physiological reaction are sufficient, and to intervene if necessary. Ultrasound and nuclear imaging techniques play an important role. MRI is rather insensitive but allows precise targeting of (focused) ultrasound, can provide real-time temperature maps, and gives access to a variety of imaging biomarkers that may be used to assess drug action. Examples from recent articles illustrate the potential of the principles of ultrasound-triggered local drug delivery.
