Two new cases of cauda equina metastases from visceral cancers are reported. This diagnosis is only infrequently considered in patients with intra-dural lesions visualized by magnetic resonance imaging or saccoradiculography. The diagnosis is especially difficult in patients with no known primary cancer. Diagnosis rests on surgery during which only a biopsy is performed. Treatment is symptomatic and focuses on relieving pain. Prognosis is bleak.
