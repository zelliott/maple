We report a case of precocious puberty in a 4-year-old boy. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging suggested a pineal cyst with enhancement of the slightly thickened wall and focal wall irregularity. Three-dimensional constructive interference in a steady-state imaging revealed a focal lobulation and a nodule-like area in the lesion. The lesion mimicking a pineal cyst proved to be a germinoma with syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells, on the basis of biopsy and tumor marker results.
