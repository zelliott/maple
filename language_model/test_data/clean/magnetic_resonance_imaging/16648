We report a pregnant patient with a rapidly growing mass within the nasal cavity, which required pre-operative super-selective embolisation and subsequent removal under general anaesthesia after childbirth. We also discuss the clinical, radiological and histological characteristics of lobular capillary haemangioma, and its treatment.

Case report and literature review.

Lobular capillary haemangioma is a benign lesion originating in the vascular tissue of skin, mucosa, muscles, glands and bone. These lesions grow rapidly. Nasal localisation is rare. Microtrauma and pregnancy are the most commonly proposed aetiological factors. Reported incidence during pregnancy ranges from less than 2 per cent to approximately 5 per cent. The management of a pregnant woman with such a lesion may be complex, and depends on the severity of symptoms and the status of the pregnancy. Complete surgical excision, with or without pre-operative embolisation, is the treatment of choice.

This uncommon lesion should be considered in any pregnant patient with a mass in the mouth or nasal cavity.
