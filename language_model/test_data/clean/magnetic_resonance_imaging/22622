The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI in predicting the disease activity of Crohn's disease.

Forty-eight patients in two hospitals who had clinically suspected exacerbation of Crohn's disease were included in this study. In three levels of thickened small-bowel wall, axial dynamic T1-weighted sequences were performed every 4-6 sec for a total duration of 2-3 min after contrast administration; static T1-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences were acquired both before and after contrast administration. The slope of enhancement, enhancement ratio, time to enhancement, enhancement time, and thickness of the small-bowel wall were determined. These MRI results were compared with overall clinical grade, Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), and Van Hees activity index. Clinical grade was based on clinical information, physical findings, laboratory studies, endoscopy, surgery, and other imaging studies. Spearman's correlation coefficient and p values were determined per hospital. Fisher's z-transformation was applied before pooling the correlation coefficients from both hospitals.

The enhancement ratio based on the static series showed significant correlation with the clinical grade (r = 0.29, p = 0.045), CDAI (r =0.31, p = 0.033), and Van Hees activity index (r = 0.36, p = 0.016). The enhancement ratio based on the dynamic series correlated significantly with the CDAI (r = 0.38, p = 0.016). Wall thickness correlated significantly with clinical grade (r = 0.47, p = 0.003) and Van Hees activity index (r = 0.41, p = 0.007).

These data suggest that the enhancement ratio of bowel wall after IV administration of gadodiamide and bowel wall thickness are weak to moderate indicators of the severity of Crohn's disease.
