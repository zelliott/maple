The comparative adequacy was studied of the two main neuroradiological imaging methods, MR imaging and CT, through the analysis of 1500 MR examinations with a preliminary CT study. The comparison was made by giving a score to the diagnostic contribution of MR imaging, especially as far as changes in the therapeutical approach were concerned. The results varied according to the various pathologies, to the different anatomical regions explored, and to the site of the masses. The overall score was higher in the spine and the spinal cord than in brain pathology. In brain neoplastic pathology, eg, the diagnostic capabilities of CT and MR imaging were similar in most cases, especially in supratentorial locations, while MR imaging was clearly superior in the spinal cord district. In infratentorial location, the better anatomical details make MR imaging the method of choice. In conclusion, CT confirms its accuracy in the detection of brain pathology, while MR imaging proves more sensitive in white matter diseases, and in particular locations, e.g. the posterior fossa. In the spine and spinal cord districts, the very high average score mainly confirms MR capability to demonstrate spinal canal normal and pathological content. Moreover, the important role of MR imaging is stressed in pediatric pathology, together with CT primary role in emergency cases.
