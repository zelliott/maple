Primary perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms (PEComas) of bone are rare mesenchymal tumors. Histologically, they are composed predominantly of perivascular epithelioid cells and have the capacity to metastasize. PEComas have been reported within intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic organs. To the best of our knowledge, only seven primary PEComas of bone have been described in the English literature. We present two cases of PEComa of bone, one arising from the distal fibula and one from the acetabulum. Both were treated by surgical excision and one also received adjuvant chemotherapy.
