The present report describes three cases of thoracic aortic endograft infolding or collapse involving the Gore TAG system. The cases include a penetrating aortic injury, a blunt aortic injury, and a symptomatic type B dissection. In the first case, infolding occurred in a delayed fashion after a normal-appearing 3-month follow-up computed tomographic angiogram. In the other two cases, infolding occurred during the immediate postoperative phase. One of the patients underwent explantation and surgical repair. The other two underwent endovascular repair of the infolded endograft by placement of a balloon-expandable stent in one case and a self-expanding stent in the other.
