Quantitative proton spectroscopic studies were performed on 39 volunteers and 16 patients with intracranial tumours. Estimates of T2 were obtained in white matter, grey matter, cerebellum, astrocytomas and meningiomas; T1 was determined in white matter only. White matter values of T2 for trimethylamines, creatine and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) were 309 +/- 84, 195 +/- 41 and 369 +/- 124 ms, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 20). Metabolite concentrations in white matter were 2.0 +/- 0.4 mumol/g wet weight for trimethylamines, 7.3 +/- 1.1 for creatine and 11.4 +/- 1.4 for NAA. The mean concentrations of creatine and NAA in grey matter and all of three metabolites in cerebellum were greater than those in white matter. Tumour spectra were characterized by increased trimethylamines, reduced creatine and NAA and occasionally the presence of lactate. Meningiomas were further characterized by the presence of alanine. The mean T2 and concentration of trimethylamines in tumours was significantly greater than in normal brain. Creatine and NAA concentrations were decreased in all tumours. The longer T2 of trimethylamines and presence of alanine in meningiomas indicate that important differences exist in membrane and glucose metabolism within these tumours when compared to either astrocytomas or normal brain tissue.
