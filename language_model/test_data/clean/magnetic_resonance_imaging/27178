Echocardiography is the first-line imaging modality for assessment of structural heart disease but magnetic resonance imaging and multi-detector computed tomography are being increasingly used for cardiac morphologic assessment. Aneurysms and diverticulae of the cardiac chambers and related structures represent a diverse group of conditions with varying etiologies and clinical manifestations. This article reviews the magnetic resonance imaging and multi-detector computed tomography features of these lesions with consideration of the emerging role that cross-sectional imaging has to play in their evaluation. Radiologists should be familiar with the salient imaging appearances of these conditions to facilitate optimal patient management.
