As MR imaging allows evaluation of soft-tissue structures not previously possible with imaging techniques, we undertook a preliminary study to evaluate the effects of a popular form of exercise (jogging) on the knee. The specific question prompting our investigation was, does repetitive impulse loading produced by jogging cause acute structural changes within the knee that are visible by MR imaging? The knees of 10 healthy subjects were examined on a 1.5-T MR system before and immediately after 30 min of continuous jogging. The same extremity was examined each time, and the imaging sequences and photographic technique (meniscal windows) were identical for both examinations. Effusions developed in five of 10 subjects after exercise. In addition, five of 10 subjects had subtle increased signal intensity within their menisci. These results suggest that jogging frequently leads to acute changes in the knee that are visible on MR imaging. The significance of these changes is unknown.
