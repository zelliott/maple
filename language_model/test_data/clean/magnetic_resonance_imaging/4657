In our study of 107 patients, for whom data derived from clinical functional analysis, axiography and, in part magnet resonance imaging, were present, we were able to show that in routine orthodontic diagnosis the use of panoramic X-ray in the normal course of a general examination of the mandibular joint can also provide important indications of the presence of cranio-mandibular disorders. The panoramic X-ray revealed that in patients with Angle class II and front deep and open bite there were significantly mor changes in the form of the condyles. A definite morphologic finding of a retracted fovea pterygoidea was found frequently in patients with anterior disk replacement with or without reduction. Lastly, the panoramic X-ray showed that a change in form of the condyles, with in some cases a serious arthrosis, occurs significantly most frequent in patients with anterior displacement without reduction.
