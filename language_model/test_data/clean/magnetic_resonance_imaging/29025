Pancreatic anomalies are occasionally reported, but complete agenesis of the dorsal pancreas is extremely rare. We report a 47-year-old woman with complete agenesis of the dorsal pancreas. This patient initially presented with jaundice. Computed tomography did not reveal the pancreatic corpus or tail. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not visualize the dorsal pancreatic duct. Choledochojejunostomy was performed because she had obstructive jaundice. At laparotomy, there was an enlarged pancreatic head, but no distal pancreas was seen. Histological examination of the pancreatic biopsy specimen showed scattered islets of Langerhans in diffuse fibrosis, with destruction of the glandular parenchyma. This case was diagnosed as complete agenesis of the dorsal pancreas.
