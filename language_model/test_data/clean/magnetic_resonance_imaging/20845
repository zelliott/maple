To describe clinicoradiologic characteristics of orbital sparganosis.

Retrospective case series.

We studied 8 patients diagnosed with orbital sparganosis at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center between 1999 and 2011.

A thorough review of clinical and imaging manifestations.

The primary clinical manifestations were redness and edema of the eyelids and conjunctivas (100%); proptosis (mild in 87.5% of cases and severe in 12.5%); subconjunctival yellow-white granulomatous lesions (75.0%); and migratory hyperemic masses of the eyelid or conjunctiva (50.0%). Of the patients, 6 had diffuse orbital or nodular masses on computed tomography imaging, 2 had the "tunnel sign" on magnetic resonance imaging, and 1 had subconjunctival tubular lesions on ultrasound biomicroscopy imaging.

Subconjunctival yellow-white granulomatous lesions, migratory hyperemic masses, and the tunnel sign on magnetic resonance imaging are characteristic clues to preoperative diagnosis of orbital sparganosis.
