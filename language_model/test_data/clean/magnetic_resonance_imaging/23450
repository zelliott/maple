Lymphomas are the most common primary orbital tumor in adults 60 years of age and older. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a distinct subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This case report describes a presentation of MCL with ocular involvement and discusses the management options.

A 63-year-old black male Vietnam veteran presented with symptoms of numbness of the right tooth and gum area with right maxillary facial pain, which he described as stabbing in nature. After extensive evaluation, the patient's symptoms were found to be caused by MCL of the right maxillary sinus invading the orbit. The lymphoma was treated successfully with a combination of high-dose corticosteroids and intensive chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Because of the aggressive nature of MCL, early detection and diagnosis are keys to the patient's survival. Given the potential for ocular involvement, eye care professionals play an important role in the early detection and management of these patients, ensuring that they are promptly referred to a specialist, e.g., an ophthalmologist or oncologist, for appropriate testing and treatment.
