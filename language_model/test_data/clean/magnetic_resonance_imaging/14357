The mechanics of the macrocirculation are examined as a basis for imaging blood flow within the system. The macrocirculation is defined as that part of the circulation in which inertial forces are not negligible compared to viscous forces and as such in human subjects comprises the heart and large blood vessels. Because the flow in the system is so complicated, understanding is built up piecemeal by considering various relatively well-characterized flows which can be seen as approximations to the actual flow.
