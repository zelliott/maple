Osteoarthritis of the knee joint can affect femoro-tibial as femoro-patellar compartments. It is a frequent and disabling location of the disease which may induce pain at motion and stiffness. Swelling of the knee is very frequent and synovial fluid is easy to puncture. Roentgenologically, the AP view, in standing position, with a 30 degree flexion is useful to depict mild narrowings of the femoro-tibial joint space. Knee is the main joint used for clinical trials in osteoarthritis because: 1. it is frequent location of the disease; 2. its handicap is relevant; 3. validated assessment criteria are available. As knee joint is superficial, femoro-tibial osteoarthritis may benefit by local treatments in addition to general usual management.
