We present a case history of a patient with multiple sclerosis who developed an abrupt onset of respiratory arrest associated with medullary lesion. A 27-year-old man developed shallow, totally irregular, ataxic respirations with aggravation of bulbar palsy and quadriplegia in the course of multiple sclerosis. As respiration was almost arrested, artificial respiration was started and continued for five days. Respiration was almost normal after 16 days from the onset of respiratory arrest. MRI showed bilateral, medullary lesions without upper cervical lesions. Pyramidal tracts, medial lemnisci, and paramedian reticular formations in medulla were damaged bilaterally. We supposed that the medullary lesions involved dual respiratory systems: a voluntary system and an automatic system, and caused acute respiratory arrest.
