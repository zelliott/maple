Recombinant human TNF-alpha was administrated intra-arterially to rats with transplanted intracerebral glioma. 1 x 10(6) of T9 rat glioma cells were transplanted into Fisher 344 rat brain stereotaxically and 1000 units of TNF-alpha was administrated at a rate of 100 microl/min. via an internal carotid artery 1 or 3 weeks after the transplantation. The effects of TNF-alpha were evaluated by MRI and histopathological examinations. Neurological symptoms, i.e. hemiparesis, appeared after 9.0 +/- 0.63 days and all rats died of tumor overloading 14.5 +/- 0.84 days after the transplantation. Single injection of TNF-alpha on 7th day after the transplantation induced regression of the tumor size in one of six rats. The tumors were detected 3 days after transplantation by MRI and they were revealed as low/iso intensity mass in T1WI, iso/high intensity in T2WI, and were enhanced by Gd-DTPA heterogeneously. On 7/14 days after the transplantation, the tumor grew approximately 7/10 mm in diameter. The single 1000 units of TNF-alpha were administrated via an internal carotid artery. 3 days after the administration of TNF-alpha, regression of the tumor size was seen in one of six rats and decrease of peritumoral edema was seen in three. These effects of TNF-alpha were, however, transient and they were not demonstrated on day 7. Single injection of TNF-alpha was not effective for large tumors more than 10 mm in diameter seen 14 days after the transplantation. These data suggest that intra-arterial TNF-alpha should be administrated at an early stage of the tumor growth and several injections are needed to cause regression in the size of the gliomas.
