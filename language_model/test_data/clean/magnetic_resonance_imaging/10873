The compact MRI for bone density measurements is a small-size MRI specially designed for the calcaneus by using a small permanent magnet. This system can measure a trabecular bone volume fraction (TBVF) for a clearly defined 3D region. The correlation coefficient (R(2)) between TBVF and QUS-SOS, and that between TBVF and DXA were about 0.29 for about 100 female subjects, and about 0.38 for about 20 subjects, respectively. This system will be especially useful for bone density measurements for children and young people.
