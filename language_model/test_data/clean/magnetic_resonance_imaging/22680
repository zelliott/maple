The purpose of this presentation is to show the imaging findings of the common and uncommon variants of adenomyosis as seen on sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

A 3-year database search was performed to identify women who had pelvic sonography and pelvic MRI within a 6-month interval. Images of these cases were retrospectively reviewed.

Eighty women were identified. Adenomyosis was diagnosed on MRI, which was used as the reference standard, in 45 of these women. The correct diagnosis was made on sonography in 73% of the cases.

Awareness of the spectrum of imaging features of adenomyosis is important to use sonography effectively for diagnosing this entity and to help avoid misdiagnosis.
