Paraganglioma are uncommon neuroendocrine tumours arising from extra-adrenal chromaffin cells of the autonomic nervous system. In the head and neck region, these neoplasms most commonly arise from the carotid body, the vagus nerve, and the jugulotympanic area. We present the case of a 69-year-old woman who suffered from dyspnoea and dysphonia for six months. A biopsy diagnosed a laryngeal haemangioma and a resection of the tumour was performed using supraglottic pharyngolaryngectomy. Definitive histopathological examination revealed a laryngeal paraganglioma. Laryngeal paraganglioma and haemangioma must be evoked when confronted with a submucosal vascular laryngeal tumour. In such cases biopsies should be avoided. Exhaustive imaging is a key factor in the diagnosis and should include an MRI and an arteriography in order to rule out other differential diagnoses. To our knowledge this is the first case focusing on this issue.
