Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) has been associated with degenerative changes in cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons in several brain regions. Since acetylcholine is colocalized with the neuropeptide galanin in certain neuronal populations, we measured the concentration of this neuropeptide and neuropeptide Y in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 11 patients with PSP and in 16 age-matched healthy controls. No significant alterations in the CSF levels of galanin or neuropeptide Y were found.
