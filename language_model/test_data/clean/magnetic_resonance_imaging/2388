The cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance image (MRI) studies of three Japanese encephalitis (JE) patients, 24 to 37 years of age, are reported. The initial findings of CT study were limited but initial MRI studies revealed multiple lesions involving the brainstem, basal ganglia and bilateral thalami. Follow-up MRI studies showed small residual lesions only. The result shows that MRI can delineate and detect brain lesions better than CT in patients in the acute stage of JE. The locations of lesions in MRI study are noteworthy and have a good correlation with pathologic anatomic distribution. Therefore, MRI study is helpful in early diagnosis of JE.
