Vertebral hemangioma is a relatively frequent but rarely symptomatic tumor. Physiologic changes during pregnancy may lead to spinal cord compression due to tumor expansion. We report a case of vertebral hemangioma during pregnancy: a 28-year-old woman, third trimester, third gestation, consulted for paraplegia of rapid onset; Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion of the 9th thoracic vertebra; a cesarean section was done, followed by laminectomy with partial symptom relief; pathology showed a benign vertebral hemangioma and treatment was completed with radiotherapy.
