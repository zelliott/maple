A 29-year-old woman with symptoms suggestive of trigeminal neuralgia is presented. Because of her age, an intracranial tumor was suspected, but images of a brain computerized tomography scan revealed nothing in particular. A magnetic resonance imaging was scheduled 2 weeks later. However, as the pain increased and occurred more frequently, the patient returned to the hospital 2 days later. After a stellate ganglion block with transient nausea and dizziness, the pain was noticeably relieved. Using magnetic resonance scanning, a tumor in the cerebellopontine angle was discovered, and at surgical resection was diagnosed as an epidermoid tumor. Stellate ganglion block may provide pain relief to some patients who are suspected to have symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia.
