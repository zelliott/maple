The authors report neuropsychological (NP) and serial quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of a 29-year-old woman with lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LG). Disease course was characterized by acute psychosis, tremor, fever, seizures, and progressive cognitive impairment. At the time of symptom onset, brain MRI revealed mild lesion volume and normal parenchymal volume. This was followed by dramatic progression of brain lesions and atrophy over 2 years, at which point the patient expired. Atrophy was most prominent in the mesial temporal lobes. NP testing revealed marked amnesia and mild impairments in other cognitive domains. To our knowledge, this is the first recorded case of LG in which bilateral temporal lobe atrophy is evident and accompanied by anterograde amnesia. We speculate that temporal lobe atrophy was influenced by the established susceptibility of this region in various neurological diseases.
