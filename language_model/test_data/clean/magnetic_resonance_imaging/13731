An unusual case of brachial plexopathy following alcohol-induced rhabdomyolysis is presented. The patient's rhabdomyolysis developed during sleep after an acute alcohol binge and there was no history of muscle trauma. It is thought that the brachial plexopathy developed due to direct compression of the plexus from swollen muscles of the shoulder girdle. The lack of similar reported cases despite the common clinical scenario of prolonged unconsciousness following excess alcohol intake suggests that other factors may be important in the development of muscle and nerve damage in susceptible individuals.
