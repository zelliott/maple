Evoked scalp potentials, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were used together to localize cortical activity evoked by visual stimuli in humans. The temporal resolution of evoked potential measurements is sufficient to track the flow of cortical activity which evolves in epochs of a few tens of msec. Spatial localization was enhanced by deconvolving scalp potential fields with a Laplacian operator. Markers glue to the scalp served to unify the three geometric reference frames into a single computer graphics database.
