Understanding the neural basis of adaptation (repetition suppression) is critical for interpreting fMRI-adaptation experiments. Sawamura and colleagues provide a critical stepping-stone by elucidating the relation between neural adaptation and response selectivity. They find some cross-adaptation by two different stimuli that activate the same neuron.
