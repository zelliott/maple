Although cabergoline is effective in the treatment of micro- and macro-prolactinoma, little is known about its efficacy in the treatment of invasive giant prolactinoma. We investigated the efficacy and safety of cabergoline in 10 male patients with invasive giant prolactinoma. Before treatment, mean serum prolactin level was 11,426 ng/mL (range, 1,450-33,200 ng/mL) and mean maximum tumor diameter was 51 mm (range, 40-77 mm). Three months after initiation of cabergoline treatment, serum prolactin concentrations decreased more than 97% in 9 patients; at last follow-up (mean treatment duration, 19 months), the mean decrease in serum prolactin concentrations was 98%, with 5 patients having normal serum prolactin levels. At first MRI follow-up (3-12 months after initiation of cabergoline), the mean reduction in tumor size was 85+/-4% (range, 57-98%). Cabergoline treatment for more than 12 months caused a greater reduction in tumor size compared to the treatment for less than 12 months (97+/-1% vs. 78+/-7%, P<0.05). These findings indicate that cabergoline treatment led to a significant and rapid reduction in serum prolactin concentrations and tumor size in patients with giant prolactinoma. Therefore, cabergoline represents an effective and well-tolerated treatment for invasive giant prolactinoma.
