To explore the geomorphological performance, the characteristics of volume, and the largest signal intension of blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) in brain tumors located in or closed to the central area.

We recruited 13 normal volunteers and 31(13 benign tumors and 18 malignant tumors) patients with brain tumor located in or closed to the central area, to examine both side hand motor and tactile function by BOLD-fMRI and obtained the activation map and its superposition image with T1 imaging, the volume, and the largest signal intension of the functional area by SPM software which manipulated the raw data in the off-line work station. The volume and the largest signal intension data of the functional area were statistically analyzed by SPSS 13.0.

The volume and the largest signal intension of the activation map in the normal functional area had hemisphere advantage. There was difference in the activated signal pixel number and the largest signal intension of the functional area between the benign brain tumors, malignant brain tumors, and the normal volunteers (P < 0.05). The shape, anatomic location, the volume, and the largest signal intension of the functional area were changed in the patients with brain tumors.

BOLD-fMRI is a valid method to assess the pre-surgical risk of patients with brain tumors, which can get the volume, the largest signal intension, the basic shape,and the anatomic location of the functional area.
