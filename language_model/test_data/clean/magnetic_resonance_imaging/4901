Breast leukemia is extremely rare. The published data on this manifestation include predominantly case reports and do not provide any statistical information.

To identify clinical signs and radiological features of breast leukemia.

PubMed and Medline databases between 1980 and 2010 were screened using 'breast leukemia' and 'leukemia of the breast' as keywords. Secondary references were also reviewed. By this search, a total of 139 patients were identified from the literature.

In most patients (n = 85, 61.2%) acute myeloid leukemia was diagnosed. Acute lymphatic leukemia occurred in 35 patients (25.2%). Isolated BL before bone marrow infiltration was seen in 24 patients (17.3%). Involvement of the breast during the course of leukemia was diagnosed in 25 cases (18%). Intramammary leukemic relapse after therapy/stem cell transplantation occurred in 59 patients (42.4%). In 71 cases (51.1%) the lesions were solitary and in 57 (41%) multiple. The number of lesions was not reported in 11 patients (7.9%). There was no significant difference between the number of lesions in ML and LL. Clinically, 73% of the patients presented with palpable breast masses. Most of them were painless. Mammography was performed in 39 patients, allowing the identification of the following three mammographic patterns: breast masses (28 patients, 72%), architectural distortion (5 patients, 13%), no abnormalities (6 patients, 15%). On ultrasound, most identified masses were homogeneously hypoechoic with microlobulated or indistinct margins. On MRI, on T2-weighted images breast lesions were hyperintense. After venous administration of contrast medium, BL showed marked inhomogeneous contrast enhancement. Treatment of BL is the same as for other localizations and is based on chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

In the present study the clinical and radiological features of BL are described. They are non-specific. However, BL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of breast disorders, especially in patients with leukemia.
