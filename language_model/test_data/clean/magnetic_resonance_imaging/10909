Molecular biology and genomic sciences are revealing the early biological signatures for many diseases. In response, the Molecular Imaging community is rapidly developing contrast agents to visualize the nascent pathological changes and to concomitantly deliver treatment directly to the site of disease. The evaluation, development and use of these new agents require a complementary understanding of contrast chemistry and imaging techniques. The fundamental issues surrounding magnetic contrast agent development, rational drug delivery, MR molecular imaging, and their interdependence are elucidated.
