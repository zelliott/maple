Estimates of auditory cortex ablation sizes in a rodent model as derived from classical histology (volume reconstructions from Nissl-stained brain sections) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (T1-weighted whole-brain scans from a 4.7 T animal scanner) were compared in the same specimens (Mongolian gerbils). Estimates of lesion volumes obtained with the two methods were very similar, robust, highly correlated and not significantly different from each other. Hence, the general usefulness of structural MRI for the determination of brain lesion size in small animal models is demonstrated. MRI therefore seems to be well suited to determine proper size and location of an experimental brain ablation prior to (potentially extensive) behavioral testing.
