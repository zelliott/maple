Atrophy demarcating to musculus teres minor is seen in magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder region in 3 to 5.5% of investigations. We describe seven patients with prolonged or recurrent pain of the shoulder region, who were diagnosed in ENMG with damage of the axillary nerve brand to m. teres minor. Probable causes included tear of the rotator cuff, luxation of the shoulder joint, nerve entrapment in the quadrilateral space, neuritis of the brachial plexus and iatrogenic damage associated with shoulder arthroscopy. This nerve damage cannot be proved clinically.
