We aimed to compare the extent of inter-observer variability in the description of seizure semiology between both neurologists and caregivers.

We prospectively investigated 93 consecutive patients monitored over the past 5 years in our video-EEG unit. The videotaped seizures of the patients were reviewed independently by two neurologists who were blind to the clinical data. The questionnaires were completed by neurologists and caregivers. Interobserver rate of agreement between neurologists and caregivers was analyzed by using the kappa analysis and intraclass correlation coefficients.

There was excellent agreement for questions regarding whether the patient's eyes remained open, laterality of head deviation, arm movements, and ictal period. On the other hand, interobserver rate of agreement was fair to moderate for the laterality of hand automatisms, the presence of nose-wiping, and oral clonic jerks.

Besides variability in interobserver agreement among clinicians, the variability or concordance between physicians and caregivers are also of great importance, especially in case of epilepsy, where the accurate description of the attacks is the major determinant of an accurate diagnosis.
