The flow (Q) through regurgitant valves may be quantified by multiplying the area of an isovelocity contour (isovel) by its velocity. This was tested computationally and experimentally (using MRI). Q = 14 to 141 ml/s, using flat and conical orifice plates. Plotting Q versus isovelocity radius, a plateau was found which, for low flow, corresponded to the true Q. At higher flow or large confinement, Q was overestimated. For conical plates, angle correction worked at low Q but not at higher values due to the formation of separation regions. These converted the cone plate into a flat plate. MRI produced similar results at 57 ml/s in that Q was correct with no angle correction. At low flow, MRI was too noisy to produce a clear plateau consistently.
