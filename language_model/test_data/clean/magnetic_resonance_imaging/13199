A clinical-neuropsychological study using Luria's method has been conducted in 13 patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and 12 patients with cerebellar cavernomas and hematomas. The syndromes were similar to lesions of the large hemisphere cortex, more often of premoter regions and less often of the cortex of posterior hemispheric regions. After a surgery on the right cerebellar hemisphere, some patients had perseverations and micrographia in writing. These syndromes were principal similar with findings described in the literature. However there were differences including the absence of marked cognitive disturbances even after the surgery. The disturbances of verbal memory were found in the lesion of both right and left cerebellar hemispheres that is the functional asymmetry of cerebellar hemispheres was not pronounced. The inactivity of speech and agrammatism in writing, even in patients with large duration of hemorrhage, were not observed. In some patients with the lesion of right cerebellar hemisphere, the disinhibition of speech, similar to that in patients with the lesion of right frontal lobe, was found. There were no marked mental disturbances. The most distinct cognitive disturbances were found after surgeries of the superior cerebellar artery. Possible mechanisms of the cerebellum's role in cognitive functions are discussed.
