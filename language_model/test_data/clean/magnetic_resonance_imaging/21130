In this article, a novel multimodal medical image fusion (MIF) method based on non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) and pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) is presented. The proposed MIF scheme exploits the advantages of both the NSCT and the PCNN to obtain better fusion results. The source medical images are first decomposed by NSCT. The low-frequency subbands (LFSs) are fused using the 'max selection' rule. For fusing the high-frequency subbands (HFSs), a PCNN model is utilized. Modified spatial frequency in NSCT domain is input to motivate the PCNN, and coefficients in NSCT domain with large firing times are selected as coefficients of the fused image. Finally, inverse NSCT (INSCT) is applied to get the fused image. Subjective as well as objective analysis of the results and comparisons with state-of-the-art MIF techniques show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in fusing multimodal medical images.
