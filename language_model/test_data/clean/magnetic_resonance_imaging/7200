The trifunctional aziridine XAMA-7 (CAS 57116-45-7) has been used to form crosslinks between a deep red-violet copper cluster of the type Cu(I)8Cu(II)6pen12Cl5- (pen=penicillamine) and molecules with biological activity such as d-biotin and proteins. A complex containing biotin, bovine serum albumin and the copper cluster displayed activity toward affinity columns of avidin on Agarose, and the red-violet pigment was immobilized on the gel. This interaction was completely blocked in gels which had been pretreated with d-biotin carboxylic acid. The free and biologically active versions of the cluster have some potential for biomedical applications. For example, the short-lived positron emitter 64Cu (suitable for positron tomography) may be carried in the cluster's structure. The cluster is paramagnetic, but it is a relatively weak effector of water proton spin-lattice relaxation. Other members of this structural group of inorganic compounds may have better magnetic properties, and the crosslinking reaction with aziridines appears to be generally applicable to the group.
