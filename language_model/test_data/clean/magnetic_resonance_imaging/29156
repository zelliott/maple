We report four patients with Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinaemia with an unusual neurologic complication, neurolymphomatosis, characterized by meningeal and root nerve infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells. Patients presented with rapidly progressive leg proximal weakness. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid disclosed lymphoplasmacytic cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine was suggestive of a tissular infiltration of leptomeninges and nerve roots. Chemotherapy and irradiation of involved tissues led to a remarkable and sustained neurological improvement.
