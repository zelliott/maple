Characterizing osteochondral lesions of the talus has enabled the strategies of surgical management to be better specified. The main technical problem is one of access for arthroscopy instruments to posteromedial lesions. A range of techniques and approaches has been described in ankle arthroscopy in general, and a transmalleolar approach provides reliable and efficient access in these cases. It is frequently used for transchondral drilling, but also enables satisfactory implant positioning in autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty procedures. We report our technique and results on five cases with a minimum 1.2 years' follow-up.
