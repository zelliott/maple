The authors determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during acute hospitalization for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) provides new diagnostic information. ICD-9 codes were used to identify consecutive patients with spontaneous ICH at Hermann Hospital, Houston, Texas, between January 1995 and August, 1997. Two investigators employed rigorous criteria to determine whether the MRI findings led to a specific new diagnosis. Two hundred ninety-one patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sixty-seven (23%) patients underwent brain MRI during the acute hospitalization. MRI provided a new diagnosis in 15 of these 67 patients (22%). Amyloid angiopathy and vascular malformation (four each) were the most frequently identified etiologies. The yield of MRI was low in basal ganglia and thalamic hemorrhage. Two of 23 (9%) patients with deep ICH and 13 of 44 (30%) patients with lobar and infratentorial hemorrhage had etiology determined by MRI. Timing of MRI did not affect yield.
