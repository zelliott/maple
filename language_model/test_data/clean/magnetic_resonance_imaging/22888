Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEDH) is rare in children below the age of 2 years. It can produce rapidly progressive neurological deficits.

The authors report a case of SSEDH in a 15-month-old boy diagnosed by MRI. Suspension laminotomy and evacuation of the clot were done 48 h after the onset of symptoms. The patient made excellent neurological recovery. Computed tomography (CT) and MRI scanning carried out 6 months after surgery revealed good fusion of the laminotomy. A brief review of relevant literature is presented.

Although rare SSEDH requires immediate surgical decompression to avoid any permanent neurological deficit. Reconstructive surgical procedures like laminotomy are preferred in children where the incidence of spinal deformity is high following laminectomy.
