The purpose of this study was to describe the MRI appearance of stress reaction in the distal humerus in 12 elite tennis players. In addition, we aimed to determine whether any MRI findings were associated with changes in recovery times.

Stress injury to the distal humerus is a cause of chronic arm pain among elite tennis players and may be exacerbated during full competition. The degree of marrow edema on STIR MRI may be predictive of time to return to competition.
