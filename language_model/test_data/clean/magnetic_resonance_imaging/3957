The authors present a documented sporadic de novo cavernous malformation of the central nervous system (CNS) in a patient undergoing follow-up magnetic resonance imaging after resection of an acoustic neuroma. The authors believe that this is the first report of a de novo cavernous malformation in a patient without a familial history of this disease or a history of treatment with cranial radiation. The occurrence of de novo lesions invalidates the common assumption that cavernous malformations are congenital lesions. The use of this assumption to calculate bleeding risks retrospectively in patients with cavernous malformations is likely to underestimate the risk of symptomatic hemorrhage significantly. Consequently, the de novo formation of cavernous malformations may be more common than appreciated and may explain the higher bleeding rates reported in prospective compared with retrospective studies of these lesions.
