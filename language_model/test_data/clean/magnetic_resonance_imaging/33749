Potentially, imaging of the carpal tunnel may expand our understanding of the pathogenesis of CTS. Future studies should correlate imaging results with the patients' clinical status and results of electrodiagnostic tests. Canal pressure studies are not clinically routine, but a research study correlating canal pressure with canal appearance might be of interest. The diagnostic accuracy of imaging studies needs further clinical validation. Currently, it is premature to promote or advertise carpal tunnel imaging as a diagnostic modality for CTS.
