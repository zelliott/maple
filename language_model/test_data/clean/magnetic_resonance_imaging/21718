A patient with MS demonstrated a striking callosal disconnection syndrome. MRI revealed callosal atrophy and extensive bilateral white matter changes. Of 15 comparison patients with clinically definite MS, only one had minimal callosal disconnection. Callosal disconnection in MS may be due to pathology of the corpus callosum as well as extensive white matter disease.
