A 3-year-old Japanese domestic cat with a diagnosis of lymphocytic leukemia showed severe generalized seizures in the course of chemotherapy after leukemic condition was improved clinically. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain were carried out. Both contrast procedures disclosed enhancements at the falx cerebri and the margin of cerebral cortex. Among these procedures contrast MR imaging demonstrated the lesion most clearly. Cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid obtained by spinal puncture showed the infiltration of malignant cells and the diagnosis of meningeal syndrome associated with lymphocytic leukemia was defined. Intrathecal administration of cytosine arabinoside partially improved the neurologic dysfunction. Autopsy and histopathological examination confirmed the infiltration of leukemic cells in the areas of meningeal lesion demonstrated with contrast CT and MR imaging. Thus these imaging techniques, especially contrast MR imaging, are useful tools for rapid and precise diagnosis of meningeal syndrome.
