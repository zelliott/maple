Primary synovial chondromatosis is a rare and usually monarticular disease. It may recur, but the tendency to malignant transformation is very low. The differentiation from low-grade chondrosarcoma can be difficult. We present the case of a 67-year-old man with synovial chondromatosis in the metacarpophalangeal joint of the right thumb which is quite an uncommon localisation.
