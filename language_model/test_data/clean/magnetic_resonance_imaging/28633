Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) techniques sensitive to the local changes in blood flow, volume and oxygenation accompanying neuronal activation are powerful tools to investigate the human brain function. Experiments were performed on 10 right-handed healthy volunteers (age range: 20-39 years), using a 1.5 T whole-body MRI system. Two oblique contiguous planes were investigated along the central sulcus of the left hemisphere. Functional images were acquired using a Gradient Echo sequence while the subjects repetitively performed sequential finger to thumb opposition movements of the right hand or mental imagery of a visual scene. Twelve images for each task were obtained over a 6-min experimental period; they were then analyzed with the software provided by the manufacturer. In all the subjects small areas were activated in both the precentral and postcentral gyrus, mean percentage signal increases during finger movement being 10.7% and 3.8%, respectively. These values are fairly higher than literature ones. However several factors, such as voxel volume, are involved in determining the measured signal increase during activation. Moreover, in most cases the software procedures provided with the MR equipment to analyze the functional images imply subjective choices. It is thus necessary to implement new software packages for the analysis of fMRI images to apply more appropriate statistical procedures and to obtain more homogeneous and objective final information.
