Whereas the transcranial approach has been regarded as the therapy of choice for transethmoidal encephalocele, its feasibility for transsphenoidal encephalocele has remained controversial, particularly in neonates and infants.

Two cases of transsphenoidal encephalocele operated transcranially are presented. In the first case, this 6-year-old boy underwent a transpalatal operation with repair of a cleft palate in another hospital before admission. Reoperation via the transcranial route was carried out because of postoperative recurrent meningitis. With partial resection of the anterior wall, the encephalocele could be separated from the underlying tissue, and the interspace was filled with the pericranial flap. He made an uneventful recovery and has been well for the past 3 years. The second was a 3-month-old baby with a large encephalocele filling the nasopharyngeal space. As the cleft palate was absent, the transcranial approach was employed. In this case, the herniated tissue was excised at the lowest level possible. Postoperatively, panhypopituitarism became manifest. Re-evaluation of the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed a small mass far below the dorsum sellae, which turned out to be an anomalous pituitary gland on histologic examination.

The transcranial approach is considered a valid alternative for the therapy of transsphenoidal encephalocele, particularly when the transpalatal approach is unfeasible. While the anterior wall of the herniated sac may be safely resected, the posterior wall should under no circumstances be sacrificed. The preoperative MRI is essential, as it may provide valuable information as to the location of vital structures within the herniated tissue.
