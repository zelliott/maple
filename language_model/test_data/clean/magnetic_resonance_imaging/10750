Percutaneous sclerotherapy of orbital low-flow vascular malformations requires precise procedural guidance. For the treatment of a patient with an orbital venolymphatic malformation, we sought to optimize guidance by combining navigation assistance for needle placement with intralesional contrast medium injection for assessment of venous drainage. By using a surgical navigation system (Vector Vision, BrainLAB, Munich, Germany), multiplanar target lesion visualization was performed after fusion of CT and MR imaging data, which allowed precise puncture planning.
