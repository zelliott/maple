The bulk biodistribution of a trifluorinated neuroleptic (fluphenazine) was studied using 19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fifteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with fluphenazine (120 mg/kg) and scanned in a G.E. CSI 2.0 tesla MRI system. The rats were killed following scanning and the brains were removed. The excised brains were then scanned using 1H and 19F MR techniques. The fluorinated neuroleptic was imaged at the injection site, spectroscopically detected in vivo in the head, and spectroscopically localized in the whole brain. These data suggest that in vivo 19F MRI of fluorinated agents is possible and could have clinical and research applications to the neurosciences.
