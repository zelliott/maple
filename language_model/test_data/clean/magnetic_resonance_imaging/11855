Accurate co-registration of MRI and EEG data is indispensable for the correct interpretation of EEG maps or source localizations in relation to brain anatomy derived from MRI. In this study, a method for the co-registration of EEG and MRI data is presented. The method consists of an iterative matching of EEG-electrode based reconstructions of the scalp surface to scalp-segmented MRIs. EEG-electrode based surface reconstruction is achieved via spline interpolation of individually digitized 3D-electrode coordinates. In contrast to other approaches, neither fiducial determination nor any additional provisions (such as bite bars, other co-registration devices or head shape digitization) are required, and co-registration errors associated with inaccurate fiducial determination are avoided. The accuracy of the method was estimated by calculating the root-mean-square (RMS) deviation of spline interpolated and MRI-segmented surface reconstructions in 20 subjects. In addition, the distance between co-registered and genuine electrode coordinates was assessed via a simulation study, in which surface reconstruction was based on virtual electrodes determined on the scalp surface of a high-resolution MRI data set. The mean RMS deviation of surface reconstructions was 2.43 mm, and the maximal distance between any two matched surface points was 5.06 mm. The simulated co-registration revealed a mean deviation of genuine and co-registered electrode coordinates of 0.61 mm. It is concluded that surface matching using spline interpolated reconstructions of scalp surfaces is a precise and highly practicable method to co-register EEG and MRI data.
