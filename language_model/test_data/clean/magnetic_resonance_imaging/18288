From October 1985 to February 1992, we performed 80 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty procedures (PTA) in 76 patients with Coarctation of the Aorta (CoAo). Twenty eight patients (aged 2.6 to 62 years; mean, 11.4) underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) during the follow-up period, 2 to 60 months (m = 16) after dilation. Three of these patients were also studied before PTA. We found mild residual coarctation in 11, minimal irregularities in the aorta in five and excellent results in twelve cases. No aneurysms were found. In those patients that underwent MRI before the angioplasty was possible to choose the balloon, thus reducing the time during dilatation. In conclusion we believe that MRI is an excellent and well suited alternative for the serial studies in patients with CoAo, before PTA and in the follow-up.
