Enterouterine fistulae are rare and nowadays are most commonly due to pelvic tumours. We review the literature and present the case of a woman who presented with an ileouterine fistula following surgery and radiotherapy for recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma. The presence of tumour within the fistula track may also have been a significant aetiological factor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent method to demonstrate the site and size of the track and has not, to date, been used to identify such a fistula.
