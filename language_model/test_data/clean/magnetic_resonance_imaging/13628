The correlations between the size of corpus callosum and the inter- and intra-hemispheric EEG coherence and the spatial EEG synchronization during finger and shoulder movements were analyzed in nine right-handed men. The cross-sectional surface areas of corpus callosum (CC) and of seven callosal regions were measured from the mid-sagittal slice of the anatomical MRI. Movement-related coherence between pairs of EEG electrodes overlying the central and parietal regions of both hemispheres was computed after spatially filtering EEG data by the Laplacian operator method. The spatial EEG synchronization was evaluated using omega-complexity, a novel measure which quantifies the number of independent sources of spontaneous EEG oscillations. The amplitude of coherence between the left and right S1/M1 areas after movement onset in the lower alpha band (7.8-9.8 Hz) correlated with the size of the callosal body in both types of movement. The size of the callosal body also correlated with the C3-Cz coherence in the 15.6-19.5 Hz band in finger movement, and in the 15.6-23.5 Hz band in shoulder movements. The size of the rostral, anterior intermediate and posterior intermediate truncus of CC correlated with omega-complexity in both types of movements indicating more foci of synchronized EEG oscillations in subjects with a large callosal truncus. The results suggest that the size of callosal truncus which is known to connect the primary sensorimotor and the supplementary motor areas of both hemispheres contributes to the coupling of EEG oscillations during voluntary finger and shoulder movements.
