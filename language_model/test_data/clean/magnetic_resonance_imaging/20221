To determine if myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) mRNA is related to clinical disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS).

Baseline MxA mRNA levels were measured in a prospective cohort of 116 untreated patients with early MS and were related to clinical relapses and MRI at baseline and at follow-up.

Low levels of MxA mRNA were associated with the occurrence of relapses (p = 0.002) and contrast-enhancing lesions (CELs) on baseline MRI (p = 0.045). In addition, high baseline MxA mRNA levels were related to a longer time to a first new relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35-1.00; p = 0.044). Adding the absence of CELs to high MxA mRNA, the predictive value increased (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.17-0.74; p = 0.006), clearly showing a cumulative value for combining both factors.

MxA mRNA is related to clinical exacerbations, the number of CELs on MRI, and is indicative for the time to a subsequent relapse. If confirmed, MxA mRNA has potential as a biomarker for clinical disease activity in MS.
