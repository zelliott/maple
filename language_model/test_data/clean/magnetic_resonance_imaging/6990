The purpose of this study was to evaluate anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) impingement against the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) with the knee in an extended position, which arthroscopy cannot detect.

Ten normal knees and 30 ACL-reconstructed knees were assessed using MR imaging. The three-dimensional reconstruction of the ACL, PCL, femur and tibia were carried out using commercially available three-dimensional reconstruction software. Anterior cruciate ligament impingement against the PCL was graded into three categories: Grade 1, some space between the ligaments; Grade 2, no space between the ligaments, and the reconstructed ACL ran straight; and Grade 3, the reconstructed ACL did not run straight. The angle of the reconstructed ACL against the tibial plateau was also measured.

All normal knees were classified as Grade 1. The 30 reconstructed knees were classified as follows: Grade 1, 12 cases; Grade 2, 7 cases; and Grade 3, 11 cases. The mean angle of the Grade 3 reconstructed ACL knees was significantly more vertical against the tibia as compared with the Grade 1 knees (P<.05). The postoperative KT-2000 side-to-side difference of the Grade 3 knees (2.8+/-4.5 mm) was larger than that of the Grade 1 knees (0.2+/-1.7 mm) and Grade 2 knees (-0.6+/-2.2 mm), but no statistically significant difference could be detected between the three groups in the postoperative KT-2000 data.

This method is useful to evaluate ACL impingement against PCL, which cannot be detected by conventional arthroscopy during the operation. The surgeon should pay careful attention to the coronal angle of the reconstructed ACL.
