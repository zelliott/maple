MR imaging of subtle fractures and bone contusions is described with emphasis placed on those types of fractures frequently associated with specific patterns of soft tissue injury. Soft tissue injuries are divided into ligamentous, meniscal, and muscular; each is discussed separately. The MR imaging appearance of these lesions is explained.
