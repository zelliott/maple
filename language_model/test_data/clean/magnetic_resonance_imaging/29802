Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a benign proliferative disorder primarily occurring in the large joints of the appendicular skeleton such as the knee and hip joints. We present an unusual case of PVNS involving the cervical spine in an adult. MR imaging showed an enhancing mass lesion arising from the posterior elements of the cervical spine and hyperintensity on the T2-weighted images, without evidence of T2 susceptibility effects. Gross total excision of the tumor was performed, and the diagnosis was established by histopathology.
