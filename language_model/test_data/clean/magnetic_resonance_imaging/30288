We present a case of plasma cell predominant lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningioma with numerous crystalline inclusions. A 72-year-old woman presented with 1-year history of memory disturbance and an MRI revealing a right frontal extra-axial mass. Histology showed a benign meningioma with multifocal accumulation of numerous large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, filled with lamellar inclusions and bipyramidal crystals. In addition, some classic plasma cells, mastocytes and lymphocytes were also detected. The crystal-containing cells were positive by CD79a and PGM1 and expressed polyclonal light chains, with kappa predominance. Electron microscopy showed crystals with needle or rectangular shape in plasma cells. Plasma cell inclusions have been reported occasionally in reactive inflammatory lesions but more frequently in plasma cell tumors and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, maybe associated with crystal-storing histiocytosis. Although plasma cell predominant lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningioma is not uncommon, to our knowledge, similar crystalline inclusions in plasma cells have not been reported previously in meningioma.
