Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RTK) is a rare and highly malignant neoplasm of infancy, with a strong tendency for early metastasis to distant regions. RTK is unique in its significant association with primary or metastatic brain tumors. The authors report the first case of RTK presenting initially with hemiplegia. The patient was found thereafter to have RTK concurrent with pulmonary metastases, a brain tumor, and a cerebral ischemic lesion. Intensive chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and etoposide alternating with cyclophosphamide was unsuccessful and the patient died 5 months later because of severe respiratory distress resulting from widespread pulmonary metastases.
