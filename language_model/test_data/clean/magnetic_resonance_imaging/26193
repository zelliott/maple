The purpose of the study was to assess global and regional myocardial function of the right ventricle (RV) with the use of phase contrast (PC) velocity mapping in patients after acute myocardial infarction. We examined 8 patients after acute myocardial wall infarction and 10 healthy volunteers for comparison. PC velocity mapping was performed in a single midventricular short-axis slice with velocity encoding in three different directions. RV displacement during systole in the through-plane direction differed significantly between patients and volunteers (P = 0.009). RV myocardial velocity in the through-plane and radial directions, evaluated at time of peak ejection rate, was significantly lower in patients than in healthy volunteers (P<0.05). RV abnormalities may be detected in patients after acute myocardial infarction using PC velocity mapping with velocity encoding in three different directions. Owing to their short acquisition times and relatively easy postprocessing, PC techniques are time-efficient and promising tools for the evaluation of RV function.
