Seventeen patients with cervical spinal cord cavities were studied with myelography, postmyelographic computed tomography scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging. The three diagnostic techniques were compared for accuracy, patient comfort, and ease of procedure. Magnetic resonance imaging was the best diagnostic and most comfortable procedure. There is no need for myelography or postmyelographic computed tomography scanning for the evaluation of cervical syringomyelia.
