Reports of multiple primary cancers are increasing, but simultaneous primary cancers are not frequently reported especially originated in the same organ. We encountered a 71-year-old female who had two simultaneous carcinomas at both edges of the tongue. Histologically, the carcinoma of the right edge was a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, while that on the left edge was a moderately-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. No other tumors were detected on other examinations, including gallium-67 scintigraphy, CT scan of the chest, upper gastrointestinal fiberscopy and so on. She underwent surgical treatment without other induction treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Her postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy were also uneventful because of her age. Fourteen-month follow-up revealed neither recurrence nor metastasis.
