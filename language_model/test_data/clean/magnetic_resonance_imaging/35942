Eight patients with intracranial tuberculomas were studied with CT and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Large, ring enhancing, solid lesions on CT showed low intensity on T2-weighted images and intermediate intensity on T1-weighted images. Small lesions, with ring enhancement on CT, showed central bright signal on T2-weighted images with a peripheral low intensity rim surrounded by high intensity edema. The MR imaging features of the tuberculomas were found to be distinct from those of abscesses, metastases, and gliomas.
