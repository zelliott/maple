Magnetic resonance (MR), computed tomographic and radiographic imaging were conducted in a dog with discospondylitis. The MR findings were increased T2 and decreased T1 signal intensity of the soft tissues ventral to vertebral bodies, the end plates of the same vertebral bodies and the intervertebral disc, and are similar to those described in human with discospondylitis.
