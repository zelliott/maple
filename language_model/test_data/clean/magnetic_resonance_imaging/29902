Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is often a position-dependent condition that is aggravated in extension and relieved in flexion.

Ten consecutive elderly patients with LSS were assessed postoperatively by magnetic resonance imaging and the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire. Cross-sectional areas of the dural sac and intervertebral foramina at the stenotic level were measured postoperatively and compared with the preoperative values.

Postoperatively the cross-sectional area of the dural sac increased 16.6 mm2 or 22.3% and intervertebral foramina increased 22 mm2 or 36.5%. The intervertebral angle and the posterior disc height changed significantly. Seventy percent of the patients were satisfied with the surgical outcome.

This new surgical method is effective in elderly LSS patients.
