The association of central nervous system neoplasms in neurofibromatosis is common and children are at particular risk. Recent advances in neurodiagnostic techniques allow for non-invasive detection of these tumors, and often these tumors are found in asymptomatic patients. Due to the diversity of neoplasms, varying grades of malignancy, variable growth patterns, and the occupancy of non-neoplastic hamartomatous lesions, the clinician often has difficulty determining which patient should have a diagnostic biopsy or resection, or if therapy should be started without pathologic confirmation. Following a review of the neuroradiology and more common intracranial tumors, recommendations regarding management are proposed.
