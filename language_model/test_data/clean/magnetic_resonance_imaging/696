The relationship between neural activity and accompanying changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygenation must be fully understood before data from brain imaging techniques can be correctly interpreted. Whether signals in fMRI reflect the neural input or output of an activated region is still unclear. Similarly, quantitative relationships between neural activity and changes in CBF are not well understood. The present study addresses these issues by using simultaneous laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) to measure CBF and multichannel electrophysiology to record neural activity in the form of field potentials and multiunit spiking. We demonstrate that CBF-activation coupling is a nonlinear inverse sigmoid function. Comparing the data with previous work suggests that within a cortical model, CBF shows greatest spatial correlation with a current sink 500 microm below the surface corresponding to sensory input. These results show that care must be exercised when interpreting imaging data elicited by particularly strong or weak stimuli and that hemodynamic changes may better reflect the input to a region rather than its spiking output.
