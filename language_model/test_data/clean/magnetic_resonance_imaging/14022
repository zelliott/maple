Vascular anomalies in the head and neck area are not infrequent and, in most cases, are congenital in origin. We present a congenital arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the neck that manifested in a young woman during delivery. Imaging findings on ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and angiography were inconclusive and the diagnosis was reached by magnetic resonance imaging. A total excision of the mass was performed.
