Injury of salivary gland tissue in the head and neck, as the result of extensive trauma, can often be overlooked on initial examination. In two case reports, the primary treatment and further follow-up of injuries of the head resulting in a parotid-maxillary sinus fistula as well as a fistula between the skin and sublingual gland are illustrated. The successful use of botulinum toxin in the treatment of traumatic salivary gland fistulas is documented in both cases. Alternative diagnostic and treatment measures of salivary gland fistulas are discussed. Surgical repair of salivary fistulas as primary treatment should be carefully considered. Treatment of a salivary fistula with the injection of botulinum toxin is possibly advantageous compared to spontaneous fistula closure. The injection of botulinum toxin shortens fistula closure time, is minimally invasive, effective and tolerable for the patient.
