A presacral, degenerative schwannoma ("ancient schwannoma") is a rare entity. The clinical signs are nonspecific, and a reliable preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Tumor heterogeneity with calcifications may be seen in degenerated schwannomas on MRI or CT but not necessarily. First-line treatment is complete surgical excision. We present the case of a 44-year-old male who required surgery for a presacral mass. Histopathological examination revealed the diagnosis of a schwannoma with degenerated areas.
