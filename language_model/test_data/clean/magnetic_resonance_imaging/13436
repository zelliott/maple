Thirty-five women were examined with female pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 5 cases demonstrated normal pelvis structures, 3 had physiological atrophic changes, and one had an underdeveloped uterus. The other 26 cases consisted of 8 leiomyoma of uterus, 11 ovarian benign tumor, 3 ovarian cancer, 2 cervical and 2 endometrial carcinoma. Images of normal uterus as well as those pathological conditions mentioned above were depicted, and compared with the operative findings. By means of MRI, we were able to demonstrate the origin of most of the pelvic masses, number, size and location of leiomyoma, myometrial penetration, parametrial extension and lymph node metastasis of endometrial carcinoma. Cervical malignancy could be accurately staged, and serous cyst was possibly distinguished from hemorrhagic cyst. However, one case of mucinous cystadenoma was misdiagnosed as dermoid cyst; one myoma, 1 cm in diameter, in same density as the uterine muscle was overlooked and one mesonephroma of 0.3 cm in diameter situated deep in the cervical fibrous tissue was not detected.
