Plain film radiographs represent the imaging of choice for the initial evaluation of pathologies of the hip. However, many lesions of the joint itself and surrounding soft tissues are often not visualized by conventional radiographs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates most of these pathologies with high sensitivity and specificity. For further assessment of intra-articular lesions such as labral tears, hyaline cartilage lesions, rupture of the ligamentum teres, and loose bodies, direct MR arthrography after intra-articular administration of contrast medium may be indicated. This article summarizes the technical aspects and the most important indications for MRI and MR arthrography of the hip in correlation with typical imaging findings of the most frequent pathologies.
