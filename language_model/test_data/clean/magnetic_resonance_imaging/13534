Black blood single shot FSE sequences (Nffse) employ 180 degrees RF refocalisation pulses preceded by an inversion RF double pulse associated to presaturation pulses. The latter produce signal void of the external volume, and possible reduction of the field of view without wrap-around artifacts along the phase coding direction. The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic possibilities of the Nffse sequences with those of conventional SE study of cardiac morphology.

Twenty-five patients (19 males and 9 females with age ranging from 20 to 54 years) presented findings suggesting right ventricular arrhythmogenic dysplasia. MR examinations were performed with a 1,5 T unit (GE Signa Horizon Echospeed 8.3, Milwaukee, USA) and Torso Phased Array coil positioned at thoracic level. The morphologic study was performed with SE multiphase-multislice ECG-gated sequences (TR: R-R, TE: 30 ms, FOV 320X250, matrix 160X256, slice thickness 10 mm, acquisition time about 5 minutes) and Single-Shot FSE Half Fourier sequences (TR: R-R, TE: 30 ms, flip angle 120 degrees, ETL 30-40, FOV 360X180, Phase FOV 0,5, VBW 64 MHz, slice tickness 10 mm, acquisition time about 10-12 seconds), by imaging along the long and short axis. The study was completed with Fast Gradient Echo sequences (TR: 9ms, TE: 8,2ms, flip angle 25 degrees, VBW 15,63 MHz, FOV 320X250, 10 mm slice thickness, matrix 128X256), subsequently assessed by cine-MR. In order to compare both sequences, two experienced radiologists performed an analysis of quantitative parameters (signal intensity ratio between fat and muscular interventricular septum) and qualitative parameters (double blind evaluation for the presence of cardiac and respiratory artifacts).

The signal intensity ratio for the Nffse sequence images was 4.63 +/- 1.56 on the long axis and 7.69 +/- 2.46 on the short axis, whereas it was 3.17 +/- 0.64 on the long axis and 3,50 +/- 0,75 on the axis one for SE images, with a statistically significant difference (p<0,001 and p<0.002 for the long and short axis, respectively). The two radiologists evaluation of the magnitude of artifacts on the SE and Nffse images was similar only as regards the images with significant artefacts alone. Nffse images consistently afforded a detailed evaluation of the right ventricular wall, although blurring artifacts were more common than with good quality SE images. Presence of fatty infiltration of the right ventricle wall was observed in 5 out of 25 patients. In the remaining 20 patients no fatty substitution of the muscular wall of the right ventricle was observed.

The Nffse sequences provide a number of gated multiphase-multislice images, similar to that obtained by conventional SE sequences, in one breath-hold time interval. Due to high intrinsic contrast and reduction of motion artifacts, the Nffse sequences allow a good evaluation of the ventricular morphology and subepicardial and paracardiac adipose tissue. Image quality can be suboptimal due to blurring artifacts. Therefore Nffse sequences can be advantageously employed to image patients with suspected right ventricular arrhythmogenic dysplasia, whenever conventional SE images exhibit substandard quality.
