This article describes three cases of acustic neurinoma in which both clinical examination and audiovestibular investigations raised strong suspicions of acustic neurinoma but no tumours could be demonstrated by CT. Magnetic resonance scanning employing gadolinium-DTPA revealed small intrameatal acustic neurinomas in all three cases. Attention is drawn to the fact that magnetic resonance scanning provides a new diagnostic possibility for acustic neurinoma and is a valuable supplement to the established diagnostic procedures in suspected acustic neurinoma even although CT reveals normal anatomical conditions in the internal auditory meatus.
