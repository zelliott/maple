The authors report a newborn male infant with a giant congenital capillary hemangioma of the pericranium. An elastic mass, measuring 6.5 x 6.9 x 3.9 cm, was located in the parieto-occipital region. Neurological examination revealed no abnormality. Angiographically, the tumor was fed symmetrically by the bilateral superficial temporal, occipital, and middle meningeal arteries. At surgery, the encapsulated tumor appeared to have arisen from the periosteum and was removed completely. Histological diagnosis was capillary hemangioma. Capillary hemangioma is a common benign tumor in infancy and usually present as a strawberry mark or port-wine stain. However, when the tumors seat relatively deeply as in the present case, they produce little or no discoloration in the overlying skin. Angiography is then useful to differentiate capillary hemangioma from other lesions and to choose an appropriate treatment.
