This article outlines the imaging role of MR imaging in evaluating acute orthopedic trauma to the extremities. MR imaging is compared, where possible, with CT scan, scintigraphy, and ultrasound. The article specifically explores the role of MR imaging in evaluating soft tissue injury accompanying fracture, emphasizes an established role in occult fracture detection, reviews the role of MR imaging in evaluating neurovascular integrity following fracture, and underscores the utility of MR imaging in evaluating trauma to the growth plate.
