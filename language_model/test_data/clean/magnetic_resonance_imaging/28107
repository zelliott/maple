The use of T2-weighted spin-echo sequences is mandatory for identifying tumours in the ENT region and for differential diagnosis of pathological findings. A highly promising alternative to time-consuming conventional SE sequences is now available in the fast-spin-echo sequences (FSE). FSE was compared with the conventional SE (CSE) basing on 100 assessments of examinations of 20 patients.

Conventional SE = TR/TE = 1800/90 ms with one average (NEX), FSE = TR/TE = 3200/120 ms with 4 averages (NEX). Measurement time CSE 6:59 min, FSE 3:12 min. Analysis was performed in analogy to on ROC analysis by 5 radiologists as a blind study. The anatomic differentiation and contrast performance were compared as well as the differentiation and definition of lesion and lymphatic node and a subjective overall assessment. Differentiation of pathological findings was the same with both sequences. FSE was superior to CSE in the visualisation of normal tissue, lymph nodes and also in the subjective overall assessment. The following criteria were employed in the subjective overall valuation: sum total of impressions gathered from contrast behaviour or performance, susceptibility to artifacts, and signal-to-noise ratio. Due to the definitely improved parameters of image quality and the markedly reduced scanning time--which is reduced to 50%--FSE will replace the conventional spin-echo sequence in routine diagnostics.
