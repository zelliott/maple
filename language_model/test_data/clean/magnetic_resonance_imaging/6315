Five DTPA-amide and ester derivatives have been synthesized and their Gd3+ stability constants have been measured using a simple spectrophotometric method. These results are compared to stability constants measured for Gd3+ binding to two different DTPA-conjugated proteins. Although the thermodynamic constants for Gd3+ binding to DTPA-monopropylamide and DTPA-monopropylester relative to Gd(DTPA)2- decrease by log K = 2.6 and 3.4, respectively, the blood pH conditional constants differ from Gd(DTPA)2- only by log K = 1.2 and 1.9, respectively. The corresponding dipropylamide and ester conjugates of DTPA show considerably lower thermodynamic and conditional constants. This has important implications in the covalent attachment of chelates to macromolecules for use in magnetic resonance imaging. The measured binding constants for Gd(DTPA)-IgG and Gd(DTPA)-BSA suggest that many of the DTPA molecules in these systems, prepared under our experimental conditions, are disconjugated. The model compound results indicate that it is important to use methods in attaching DTPA to macromolecules which preclude dionjugation of the chelate. Otherwise, their affinity for Gd3+ and consequently their usefulness as MRI contrast agents may be severely compromised.
