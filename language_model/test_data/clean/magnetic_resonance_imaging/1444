Transabdominal ultrasonography has long been a fist-line examination to explore most of the pelvic diseases. Transvaginal sonography is a simple procedure giving an accurate and reliable diagnosis. These two techniques complement each other and can usefully be performed concomitantly. Computed tomography should be reserved to the extension assessment and follow-up uterine and ovarian tumours. Magnetic resonance imaging is a non invasive technique providing for a three-dimensional, very high quality study of the female pelvis. Its main value resides in the exploration of gynaecological tumours, where it gives a reliable assessment of local and regional extension. These various imaging techniques, therefore, have a definite, non competitive role to play in the exploration of gynaecological diseases. They are the necessary complements of physical examination and endoscopic methods.
