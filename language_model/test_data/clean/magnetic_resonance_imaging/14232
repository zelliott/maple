NMR imaging and localized 1H spectroscopy of a variety of aquatic organisms in vivo is described for the first time. The practical consideration of life support, water volume, salinity, and anesthesia are discussed and solutions presented. Such animal studies shape our understanding of physiology, biochemistry, and biology, and provide models of human disease and normal function. These studies also have economic and ecological importance.
