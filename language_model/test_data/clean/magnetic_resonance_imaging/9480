Ectopic liver is a rare finding, particularly in intrathoracic locations. We report the case of a 42-year-old woman with a mobile right atrial mass that was subsequently identified as ectopic liver by histology. Its point of origin was in a hepatic vein with extension into the right atrium. Although accurate diagnosis of ectopic liver may be possible with advanced imaging techniques, limited familiarity with the clinical entity is a barrier to early diagnosis.
