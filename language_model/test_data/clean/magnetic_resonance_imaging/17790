The kidneys are essential for maintaining homeostasis, are responsible for the reabsorption of water, glucose and amino acids, and filter the blood by removing waste. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterized by the rapid loss of renal excretory function and the accumulation of end metabolic products of urea and creatinine. AKI is associated with the later development of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease, and may eventually be fatal. Early diagnosis of AKI and assessments of the effects of treatment, however, are challenging. The pathophysiological mechanism of AKI is thought to be the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand in the kidneys. We have assessed the ability of arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), without the administration of contrast media, to quantify renal blood flow (RBF) non-invasively. We found that RBF was significantly lower in AKI patients than in healthy volunteers. These results suggest that ASL perfusion MRI, a noninvasive measurement of RBF, may be useful in the early diagnosis of AKI.
