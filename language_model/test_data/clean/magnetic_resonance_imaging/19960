To evaluate the effects of improved glycaemic control on the abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat in type 1 diabetes.

Sixteen subjects were enrolled for this 6-month study. The goal was to achieve normal haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c <5.6% in our laboratory). T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the abdominal subcutaneous and visceral fat areas at the L2-L3 disk level. Activity and energy intake were assessed using a weekly recall and food diary respectively. Plasma leptin, ghrelin and adiponectin levels were measured at baseline and at 6 months.

Twelve subjects completed the study. HbA1c was 10.4 +/- 2.2% at baseline, and abdominal visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio was 0.29 +/- 0.15. HbA1c dropped to 8.0 +/- 1.4% at 6 months (p = 0.009). There was a +1.85 kg weight change in 6 months (p = 0.30), whereas the visceral to subcutaneous fat ratios changed to 0.36 +/- 0.18 (p = 0.22). Daily metabolic equivalents (METs) of activity at 6 months correlated with a decrease in the visceral to subcutaneous fat ratios (r = -0.80, p = 0.01). Ghrelin level changes correlated negatively with the changes in the visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio (p < 0.01).

The visceral to subcutaneous fat changes had a negative correlation with the physical activity METs at 6 months but not with HbA1c changes in this study. The correlation between the changes in ghrelin and the visceral to subcutaneous fat ratios is intriguing, but a larger study may be needed to confirm this finding.
