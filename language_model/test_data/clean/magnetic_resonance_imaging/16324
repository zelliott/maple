The emergence of magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique has made it possible to answer many questions in the field of anatomy more precisely while observing different anatomic parts of living persons at different ages. This study was conducted to determine the dimensions of different parts of pons and also comparing the data in accordance with age and sex by MRI.

The present study carried out on 300 healthy individuals referred to imaging center at Imam Reza hospital in the city of Kermanshah, Iran. The precondition for people to be included in the study was the approval made by in-house physician based on person's state of health and the lack of any pathological lesion in brain on the basis of images obtained by MRI. Following MRI procedure, the dimensions of target parts in pons were calculated by the MRI-associated measuring system and recorded along with the age and sex of the patients. Measurements were recorded in mm and based on selecting the largest height, width and length of the organ during the examination of all axial, sagittal, and T(1) coronal profiles. Data analysis was performed using t-student test and Pearson's correlation. The significance level was set at P=0.05.

The mean size of different parts of pons recorded in mm was as follows: The height of tegmentum of pons in men and women were 21.10+/-1.99 and 20.35+/-1.95, respectively. The height of ventricle of pons was 24.96+/-1.45 in men and 23.72+/-1.41 in women. The length of pons in men was 21.40+/-1.55 and in women 21.10+/-1.28. The length of ventricle in men and women were 16.85+/-1.21 and 16.77+/-1.36, respectively. The length of tegmentum of pons was 4.57+/-0.50 in men and 4.40+/-0.58 in women. Lastly, the transverse length of the ventricle of pons was 27.30+/-1.68 in men and 26.52+/-1.63 in women.

The values obtained for the transverse length, length of tegmentum of ventricle, height of ventricle and height of tegmentum in men were larger than those found for women. There were significant relationships between the transverse length, length of tegmentum of pons, height of ventricle of pons and the age in men. There was no significant relationship between dimension of pons and age in women.
