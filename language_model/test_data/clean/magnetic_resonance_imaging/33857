We report a case of a huge retroperitoneal tumor in a 67-year-old woman. When the patient was taken to another hospital by ambulance, she had lost consciousness because of hypertension and hypoglycemia and abdominal CT revealed a huge retroperitoneal tumor with deviation of the right kidney and inferior vena cava. After further examinations including ultrasonography, MRI and angiography in our hospital, the tumor was extirpated. The tumor, 22 x 17 x 10 cm in size and 2,580 g in weight was diagnosed as hemangiopericytoma histologically. She has remained well with no evidence of recurrence for 9 months since the operation.
