Cerebral infarction associated with ulcerative colitis is particularly rare, but clinically important because of its high morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis of thrombosis in ulcerative colitis remains unclear even if platelet and coagulation cascade abnormalities, systemic inflammation, and the presence of other well recognized vascular risk factors are likely to play a key role in clot formation. We report a case of a young woman with recurrent ischemic stroke secondary to the interaction between ulcerative colitis-related dysbalanced hemostasis and high levels of lipoprotein (a).
