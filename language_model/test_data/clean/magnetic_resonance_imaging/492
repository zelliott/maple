Central nervous system involvement is a rare finding in the management of epithelial ovarian cancer with an incidence between 1-2%. A sharp rise in the incidence has been widely and repeatedly proclaimed for nearly two decades now, but has to be treated with scepticism after a careful review of the current literature. Brain metastases from ovarian cancer are known to be related to a very poor prognosis. Since brain imaging is not part of the routine follow-up care for ovarian cancer patients, and since CA-125--one of the standard tools--cannot be relied upon to detect central nervous system relapse, brain lesions are mostly traced by unspecific neurological symptoms only. Several prognostic factors are still being discussed today. But only a high performance status and the absence of an extra cranial disease at the time of CNS relapse have been accepted throughout the current literature as having a highly significant positive impact on survival. In the past, therapeutic efforts have focused on symptom palliation with corticosteroids and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). During the last years several other therapy options have evolved from encouraging efforts made by several study groups, including chemotherapy, neurosurgery and radiosurgery. It has been shown that a multi-modal approach, combining these strategies, promises the best prolongation of survival and in some cases even resulted in long-term remissions. The present article gives an overview of brain metastases in epithelial ovarian cancer and discusses the current treatment options.
