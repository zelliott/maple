Naming pictures of objects from different categories (e.g. animals or tools) evokes maximal responses in different brain regions. However, these 'category-specific' regions typically respond to other object categories as well. Here we used stimulus familiarity to further investigate category representation. Naming pictures of animals and tools elicited category-related activity in a number of previously identified regions. This activity was reduced for familiar relative to novel stimuli. Reduced activation occurred in all object responsive areas in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex, regardless of which category initially produced the maximal response. This suggests that object representations in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex are not limited to a discrete area, but rather are widespread and overlapping. In other regions (e.g. the lateral temporal and left premotor cortices), experience-dependent reductions were category specific. Together, these findings suggest that category-related activations reflect the retrieval of information about category-specific features and attributes.
