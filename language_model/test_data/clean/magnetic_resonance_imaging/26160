Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) is typically bacterial in origin and caused by Pseudomonas, although the fungus Aspergillus has also rarely been implicated. SBO generally arises from ear infections and infrequently complicates sinonasal infection. Rhinocerebral Mucor infection is characteristically an acute, fulminant, and deadly infection also affecting the orbits and deep face and is associated with intracranial complications. Bony involvement is uncommon because of the angioinvasive nature of the fungus. More recently, chronic invasive Mucor sinusitis has been described. We report the unusual clinical and imaging features of a patient with biopsy-proven invasive mucormycosis arising from chronic isolated sphenoid sinus disease, who presented with extensive SBO and a paucity of deep facial, orbital, or intracranial involvement.
