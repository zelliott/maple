The pons is covered by a rich venous network offering numerous vascular landmarks in MRI and during surgery. We present an original study of the veins as they appear on MR multiplanar scans after gadolinium IV injection. This prospective study is based on 40 consecutive patients with normal posterior fossa structures. One of the major venous collectors follows the pons: the superior petrosal v. was identified on MRI in 95% of our cases. Its hooklike extremity drains into the superior petrosal sinus. The inferior petrosal v. was never identifiable. The superficial pontine venous network are identified in 72.5% of cases in the axial plane and were organised in longitudinal and transverse collectors, whose MR aspects are presented here.
