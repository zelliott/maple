Since the outbreak of novel influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, various neurological complications have been cited. We described a male patient with H1N1-associated encephalopathy/encephalitis presenting with severe neurological symptoms and signs. Residual neurological sequelae were dominant. This is the first report of extensive cortical-subcortical necroses over the bilateral frontal-parietal areas based on an MRI study.
