The purpose of the study was to investigate by in vitro and in vivo methods the phosphocreatine (PCr)/ ATP ratio as an expression of the energy metabolic state of human myometrium in comparison with striated skeletal muscle. The contents of PCr and adenylates in biopsies of uterine smooth muscle and m. rectus abdominis from seven term pregnant women were determined in vitro and compared with results obtained in vivo by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) in the uterus and m. gastrocnemius of eight non-pregnant women. The PCr/ATP ratio in the striated skeletal muscle was about three times higher than that of the myometrium. The results of the in vitro biopsy part of the study and the in vivo 31P-MRS part conformed with each other. In the biopsies both PCr and ATP concentrations were significantly lower in the myometrium than in the rectus muscle, but the difference for PCr was more pronounced, accounting for the significantly lower PCr/ATP ratio in the uterine smooth muscle. The energy metabolic pattern of uterine smooth muscle differs from that of striated skeletal muscle regarding the contents of high-energy phosphocompounds and the PCr/ATP ratio. This in vivo finding is the first report on human smooth muscle using 31P-MRS.
