A 32-year-old woman, addicted to heroin, presented with a dorsal spondylodiscitis due to Candida albicans associated with epidural abscess. Antimycotic treatment was successful, and no neurosurgical decompression was necessary. To our knowledge, this is the first case of documented epidural involvement in candidal spondylodiscitis. The diagnosis of candidal spondylodiscitis should be considered in cases of para- or tetraplegia occurring in intravenous drug abusers.
