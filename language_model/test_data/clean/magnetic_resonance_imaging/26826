Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene. No work on molecular genetics of MLD has been reported from India and the mutational spectrum in Indian patients is not known. The present study was undertaken to identify mutations in arylsulfatase A gene in Indian MLD patients, to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlation, and to see the effect of the novel mutants on the protein. Twenty MLD patients (16 families) were screened by ARMS PCR for the most common mutation (c.459+1G>A). Pseudodeficiency alleles were tested by RFLP method whereas rare and novel mutations were scanned by Conformation Sensitive Gel Electrophoresis (CSGE), followed by sequencing. The genotype-phenotype correlation was also attempted. Protein homology modeling analysis was carried out for two novel missense mutations identified, to assess the effect of these mutations on the protein conformation. Nine pathogenic alleles were found in 13 patients (65%). Four previously reported mutations and five novel variants were identified. Five patients (35%) were found to have pseudodeficiency alleles, c.1049A>G (p.Asn350Ser) and c.1524+95A>G. Genotype-phenotype correlation was found to be difficult to establish. Protein modeling studies showed that the mutations cause loss of interactions leading to conformational change in ASA protein. The study identified the mutational spectrum of Indian MLD patients, which will be helpful in genetic counseling, carrier detection and establishing prenatal diagnosis. Homology modeling helped to study conformational change in protein and has implications in generating novel therapeutic molecules.
