Imaging plays a major role in the diagnosis and meanwhile also in the therapy control of rheumatic diseases. Besides the commonly used X-ray technique and musculoskeletal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is able to provide a three-dimensional view of musculature, ligaments, tendons, capsules, synovial membranes, bones and cartilage with high resolution quality. Therefore, MRI is being employed more and more in the early diagnosis of inflammatory joint and spinal diseases. Contrast-enhanced MRI enables an assessment of disease activity and a differentiation between active and chronic joint manifestation. The technical examinations by MRI are these days standardized and invariably reproducible. This makes it possible to document the course of a disease and allows subsequent treatment decisions. In addition to midfield (>0.5<1.0 T) and high field MRI (>1.0 T), low field MRI (<0.5 T) is used in rheumatology as a patient-friendly office-based technique.
