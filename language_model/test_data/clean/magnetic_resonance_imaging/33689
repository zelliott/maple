We followed up electrophysiological findings in 2 patients who underwent optic nerve glioma resection. Case 1 showed a normal flash electroretinogram (ERG) 6 months after surgery. Case 2 showed a negative-type flash ERG and nonrecordable pattern ERG and flash visual-evoked cortical potentials 13 and 20 years after surgery. The flash ERG after surgical resection of the optic nerve was considered to be affected by the interruption of the central retinal artery during the surgery, and the preserved ERG suggested the possibility of developing the collateral circulation of the ciliary artery.
