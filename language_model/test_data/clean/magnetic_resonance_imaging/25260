Acute haemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy is a rare, rapidly progressive disease of cerebral white matter associated with high fatality. The few known patients surviving have all been treated with early instigation of immuno-modulatory therapy. Here we describe two cases of this disease and underscore the importance of considering this diagnosis in the differential for any individual presenting with progressive neurological signs, an antecedent flu-like illness, and early changes on CT showing widespread disease of white matter.
