Bilateral striatal necrosis (BSN) is relatively rare and has been related to a wide array of causes, including nuclear and mitochondrial DNA mutations. We report the clinical vignette of a patient with a 37 year-history of generalized dystonia secondary to BSN associated with multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions of undefined origin. Globus pallidus interna deep brain stimulation produced sustained benefit, with predominant improvements in disability.
