We report the case of a 29-year-old man with hemoptysis. The patient came to the emergency department, where a laboratory test and chest radiograph were reported as normal. The following day the patient again had hemoptysis, though less than previously. He reported no chest pain, dyspnea, fever, catarrh, changes in urine or feces, contact with patients with bacillus disease or constitutional symptoms. Doppler ultrasound of the chest showed right basal parenchymatous condensation containing a vessel with arterial flow (in the opposite direction to the aortic flow) compatible with an aberrant vessel, possibly a sequestration, leaving the aorta above the celiac trunk. Because of the findings of the chest echogram and magnetic resonance study, thoracoabdominal computed tomography angiography was undertaken; this showed right basal condensation and an anomalous vessel originating 1 cm above the celiac trunk, supplying the right lower lobe. An aortic and pulmonary arteriogram via an arterial and right femoral vein approach confirmed the findings. The patient was treated successfully with percutaneous embolization with coils. The relevant literature is reviewed.
