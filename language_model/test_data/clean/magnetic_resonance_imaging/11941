Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) with central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating lesions has recently been reported to mimic multiple sclerosis (MS). In this paper, a series of patients with CIDP were examined to see if they had CNS involvement. CIDP patients with CNS lesions were then compared to patients with MS with peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement for similarities. CNS and PNS involvement were detected by clinical symptoms, neurological findings, neuro-otological and neuro-ophthalmological tests, electrophysiological examinations such as electroencephalography, evoked potentials, blink reflex, conventional peripheral nerve conduction studies and electromyography, as well as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There were 7 of 17 CIDP patients with CNS involvement, but only 2 of 59 MS patients with PNS lesions were found. The rate of CIDP with CNS involvement (41.2%) was higher than that of MS with PNS lesions (3.4%). The CNS signs and symptoms of 7 CIDP patients were not so constant as their PNS symptoms, and consisted of 1 case with optic neuritis, 4 cases with cerebellar atxia and/or nystagmus, and 3 cases with spinal symptoms. These signs and symptoms are all well known in MS. Prolonged latencies on evoked potentials and high signal white matter lesions on T2 weighted MRI, indicating demyelinating CNS lesions were also similar to those found in MS. The CNS involvement in those patients with CIDP was therefore similar in character to those found in MS, but was far less severe than the PNS finding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
