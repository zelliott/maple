A group of patients complaining of facial nerve palsy (Bell's palsy) were evaluated with MRI using a 0.5 unit and high resolution T1-weighted images, in order to evaluate the efficacy of Gd-DTPA enhancement in depicting the degree of nerve damage: MRI examination was performed within 24 hours to two weeks after the onset of palsy. The authors describe the results obtained from the analysis of 11 cases of Bell's palsy, discussing the prognostic and clinical significance.
