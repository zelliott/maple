Collet-Sicard syndrome (CSS) is a rare condition that includes palsies of cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII. There are multiple reported causes in the literature, although infection is particularly unusual.

To report an unusual case of CSS as a result of infection causing head-to-neck dissociation with involvement of the upper cervical spine.

Case report.

A 56-year-old male with medical comorbidities developed a cranial-based infection secondary to initial incomplete treatment of otitis media. The mass effect of the infection resulted in multiple cranial nerve palsies and extremity symptoms initially confused with a cerebrovascular accident. Clinical course of the patient and a review of CSS are presented.

With progression of the disease, further evaluation revealed a disseminated upper cervical and skull-based infection causing destructive head-to-neck infectious instability. This was treated with posterior occipitocervical debridement, fixation, and fusion and appropriate long-term antibiotics. Over the course of several months, the infection resolved and there was a significant improvement in his dysphagia, dysarthria, and hearing.

Delay in diagnosis of CSS is common, and this syndrome should be considered in patients who present with a constellation of lower cranial nerve palsies. Early recognition and treatment should result in successful recovery, but even in cases of delayed detection, suitable intervention can result in substantial clinical improvement.
