The nature of changes in rapidly acquired magnetic resonance images of the brain was studied by using a denoising method and spectral techniques optimally suited to short time series. It was found that the stimulus related changes have a complex spatiotemporal structure even for simple visual stimuli. Apart from a low frequency window, the non-stimulus-related changes were found to correspond in detail to either breathing or heartbeat, although these two sources show different patterns of spatial coherence in the image. At low frequencies, oscillations with frequencies around 0.1 Hz were observed, also with nontrivial space-time structure, which are likely to be vasomotor in origin.
