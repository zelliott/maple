The aim of this study was to establish a standardized procedure for the measurement of regional fractional ventilation in a healthy rat model as a baseline for further studies of pulmonary disorder models.

The lungs of five healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were imaged using hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging. From these images, regional fractional ventilation was calculated and maps generated detailing the distribution of fractional ventilation in the lung. The 1.56 mm x 1.56 mm x 4 mm regions of interest were assigned on 5 cm x 5 cm field of view lung maps. Histograms were also generated showing the frequency distribution of fractional ventilation values. To compare fractional ventilation values between animals, the ventilation procedure was standardized to results from individual pulmonary function tests. Each animal's spontaneous tidal volume, respiratory rate, and inspiration percentage (percent of total respiratory cycle in inspiration) were used in their mechanical ventilation settings.

Results were similar among all five healthy rats based on examination of ventilation distribution maps and frequency distribution histograms. Mean (0.13) and standard deviation (0.07) were calculated for fractional ventilation in each animal. However, these values were determined to be influenced by slice selection, and therefore the maps and histograms were favored in analysis of results.

This study shows consistent results in healthy rat lungs and will serve as a baseline study for future measurements in emphysematous rat lungs.
