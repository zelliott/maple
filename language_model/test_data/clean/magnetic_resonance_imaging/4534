Spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage is unusual, and rarely results in spinal subarachnoid hematoma because the cerebrospinal fluid tends to dilute the blood and prevent the formation of clots. We describe a patient with spinal subarachnoid hematoma of unusual spontaneous origin.

A 66-year-old female presented with sudden onset of intense back pain with paraplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass lesion between T2 and T6, compressing the spinal cord anteriorly. Emergency osteoplastic laminotomy exposed a hematoma in the subarachnoid space from T2 to T6, but no source of the hemorrhage was found. The patient was able to walk by herself about 20 days after the operation.

The outcome is significantly influenced by the duration between onset and operation, preoperative neurologic status, and rapidity of symptom progression. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of early diagnosis, and rapid and complete operative removal of spinal subarachnoid hematoma in order to achieve the best outcome.
