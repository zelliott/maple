Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women, and primary care physicians can be instrumental in ensuring a timely diagnosis. Women should be taught breast self-examination by the time they are in their late teens. Patients of all ages should be encouraged to have regular physician-conducted breast examinations and mammographic screening at a high-quality center. The consistent care and individualized follow-up provided in a primary care office are vital components of the total effort toward good breast health.
