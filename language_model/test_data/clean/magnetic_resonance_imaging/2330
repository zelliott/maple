Worldwide, more people play soccer than any other team sport. The Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) registered more than 150 million players in 1984. Although foot injuries in soccer range from midfoot sprains to stress fractures to capsulitis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, we could find no case reports of a rupture of the lateral collateral ligaments of the great toe in soccer players. This is a report of the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of such an injury in a professional soccer player.
