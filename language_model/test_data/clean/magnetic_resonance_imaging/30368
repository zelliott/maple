We report a case of clear-cell ependymoma in a 20-month-old girl who presented with seizures. The tumor had several uncommon features including a solid consistency, a purely intracortical location, and a remarkable degree of desmoplasia. Clinical, radiological, and pathological findings are presented. This case emphasizes the value of ultrastructural studies in pathological work-up of brain tumors.
