An abdominal mass in a child in the first year of life is usually of renal origin. The most common renal masses in the perinatal period are nonneoplastic and include hydronephrosis and multicystic dysplastic kidney. With the development of new therapeutic regimens and standardization of treatment protocols, the cure rate for the most common renal neoplasm, Wilms tumor, has risen to more than 90%. This article reviews the role of imaging in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of children with renal neoplasms. Pertinent epidemiologic, clinical, and histopathologic considerations are reviewed, and current recommendations for management are presented.
