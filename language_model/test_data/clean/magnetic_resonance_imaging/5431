Subdural hematoma (SDH) of the spine following intracranial hemorrhage is extremely rare. We present a 35-year-old woman who suffered from headache and dizziness initially, and then lower back pain, lower limb weakness and paraparesis gradually developed within 1-2 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed intracranial and spinal SDH. No vascular abnormality was seen by brain and spinal angiography. Platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, were normal. A diagnosis of spontaneous spinal and intracranial SDH was then confirmed surgically. Postoperative recovery was uneventful.
