After intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA (0.1 mmol/kg) hemodialysis was performed five times within 6 days in a patient with endstage renal failure. During the fifth hemodialysis a blood sample of 5 ml was withdrawn and Gd-concentration was measured in plasma at 342.247 nm using the method of Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry. Gd-concentration measured in venous and arterial blood was 6 x 10(-6) mol/liter, corresponding to 1.5% of the dose administered. If these data can be confirmed in more patients with endstage renal failure, this is the proof of effective hemodialysis of Gd-DTPA in a clinical setting.
