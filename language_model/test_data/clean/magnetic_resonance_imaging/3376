The patient is a 20-year-old man with glycogen storage disease type I (GSD-type I). In his teens, multiple focal hepatic masses were detected on abdominal ultrasonography (US), which were diagnosed as multiple hepatocellular adenomas from the imaging. During follow-up, these masses had shown intermittent growth in size. In the evaluation of Gd-EOB-DTPA (gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid) MR imaging, these masses showed various signal intensities from hypo- to hyperintense during the hepatocyte-specific phase. Intermittent growth and elevation of serum PIVKA-II levels indicate the potential for malignant transformation, so the patient underwent partial hepatectomy. The resected masses were all consistent with benign hepatocellular adenomas histopathologically.
