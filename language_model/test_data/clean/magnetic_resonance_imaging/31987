The intravertebral vacuum phenomenon was first described by KÃ¼mmel and is also known as delayed vertebral collapse or vertebral pseudarthrosis. Clinically, it occurs in approximately 10% of vertebral osteoporotic fractures, mainly in the thoracolumbar zone, is accentuated on extension views and associated with benign fractures. Most patients are neurologically intact, and continued pain is a common symptom that responds well to stabilization. Various theories exist in the literature about the pathogenesis; data support a combination of ischemia and psuedarthrosis. The ultimate treatment plan must be individualized and involve decompression of neurologic elements--when present--and sufficient stabilization, which varies according to surgeon preference and the patient's combordities.
