To characterize and compare hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases of colorectal metastatic cancer (CMC) by means of quantitative liver perfusion MRI.

Liver perfusion was assessed in 26 HCC and CMC patients (50 nodules) by means of contrast-enhanced MRI. Six perfusion parameters-hepatic perfusion index (HPI), mean transit time (MTT), distribution volume (DV), total blood flow (F(T)), arterial blood flow (F(A)), and portal blood flow (F(P))-were calculated in tumor nodules and the adjacent hepatic parenchyma.

The values of F(T), F(A), F(P), and DV were significantly higher in the HCC than in the CMC group, whereas MTT was significantly higher in the CMC group. There was no significant difference in HPI. Arterial blood flow was higher than portal blood flow in the CMC group, while portal blood flow was slightly higher than arterial blood flow in the HCC group.

The present work describes the use of dynamic MRI to quantitatively assess liver perfusion, which in the future may help studying liver cancers on the basis of their microvascular characteristics.
