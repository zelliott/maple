The present paper reports our own experience with MR perfusion imaging and gives an overview of contrast-enhanced pulmonary MR perfusion imaging, MR angiography, and ventilation MR imaging using hyperpolarized gases or oxygen as contrast agent. These methods are discussed within the context of their possible role in the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases, particularly embolism and emphysema.
