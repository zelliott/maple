In preterm infants, the risk to develop attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is 3 to 4-fold higher than in term infants. Moreover, preterm infants exhibit deficits in motor coordination and balance. Based on clinical data, higher oxygen levels in preterm infants lead to worse neurological outcome, and experimental hyperoxia causes wide-ranging cerebral changes in neonatal rodents. We hypothesize that hyperoxia in the immature brain may affect motor activity in preterm infants. We subjected newborn mice from P6 to P8 to 48 h of hyperoxia (80% O(2)) and tested motor activity in running wheels starting at adolescent age P30. Subsequently, from P44 to P53, regular wheels were replaced by complex wheels with variable crossbar positions to assess motor coordination deficits. MRI with diffusion tensor imaging was performed in the corpus callosum to determine white matter diffusivity in mice after hyperoxia at ages P30 and P53 in comparison to control animals. Adolescent mice after neonatal hyperoxia revealed significantly higher values for maximum velocity and mean velocity in regular wheels than controls (P<0.05). In the complex running wheels, however, maximum velocity was decreased in animals after hyperoxia, as compared to controls (P<0.05). Decreased fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffusion coefficient were observed in the corpus callosum of P30 and P53 mice after neonatal hyperoxia compared to control mice. Hyperoxia in the immature brain causes hyperactivity, motor coordination deficits, and impaired white matter diffusivity in adolescent and young adult mice.
