Autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) is a potential treatment for full-thickness chondral lesions in the knee. Delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC) has recently been developed as a sensitive and specific measure of cartilage glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Under the conditions of dGEMRIC, T1 is directly related to the GAG concentration. Our aim for this study was to demonstrate the potential of dGEMRIC to evaluate ACT implants.

Eleven ACT implants were studied 2 to 24 months postoperatively by dGEMRIC. T1 values from three regions of interest were obtained to examine GAG content (1) in the implant, (2) in native cartilage adjacent to the implant, and (3) in native cartilage further removed from the implant (as "control").

One implant failed and therefore was not included. Four of the implants were studied between 2 and 6 months postoperatively and showed low T1 (GAG), less than 80% of the control native cartilage. Five of the six implants studied between 12 and 24 months postoperativley showed T1 (GAG) comparable to (>80%) of control. One 18-month graft showed low T1 comparable to the surrounding native cartilage, with normal GAG seen in cartilage far from the graft site. The GAG index (T1 values of the graft normalized to control) from the group of implants 6 months or less was 59% +/- 5% of control, whereas those at 12 to 24 months were 91% +/- 18% of control. The two groups were statistically different with a P value of 0.005.

The GAG level in grafts that were implanted for less than 12 months appeared to be lower than that in the remote cartilage. At 12 months or greater, the grafts in this study had GAG levels that were comparable to both the adjacent and remote cartilage. This preliminary study of ACT implants has shown that it is feasible to apply the dGEMRIC technique in patients with ACT as a way to obtain information related to the composition of grafts. These results provide motivation and the pilot data with which to design further clinical studies.
