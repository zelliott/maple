Transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH) is an uncommon condition. This painful regional osteoporosis affects previously healthy women in the third trimester of pregnancy. It is characterized by pain in the affected hip and pronounced osteopenia of the femoral head and neck. It has a relatively short clinical course (average 6 months) and a predictably benign prognosis. Complete clinical and radiological recovery is the rule. The diagnosis is one of exclusion. The cause of the osteopenia is not known, although various aetiological factors have been implicated. A case of TOH occurring in the third trimester of pregnancy with complete recovery within 6 months postpartum is presented.
