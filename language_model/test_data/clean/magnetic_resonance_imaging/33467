Clinical, radiographic, and functional outcome parameters were analyzed before and after treatment of eight individuals with lumbosacral chordomas studied over a 3-year period. Emphasis was placed upon correlation of multiplane images and the pathoanatomy of the gross specimen. Surgical resections achieving wide margins can be curative. Magnetic resonance imaging of lumbosacral chordomas has revolutionized the preoperative anatomic localization of these tumors. Therefore, it is critical that the operating surgeon scrutinize the three-dimensional location of the tumor and its spatial relationship to surrounding structures prior to surgical eradication. A systematic approach for the radiographic analysis of tumor extent in lumbosacral chordomas is presented. Four strategic areas of preoperative analysis are identified for sacral chordomas and two for lumbar neoplasms. Functional outcome after resection is predicted by Stener's work. Contamination-free surgery is facilitated by accurate preoperative radiographic interpretation of the pathoanatomy by the surgeon.
