Due to the development new of imaging devices which produce a large number of tomographic slices, advanced techniques for the evaluation of the large amount of data are required. Computer supported extraction of dynamic 3D-models of the patients anatomy from temporal series thus is highly desirable. Since the diagnostician should be able to quickly make sensible decisions based on the models, high accuracy is required within a minimum of time. We present modeling and visualization techniques that are realized within the Cardiac Station. Results for the application of these techniques to cardiac image data demonstrate their usability. Besides giving information about the patients morphology functional parameters can be derived from the data and visualized together with the model. In order to verify the model with the original image data and for the planning of real intervention interaction techniques are presented.
