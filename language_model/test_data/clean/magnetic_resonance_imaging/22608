The purpose of this study was to clarify the incidence and features of acute cerebrovascular diseases in Yamagata Prefecture, by comparing with those in other prefectures reported in previous studies. Consecutive 13,639 cases of acute stroke were prospectively registered to Yamagata Society in Treatment for Cerebral Stroke (YSTCS) between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2002. Cerebral infarction (CI), intracerebral hemorrhage (CH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) were observed in 58.4%, 25.8%, 11.4% and 4.4% of the patients, respectively. The frequencies of CH and SAH (37.2%) in Yamagata Prefecture were higher than those reported in other studies (p < 0.01). In addition, time from onset to admission in Yamagata Prefecture was longer than that reported in others(p< 0.01). This study was one of the largest stroke registration studies in Japan enrolling 13,639 patients. In addition, computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance image (MRI) was performed on admission in all patients. Diagnosis was made by a neurologist or a neurosurgeon based on CT and/or MRI findings. Our results might accurately reflect current status of stroke patients in Yamagata Prefecture.
