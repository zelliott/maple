Investigators use non-invasive imaging to collect geometric data for finite element models. A preprocessor is described to facilitate model generation of anatomical regions from serial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data stored in a bitmap format. The MRI Data Transfer System is a stand-alone Windows-based program developed in VISUAL BASIC 3.0 which generates a NASTRAN input file. The program can be modified to generate input files for other solvers. The software will executive on any IBM-compatible computer which runs Windows Version 3.1 or higher. To demonstrate the software, model generation of a portion of a tibia is described.
