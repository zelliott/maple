High retropharyngeal neuroblastic tumors in children have been excised and debulked transorally or cervically, often with a covering tracheostomy. Although we and others have approached high thoracic lesions thoracoscopically, the trapdoor incision (or modification thereof) is generally reserved for cervicothoracic tumors with significant vessel encasement around the thoracic inlet. We report a case of symptomatic ganglioneuroma extending from the nasopharynx, at the level of the skull base, down to the aortic arch: macroscopic clearance was achieved via an extended trapdoor incision and without recourse to tracheostomy, transoral surgery, or transfusion.
