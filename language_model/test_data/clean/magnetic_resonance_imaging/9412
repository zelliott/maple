Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, if it occurs in late pregnancy, requires pregnancy termination. Here, we report a woman without a discernable underlying condition who developed neurological deficits at 14 weeks of pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an occipitoparietal brain lesion suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Neurological symptoms ameliorated spontaneously and she continued her pregnancy to term. A decision to terminate pregnancy based on only neurological and magnetic resonance imaging findings should be avoided.
