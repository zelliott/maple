An unusual case of adenomyoma of the common bile duct is reported. A 31 year-old woman with intermittent epigastralgia was found to have cholestasis and stenosis of the common bile duct. A malignant tumor could not be excluded. Resection of the common bile duct with the tumor was performed with choledochojejunostomy reconstruction. The tumor consisted of glandular hyperplasia and proliferation of smooth muscle fibers and fibrous connective tissue. The patient was well at the 30-month follow-up. Although the benign tumors of the extrahepatic bile ducts are rare, the clinical importance lies in the recognition that they can cause biliary tract obstruction. Intra-operative frozen section for histologic examination is required to make the diagnosis and plan the surgical procedure. Complete extirpation of the lesion is recommended. A radical operation is not necessary.
