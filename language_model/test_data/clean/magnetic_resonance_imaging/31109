Isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy (IHNP) although a rare condition, has been previously reported. A literature review revealed that in most cases, IHNP indicates the presence of an intracranial or extracranial space occupying lesion, head and neck injury, vascular abnormality, infection, autoimmune disease or neuropathy. Reports of idiopathic cases are rare and the vast majority of IHNP are reversible. We report a case of persistent idiopathic unilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy, with an emphasis on the investigations necessary to be undertaken on presentation of such a lesion.
