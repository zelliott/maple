Postpump chorea (PPC) is the development of choreoathetoid movements within 2 weeks following cardiopulmonary bypass. Over a 10-year period, 668 children underwent open cardiac surgery, of whom 8 (1.2%) developed PPC. Age at surgery ranged from 8 to 34 months. The onset of chorea was 3 to 12 days following surgery. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed atrophy but no focal lesions. Cerebral positron emission tomography using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose in a patient following 12 months of chorea showed patchy areas of decreased glucose metabolism. None of the patients were developmentally normal 22 to 130 months following surgery. Three patients have had transient and 5 have persistent chorea. Neurological deficits ranged from a mild learning disability to progressive hypotonia and obtundation ending in death. One of 4 patients who received haloperidol had a decrease in the severity of chorea. We compared PPC patients with 39 randomly selected controls. During surgery, affected patients spent significantly more time on pump and at temperatures under 36 degrees C, were cooled to lower temperatures than controls, and were more likely to have had a circulatory arrest. One patient developed chorea without a history of circulatory arrest. We conclude that (1) there is a strong association between PPC, deep hypothermia, and circulatory arrest, (2) absence of characteristic macroscopic changes suggests a biochemical or microembolic etiology in some cases, (3) chorea is frequently associated with developmental delay, and (4) the prognosis for complete resolution of chorea is guarded.
