Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is almost always seen in soft tissue. Skeletal involvement by MPNST is uncommon and usually results from secondary invasion. Primary MPNSTs are exceptionally rare. We report a surgically proven case of intraosseous MPNST, with local recurrence and lung metastasis during follow-up. The imaging and histological features of the case are described and the literature on the subject briefly reviewed.
