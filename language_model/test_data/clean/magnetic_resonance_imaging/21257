We report an interesting case of a neurinoma originating from the anterior interosseous nerve. Magnetic resonance (MR) images showed an egg-shaped, well-circumscribed mass on the volar side of the forearm. On the enhanced three-dimensional computer tomography (3D-CT), it was clearly demonstrated that the tumour had arterial feeding from the anterior interosseous artery. The enhanced 3D-CT angiography was useful in the pre-operative diagnosis and surgical planning of peripheral neurinomas.
