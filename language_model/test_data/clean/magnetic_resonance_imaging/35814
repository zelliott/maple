Myelopathy is a common consequence of cervical spondylosis. Typically, the syndrome develops gradually over a long period. Rapidly progressive deterioration in the absence of trauma or other precipitating factors is exceptional. We report a case of a rapidly progressive acute myelopathy secondary to cervical spondylosis without identifiable precipitating cause. The importance of recognizing this syndrome lies in the fact that rapid operative intervention may result in significant neurological recovery. The value of magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively and postoperatively is emphasized.
