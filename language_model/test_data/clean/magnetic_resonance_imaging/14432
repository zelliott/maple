The complex anatomy and multiple functions of the structures involved in the sella, suprasellar, and parasellar spaces present a challenge for the imager in identifying an etiology when symptoms are present. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and arteriography all play roles depending upon the localization of the process. In this area, as in others, care must be exercised, as nonneoplastic masses may mimic those that are neoplasms. Studies must be tailored to answering questions posed by the differential diagnosis.
