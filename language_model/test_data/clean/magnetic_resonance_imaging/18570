The advent of MR imaging in musculoskeletal radiology, coupled with advances in the past decade in the treatment of knee disorders, has fueled an explosion of interest in MR imaging of the knee. Evaluation of meniscal pathology has been central to this development. The accuracy of MR imaging in the diagnosis of meniscal tears is now well established; attention has more recently been focused on the prevalence, natural history, and clinical significance of other intrameniscal signal abnormalities, as well as on the postoperative meniscus. Nonmeniscal knee disorders that may clinically mimic meniscal lesions are also reliably diagnosed with MR imaging. Technical advances in pulse sequences allow knee imaging with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
