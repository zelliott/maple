A 42-year-old woman presented with ptosis of the left upper lid and limitation of elevation and adduction of the left eye. Neuroimaging revealed a left cavernous sinus lesion which on biopsy proved to be a meningioma. She was symptomatically stable for three weeks until she had spontaneous elevation of her left upper lid and resolution of her diplopia over the course of one day. Spontaneous improvement of a neurologic deficit is generally considered evidence against an underlying tumor; however, it should not rule out the possibility that a tumor is present.
