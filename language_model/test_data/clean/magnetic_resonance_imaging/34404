The purpose of this study was to determine the MR appearance of struma ovarii correlating with the pathological features.

MR findings of two patients with struma ovarii were retrospectively reviewed and compared with the pathological findings.

Both tumors were complex masses composed of multiple cysts and solid components. The size and signal intensity of multiple cysts varied within the tumor. Hyperintense cystic areas on T1-weighted images were thought to correspond pathologically to hemorrhagic cysts and follicles containing viscous proteinaceous colloid. Solid components had as high a signal intensity as did uterine endometrium on T2-weighted images and as intermediate a signal intensity as did uterine muscle layer on T1-weighted images. After intravenous administration of gadolinium-DTPA, the solid components showed marked contrast enhancement. There was also ascitic fluid associated with adhesion and peritoneal thickening.

The characteristic MR appearance of struma ovarii is thought to be a mixed mass composed of T2-hyperintense solid components with intense contrast enhancement and multiple T1-hyperintense cystic areas suggestive of hemorrhagic degeneration and viscous proteinaceous colloid.
