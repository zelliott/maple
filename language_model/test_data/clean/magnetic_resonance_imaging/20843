Genetic studies have found that the interleukin-1β gene (IL1B, 2q13) influences the risk for schizophrenia, but the underlying biological mechanisms of the association are still unclear. Investigation of the effects of genetic variability in this gene on brain function could provide more information about its role in the disorder.

The present study examined the effects of a functional polymorphism at IL1B gene promoter (-511C/T; rs16944) on brain correlates of working memory performance in schizophrenia. Forty-eight schizophrenia patients and 46 control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing the n-back task.

In the pooled sample, genetic variability at this locus was associated with differential brain activation in a bilateral frontal region including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There was also a significant diagnosis × genotype interaction effect in an overlapping frontal region: the IL1B polymorphism did not affect activation in the control subjects in this area, but the schizophrenia patients who were T carriers showed significantly higher activation than the CC homozygotes.

The findings support a role for IL1B variability in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction classically associated with schizophrenia.
