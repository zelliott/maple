Images reconstructed from multielement, phased array coils and presented as the square root of the sum of the squares of the signals received by the individual elements have a distribution of signal and noise that distorts the relationship between the image intensity and the underlying signal. The distortion is accentuated for long echo times for which the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) may be low. When measuring T(2) or T(2)* this signal distortion leads to biased estimates of these parameters. We demonstrate this effect and its dependence on the image SNR and the number of elements in a phased array coil. We evaluated the effects of four techniques for calculating T(2) from data acquired in phased array coils (log transform, least squares, lookup table correction, and maximum likelihood [ML] estimation). The ML estimation gave the most accurate T(2) in the presence of this bias.
