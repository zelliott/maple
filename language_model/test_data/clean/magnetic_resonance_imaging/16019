The purpose of this study is to investigate information processing in the primary somatosensory system with the help of oscillatory network modelling. Specifically, we consider interactions in the oscillatory 600Hz activity between the thalamus and the cortical Brodmann areas 3b and 1. This type of cortical activity occurs after electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves such as the median nerve. Our measurements consist of simultaneous 31-channel MEG and 32-channel EEG recordings and individual 3D MRI data. We perform source localization by means of a multi-dipole model. The dipole activation time courses are then modelled by a set of coupled oscillators, described by linear second-order ordinary delay differential equations (DDEs). In particular, a new model for the thalamic activity is included in the oscillatory network. The parameters of the DDE system are successfully fitted to the data by a nonlinear evolutionary optimization method. To activate the oscillatory network, an individual input function is used, based on measurements of the propagated stimulation signal at the biceps. A significant feedback from the cortex to the thalamus could be detected by comparing the network modelling with and without feedback connections. Our finding in humans is supported by earlier animal studies. We conclude that this type of rhythmic brain activity can be modelled by oscillatory networks in order to disentangle feed forward and feedback information transfer.
