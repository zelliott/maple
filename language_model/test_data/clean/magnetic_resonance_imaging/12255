Peptides are highly selective, high-affinity ligands for a diverse array of disease targets, but suitably derivatizing them for application as diagnostic or therapeutic agents often presents a significant challenge. Covalent modification with metal chelates frequently results in decreased binding affinity, so a variety of strategies must be explored to find suitable locations for modification and facile peptide conjugation chemistries that maintain or enhance binding affinity. In this chapter, we present a paradigm for systematically optimizing peptide binding and determining the favorable sites and methods for peptide conjugation. This strategy is illustrated by two case studies of peptide-based targeted gadolinium contrast agents: EP-2104R for diagnosis of thrombosis and EP-3533 for diagnosis of cardiac perfusion and fibrosis. Two different architectures for the peptide-metal complex conjugation were designed: EP-2104R contains a total of four gadolinium (Gd) chelates linked at the N- and C-termini, whereas EP-3533 is derivatized with three Gd chelates, two on the N-terminus and one on a lysine side chain. Detailed protocols are provided for two Gd chelate conjugation methods.
