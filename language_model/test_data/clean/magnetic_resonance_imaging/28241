Six months after the onset of visual loss a 23-year-old male patient with Leber's optic neuropathy associated with a mitochondrial DNA mutation developed brain stem involvement with Parinaud's syndrome and oculopalatal myoclonus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a high signal area in the brain stem, corresponding to a hypodense area in the CT scan that did not show contrast enhancement. Distinct diminution but not complete remission of the MRI findings was found in the 5-year follow-up, which was not accompanied by clinical improvement. Although the MRI findings were compatible with a demyelinating lesion, neither extensive evoked potential studies nor spinal fluid examination supported this.
