A signal increase in denervated muscle on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been described in several clinical and experimental studies. Here, we studied the time course of T2-relaxation time changes in denervation and subsequent reinnervation in a rat model and correlated the findings with electrophysiology and quantitative histology. A prolongation of the T2 relaxation time in muscles was present 48 h after denervation, which was paralleled by spontaneous activity on electromyography (EMG). Histologically, there was a marked enlargement of the capillaries at that time point, indicating increased blood volume. The relaxation time changes peaked 3 weeks after beginning of nerve regeneration identified by EMG. Subsequently, the T2 prolongation normalized until 10 weeks after beginning of regeneration which was associated with a histological regression of the capillary enlargement. MRI closely mirrors the electrophysiological changes following denervation and reinnervation and may thus be used as adjunct to electrophysiology. The pathophysiological basis for the MR relaxation time changes is predominantly the enlargement of the capillary bed.
