Ten children, five boys and five girls with true precocious puberty at an early age were found to have hypothalamic hamartomas on brain imaging. Very early onset of puberty, varying from a few weeks to three years of age, and rapid progression were characteristic. Accelerated growth velocity and markedly advanced bone age were evident in all. Gonadotropin and gonadal hormone levels were elevated above the prepubertal range. Six children had associated developmental delay or hyperactivity.
