Epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) in multiple sclerosis is extremely rare. We report a case of a patient with clinically definite multiple sclerosis who developed EPC. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicted high signal in subcortical white matter and basal ganglia. A combination of lesions may be important in the generation of EPC.
