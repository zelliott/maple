We report two cases of testicular abscess. The first case is in a 53-year-old man who had been suffering from diabetes mellitus. Because of cerebral infarction, he had been bedridden and a Foley catheter had been indwelt for a long period of time. The second case is in a 78-year-old man who had suffered from acute prostatitis six months earlier. In both cases, the chief complaints were high fever and painful scrotal swelling. At initial evaluation, ultrasonography revealed that the affected testes were swollen without abscess formation and an ipsilateral epididymal swelling was demonstrated in the second case but not in the first case. The urine bacterial culture (UBC) result was positive for Escherichia coli in first case and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the second case. In both cases, fever and scrotal pain subsided after antibiotic chemotherapy, and inflammatory reactions on routine blood studies were normalized within 2 weeks. Nevertheless, the swollen testes did not sigunificantly reduce in size, and testicular abscess was suspected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Orchiectomy was performed, and intratesticular abscess formations were confirmed macroscopically and microscopically. In each case, bacterial culture from the abscess was positive for the same bacterium as detected from the UBC. It is difficult to distinguish testicular abscess from acute epididymitis at the early stage because of similarities on symptoms or signs between the two. If testicular swelling lasts after appropriate chemotherapy, we believe that attention should be directed to testicular abscess, which needs orchiectomy to obtain a complete cure and MRI is useful in its diagnosis.
