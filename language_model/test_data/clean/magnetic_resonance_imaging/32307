The purpose of this pictorial essay is to show the imaging features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency thermal ablation on CT, MRI, and contrast-enhanced sonography and to describe the advantages and limitations of each imaging technique in evaluating the therapeutic effect on HCC.

CT is the standard imaging technique for monitoring the effectiveness of TACE and radiofrequency ablation. Contrast-enhanced sonography and MRI can complement CT in evaluating the therapeutic response.
