The authors describe a 9-year-old boy with a large spinal cord ependymoma whose apparent drop metastases on imaging studies were later demonstrated to be schwannomas. This finding led to the discovery of small bilateral acoustic neuromas and an intracranial meningioma, establishing the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 2. The presence of additional radiographic abnormalities in a patient with a spinal cord tumor should prompt careful consideration of the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 2, as early identification of this disorder may significantly affect patient management.
