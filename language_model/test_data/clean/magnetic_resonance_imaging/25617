Two hypotheses were tested: (a) that view-to-view variations in bulk phase and modulus of magnetization in vascular volume elements can indicate the presence of disordered blood flow, and (b) that a substantial loss of signal intensity on magnetic resonance (MR) angiograms of poststenotic regions is due to view-to-view changes in magnetization. To test these hypotheses, a technique was developed in which view-to-view variations in transverse magnetization were used to create angiographic projection images, which showed only disordered flow (disordered flow maps) in vitro and in vivo. In phantom studies, this technique recovered signal intensity downstream from stenoses. A combination of disordered flow maps with morphologic images improved visualization of stenotic regions and provided information on characteristics of local flow. These results show that view-to-view variations in transverse magnetization occur in regions of disordered flow and are an important cause of loss of signal intensity. This technique can provide information about dynamic blood flow and improve depiction of anatomic structures on MR angiograms.
