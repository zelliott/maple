Diuretic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance urography (MRU) is analogous to conventional intravenous urography (IVU) and, hence, designated as excretory MRU. It is performed with a T1-weighted fast gradient-echo sequence to obtain breath-hold, dynamic MRU after intravenous injection of low-dose furosemide (5-10 mg) and gadolinium (Gd) chelate. The combination of Gd and furosemide is the key for achieving a uniform distribution of the contrast material inside the entire urinary tract. It provides high-resolution images of nondilated urinary tracts and information about the renal function. This pictorial essay reviews the technical aspects and practical consideration of diuretic Gd-enhanced MRU and underlines its diagnostic capability in comparison with IVU in the depiction of nondilated collecting systems. We discuss its potential applications, as in young patients with anatomic anomalies, patients with renal transplants, patients allergic to iodinated contrast medium, and avoiding multimodality work-up in the evaluation of kidney donors and patients with renal and extrarenal tumor diseases.
