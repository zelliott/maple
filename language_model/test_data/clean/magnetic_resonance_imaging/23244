Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become established as part of clinical practice in many centres worldwide especially when visualization of the central nervous system pathology is required. In this review we summarize the recent literature and provide an overview of fetal development and the commonly encountered fetal pathologies visualized with MRI and illustrated with numerous MR images. We aim to convey the role of fetal MRI in clinical practice and its value as an additional investigation alongside ultrasound yet emphasize the need for caution when interpreting fetal MR images especially where experience is limited.
