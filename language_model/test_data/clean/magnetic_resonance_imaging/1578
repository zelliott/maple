Gangliogliomas are intra-axial, avascular masses located predominantly in the temporal lobe. A ganglioglioma that mimics a meningioma in that it is extra-axial and has a significant extracranial vascular supply has not been reported previously.

A 12-year-old girl presented with a right temporoparietal mass. A neurological examination revealed nothing abnormal, and the girl's symptoms were limited to headaches.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an extra-axial mass, and cerebral catheter angiography revealed a blood supply mainly from the posterior division of the right middle meningeal artery. Intraoperative findings confirmed the extra-axial location of the tumor, and histological analysis revealed that the tumor was a ganglioglioma.

This report confirms that gangliogliomas can present as extra-axial, vascular masses that are similar to meningiomas.
