We retrospectively studied the staging accuracy of endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in comparison with transrectal ultrasound examination (TRUS) for 71 localized bladder cancers and 19 localized prostate cancers (PC) radically resected. The accuracy of clinical staging for bladder cancer in endorectal MRI and TRUS was 85.9% and 69.2%, respectively. The presence or absence of the continuity of submucosal enhancement on T2-weighted MRI images could be useful for the staging of bladder cancer. The accuracy of the seminal vesicular invasion for prostate cancer in endorectal MRI and TRUS was 95% and 63%, respectively. To determine whether magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) provides additional information in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, the magnetization transfer ratios (MTRs) were calculated in 22 patients with PC, 5 with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 4 controls. The mean MTR in the peripheral zone of the normal prostate (8.0% +/- 3.4 [standard deviation]) showed a statistically significant decrease relative to that in the inner zone of the normal prostate (27.4% +/- 3.4, p < 0.01), BPH (25.5% +/- 3.7, p < 0.01), pre-treatment PC (30.6% +/- 5.9, p < 0.01), and PC after hormonal therapy (20.3% +/- 6.3, p < 0.01). The mean MTR in pre-treatment PC was significantly higher than that in BPH, or in PC after hormonal therapy (p < 0.01). MTC was considered to be useful for conspicuity of prostate cancer lesion.
