The normal MR imaging appearance of the neck can be confusing given the number and complexity of structures that pass through it. This article strives to simplify normal MR imaging anatomy of the neck using a spatial approach. We present the protocols used at our institution and provide tables with details. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging anatomy and appearance of the deep spaces of the neck are described with extensive labeled imaging correlates. Pearls and common pitfalls encountered with MR imaging of the neck are discussed. Additional aspects of normal neck MR imaging are described including lymph node, brachial plexus, and vascular anatomy.
