Findings from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of 50 knees were retrospectively interpreted. The results were correlated with arthroscopic findings. Multiple pulse sequences were performed including sagittal double-echo, coronal T1-weighted and gradient echo, axial gradient echo or fat suppression imaging. Three-dimensional MRI was performed if there was a high suspicion of a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. The individual positive predictive value, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated from the comparison between MRI and arthroscopic findings of the menisci, anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament. The following results were obtained: 1) Tears of the medial meniscus-positive predictive value, 72%; sensitivity, 87%; specificity, 86%; and accuracy, 86%. 2) Tears of the lateral meniscus-positive predictive value, 85%; sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 90%; and accuracy, 88%. 3) Tears of the anterior cruciate ligament-positive predictive value, 88%; sensitivity, 95%; specificity, 89%; and accuracy, 92%. 4) Tears of the posterior cruciate ligament-positive predictive value, 100%; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 100%; and accuracy, 100%. It is concluded that MRI is a noninvasive and accurate method for detecting the internal derangement of the knee.
