The hypothalamus, in addition to regulating the anterior and posterior pituitary, controls water balance through thirst, regulates food ingestion and body temperature, influences consciousness, sleep, emotion and other behaviors. Much has been learned of these effects in human disease through the clinical manifestations that occur with hypothalamic lesions. This study reviews the clinical pathologic correlations that have been made in recent years showing that regions of the hypothalamus exert functions in humans that are similar to those identified in experimental animals. Clinical pathologic correlations have not always provided precise analysis of hypothalamic function. The hypothalamus is small and often lesions that come to clinical attention achieve considerable size before their recognition, making local anatomic dissections of the effects of the lesions difficult. Nevertheless, the use of modern non-invasive techniques including CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have provided new information not previously available. This paper reviews several cases of hypothalamic disorder recognized recently. (1) A 33-year-old black man with hypothalamic sarcoidosis. Manifestations of hypothalamic dysfunction included panhypopituitarism, aggressive hyperphagia, polydipsia (partially due to hyperglycemia secondary to diabetes mellitus), drowsiness, depression, and irritability. (2) A 37-year-old woman with a large intrahypothalamic tumor (biopsy showed pituitary adenoma), with drowsiness, poikilothermia, lack of satiety, confusion, and memory loss. She becomes depressed when she is transiently more alert (as after hypertonic contrast-dye infusion). (3) A 60-year-old man with hypothalamic compression by a pituitary tumor, associated with syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH), severe anorexia, memory loss, but preserved thirst. After surgical decompression of the tumor his appetite acutely recovered, but he developed severe hypo(poikilo)thermia. (4) A 45-year-old woman with a suprasellar craniopharyngioma presented with severe drowsiness, hyperphagia, depression, and memory loss post-operatively, which responded to antidepressants (except for the memory loss). She had extremely labile blood pressures and serum Na for about 1 week post-operatively.
