A number of extracranial anatomical sites, including the nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, and masticator space, may give rise to lesions involving the skull base. Implicit in the nature of an invasive lesion, the majority of these lesions are malignant. Accordingly, for optimal patient outcomes and treatment planning, it is imperative to include a search pattern for extracranial sites and to assess accurately the character and extent of these diverse lesions. Of particular importance to radiologists are lesions arising from each extracranial site, the search patterns, and relevant information important to convey to the referring clinician.
