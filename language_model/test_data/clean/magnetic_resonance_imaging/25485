A 44-year-old man with treated neurosyphilis presented with subclinical status epilepticus (SE) refractory to intravenous high-dose lorazepam, phenytoin, and valproic acid over 4 days. Ketamine infusion was instituted after low-dose propofol sedation with gradual control of electrographic seizures over 72h. Reevaluation 3 months later revealed diffuse cerebellar and worsened cerebral atrophy, consistent with animal models of N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist-mediated neurotoxicity. Animal studies of prolonged ketamine therapy are required before widespread human use in SE.
