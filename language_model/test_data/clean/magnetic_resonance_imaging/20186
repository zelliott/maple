Non-compaction of the ventricular myocardium (NCVM) is a rare disorder of myocardial morphogenesis usually diagnosed in paediatric age associated with high mortality rates. Among reported cases, NCVM has been described in only six patients > or = 70 years. We describe the case of a 74-year-old male with NCVM involving the left ventricle, representing one of the oldest patients ever reported in the literature. Of note, this case was characterized by late appearance of NCVM and rapid deterioration of clinical conditions. The wide age range of symptom onset from prenatal to geriatric age supports the hypothesis that NCVM is a multifactorial rather than a simple congenital disorder.
