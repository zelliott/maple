The isolated myeloid sarcomas of the cervix are tumors whose forecast was dark for a long time. However, an effective but invasive treatment associating chemotherapy and radiotherapy allows for local remission. This treatment generally causes an ovarian failure and especially infertility. We report the case of a 29-year-old woman suffering from a myeloid sarcoma isolated from the uterine cervix and wishing a pregnancy. A prevention of the deficit ovarian was carried out. This patient presented normal menstrual cycles and a biochemical pregnancy three years after the beginning of the treatment.
