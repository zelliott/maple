Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with acute head injury was conducted to study if contrast extravasation was associated with development of hemorrhagic lesions. A series of 60 head-injured patients were admitted to our emergency unit. Computerized tomography (CT) scans and skull x-ray films were taken as rapidly as possible after hospitalization. Injury severity on admission was evaluated using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, motor score, and pupillary examination, while overall outcome was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) 3 months after injury. Of all patients admitted, MR imaging with gadolinium enhancement was performed in 18 patients who were at high risk of developing hemorrhagic lesion within 6 h after injury. In these patients we investigated whether contrast extravasation was associated with development of hemorrhagic lesions. All 18 patients presented abnormal findings on their admission CT scans. Admission GCS score in those patients who underwent MR imaging with gadolinium enhancement was 13 or more in 12 patients, 9-12 in four patients, and 8 or less in two patients. Fourteen of 18 patients showed contrast extravasation, corresponding with an evolution of lesion size. Nine of 14 patients who demonstrated extravasation of the contrast medium required surgical treatment. The results of the current study suggest that extravasation of contrast medium indicates a continuance of posttraumatic bleeding. Thus, MR imaging with gadolinium enhancement in acutely head-injured patients may constitute a reasonable strategy for predicting the development of hemorrhagic lesions.
