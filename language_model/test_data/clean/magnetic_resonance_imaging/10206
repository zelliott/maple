A 9-year-old Burmese cat was presented for investigation of a subacute onset of bilateral forelimb paresis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervico-thoracic vertebral column and brachial plexus revealed a bilaterally symmetrical, severe and diffuse swelling of the spinal nerves forming the caudal part of the brachial plexus. Histopathology of the abnormal nerve roots, spinal nerves and brachial plexi showed inflammatory and marked proliferative changes with similar features to that of hypertrophic neuritis of man. Hypertrophic neuritis in man is a rare, tumor-like, chronic inflammatory peripheral nerve disorder of unknown origin most frequently involving the brachial plexus.
