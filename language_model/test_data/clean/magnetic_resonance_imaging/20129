Segmentation guidelines on high-resolution MRI designed to assess remaining volumes of the hippocampus and the parahippocampal cortices after medial temporal lobe (MTL) surgery could provide a useful tool to investigate the involvement of these anatomical regions in surgical outcomes and in human memory. For this purpose, we implemented an MRI volumetric analysis, already applied to healthy population or epileptic patient before surgery, to quantify the volume of the hippocampus, the temporopolar cortex and the regions of the parahippocampal gyrus (perirhinal, entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices) spared after unilateral MTL resection carried out to treat medically uncontrolled temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Based on the locations of remaining anatomical landmarks, we quantified the volume of these regions in 24 patients after MTL resection and in 16 control participants. Our results show that (1) mean volumes of these regions contralateral to the epileptic focus were similar to those of normal subjects, (2) volumetric measures obtained from the resected side were much smaller than those from the non-resected side or from normal values and (3) the extent of MTL resection was comparable in right or left MTL surgery. Individual analysis of patients showed that the parahippocampal cortex, as opposed to the other regions, was not systematically removed across patients. As a post-operative MRI-based method, it therefore proves valuable to assess group data as well as to explore differences between individual patients.
