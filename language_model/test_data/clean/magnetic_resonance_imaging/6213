While falx calcification is rarely demonstrated using magnetic resonance, falx ossification, when seen, is characteristic. On magnetic resonance images, falx ossification exhibits a typical appearance consisting of a central marrow-containing portion with signal intensity similar to fat, surrounded by low signal intensity representing cortical bone. Falx ossification was seen in 0.7% of patients and should not be confused with a falx lipoma, a rare congenital entity.
