In children, posterior fossa juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas are common tumors. Radiologically, primarily extra-axial brainstem pilocytic astrocytomas are uncommon and extra-axial cerebellar pilocytic tumors are exceptional. We report two cases of such exophytic tumors, contrasting their presentation, imaging appearance, and prognosis. We also report the radiographic features of posterior fossa juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas from a 5-year review of our institutional experience.
