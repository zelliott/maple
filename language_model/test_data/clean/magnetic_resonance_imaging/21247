Total surgical resection is the treatment of choice for choroid plexus tumors. However, the hypervascular nature of such lesions imposes challenges to the surgical treatment. Preoperative embolization for intracranial tumors has been widely used in an attempt to reduce blood loss, but rarely with choroid plexus tumors.

We describe the first case of preoperative embolization of choroid plexus papilloma with Onyx via the anterior choroidal artery. The procedure underwent without any complications and surgical treatment was possible with minimal blood loss.

Embolization of choroid plexus tumors via anterior choroidal artery is potentially dangerous, but following a meticulous technique, it can be used as a safe and effective preoperative procedure.
