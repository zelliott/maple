Pancreatitis is a relatively rare complication in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Herein we report a case of SLE with the initial development of acute pancreatitis, subsequently complicated by bleeding pseudoaneurysms. A 55-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of SLE. During the course of treatment, she complained of upper abdominal pain. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed that the pancreas was diffusely enlarged, and she was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Her pancreatitis was resistant to glucocorticoid therapy and was subsequently associated with pancreatic pseudocysts and recurrent rupture of the pseudoaneurysms. After surgical drainage of the hemorrhagic pseudocysts, the patient's clinical condition gradually improved with intensive therapies. Our case indicates that lupus pancreatitis can be associated with the potentially fatal complication of recurrent bleeding of pseudoaneurysms.
