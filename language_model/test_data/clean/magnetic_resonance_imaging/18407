A 59-year-old farmer was admitted with severe anterior chest and back pain. As MRI showed a Stanford type A dissection, operation was performed. Surgical intervention revealed the clotted false lumen of the ascending aorta without intimal tear, and it was transected and primarily reconstructed with Teflon felt bolsters. Three months later MRI disclosed disappearance of the dissected lumen in the ascending and descending aorta. During the following two years and three months, a saccular aneurysm of the distal arch was found to be increased in size rapidly. The second operation was attempted to close the intimal defect with patch. As a whole this was a rare case of DeBakey type III acute aortic dissection complicated with proximal extension, clotted false lumen and saccular aneurysm formation at the site of the intimal tear.
