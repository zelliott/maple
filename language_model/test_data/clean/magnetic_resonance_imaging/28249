Perineural and endoneural tumor spread is a form of metastatic disease in which the primary tumors spread along neural pathways and gain access to noncontiguous regions. Although rare, this type of skip metastasis into the cranial cavity occurs from tumors of the parotid gland and facial skin. Recognition of this process, evaluation of the patient with proper diagnostic procedures, and its treatment are presented.
