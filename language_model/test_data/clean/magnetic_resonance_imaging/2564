MR imaging with retrobulbar anesthesia was performed in eight patients with uveal melanoma. Injection of 2 mL prilocain hydrochloride in 2% epinephrin into the eye muscle cone resulted in improved image quality in seven patients, without side effects. Ocular MR imaging can be indicated to clarify indeterminate sonographic findings in cases of extrascleral growth or to exclude optic nerve invasion in patients with tumors located at the posterior pole of the globe.
