Hemangiomas are benign endothelial cell-derived tumors that are present in 1-2% of newborns. They are most frequent in females. Eighty per cent are located in the head and neck region. Intramuscular hemangiomas represent 0.8% of all cases. They are characterized by rapid endothelial growth. Treatment is indicated for lesions that have an organic or visceral location or those that present with deformities.

Six cases of intramuscular hemangioma are presented. They were collected during the period June 2003 to November 2005 from all surgical cases seen at the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Hospital General "Dr Manuel Gea Gonzalez," Mexico City, Mexico. Their clinical appearance, treatment, and outcomes are discussed.

There were five women and one man with a mean age of 24.6 years (15-44 years). Two hemangiomas were located on the upper extremities and four on the lower extremities. All six patients were treated by surgical resection. Four cavernous hemangiomas were revealed during microscopic examination. At 1-3 years of follow-up, there were no recurrences and the functional and aesthetic results were good.

Intramuscular hemangiomas are rare. Lesions of the extremities are even rarer. Surgical excision in the six cases described here resulted in cure with good functional and cosmetic outcomes.
