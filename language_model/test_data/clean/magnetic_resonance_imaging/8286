We report a patient who experienced progressive diplopia and distal weakness of the upper limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed extensive white matter lesions and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid revealed acute human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection. Myasthenia gravis (MG) was evidenced by electromyography (EMG) and antibodies against acetylcholine receptor. This unusual case of MG associated with HTLV-I infection and brain-restricted lesions underscores the possible link between viruses and MG pathogenesis.
