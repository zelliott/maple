A case of 23-year-old female with histologically verified hemangioma of the hypopharynx was reported. MRI revealed slight hyper-intense mass on T1-weighted image while it was very high-signal intensity on T2-weighted image. The dynamic MRI showed peak contrast at 80 seconds after administration of Gd-DTPA. In the present paper the value of MRI for diagnosing hemangioma of the hypopharynx is discussed.
