Modern whole body MR systems are equipped with echo-planar-imaging capability, which allows the measurement of a single slice in a fraction of a second or of thousands of images in few minutes. A considerable restriction to the acquisition of series containing large amounts of images in patient examinations is the time-consuming data handling time of the images at conventional systems, which includes the time to insert the images into the systems database. We propose the arrangement of several images on a new image with a large matrix size like a mosaic. The handling time depends mostly on the number of images without consideration of their matrix size. Therefore, image handling is strongly reduced by the use of such mosaic images.
