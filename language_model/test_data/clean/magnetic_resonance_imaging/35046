The aim of this study was to reveal the volumetric changes in tumor necrosis, reactive zone, and edema referred to as the "triple ring" appearing after low-dose-rate iodine-125 (I-125) interstitial irradiation of 20 inoperable low-grade gliomas. To enable prediction of these volumetric changes, we provide mathematical expressions that describe the dynamics of the triple ring. Volumes of the three regions on image-fused control CT/MR images were measured for a 24-month period. The delivered dose on the tumor surface was 50-60 Gy. Dose planning and image fusion were performed with Brain-Lab Target 1.19 software; mathematical and statistical computations were carried out with Matlab numeric computation and visualization software. To determine the volumes, control images with the triple rings were fused with the planning images. Relative volumes normalized with respect to the volume of reference dose were calculated and plotted in the time domain. First, the mean values of volumes were determined from the patients' measured data; then, polynomials were fitted to the mean values using the polynomial curve-fitting method. The accuracy of our results was verified by correlating the predicted data with the measured ones. The polynomial prediction approach proposed here reveals the dynamics of the triple ring. These polynomials will assist with (1) designing the best treatment, (2) following the patient's condition, and (3) planning reirradiation if necessary.
