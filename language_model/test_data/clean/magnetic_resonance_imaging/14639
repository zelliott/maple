The differential diagnosis of renal masses in pediatric patients includes benign and malignant tumors, as well as nonneoplastic mass-like lesions mimicking tumors. Although the spectrum of renal masses in children has some overlap with that of adults, it is important to understand the renal pathologic processes specific to the pediatric population, as well as their characteristic imaging appearances and clinical presentations. This article reviews benign and malignant renal masses in children, with an emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging and clinical features that are specific to each lesion type.
