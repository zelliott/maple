To explore the correlation between imaging features of solid-pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas (SPTP) and their pathological findings.

Analyze the imaging of 19 patients (female 15, male 4, median age 25 years) who underwent surgery for SPTP, and divide their into solid-predominance type, solid-cyst type and cyst-predominance type to compare with their pathological specimens. All patients plain and enhanced CT examination and plain and enhanced MR examination.

(1) 2 cases of solid-predominance type (11%), 13 cases solid-cyst type (68%), 4 cases of cyst-predominance type (21%). Cyst are located in the surrounding area of solid-predominance type; Solid and cyst are mixed in cyst-solid type; cyst-predominance type are thick-walled cystic tumors with nodules. (2) 12 cases (63%) show obvious signs of haemorrhage and 4 cases (21%) had calcification on CT; All cases (100%) which on MR can be seen signs of haemorrhage. (3) Pathological findings demonstrate SPTP have two ingredients: solid and cystic. However, the two ingredients occupy different ratio in different types. Haemorrhage are seen in all of tumors.

As a sort of neoplasm which preferentially arising in SPTP occur in pancreas of young women, its different types of imaging features related to their pathological findings.
