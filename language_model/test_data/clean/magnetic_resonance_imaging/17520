Cowden's syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal dominant condition featuring multiple hamartomas, often with mucocutaneous lesions, goitre, breast cancer, gastrointestinal polyps or even Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD). In this article we report the case of a 34-year-old man who was diagnosed with LDD. Subsequent examinations also revealed manifestations of CS, i.e. macrocephaly, thyroid nodules and gastrointestinal polyps.
