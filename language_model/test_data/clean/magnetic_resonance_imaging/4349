Case 31 patients with Cushing syndrome are analysed. On the basis of the number of the atypical cells from dark-cell adrenal cortex adenomas, giant-cell adenomas were differentiated as a separate morphological type. Blood concentration of hydrocortisone depends on the cell composition of adenomas. Clear-cell adenomas can be hormone-active and hormont-inactive. The quantitative parameters oblained NMR-tomography, allow detecting morphological type of the tumor with greaf accuracy.
