A tethered cord (TC) has been reported in as much as 50% of the patients affected by anorectal malformation (ARM). No guidelines for timing and modality of diagnosis and treatment have been established. We present the preliminary results of a multidisciplinary protocol carried out at our center.

Seventy-four ARM patients underwent spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All TC patients underwent videourodynamic (UD), somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs), and neurological examination at baseline and, if normal, at 5 and 10 years of age. Conversely, when UD or SEP abnormalities were detected the follow-up was individually tailored at shorter time.

25/74 patients had a neuroradiological TC (33.7%). Based on the results of UD, SEP, and neurological status, four patients were untethered, eight are possible candidates, nine are stable, and four were excluded because of incomplete data.

Tethered cord is frequent in ARM patients. Because neurological deficits secondary to TC can contribute to neurological disability, we recommend routine MRI examination and a multidisciplinary program of follow-up in cases of TC. Preliminary results suggest the combined use of SEPs and UD could represent a useful adjunct to clinical examination in patients in whom a "wait and see" approach is preferred to the prophylactic surgery.
