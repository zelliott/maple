We report on four patients with unilateral tremor stemming from cerebrovascular accidents. In two patients with proven lesions of the thalamus, the tremor was irregular and, in addition, there was dystonic posturing of the affected arm. Tremor and dystonic posturing had appeared after the stroke. In the other two patients tremor had occurred immediately at the onset of the stroke and lasted only a few days. The tremors were of small amplitude and high frequency, and lesions could not be found on CT or MRI in these two patients. None of our patients showed signs of the so-called rubral tremor.
