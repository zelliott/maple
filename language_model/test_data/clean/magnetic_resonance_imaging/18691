The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between balancing-side occlusal contact patterns and the prevalence of the internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Forty-one patients were used for the magnetic resonance image (MRI) analysis of TMJ and occlusal examination. Balancing-side occlusal contact patterns observed during mandibular lateral excursive movements were classified into the three following categories: group A, simultaneous balancing-side contact, group B, balancing-side contact (with clenching only) and Group C, no balancing-side contact (with or without clenching). By the occlusal examination of 57 sides, 31.6% showed group A, 8.8% showed group B and 59.6% showed group C contact. Group A could not be observed in the patient group with normal disc position. In the disc displacement group, the prevalence of group A, group B and group C were 40.9, 6.8 and 52.3%, respectively. The higher prevalence of simultaneous balancing-side contact was revealed to be associated with articular disc dislocation.
