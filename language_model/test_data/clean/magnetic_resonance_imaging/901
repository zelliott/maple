The purpose of this study was to find a robust nonverbal paradigm to obtain reliable, reproducible auditory activation and characterize the nonverbal activation of the auditory cortex in regard to the Brodmann regions. The extent of localization and lateralization of activation was investigated utilizing functional magnetic resonance (fMR). Two tasks were used: monotonous repetitive stimuli of "double octaves" (DO) consisting of alternating four A with four C piano notes and a variated string of "sequential notes" (SN), which was a fast nonrepetitive sequence of piano notes. Eleven volunteers were investigated. The activation periods had a duration of 30 s, and presented every 30 s. All subjects demonstrated fMRI signal activity in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) involving the primary and secondary auditory cortex except one subject who showed no activation with the DO stimulus. SN elicited more activation than DO (p =<.03). The bulk activation for SN and DO was slightly greater in the right hemisphere, although the primary auditory area (Brodmann's 41) was better activated on the left p =<.001. Brodmann's area 22 was most frequently right-side dominant (p =.015, p =.017 for DO and SN, respectively). These findings appear to have implications in the examination of preverbal subjects.
