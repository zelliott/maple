Accurate assessment of mitral regurgitation (MR) severity is important for clinical decision making, prognostication, and decisions regarding timing of surgical intervention. The most common method for noninvasive assessment of MR has been with 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography, which is often used as a qualitative tool. Several newer noninvasive modalities including 3-dimensional echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and cardiac computed tomography have also become available for this purpose; however, their role in routine clinical practice is not clearly defined. In this review, we provide an overview of these newer modalities for quantitative assessment of MR severity.
