Myelopathy is, frequently, the first manifestation of a multiple sclerosis (MS), being the acute transverse mielitis, partial or incomplete, the habitual clinical syndrome. Other sensitive symptoms with an origin in the spinal cord as 'steroanesthesia', 'pseudo-athetosis' or 'pseudo-radiculopathy' have been described as unusual form of presentation in MS, but not the 'pseudo-polyneuropathy', perhaps in relation with its rapid progression in an acute transverse mielitis or other sensory pattern.

We presented two patients with a 'pseudo-polyneuropathy' pattern as the first manifestation of MS. In the two cases magnetic resonance imaging showed a cervical lesion of spinal cord with a probably inflammatory origin and other similar lesions in the brain. Neurophysiological studies were normal. We think that the 'pseudo-polyneuropathy' could be caused by an antero-lateral demyelinating process in the cervical spinal cord, with affectation of the anterior comissure and the ventral portion of lateral spinothalamic pathway.

The 'pseudo-polyneuropathic' syndrome is uncommon form of presentation of MS in young people. We may be capable of recognize the 'pseudo-polyneuropathy' with spinal origin and early choose the appropriate complementary examinations for a correct diagnosis and therapy.
