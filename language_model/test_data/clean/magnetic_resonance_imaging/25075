To describe the patient presentation, radiographic findings, and treatment results in a series of eight patients with a diagnosis of intralabyrinthine schwannoma, and to review the presentation of other cases of intralabyrinthine schwannoma in the English otolaryngologic literature.

Retrospective review of patient records, operative reports, and radiologic studies, and review of the literature.

Eight patients with a variety of otologic symptoms including progressive hearing loss, episodic vertigo, and tinnitus were found to have a schwannoma involving the vestibule or cochlea. Surgery was performed to remove the tumors from four patients with nonserviceable hearing. The patients experienced significant improvement in their vertigo and tinnitus after surgery. Observation and serial magnetic resonance imaging were adequate treatment of the four patients with serviceable hearing. In the literature review, 447 cases of intralabyrinthine schwannoma were identified, and the presentations were similar to those in the cases described here.

Intralabyrinthine schwannomas are rare tumors that arise from the distal portion of either the vestibular nerve or the cochlear nerve. Consequently, the cochlea, the semicircular canals, the vestibule, or a combination of these structures may become involved with these lesions. Transmastoid labyrinthectomy or a transotic approach can be used to remove intralabyrinthine tumors from patients with nonserviceable hearing and severe vertigo or tinnitus. In addition, these surgical approaches should be used if the tumor grows to involve the internal auditory canal. Observation is an appropriate option for patients who have serviceable hearing.
