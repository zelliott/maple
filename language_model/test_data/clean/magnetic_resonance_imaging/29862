Neurological involvement occurs rarely with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Only a few cases of transverse myelopathy have been reported in the setting of SSc.

To describe a patient with SSc who developed transverse myelitis that improved during a course of immunosuppression.

A 30-year-old woman with SSc presented with subacute onset of bilateral lower extremity weakness and numbness. Results of magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies supported a diagnosis of transverse myelitis. The patient responded favorably to a course of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. No overlapping autoimmune disorders were evident. Clinical follow-up showed significant recovery, with resolution of radiological abnormalities.

Transverse myelitis can occur as a rare manifestation of SSc and may respond favorably to immunosuppressive therapy.
