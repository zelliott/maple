A 23-year-old female with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and a growth-hormone (GH)-producing pituitary adenoma is described. A reduction in the elevated GH levels to normal levels following the administration of dopaminergic agents decreased plasma insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and ovarian dysfunction. Menstrual cycles were therefore restored and the number of ovarian cysts reduced, suggesting that insulin and/or IGF-1, stimulators of theca cell proliferation, may be pathogenetic factors in PCOS.
