An unusual case of an exophytic spindle-cell carcinoma of the maxilla arising from an area of erythroplakia is presented. The epithelial nature of the spindle cells was demonstrated by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. After initial surgery the tumour recurred and was then extensively infiltrative and rapidly destructive. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an invasive tumour of the contra-lateral maxillary antrum suggesting a multicentric origin.
