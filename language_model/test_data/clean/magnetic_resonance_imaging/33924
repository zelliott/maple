NF2 is a distinct entity characterized by bilateral eighth-nerve schwannomas, other intracranial schwannomas and meningiomas, and multiple spinal canal schwannomas, meningiomas and gliomas. Screening of the entire neural axis is mandatory because of the incidence of asymptomatic lesions. MRI is the technique of choice, particularly employing contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted sequences in multiple image planes.
