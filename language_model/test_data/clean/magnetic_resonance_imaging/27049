The Cabrol technique is reserved where the conventional 'button' or Bentall techniques fail to maintain a tension-free anastomosis between the coronary arteries and aortic conduit. However, the side-to-side anastomosis of the interposition graft that connects the coronary ostia with the aorta in the Cabrol, may lead to kinking or tension, and subsequent occlusion. We present a case of successful Cabrol modification in a patient with bicuspid aortopathy where the graft to the right coronary artery was anastomosed directly onto the valved conduit and the graft to the left main stem onto the previous right aortocoronary graft in a T-fashion.
