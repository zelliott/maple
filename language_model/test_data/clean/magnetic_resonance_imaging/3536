The rotator interval is an anatomically defined triangular area located between the coracoid process, the superior aspect of the subscapularis, and the anterior aspect of the supraspinatus. It is widely accepted that the rotator interval structures fulfill a role in biomechanics and pathology of the glenohumeral joint and long head biceps tendon. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the biomechanical details and the indications for treatment. A better understanding of rotator interval anatomy and function will lead to improved treatment of rotator interval abnormalities, and guide the indications for imaging and surgical intervention.
