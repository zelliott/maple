The purpose of this study was to compare structural variations of the temporomandibular joint anatomy between symptomatic patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction and asymptomatic controls.

There were 74 symptomatic patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction, 29 asymptomatic volunteers with normal joints, and 6 asymptomatic volunteers with disk displacement with reduction included in this study. All subjects had bilateral high resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans performed in the sagittal (closed and opened) and coronal (closed) positions. All subjects had right and left full profile laminagraphs, one in the centric occlusal position, and one with the incisors edge to edge.

Student-Newman-Keuls tests demonstrated no significant angular or linear differences for depth of the articular fossa, angle of the articular eminence, horizontal and vertical overlap of the incisor teeth, and linear condylar translation.

This study concludes that there are no significant differences in angular and linear measurements in the articular fossa of asymptomatic volunteers and symptomatic subjects with temporomandibular joint dysfunction.
