A 61-year-old man with a history of cerebellar infarction was transferred to our hospital for the treatment of vertebral artery (VA) stenosis. The VA dissection was treated with endovascular stent placement followed by coil embolization in which shrinkage of the dissecting aneurysm was confirmed by the three-dimensional driven equilibrium (3D DRIVE) sequence. Using 3D DRIVE, the outer contour of the aneurysm was well visualized, free from the influence of the metallic devices. 3D DRIVE may be useful in the follow-up assessment of the vertebrobasilar artery after stent-assisted coil embolization.
