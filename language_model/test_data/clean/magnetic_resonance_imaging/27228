To assess the correlations between parameters measured on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in rectal cancer.

To assess the correlations between parameters measured on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and FDG-PET in rectal cancer.

Significant correlations were only demonstrated between k(ep) and SUVmax (r = 0.587, P = 0.001), and k(ep) and SUVmean (r = 0.562, P = 0.002). No significant differences were found in imaging parameters between well, moderately and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma groups. However, there was a trend that higher imaging values were found in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas.

Positive correlations were found between k(ep) and SUV values in primary rectal adenocarcinomas suggesting an association between angiogenesis and metabolic activity and further reflecting that angiogenic activity in washout phase is better associated with tumor metabolism than the uptake phase.
