Neuronal activation leads to an increase in the local cortical perfusion. The exact regulatory mechanisms leading to these changes are still unknown. To elucidate the role of oxygen in the initial hemodynamic regulation, a disactivation paradigm was performed with fMRI. A stimulus was applied following a previous extended activation in order to evoke physiological variations of the local oxygen concentration. The results demonstrate that the initial hemodynamic response time is independent of the local blood oxygen concentration.
