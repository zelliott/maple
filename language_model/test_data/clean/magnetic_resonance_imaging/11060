Fifty normal noninfarct patients and 12 cases with infarcts of the cerebrum were examined with routine magnetic resonance imaging and echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging. The diffusion-weighted three-dimensional images were reconstructed with volume-rendering processing on workstation. Precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobule, superior frontal gyrus, precentral sulcus, central sulcus, postcentral sulcus, intraparietal sulcus and superior frontal sulcus were best shown of all structures with an arbitrary score of 2.61-2.77. Supramarginal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and lateral sulcus were clearly shown in the majority of the cerebra with average scores of 2.0-2.49; angular gyrus, inferior frontal sulcus and superior temporal gyrus were not demonstrated satisfactorily and their average scores were 1.67-1.89. Middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, superior temporal sulcus and inferior temporal sulcus were difficult to identify, and thus had average scores of 0.87-1.26. Brain surface structures were better displayed in the older group of individuals than in the younger group. The structures in the 12 cases with acute or chronic cerebrum infarcts were also satisfactorily demonstrated with this new technique.
