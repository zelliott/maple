The histiocytoses are a rare but diverse group of disorders, ranging from localised, self-limiting lesions to disseminated, fulminant, multi-system disease. Some histiocytoses may cause or present with neurological disease and their recognition can be challenging. We illustrate this with a case, followed by a discussion of the clinical characteristics and management of the more common histiocytoses that may present to the neurologist.
