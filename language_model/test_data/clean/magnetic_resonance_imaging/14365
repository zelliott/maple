Recent developments have shown that diffusion and blood microcirculation (perfusion) could be imaged and measured noninvasively by MRI. The purpose of this presentation is to overview the different approaches that use B0 field gradients to monitor diffusion/perfusion. The principles of these different methods are discussed together with their limitations and their potential applications.
