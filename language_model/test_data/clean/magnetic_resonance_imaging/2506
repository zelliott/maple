Magnetic resonance imaging of 16 patients with contiguous discitis and osteomyelitis provided a specific diagnosis and defined the anatomic extent of vertebral and soft-tissue involvement. Altered signal changes were evident in the disc, adjacent vertebra in the end plate and metaphyseal equivalent regions, and the anterior prevertebral tissues. Significant posterior spread and disc herniation were not evident. Fourteen patients had lumbar involvement; two had cervical involvement. The patients were followed-up for an average of 4 years 5 months. Scoliosis has developed in one patient, and four continue to have a loss of lumbar lordosis. By comparing serial roentgenograms, the mean decrease of disc-space height after the acute episode was 43% (range, 51-61%). There was no restitution of normal disc-space height at the latest follow-up roentgenogram in any of the patients. A 14% (average) narrowing of the vertebral foramina was evident in seven cases. In one patient, a fusion progressively developed 7 years after the acute episode (before full skeletal maturity). However, several patients appear to be progressing toward fusion of adjacent vertebra. A study of histologic specimens elucidated vascular anatomy of the immature vertebra that further explain the disease characteristics.
