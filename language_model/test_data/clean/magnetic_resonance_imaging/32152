Barth syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by dilated cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, growth retardation, and skeletal myopathy. We describe a case of acute stroke owing to Barth syndrome that required intra-arterial thrombolysis. This case suggests that cardiovascular complications can be observed in patients with Barth syndrome. Stroke prevention measures, including the use of antithrombotic agents, might be warranted.
