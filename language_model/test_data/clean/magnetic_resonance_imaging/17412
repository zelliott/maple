In the population of pregnant women in Serbia and Montenegro, hemorrhoids are present in 85% of the cases during the second and third pregnancy. Urged by the complications of non-treated hemorrhoids, we carried out a routine diagnostic procedure to examine hemorrhoids during pregnancy, i.e. a differential diagnosis with other possible complications was performed. Fifty patients, aged between 36 and 38, were examined by anoscope and rectoscope during the second trimester. Rectal carcinoma was found in three cases, which is a disturbing number. The patient with the most serious clinical picture was subjected to urgent artificial fetal lung maturation and surgical delivery. One of the patients had clinical cachexia, and in view of the fact that the magnetic resonance imaging during pregnancy showed infiltration and that the patient was 38 years old, with the patient's consent, surgery was performed together with hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy and immediate removal of the rectum and anus. In the other two cases, the delivery ended vaginally between the 35th and 38th week of gestation, after which the patients were moved to the surgery ward. Besides a positive family history for digestive tract carcinoma (95%), smoking and increased body mass index, there were no significant parameters distinguishing these three patients from others with hemorrhoids. Interesting data were obtained from the fact that there was no increase in body mass during pregnancy which patients correlated with their already present obesity. Moreover, pain was correlated with the fact that the patients did not follow a healthy dietary regime. In all 50 patients, the following procedures were performed: anoscope, rectoscope and digestive tract tumor markers. Observing the results of the biopsies, we found rectal carcinoma Stage C according to Dukes staging (tumor included serosa) in one case. In the other two cases, Stage B1 carcinomas were found (which included all layers except serosa). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed and confirmed progression of the disease. The delivery ended per vias naturalis in two cases in view of the fact that it was the third pregnancy for both patients. Surgery was performed 40 days after delivery. Postoperative recovery was unremarkable in all described cases.
