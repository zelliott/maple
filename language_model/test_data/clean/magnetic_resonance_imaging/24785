Patients with magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI)-negative (or 'nonlesional') pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy are the most challenging group undergoing presurgical evaluation. Few large-scale studies have systematically reviewed the pathological substrates underlying MRI-negative epilepsies. In the current study, histopathological specimens were retrospectively reviewed from MRI-negative epilepsy patients (n=95, mean age=30 years, 50% female subjects). Focal cortical dysplasia cases were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and Palmini et al classifications. The most common pathologies found in this MRI-negative cohort included: focal cortical dysplasia (n=43, 45%), gliosis (n=21, 22%), hamartia+gliosis (n=12, 13%), and hippocampal sclerosis (n=9, 9%). The majority of focal cortical dysplasia were ILAE type I (n=37) or Palmini type I (n=39). Seven patients had no identifiable pathological abnormalities. The existence of positive pathology was not significantly associated with age or temporal/extratemporal resection. Follow-up data post surgery was available in 90 patients; 63 (70%) and 57 (63%) attained seizure freedom at 6 and 12 months, respectively. The finding of positive pathology was significantly associated with seizure-free outcome at 6 months (P=0.035), but not at 12 months. In subgroup analysis, the focal cortical dysplasia group was not significantly correlated with seizure-free outcome, as compared with the negative-pathology groups at either 6 or 12 months. Of note, the finding of hippocampal sclerosis had a significant positive correlation with seizure-free outcome when compared with the negative-pathology group (P=0.009 and 0.004 for 6- and 12-month outcome, respectively). Absence of a significant histopathology in the resected surgical specimen did not preclude seizure freedom. In conclusion, our study highlights the heterogeneity of epileptic pathologies in MRI-negative epilepsies, with focal cortical dysplasia being the most common finding. The existence of positive pathology in surgical specimen may be a good indication for short-term good seizure outcome. There is a small subset of cases in which no pathological abnormalities are identified.
