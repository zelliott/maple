To evaluate the efficacy of integration of metabolism images into multimodal neuronavigation for frameless stereotactic biopsy.

From January to December 2012, 32 patients with brain lesions underwent frameless stereotactic biopsy guided by positron emission tomograph (PET) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS)-based multimodal neuronavigation and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI). The cohort consisted of 16 male and 16 female patients, with a mean age of 45 years (range: 7 - 62 years). Biopsy targets were identified according to PET and (1)H-MRS. Biopsy was performed with Varioguide frameless biopsy system. Diagnostic yield and complications were assessed.

Metabolism images-based multimodal neuronavigation and iMRI were successfully implemented in all cases. iMRI confirmed accuracy of biopsy targets. All the specimens obtained pathological diagnosis, the diagnostic yield was 100%. In 1 patient, iMRI found small hematoma (< 5 ml), surgical evacuation wasn't needed with intraoperative complication rate 3.1%. With the help of multimodal neuronavigation, no patients had new or worsened neurologic deficits.

Integration of metabolism images into multimodal neuronavigation provide not only anatomical, but also metabolic and functional information for frameless stereotaxy, increasing diagnostic yield and avoiding postoperative neurologic deficits.
