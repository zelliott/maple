Superficial femoral artery muscular branch avulsion may occasionally be associated with blunt trauma in the absence of fractures or even minor injuries. Spontaneous rupture of the superficial femoral artery or its muscular branches is extremely rare, with only five previously reported cases. We report the first case of bilateral spontaneous rupture of the muscular branch of the superficial femoral artery with pseudoaneurysm formation in a young, healthy patient. The patient denied any history of trauma to both his lower limbs. On both occasions, the patient had early surgical intervention with open evacuation of the hematoma and ligation of the avulsed artery. The patient recovered completely without any postoperative complications.
