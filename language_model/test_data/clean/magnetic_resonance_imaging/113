The double posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) sign is seen on a midline sagittal MR image of the knee as a low-signal-intensity linear band paralleling the antero-inferior part of the PCL. Although the sign has a high specificity for a displaced bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus, it can be mimicked by several normal and abnormal structures in the intercondylar region. Familiarity with these variants and identifying the other features supportive of meniscal injury will help to make a confident diagnosis of bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus.
