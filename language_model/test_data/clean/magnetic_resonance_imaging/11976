The cerebral involvement of a 13-yr-old boy with Wilson's disease was serially evaluated during the first 18 mo of D-penicillamine treatment. An ultra-low-field magnetic resonance imaging (ULF MRI) system, operating at 0.02 T, with computerized image processing was used. The half-yr period prior to the clinical diagnosis was set, the patient had showed poor school performance, emotional lability, deteriorating handwriting, progressively slow, gross, and fine motor functions, and a fixed rigid smile. No overt signs of liver disease were found. With D-penicillamine treatment (1-1.5 g/d) a continuous improvement was seen. The pretreatment MRI investigation showed pronounced pathological transformation in the basal ganglia. However, changes were seen also in most other parts of the brain indicating diffuse involvement. During treatment the computerized MR images became gradually more normal. The current magnetic resonance imaging system with computerized image processing is a sensitive and simple method for evaluation of subtle parenchymal changes of the brain.
