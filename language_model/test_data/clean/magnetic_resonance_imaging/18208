The aim of the study is estimation of compatibility between morphological and functional results obtained from two independent evaluations used nowadays in cardiology procedures: echocardiography and Cardio MR. 48 patients were examined (24 fema les and 24 males) from 37 to 75 years of age (mean age was 56 years) with diagnosed cardiac hypertrophy in the course of 2nd and 3rd degree primary hypertension. All patients from this gro up underwent echocardiography exami nation obtained from two independent evaluations, using 2.5 M Hz transducer. Also all the patients underwent Cardio MR examination using MR 1.5 T Signa Excite (GE) system, obtained from two independent evaluations. Dedicated software was used for post-processing (MASS). The same left ventricular mor phological and functional parameters. were assessed in both procedures. Analysis of differences between results obtainedfromtwo independent doctors of the same parameter for each method separately was performed. It was assu med, that the method there were less differences between results obtained from two examiners foreach parameter, was more objective. Statistically significant differences in measurements between different examiners in echocardiography was demonstrated of the following left ven tricular parameters: LV end-diastolic diameter (LVDd), LV end-systolic dia meter (LVSd), end-diastolic long axis (LD), end-systolic long axis (LS), end diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction (EF) and left ventricular mass (LVM). No statistically significant differences in measurements between both exami ners in Cardio MR for all measured LV parameters was demonstrated. Cardio MR examination is the procedure, where the result not depends on the operator.
