Foot drop is commonly caused by lumbar radiculopathy, peroneal nerve injury, spinal stenosis and other systemic diseases. It is usually thought as peripheral etiology, but it could be attributed to a central lesion, too. However, central lesions are rarely reported. We report a case diagnosed as a left parasagittal parietal tumor, in which drop foot was the only abnormal neurologic finding.
