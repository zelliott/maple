The aim of this study was to assess the spectrum of radiographic findings in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The study group consisted of 16 women and 7 men whose Ca levels were at least two or three times higher than normal. The average age was 55.3 in women and 49.4 in men. We detected carcinoma in 1, hyperplasia in 1, multiple adenomas in 4, single adenoma in 17 patients. The most common finding in the skeletal system was the decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and the complete loss of the lamina durae dentium. BMD was found lower in women than in men. This result attributed the increased number of postmenopausal patients in our study group. The second most common finding in our study group was subperiosteal bone resorption. Brown tumors (BTs) were located at maxilla in one, widespread in one, mandibula in two, long tubular bones in four patients. Renal stone disease was found in five, spastic colon in two, gastric ulcer in one, mitral valve calcification in one patients. We demonstrated no pathologic changes consistent with PHPT in remaining seven patients.
