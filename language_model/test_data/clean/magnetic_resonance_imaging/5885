Various splenic inflammatory pseudotumours are reported to be infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is thought to be associated with the pathogenesis of the lesion. The term "inflammatory pseudotumour (IPT)-like follicular dendritic cell tumour", all cases of which are also EBV positive, has recently been proposed. Here, we describe the imaging findings of these splenic tumours and present the cases of an IPT-like follicular dendritic cell tumour and two EBV-positive inflammatory pseudotumours in two female patients and one male patient. These splenic lesions were found incidentally on pre-operative or post-operative screening or at medical check-up. CT performed on all three patients revealed low-density solitary masses in the spleen. MRI was performed on one patient; the solitary mass demonstrated isointensity on T(1) weighted images and low intensity on T(2) weighted images relative to the surrounding splenic parenchyma. Dynamic MRI study revealed that the mass did not enhance on the early phase but enhanced to the same degree as the surrounding splenic parenchyma on the delayed phase. The imaging findings are almost identical to those found in conventional IPT because the morphology is similar in both cases; however, attention should be paid to this new entity in the diagnosis of splenic lesions because of its neoplastic nature. Longer follow-up is also necessary for these patients compared with those with conventional IPT.
