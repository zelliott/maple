New onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) is a relatively novel concept used to describe a cohort of previously healthy young adults mostly women presenting with denovo refractory status epilepticus which has a miserable impact on the outcome. Various infectious and non-infectious causes have been considered to be responsible for this dreaded syndrome; however, many a times the exact cause is not identified. As therapy with antiepileptic and anaesthetic drugs is not so successful, identifying and treating the exact cause could improve the outcome. Here the authors describe a woman who presented with NORSE. Investigations confirmed the diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) and she responded drastically to acyclovir along with complete control of seizures. In this case, NORSE was the presenting feature of HSE and the refractoriness of her seizures was terminated only after treating the exact cause, that is, encephalitis.
