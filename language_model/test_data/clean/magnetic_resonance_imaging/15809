We present a case of delayed presentation of a subdural haematoma causing cauda equina syndrome which occurred 96 hours after a spinal anaesthetic had been administered for an elective total hip replacement in an 86-year-old man. The patient had received low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulation which had been delayed until 12 hours postoperatively. No other cause of the haemorrhage could be identified.
