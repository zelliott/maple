The brain and skeletal muscle of eight adult patients with migraine with prolonged auras or migraine strokes leaving a permanent hemianopic defect were studied by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Biochemical assays performed on muscle biopsy and platelets had revealed abnormal mitochondrial enzyme activities. Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed an abnormally low phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate ratio in all patients, apparently due to decreased phosphocreatine and increased inorganic phosphate contents. Muscle phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed low recovery from exercise in seven patients. Three patients had an increased phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate ratio at rest, and the exercise transfer characteristics were abnormal in four patients for relatively low levels of exercise. The mitochondrial metabolic defects present in platelets and muscle of complicated migraine patients are therefore also expressed in the brain.
