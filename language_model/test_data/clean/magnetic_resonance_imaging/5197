Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a recently described potentially lethal but treatable disorder that often occurs as a paraneoplastic manifestation of ovarian teratomas. We report three women with this disorder who presented with subacute onset of delirium, seizures and autonomic instability. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies were detectable in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid of each patient. Ovarian masses were detected in two patients, and subsequently excised. In the third patient, an empirical bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed and revealed a microscopic neoplasm. All patients experienced slow reversal of the neurological symptoms following surgery and immunotherapy. Our experience suggests that prompt syndrome recognition followed by tumor removal and immunotherapy usually results in neurological recovery.
