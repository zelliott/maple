The magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy findings of extrapontine myelinolysis have been rarely reported. Herein, we present MR spectroscopy findings as well as the conventional MR and diffusion MR findings of an acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient with extrapontine myelinolysis. Advanced MR imaging including diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy may be helpful to exclude other pathologies in the differential diagnosis and make the diagnosis when there is a diagnostic difficulty on cases clinically suspicious for extrapontine myelinolysis.
