With the invention of "open" magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, access to the patient is possible during the imaging procedure. An important application of these systems is intraoperative MRI to control the extent of resection during tumor surgery. Up to now flexible surface coils wrapped around, or placed at each side of the head, were used for imaging. These flexible coils have several disadvantages such as unreliability, interindividual problems, difficult handling, poor hygienic properties, and often unsatisfactory or inhomogeneous image quality. To solve most of these problems, an MR-compatible head-holder in combination with an integrated surface coil for use in a 0.2 T C-shaped magnet was developed. Forty-eight patients with known cranial tumors underwent MRI intraoperatively. In 32 patients (67%), residual tumor was found, and additional surgical resection was performed. The integrated head-holder/coil is a safe and practical tool for intraoperative MRI, providing efficient and reliable resection control during neurosurgical procedures.
