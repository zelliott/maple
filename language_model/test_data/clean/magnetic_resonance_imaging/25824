MR imaging of the shoulder has become an important imaging modality for that joint. Excellent soft tissue contrast and multiplanar acquisition provide optimal assessment of muscle, tendons, hyaline and fibrous cartilage, joint capsules, fat, bursae and bone marrow. The most common indications for shoulder MRI are suspected rotator cuff tear, shoulder instability, osteonecrosis, neoplasm and infection. In this article we describe MR technique, special anatomy of the shoulder, and diagnostic MR criteria of common pathologic conditions.
