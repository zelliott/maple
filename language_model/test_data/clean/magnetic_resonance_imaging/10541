The authors evaluated floccular activity with fMRI during the performance of vertical smooth pursuit eye movements in four patients with downbeat nystagmus (DBN) due to cerebellar degeneration and in 16 healthy controls. Region of interest analysis revealed a significantly diminished activation of both floccular lobes during downward but not upward pursuit in DBN. These imaging data support the view that a functional deficiency of the flocculi in downward pursuit causes DBN.
