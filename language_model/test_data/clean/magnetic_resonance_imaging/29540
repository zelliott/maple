Hydrodynamic flow and electric currents through model porous media were investigated. The transport rates through the individual pathways of the pore network are determined by the local width of the pore channels and by the driving mechanism. The model objects represent quasi two-dimensional random site percolation clusters. The calculated design was realized by milling the structure in polystyrene sheets. Velocity maps of stationary flow and current density maps of stationary currents through the cluster were acquired by magnetic resonance imaging methods. The findings were compared to the results of numerical simulations based on the same structure. Since the difference in the transport patterns of the different driving mechanisms are expected to be more pronounced in smaller pore spaces, ultra deep X-ray lithography has been used for the fabrication of downsized model objects with a spatial resolution of better than 50 microm and an aspect ratio as large as 20. First results obtained with these objects are reported.
