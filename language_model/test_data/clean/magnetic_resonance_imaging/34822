We report a functional neuroimaging study of a patient clinically diagnosed with Korsakoff syndrome. Positron emission tomography (PET) with the 15O inhalation method showed decreased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and decreased regional cerebral metabolic ratio for oxygen (rCMRO2) in the bilateral fronto-temporal areas and in the left thalamus. These results suggest that dysfunction of the frontal-thalamic neural network plays a role in the disturbance of Korsakoff syndrome.
