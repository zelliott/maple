We describe the very rare condition of an idiopathic spinal arachnoid malformation associated with syringomyelia (SM) and depicted on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) whose features were confirmed at surgery.

A 34-year-old female suffered from progressive gait impairment because of lower limb palsy and sensory disturbances. MRI demonstrated a bulging membrane at the T6 level that was transversely stretched between the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord and the posterior dura mater. At this level, the spinal cord appeared atrophic and pushed anteriorly against the dura with enlargement of the posterior subarachnoid spaces (SAS) and focal collapse of an associated panmedullar SM. Surgery consisted in releasing the arachnoid malformation and opening the inferior segment of the syringomyelic cavity. Pathological examination revealed a fibro-sclerotic tissue with cellular areas of meningo-endothelial cells. Postoperative neurological status progressively improved but slightly. Three-months and 1 year postoperatively, MRI showed the collapse of the whole SM and restoration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow at the treated T6 level.

Spinal arachnoid malformations associated with SM are very rare and have never been described up to now on MRI. Surgical removal of the causative malformation allows spinal cord decompression and prevents the recurrence of the SM by restoring normal CSF circulation.
