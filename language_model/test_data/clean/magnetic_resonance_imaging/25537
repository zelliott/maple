This review details current efforts to transplant or to replace a meniscus. Different substitutes for meniscal transplantation or replacement have been used with varying experimental and clinical success. Meniscal transplantation emerges as a useful option for selected patients with a stable knee and appropriate alignment. Some long-term studies of meniscal transplantation prove that cartilage protection is possible. Clear convincing evidence that meniscal transplantation or replacement restores the normal function of the knee joint has not been shown. In keeping with the multiple functions and anatomy of the meniscus experience of meniscal transplantation has shown that many aspects have to be considered to achieve successful results. This offers many possibilities for further scientific investigations.
