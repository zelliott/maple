Arthritis of the thumb joints is a common problem and remains a significant cause of morbidity in the adult population. Careful physical examination is critical in the assessment of these patients, given the large differential diagnosis of conditions affecting the thumb and the radial side of the wrist. Because treatment should be specifically directed at the area of pathology, adequate diagnosis is vital. Plain radiograph evaluation remains the diagnostic modality of choice in the evaluation of patients with degenerative conditions about the hand and wrist.
