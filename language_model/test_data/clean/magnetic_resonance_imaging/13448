The relative value of two different MRI procedures for the assessment of infratentorial extension in multiple sclerosis (MS) was studied. Multislice spin-echo techniques were used overall. Procedure A consisted of parasagittal T1-weighted images (500/30) and axial T2-weighted images (2500/30, 2500/120). Procedure B consisted of parasagittal T2-weighted images (1600/35, 1600/90). In the parasagittal T2-weighted images clear visualization of MS lesions is achieved because signal intensities of CSF and normal nervous tissue are nearly identical. All images were performed with a 0.5 Tesla MR system. Data were obtained in 98 patients with definite (N = 30) or probable MS (N = 68). Areas with abnormal signal intensity in the infratentorial regions (brainstem, cerebellum, and/or cervical spinal cord) were identified in 44% of the patients with procedure A and in 64% with procedure B. The standard application of the combination of both procedures improves the sensitivity of the MR examination for the diagnosis of MS, the delineation of infratentorial lesions and the correlation between clinical and MR data without excessively increasing imaging time.
