Cerebral radiation necrosis is a serious complication of radiation treatment for brain tumors. Therapeutic options include corticosteroids, anticoagulation and hyperbaric oxygen with limited efficacy. Bevacizumab, an antibody against VEGF had been reported to reduce edema in patients with suspected radiation necrosis. We retrospectively reviewed 6 patients with biopsy proven cerebral radiation necrosis treated with bevacizumab between 2006 and 2008.

Interval MRI follow-up demonstrated radiographic response in all patients with an average reduction of 79% for the post gadolinium studies and 49% for the FLAIR images. The initial partial radiographic response was noted for up to a mean follow-up time of 5.9 months (6 weeks to 18 months).

Bevacizumab appears to produce radiographic response and clinical benefits in the treatment of patients with cerebral radionecrosis.
