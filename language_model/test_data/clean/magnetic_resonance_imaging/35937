Nineteen patients with rectal carcinoma were evaluated prospectively. The extent of tumor and the relationship of the tumor to the levator ani muscle were studied as this determines the choice of the surgical procedure (abdominoperineal resection versus low anterior resection). Peroperative assessment and detailed evaluation of the pathologic specimens were correlated with magnetic resonance (MR) features. Magnetic resonance staging and surgical findings were at variance in four of 15 cases (27%). Magnetic resonance had sensitivities and specificities of 75 and 100% in the detection of perirectal growth. Magnetic resonance demonstrated invasion of adjacent pelvic side wall and sacrum in two of two cases. The comparison with TNM classification demonstrated that MR correctly staged 15 of 19 cases (79%). This study shows that MR is a good examination to evaluate the involvement of perirectal fatty tissues and adjacent structures. The low prevalence of involved lymph nodes in our cases prevents significant positive predictive values. Nevertheless, MR can help to select patients for local excision or for preoperative radiotherapy.
