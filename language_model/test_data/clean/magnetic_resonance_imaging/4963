To describe in-phase (IP)/out-of-phase (OP) imaging with single shot magnetization-prepared gradient-recalled-echo (MP-GRE) and to compare intra-individually IP/OP MP-GRE with IP/OP three-dimensional gradient-recalled-echo (3D-GRE) at 3.0 Tesla (T).

Thirty-six subjects (15 males, 21 females; mean age 46.97 Â± 14.97) who had abdominal MRI examinations including precontrast T1-weighted IP/OP MP-GRE, IP/OP 3D-GRE were included in the study. Two radiologists independently evaluated the sequences qualitatively for extent of artifacts, lesion detectability, and conspicuity and subjective grading of liver steatosis. Quantitative evaluation was performed by one radiologist and included liver fat index, liver and spleen SNR, and liver-lesion and liver-spleen CNR.

Respiratory ghosting was more pronounced on 3D-GRE (P < 0.0008). The degrees of parallel imaging residual artifacts, shading and blurring were significantly higher on the 3D-GRE sequences (P < 0.0008). Spatial misregistration and bounce point artifacts were only observed with MP-GRE images. Pixel graininess was more apparent on MP-GRE (P < 0.0008). Lesion detectability, confidence, and conspicuity were considerably higher on MP-GRE. Visual appreciation of steatosis was superior on 3D-GRE. Overall image quality was superior on MP-GRE (P < 0.0008).

Higher image quality and improved lesion detectability were present with IP/OP MP-GRE technique. Inversion-recovery prepared techniques may represent an important evolution for precontrast T1-weighted image at 3.0T. The good image quality of MP-GRE sequences acquired in a free breathing manner should recommend its use in patients unable to suspend breathing.
