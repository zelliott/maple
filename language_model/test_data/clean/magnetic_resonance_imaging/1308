The unique properties of magnetic resonance imaging result in the potential to differentiate various components of the diseased arterial wall. In this article four cases are presented in which magnetic resonance imaging showed mural aortic thrombus and its anatomic relationship to the visceral and renal arteries. Once thrombus is identified and localized specific operative strategies can be undertaken to prevent recurrent embolic events and/or avoid perioperative thromboembolic complications.
