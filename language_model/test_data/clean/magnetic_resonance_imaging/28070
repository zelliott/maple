Seven days after ethanol injection, MR images of the liver in 5 rabbits were evaluated by T1, T2-weighted SE and TURBO-FLASH dynamic images. Necrotic area was visualized as low-intensity on T1-weighted images and high-intensity on T2-weighted images. These findings were similar to the tumor that was not treated, so it is necessary to be careful for evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. Necrotic area was not meanwhile enhanced on TURBO-FLASH dynamic images, therefore, dynamic study seemed to be useful for therapeutic efficacy after ethanol injection.
