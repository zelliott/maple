We compared the efficacy of detection of osteodestruction sites by X-ray magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) and multispiral computed tomography (MSCT) in 11 patients with multiple myeloma. X-ray study revealed sites of destruction from 7 to 40 mm in size in all the 11 patients. MSCT using a 64-slice tomograph showed skeletal bone destruction (5-53 mm) and revealed soft-tissue component of the tumour in 2 patients. MRT revealed destruction sites 4-50 mm in size and soft-tissue tumour component in all the patients. The use of MSCT allowed detecting affected sites in cortical and trabecular layers of the bone. MRT revealed the largest number of affected size and their visualization was more efficacious than by two other methods.
