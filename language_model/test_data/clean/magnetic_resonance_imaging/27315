Soft-tissue glomus tumours are benign lesions derived from the glomus bodies, which are specialized arteriovenous shunts that serve a thermoregulatory function and are concentrated in the distal extremities of the dermis. Glomangioleiomyoma is rarely found in the orbit, most likely because of the paucity of smooth muscle and glomus bodies in this location. We report the case of a woman with exophthalmos in whom computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a large, lobulated mass in the right intraconal space.
