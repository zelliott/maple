Although percutaneous fixation with iliosacral screws has been shown to be a safe and reproducible method for sacroiliac dislocation and sacral fractures, it is a technically demanding technique, and one of its contraindications is sacral anatomical variations and dysmorphism. The incidence and pattern of S1 and S2 anatomical variations were evaluated in 61 patients (35 women and 26 men) using magnetic resonance imaging of the sacrum in an attempt to explore the possible existence of groups of individuals in whom percutaneous sacroiliac fixation is difficult due to local anatomy. S1 and S2 dimensions in both the transverse and coronal planes were recorded and evaluated. In each individual, S1 and S2 dimensions both in the coronal and transverse planes were proportional, with S2 dimensions being 80% of those of S1 on average. Patients were separated into 4 groups based on the S1 and S2 body size and the asymmetry of dimensions in the transverse and coronal planes. In 48 patients (78.6%), dimensions in both planes were symmetrical despite the varying size of the S1 and S2 body. In 2 patients (3.3%) there was a combination of large transverse plane and small coronal plane dimensions, with large S1 and S2 body size. In 9 patients (14.8%), coronal plane dimensions were disproportionately smaller compared to those of the transverse plane, with a varying size of S1 and S2 body making effective sacroiliac screw insertion a difficult task. Thus, a preoperative imaging study, preferably computed tomography scan, of S1 and S2 body size and coronal plane dimensions and an intraoperative fluoroscopic control of S1 and S2 dimensions on the coronal plane are suggested for safe sacroiliac screw fixation.
