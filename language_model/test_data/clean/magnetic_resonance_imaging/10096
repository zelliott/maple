The pathophysiology of osteoporotic compression fractures is different from those occurring secondary to traumatic spinal injury, and currently, there is no classification suitable for symptomatic osteoporotic compression fractures treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty. We propose a new classification based on the radiological appearance in the subacute or chronic stage of the clinical presentation of these fractures. They are classified by the authors based on observations and measurements from preoperative and postoperative dynamic lateral radiographs. Compression fractures are divided into two types. Type I is a compression fracture involving the anterior column only. Type II is a fracture involving both the anterior and middle column. Each type is divided into two groups: fractures with union and those with non-union. Type II compression fractures have a higher incidence of non-union than type I (p<0.05). In both type I and II non-union groups, fractures achieve greater increase in vertebral body height after vertebroplasty than both type I and type II union group fractures (p<0.05). In both non-union groups, fractures achieved a greater reduction of kyphotic angle post-vertebroplasty than type I and II union group fractures (p<0.05). Further clinical follow-up of these patients will confirm and extend this classification.
