Gadolinium (Gd) enhancement of lesions indicates inflammatory lesion activity in multiple sclerosis (MS). The question arises whether early inflammatory lesion activity--measured sensitively using triple dose Gd--is related to the future clinical course, or to the development of brain atrophy that is thought to reflect the underlying pathological progression of the disease. In this study, 26 patients with early relapsing-remitting (RR) MS (median disease duration: 1.7 years) were followed up over two years. Associations were explored between their levels of Gd-lesion enhancement in the first six months and later clinical (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and MS Functional Composite Score (MSFC)) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (brain volume, T(2) and T(1) lesion volumes) measures. The extent of Gd-enhancement in the first six months correlated weakly with concurrent relapses (P =0.041), but there was no consistent correlation with clinical and MRI outcomes at two years. More prolonged follow-up is warranted to clarify the relationship between early inflammatory lesions and long-term clinical course.
