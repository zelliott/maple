Two patients with typical tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) associated with cervical or dorsal-lumbar hydrosyringomielia are described for the first time. Syringomielic cavities are small in extension in both cases, leading to significant clinical symptoms as bilateral pes cavus and scoliosis in one patient only. So far, tuberous sclerosis had not been reported to involve primarily the spinal cord, and other factors directly linked to syringomiely are not present in both these patients.
