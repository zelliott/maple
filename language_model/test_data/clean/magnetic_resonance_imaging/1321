The use of MRT in craniofacial pathology has been evaluated above all as regards the possibility offered by this technique for studying the soft parts with better results than already sophisticated investigations like the CT scan. The technique's limitations are the long duration of the investigation, the impossibility of carrying it out in carriers of pacemakers, the inadequate visualisation of the bone and calcifications, the fairly high cost; the advantages are the fact that ionising radiation is not employed, the ureter sensitivity for the soft parts, the good vessel evaluation and the possibility of obtaining oriented sections in every space plane without moving the patient. The use of MRT is therefore rich in prospects.
