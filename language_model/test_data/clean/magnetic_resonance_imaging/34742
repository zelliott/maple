The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of database prescan as an alternative to conventional autoprescan in pediatric brain MRI. Autoprescan parameters [receiver levels and transmit gain (TG)] were analyzed prospectively in 236 pediatric brain MRI studies. Paired t test and linear regression analysis were performed to determine predictability of autoprescan parameters by database-generated parameters. Signal-to-noise ratio, image quality, and potential time efficiency of database-generated parameters were assessed. No statistical difference (P = .13) and a high correlation between the TG of the axial fast spin echo (FSE) proton density (PD) and axial FSE T2-weighted sequences (r = .92) was seen. Strong correlations were noted between the TG of the sagittal T1-weighted and the TG of the axial FSE PD (r = .79), axial FSE T2-weighted (r = .81), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (r = .78) sequences. The receiver levels did not change significantly between sequences. Quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed no differences in the signal-to-noise ratios of the autoprescan and the database-predicted prescan parameters. Implementation of database prescan could improve time efficiency by 28 to 33%. Autoprescan parameters can be predicted by using database-generated information while preserving the diagnostic image quality of the study. Incorporation of database prescan into commercial MRI systems could improve MRI time efficiency and patient throughput.
