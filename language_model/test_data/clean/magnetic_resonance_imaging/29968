To screen for patients at risk for memory decline after temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery, selective amobarbital procedures, such as injection into the anterior choroidal artery (ACA-IAT), are sometimes used. We investigated the extent of the territory affected during ACA-IAT and its predictive value with respect to postoperative memory. Seventeen patients with TLE underwent ACA-IAT. In 9 of 17 patients, intraarterial SPECT co-registrated to MRI allowed delineation of amobarbital-perfused structures. Another subgroup of 9 of 17 patients underwent anterior temporal lobectomy. Verbal memory was tested pre- and postoperatively and during ACA-IAT. Major variations in the ACA-IAT perfusion pattern occurred and were not correlated with the verbal memory scores during ACA-IAT. Postoperatively, no patient experienced a severe verbal memory decline, but individual postoperative performance was not correlated with results during ACA-IAT. Our study suggests that ACA-IAT can be used to screen for severe postoperative amnesia in inconclusive cases, but cannot predict individual outcome, even when the perfusion pattern is taken into account.
