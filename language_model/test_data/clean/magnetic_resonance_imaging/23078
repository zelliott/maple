The amount of resection is closely related to survival in brain tumours. To enhance resection, especially intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been applied. The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to test if intraoperative 3-D ultrasound likewise can be used for resection control.

16 patients, who underwent surgery for intraaxial tumours in non-eloquent brain areas, were initially included into this prospective study. In two patients, the small size of the craniotomy hindered intraoperative ultrasound imaging. In 14 patients, 3-D ultrasound images were obtained before and after opening of the dura, during tumour removal, prior to evaluation by a blinded investigator for identification of tumour remnants, and after dura closure. Seven patients were randomized to complete tumour removal according to the impression of the surgeon (group 1). Seven patients were randomized to incomplete tumour removal (tumour remnant <1cm) (group 2); in these patients, the neurosurgeon intentionally left a tumour remnant prior to evaluation by the blinded investigator. The tumour remnant was then removed. It was tested if 3-D ultrasound can correctly identify complete and incomplete tumour resection. All patients underwent early postoperative MRI.

In two patients (one each of the two groups) the image quality was too poor for a meaningful intraoperative evaluation. In the six patients randomized for incomplete tumour removal, 3-D ultrasound correctly identified tumour remnants in four patients (67%). In six patients randomized for complete tumour removal, 3-D ultrasound confirmed complete tumour resection in three patients. In addition, 3-D ultrasound identified correctly one tumour remnant in a patient randomized for complete tumour removal. Thus, the sensitivity for tumour remnant detection increased to 71% (five of seven patients) and that of confirmation of complete tumour removal was 60 % (three of five patients).

The number of investigated patients is still to low to allow definite conclusions. However, the study results suggest, that 3-D ultrasound is especially helpful for detection of overseen brain tumour tissue.
