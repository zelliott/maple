Aspergillus disc space infection is an unusual complication of the immunocompromised state. Magnetic resonance imaging may aid the clinician in arriving at a prompt diagnosis of discitis in affected patients. We report a case of systemically acquired Aspergillus discitis at multiple levels diagnosed by plain x-ray films, bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and biopsy. We review the literature on this subject and suggest that aggressive diagnosis with early biopsy, treatment with systemic antifungal agents, and surgical debridement of the infected disc space yield the best outcome for these patients.
