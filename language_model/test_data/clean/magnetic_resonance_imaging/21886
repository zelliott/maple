Spinal intradural subpial lipomas are rare lesions. This case report emphasizes the role of MRI in diagnosing this lesion and in delineating its location. However, a dermoid cyst with a high lipid content of mixed triglycerides and unsaturated fatty acids without cholesterol may present the same appearance as an intradural lipoma and cannot be differentiated from it even with the use of short T1 inversion-recovery (STIR) images.
