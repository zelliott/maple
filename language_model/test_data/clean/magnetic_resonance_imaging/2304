Interactive image guidance is now in routine use for open neurosurgical procedures and has demonstrated patient benefits. However, freehand interactive guidance is not an appropriate replacement for the traditional frame-based stereotactic procedures of biopsy, electrode placement, and functional lesioning. These point-based procedures require precise target localization and direct instrument guidance to avoid collateral brain injury. To perform true frameless stereotactic procedures requires a guide that is also adjustable for positioning, lockable, and adaptable to multiple instruments. We describe such a device, which is employed for the guidance of biopsy needles, shunts, electrodes, and endoscopes during neuronavigation. The method of frameless stereotactic biopsy retrieval with an infrared-based neuronavigation system is described, clinical results are given, and further areas of application discussed.
