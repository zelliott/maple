The purpose of this study was to describe tubular intraosseous tracking of contrast medium in the acetabular fossa, to our knowledge a previously undocumented imaging finding in MR arthrography of the hip, and to discuss its prevalence, clinical significance, and possible mechanisms of development.

Tubular acetabular intraosseous contrast tracking is a common MR arthrographic finding that seems to have little clinical significance. Although the exact pathophysiologic mechanism is unknown, we presume repeated pumping of joint fluid through the nutrient foramina of the acetabular fossa may be one mechanism.
