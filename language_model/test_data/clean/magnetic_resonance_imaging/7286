To assess by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if adult non-cultivated bone marrow stem cells accelerate tendon-to-bone healing in the femoral tunnel, after hamstring anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.

Forty-three patients underwent ACL reconstruction and were prospectively randomized into two groups: 20 patients in the experimental group (group A) with adult non-cultivated bone marrow stem cells and 23 patients in the control group (group B) without adult non-cultivated bone marrow stem cells. All patients underwent MRI of the knee at three months after surgery to evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio of the interzone.

There was no difference in the signal-to-noise ratio of the interzone on MRI between the experimental and the control group.

Adult non-cultivated bone marrow stem cells do not seem to accelerate graft-to-bone healing in ACL reconstruction. The clinical relevance of this finding is that adult non-cultivated bone marrow stem cells apparently have a limited role in ACL reconstruction.
