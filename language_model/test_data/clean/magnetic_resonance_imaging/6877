Brown-Sequard Syndrome (BSS) caused by cervical spondylosis (CS) is rare. About 70% of patients with CS presenting with BSS show lesion-dermatome discrepancy, which may be due to spinal cord lamination. From the clinical point of view, this discrepancy should be carefully evaluated and these patients should be treated as an emergency.
