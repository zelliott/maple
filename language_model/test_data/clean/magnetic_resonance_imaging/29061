Salivary gland choristoma (ectopic or heterotopic salivary gland tissue) is a rare condition that occurs in various locations within the head and neck regions. We present a 13-year-old boy with a salivary gland choristoma in the middle ear associated with congenital alopecia around the auricle in addition to facial nerve and ossicular chain abnormalities. Because the lesions commonly involve the facial nerve, intraoperative facial nerve monitoring is helpful in allowing safe biopsy without facial nerve damage.
