Two cases of Kikuchi disease showed variable nodal enhancing features, including homogeneous enhancement and focal or extensive nodal necrosis on contrast-enhanced CT scans. At MR imaging, the area of central necrosis was isointense or hypointense on T1-weighted images and had a lower signal than nonnecrotic areas on T2-weighted images. The CT appearance of Kikuchi disease can be variable and can mimic not only lymphoma but various nodal diseases with nodal necrosis, including metastasis and tuberculosis.
