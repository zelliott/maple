The prevalence of invasive procedures in diagnosing female sexual dysfunctions and pathologies is high. There is a need for a less invasive evaluation tool and medical imaging of the clitoris may be a solution. The clitoris has already been studied with nuclear magnetic resonance but there are very few sonographic 2D and 3D studies despite the fact that it is a simple, noninvasive, and inexpensive method.

This study aims at determining the feasibility of using ultrasound (US) techniques to image the clitoris in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of anatomy for possible use in study.

The ultrasounds were performed in five healthy volunteers with the Voluson GE Sonography system (GE Healthcare Ultrasound, Zipf, Austria), using one 12-MHz flat probe.

The clitoral body's diameter, the length of the raphe.

The three planes-the cross-section, sagittal section, and coronal section-were revealed making it possible to study the entire organ.

The sonography is a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive mean which might help for the evaluation of this organ.
