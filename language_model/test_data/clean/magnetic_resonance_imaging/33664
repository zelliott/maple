An intracavitary probe for magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis has been developed that takes advantage of the "inside-out" spatial characteristics of a birdcage resonator. The probe consists of an eight-leg, birdcage resonator in a low-pass configuration operating in receive-only mode. The resonator circuit is mounted on a solid rod, is encased in Teflon, and has been used to obtain detailed images of pelvic anatomy in a male canine. The approximate cylindrical symmetry of the external sensitivity profile of this type of circuit, employed in an intracavitary application, demonstrates the potential superiority of this type of probe design over single-loop intracavitary coils. Axial, coronal, and sagittal MR images, obtained with 8 and 16 cm fields of view, are presented to illustrate the advantages of this type of intracavitary probe compared with conventional body-coil images. The prototype described in this report has been designed for clinical use in human subjects and is currently undergoing testing to determine its efficacy in the evaluation of rectal, prostate, and gynecologic pathology.
