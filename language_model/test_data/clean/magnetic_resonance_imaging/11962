Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis is generally considered to be most beneficial in those cases where the pelvic sonogram is limited or equivocal. All cases that underwent both sonographic and MRI examinations at our institution for the evaluation of the female pelvis in the past two years were retrospectively reviewed. We reviewed the sonographic and MRI reports and the subsequent clinical management in the 41 cases that had both studies to assess whether MRI contributed to the clinical management decision. Both studies were interpreted independently based upon the known clinical and laboratory data available at the time. MRI was obtained in 21 cases because the sonogram was suboptimal or inconclusive. In the other 20 cases it was obtained for additional information, even though the sonogram was diagnostic. Of the 21 inconclusive sonographic studies, MRI established or clarified the diagnosis in all cases. Of the 20 studies where MRI was obtained for additional information, MRI added useful data that helped contribute to the clinical management of 11 patients. MRI is an important adjunct to pelvic sonography. It established, clarified, or added significant data in 78% of cases.
