Anomalies of cell migration manifest themselves in many ways with various clinical and morphological aspects. Among these, heterotopic gray matter, especially when isolated, is characterized by slighter symptoms and later onset. In this paper eight cases of gray matter heterotopia are presented which have been studied over a two-year period. Magnetic Resonance imaging is emphasised for a correct diagnosis.
