We present findings in a patient positive for the human immunodeficiency virus in whom a prostatic abscess involving the entire gland was diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); he was subsequently treated by transurethral resection, drainage, and antibiotics. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pelvic phased-array coil MRI performed in a patient with prostatic abscess.
