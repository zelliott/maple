Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a rare, locally aggressive, proliferative fibroblastic lesion affecting musculoaponeurotic structures, most often, of the limbs and trunk. Intracranial AF is extremely rare and requires aggressive treatment to prevent recurrence. We present a case of a 34 year-old male with AF involving intracranial structures causing panhypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. Patient was admitted to hospital because of polyuria, polydipsia, and loss of libido, impotence, hearing loss, and gait disturbance. On cranial magnetic resonance imaging, the lesion extended through the sphenoid sinus into the both pterygoid recesses, destroying the left lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus and invading the retroorbital area. There was also a distinct lesion in the hypothalamic area. The tumor was markedly isointense on both T2- and T1-weighted images relative to gray matter, and enhanced strongly after administration of gadolinium. The patient underwent partial resection of the lesion via a transcranial approach. The pathological examination of the mass was reported as AF. No other sites were found to be involved by thorax and abdominal tomography. Hormonal assessment of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction revealed panhypopituitarism with central diabetes insipidus. Replacement therapy was instituted. In this case, standard treatment of wide-field surgical resection was impossible. On the basis of reports that radiotherapy is an effective treatment for this kind of tumor, we administered radiation to the affected area, since chemotherapy and hormonal treatment of non-resectable tumors are not satisfactory. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of AF presenting as panhypopituitarism with central diabetes insipidus.
