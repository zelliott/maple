A patient was reported, who was diagnosed as having tuberous sclerosis in neonatal period. He began to have complex partial seizures at 3 weeks of age. At 27 days of age, brain CT revealed a large high density lesion from the left temporal cortex to the left posterior horn, in addition to periventricular nodules. These lesions were not enhanced after injection of contrast medium. Brain MRI demonstrated more nodular lesions, the intensity pattern of which was different form those in previously reported cases. Ictal EEG showed secondary generalization from left temporal focus, which was compatible with complex partial seizures. In English literature, neonatal cases of tuberous sclerosis with large parenchymal lesions on brain CT were reported by only a few authors, and only two cases of neonatal MRI findings were documented. The neonate with tuberous sclerosis should be carefully evaluated because of the atypical appearance of MRI in rare cases.
