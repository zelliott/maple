Cavernous hemangiomas of the adrenal gland are rare, and we here describe CT and MR features of an additional case including delayed contrast CT.

On CT, the tumor appeared as a well-delineated mass. Fatty areas and calcifications were seen. On delayed contrast CT, a progressive enhancement from the periphery to the center of the tumor was noticed, similar to the contrast enhancement of liver hemangiomas. In T1-weighted MR images, a hypointense tumor with a central stellate area of hypointensity was found. The tumor had a predominantly peripheral contrast enhancement.

CT and MR findings of adrenal hemangiomas are in some cases similar to those of liver hemangiomas. A tumor resection must be considered if the tumor changes in appearance or size.
