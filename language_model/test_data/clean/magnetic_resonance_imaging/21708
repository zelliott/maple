The authors report on an 8-year-old girl who experienced bilateral subdural frontoparietal and interhemispheric empyema following sinusitis. The child improved after initial treatment with a 3 weeks course of parenteral antibiotics. Surgical drainage was further required because of clinical aggravation; however, this evolution was related to bilateral frontoparietal brain edema and abscesses fluid was sterile.
