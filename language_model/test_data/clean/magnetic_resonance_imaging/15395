This study examined if children with cryptogenic epilepsy and complex partial seizures (CPS) have smaller total brain, frontal, and temporal lobe volumes than normal children and how this is related to seizure, cognitive, psychiatric, and demographic variables. Forty-four children with CPS and 38 normal children, aged 5-16 years, underwent brain MRI scans at 1.5 T. Tissue was segmented, and total brain, frontal lobe, frontal parcellation, and temporal lobe volumes were computed. Other than significantly larger temporal lobe white matter volumes in the CPS group, there were no significant differences in brain volumes between the CPS and normal groups. Earlier onset, longer duration of illness, younger chronological age, and presence of a psychiatric diagnosis were significantly related to smaller frontotemporal volumes in subjects with CPS. Although these findings suggest that CPS might affect development of the temporal and frontal regions, we are unable to rule out the possibility that smaller frontotemporal volumes might predispose children to CPS. These findings highlight the need to control for seizure, cognitive, psychiatric, and demographic variables in studies of frontotemporal volumes in pediatric CPS.
