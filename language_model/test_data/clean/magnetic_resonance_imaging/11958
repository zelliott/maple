We reported two operated cases (a 35-year-old male and 52-year-old male) of mediastinal goiter accompanied by marked tracheal deviation. The two patients did not have any clinical symptoms. CT, MRI, ultrasonography and angiography finding of the two cases are presented. Fluid was obtained from the cystic lesions by ultrasonically guided needle aspiration. The levels of thyroid hormones (T3, T4) in the fluid were not high in comparison with serum levels. Surgical resection was performed on the 35-year-old male case by collar incision and on the 52-year-old male case by median sternotomy.
