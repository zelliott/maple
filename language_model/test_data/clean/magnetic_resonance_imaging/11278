To analyze the clinical, radiological, and pathological features which may be useful to differentiate intracranial schwannomas of the facial nerve from vestibular schwannomas.

A retrospective study of 91 patients undergoing surgery with a clinical suspicion of vestibular schwannoma is presented. Clinical and radiological features are analyzed. Immunohistochemistry for neurofilaments was performed in selected cases of unilateral vestibular schwannomas, bilateral vestibular schwannomas, and facial nerve schwannomas.

Facial function was normal in 83% of patients with vestibular schwannoma. Both patients with facial schwannomas had preoperative House-Brackmann grade II facial function. MRI showed no main differences between facial and vestibular schwannomas. A positive immunostaining was found in unilateral vestibular schwannomas, bilateral vestibular schwannomas, and facial nerve schwannomas.

There are no specific clinical, radiological, or pathological factors to accurately differentiate schwannomas of the facial nerve from vestibular schwannomas.
