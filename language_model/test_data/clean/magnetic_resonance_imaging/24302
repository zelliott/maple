The aim of the article is to describe and characterize the hemochromatosis arthropathy of the hand by low-field MRI in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Forty-nine patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (37 with and twelve without arthropathy) were examined clinically and by low-field MRI of the hands. The examination showed heterogeneous degenerative and inflammatory joint changes such as erosions (in 84% of all symptomatic patients), synovitis (77%), bone marrow edema (38%), subchondral cysts (30%), tenosynovitis (30%), joint space narrowing (73%) and osteophytes (59%) including hook-shaped osteophytes at MCP joints (32%). Mild joint changes were also seen in a lower percentage of asymptomatic patients. This is the first larger study addressing the joint changes of the hand in hereditary hemochromatosis using low-field MRI. Our study emphasizes the inflammatory and destructive character of the arthropathy besides the well-known degenerative joint changes described in conventional X-ray. The impact of joint changes in asymptomatic patients deserves further investigation.
