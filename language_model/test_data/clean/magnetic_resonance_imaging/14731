The aim of this study is to find out the development and application of MUC1-expressing ovarian cancer (OVCAR3) by C595 monoclonal antibody-conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) using MR imaging. At the end, its use as a nanosized contrast agent MR imaging probe for ovarian cancer detection was investigated. The strategy is to use SPIONs attached to C595 mAb that binds to the MUC1, to specifically detect ovarian cancer cells. Anticancer effects and MR imaging parameters of the prepared nanoconjugate was investigated both under in vitro and in vivo experiments. The characterization of nanoconjugate includes its size, cell toxicity, flow cytometry, Prussian blue staining test and its cellular uptake as well as its biodistribution, and MR imaging was also investigated. The findings of the study showed good tumor accumulation and detection, no in vivo toxicity, and potential selective antiovarian cancer activity. Overall, based on the findings SPIONs-C595 nanosized probe is a selective ovarian molecular imaging modality. Further subsequent clinical trials appear warranted.
