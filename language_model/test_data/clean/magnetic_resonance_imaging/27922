Sequential radiographic and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations were performed in nine patients with an intravertebral vacuum cleft indicative of avascular necrosis. Progressive changes in the content of the cleft occurred within an hour after the patients were placed in a supine position. Initially, the cleft showed a gaslike pattern during extension of the spine, with a radiolucent band on radiographs and a signal void on MR images. Later, the vacuum phenomenon disappeared on radiographs, and a fluidlike high-signal-intensity pattern appeared on T2- or T2*-weighted MR images, suggestive of a slow fluid inflow within the intravertebral cleft. Because the recognition of a vacuum cleft in a collapsed vertebral body helps avoid confusion with malignancy or infection, it is important to search for this in examinations performed immediately after supine positioning.
