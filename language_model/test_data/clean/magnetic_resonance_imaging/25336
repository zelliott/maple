Pituitary apoplexy may be associated with visual deterioration that may be severe in some cases. Misdiagnosis of this condition is not uncommon, resulting in delayed treatment, which may adversely affect the outcome and visual prognosis. We present a case of pituitary apoplexy, who presented with features of syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and monocular blindness. He had remarkable improvement to normal vision along with normalisation of serum sodium following emergency trans-sphenoidal surgery.
