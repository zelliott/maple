Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive investigation technique that uses non ionizing radio waves of low quantum energy, rendering it suitable for application in children. Monitoring and anesthesia techniques allow MRL including immobilisation in a special incubator to be carried out in small infants. In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides biochemical information on living organisms in a non-invasive manner. Such a technique has recently been used to study neonatal brain energy metabolism. High energy phosphate metabolism and phospholipid metabolism can be evaluated in this manner and available clinical correlations can be made regarding eg seizures or long term neurologic sequelae associated with a decreased phosphocreatine: orthophosphate ratio. Future trends in neonatal MRS will provide further information on morphologic and metabolic brain development.
