The potential technical complications after liver transplantation are numerous. CT is most useful in the evaluation of the hepatic parenchyma and in the identification of perihepatic fluid collections. CT provides complementary data when the sonographic findings in cases with suspected vascular or biliary complications are unclear. The value of MRI in the evaluation of liver transplants has not yet been fully determined. In patients with complex venous hemodynamics MRI can add useful information.
