Peritoneal benign cystic mesothelioma is a rare tumour of unknown aetiology. It usually presents with mild abdominal pain and a solid tumour on physical examination. The differential diagnosis with solid abdominal tumours is difficult. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging as well as aspiration cytology are useful in suggesting the pre-operative diagnosis. We present one case report and discuss this entity.
