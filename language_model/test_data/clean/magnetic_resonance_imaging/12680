In acute encephalopathy with febrile convulsive status epilepticus (AEFCSE), subcortical white matter lesions on diffusion-weighted images are sometimes encountered on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), such as in acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion (AESD). We report here a severe case of AEFCSE following respiratory syncytial virus infection, with emphasis on the cranial MRI findings. MRI in this patient showed widespread T2-hyperintensity along the cerebral cortical gray matter from day 3 to day 22. Lesions with reduced diffusion were noted on day 3 in the deep zone of gray matter of the left occipito-temporo-parietal cortex, but on day 7 they shifted to the subcortical white matter of both the cerebral hemispheres. These MRI findings provide radiologic evidence for damage to the cortical gray matter in AEFCSE. The serial change of diffusion-weighted images suggests that the cortical gray matter may be injured prior to the involvement of the subcortical white matter.
