In many cases, adrenal lesions are incidentally discovered during ultrasonography or computed tomography in the staging or follow-up of patients with primary malignancies. The most important issue in the radiological management of adrenal masses is the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant lesions. Magnetic resonance (MR) plays an important role in the characterization of such lesions. Our aim was to present the MR techniques and to review the MR features of most common adrenal masses.
