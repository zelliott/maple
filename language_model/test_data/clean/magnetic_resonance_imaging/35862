An inflatable surface coil for transrectal magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate was designed. The coil was tested during imaging of an insulated saline phantom and of the prostates of four patients. Phantom images were comparable to those obtained with commercial coils of similar size. High spatial resolution and excellent contrast were noted in coronal images of the prostates. Use of this coil could substantially improve studies of the prostate and cervix.
