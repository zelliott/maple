Discrete metaphyseal radiolucent lesions, often termed "metaphyseal cysts", are a frequent finding in Legg-Calv√©-Perthes disease. Recent literature emphasizes that such lesions represent ectopic physeal cartilage. This paper reports a case in which biopsy of the metaphyseal lesion indicated that no cartilage was present.
