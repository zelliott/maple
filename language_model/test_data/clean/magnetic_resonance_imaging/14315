The effect of treatment on bone marrow infiltration in hairy cell leukaemia was followed by means of MRT in five patients. A semi-quantitative method has been developed in order to judge the effect of treatment. The results correlate well with the findings on iliac crest biopsies. The method could partly replace the invasive iliac crest biopsies, which are used for therapy monitoring.
