Functional MR imaging studies of the brain should be interpreted in the context of their reproducibility. We assessed the reproducibility of visual activation measured by functional MR imaging and analyzed the effect of image transformation to standard space.

Seven healthy volunteers were studied twice with echo-planner functional MR imaging at 1.5 T during visual stimulation. The studies were separated by an interval of 2 to 7 days. Functional images were analyzed after spatial normalization to the space described by Talairach and Tournoux and/or after coregistration of the images of the second study with the images of the first study. The number of active voxels for each study was determined at three thresholds. In addition, the change in the center of the mass of activation, the mean change in signal intensity, and the mean t value within the activated area were measured. These reproducibility indexes were calculated for the spatially normalized and nonnormalized data for each subject.

Variations in visual activation were observed between the two studies in the same individual as well as across subjects. There was no evidence of an effect from image transformation on reproducibility on any of the measures.

Our findings show that the reproducibility of activation in functional MR imaging may be much more variable across subjects than suggested in previous studies. The use of different types of image transformation (coregistration, spatial normalization) does not significantly affect the reproducibility of visual activation.
