Early determination that breast cancer is bilateral and multifocal can change therapy strategy and, subsequently, mortality and morbidity rates. The authors present a case with bilateral, multifocal breast cancer detected only by Tc-99m sestamibi imaging.

Early and delayed Tc-99m sestamibi imaging and dynamic MRI were performed in a patient with a right-sided lesion shown on mammography.

Although early Tc-99m sestamibi imaging detected bilateral breast cancer foci, both dynamic MRI and mammography missed the lesion in the left breast. Additional lesions seen on delayed Tc-99m sestamibi images of the left breast, which were initially thought to be benign, completely disappeared after concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, suggesting multifocal malignant lesions in the left breast.

This case suggests that Tc-99m sestamibi may be useful for detecting bilateral cancer, and delayed imaging may give additional information regarding the possible multifocal nature of the disease.
