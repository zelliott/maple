Giant cell glioblastoma is a histological variant of glioblastoma that accounts for less than 1% of intracranial tumors and to 5% of glioblastoma. They occur at any age and are likely to affect the younger as well the older age group unlike the conventional glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). They are often located subcortically in the temporal and parietal lobes. Cytological descriptions of giant cell glioblastoma are extremely rare. We describe squash cytomorphology of giant cell glioblastoma of left posterior frontal region in 35-year-old male. The squash smears were moderately cellular displaying malignant astrocytic tumor cells disposed in cohesive clusters and dispersed population on a necrotic background. Most striking feature was numerous multinucleated giant cells. We also discuss the differential diagnosis in light of relevant literature.
