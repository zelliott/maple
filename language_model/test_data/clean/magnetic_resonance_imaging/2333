A fusiform aneurysm involving the ascending aorta and aortic arch in an 8-month-old infant was imaged with magnetic resonance. Histologic studies of the excised aneurysm indicated Takayasu's arteritis. Takayasu's arteritis has rarely been reported in infants, and involvement of the ascending aorta and aortic arch is an unusual finding in this age group.
