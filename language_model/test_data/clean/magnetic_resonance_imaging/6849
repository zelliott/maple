A new method of thermoablation with hot water vapour based on a new type of microtube was developed. This approach allows tumours, with volume and anatomical positions not accessible to other techniques (cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, laser ablation) to be treated.

The method was tested on a human colon carcinoma grafted subcutaneously in Swiss nude mice and the experiment monitored under magnetic resonance imaging.

It was found that 2.52 cal s(-1) per cm3 of tumour were necessary to reduce tumour size. The microtube is built to withstand a large range of temperatures and pressures and is biocompatible.

A specific feature of this technique is that, besides hot vapour, several types of drugs can be delivered through the same microtube depending of the location, type or size of the tumour. These properties make it a unique device for multi-therapeutic treatments.
