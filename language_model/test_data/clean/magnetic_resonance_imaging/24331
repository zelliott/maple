In ultra-low-field magnetic resonance imaging, arrays of up to hundreds of highly sensitive superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) can be used to detect the weak magnetic fields emitted by the precessing magnetization. Here, we investigate the noise amplification in sensitivity-encoded ultra-low-field MRI at various acceleration rates using a SQUID array consisting of 102 magnetometers, 102 gradiometers, or 306 magnetometers and gradiometers, to cover the whole head. Our results suggest that SQUID arrays consisting of 102 magnetometers and 102 gradiometers are similar in g-factor distribution. A SQUID array of 306 sensors (102 magnetometers and 204 gradiometers) only marginally improves the g-factor. Corroborating with previous studies, the g-factor in 2D sensitivity-encoded ultra-low-field MRI with 9 to 16-fold 2D accelerations using the SQUID array studied here may be acceptable.
