HRMAS NMR is considered a valuable technique to obtain detailed metabolic profile of unprocessed tissues. To properly interpret the HRMAS metabolomic results, detailed information of the actual state of the sample inside the rotor is needed. MRM (Magnetic Resonance Microscopy) was applied for obtaining structural and spatially localized metabolic information of the samples inside the HRMAS rotors. The tissue was observed stuck to the rotor wall under the effect of HRMAS spinning. MRM spectroscopy showed a transference of metabolites from the tissue to the medium. The sample shape and the metabolite transfer after HRMAS indicated that tissue had undergone alterations and it can not be strictly considered as intact. This must be considered when HRMAS is used for metabolic tissue characterization, and it is expected to be highly dependent on the manipulation of the sample. The localized spectroscopic information of MRM reveals the biochemical compartmentalization on tissue samples hidden in the HRMAS spectrum.
