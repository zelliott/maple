NMR imaging is a well-established technology for obtaining cross-sectional anatomic pictures of organs and tissues. In addition, NMR can provide valuable information about the physiologic state of organs and tissues, especially, as a consequence of cellular injury. With this in mind, NMR in combination with gadolinium-based contrast enhancing agents has been used to assist in the detection of abnormalities to joints as well as to evaluate the status of damage resulting from an injury to this site. We describe the synthesis of a new nitroxide, which is bioresistant to the one-electron reduction mediated by superoxide in the presence of cysteine. This model mimics the reduction of nitroxides by extracellular secretion of superoxide by PMA-stimulated neutrophils. With this nitroxide, we found, in the range from 15 to 17.5 mumoles, enhancement of an NMR image in the knee joint of rabbits. Of interest is the finding that the contrast image remained for at least 90 minutes. These results demonstrate the utility of nitroxides as contrast enhancing agents for NMR imaging of joints.
