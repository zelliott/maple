Utilization of external motion tracking devices is an emerging technology in head motion correction for MRI. However, cross-calibration between the reference frames of the external tracking device and the MRI scanner can be tedious and remains a challenge in practical applications. In this study, we present two hybrid methods, both of which combine prospective, optical-based motion correction with retrospective entropy-based autofocusing to remove residual motion artifacts. Our results revealed that in the presence of cross-calibration errors between the optical tracking device and the MR scanner, application of retrospective correction on prospectively corrected data significantly improves image quality. As a result of this hybrid prospective and retrospective motion correction approach, the requirement for a high-quality calibration scan can be significantly relaxed, even to the extent that it is possible to perform external prospective motion tracking without any prior cross-calibration step if a crude approximation of cross-calibration matrix exists. Moreover, the motion tracking system, which is used to reduce the dimensionality of the autofocusing problem, benefits the retrospective approach at the same time.
