Brain imaging studies in TEP, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have shown that visuospatial short-term memory tasks depend on dorsal parietofrontal networks. Knowing the spatiotemporal dynamics of this network would provide further understanding of the neural bases of the encoding process. We combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) with EEG and fMRI techniques to study this network in a task, in which participants had to judge the symmetry in position of two dots, presented either simultaneously ("immediate comparison") or successively ("memorization" of a first dot and "delayed comparison", after 3 s, with a second dot). With EEG, larger amplitude was observed in the parietocentral P3b component (350-500 ms) in the immediate and "delayed comparisons" than in "memorization" condition, where topography at this time was more anterior and right lateralized. MEG provided a more accurate localization and temporal variations of sources, revealing a strong M4 component at 450 ms in the "memorization" condition, with two sources localized in parietal and right premotor regions. These localizations are consistent with both fMRI foci and EEG cortical current source densities (CSD), but only MEG revealed the strong increase in premotor region at 450 ms related to "memorization". These combined results suggest that EEG P3B and MEG M4 components reflect two different dynamics in parietofrontal networks: the parietocentral P3b indexes a decision mechanism during the immediate and "delayed comparisons", whereas the MEG M4 component, with a larger right premotor source, reflects the encoding process in visuospatial short-term memory.
