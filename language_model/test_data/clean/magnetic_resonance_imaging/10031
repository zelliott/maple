MRI detectable and targeted quantum dots were developed. To that aim, quantum dots were coated with paramagnetic and pegylated lipids, which resulted in a relaxivity, r(1), of nearly 2000 mM(-1)s(-1) per quantum dot. The quantum dots were functionalized by covalently linking alphavbeta3-specific RGD peptides, and the specificity was assessed and confirmed on cultured endothelial cells. The bimodal character, the high relaxivity, and the specificity of this nanoparticulate probe make it an excellent contrast agent for molecular imaging purposes.
