Coupling of the cardiovascular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) system is considered to be important to understand the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular and craniospinal disease and intrathecal drug delivery. A coupled cardiovascular and CSF system model was designed to examine the relation of spinal cord (SC) blood flow (SCBF) and CSF pulsations along the spinal subarachnoid space (SSS). A one-dimensional (1-D) cardiovascular tree model was constructed including a simplified SC arterial network. Connection between the cardiovascular and CSF system was accomplished by a transfer function based on in vivo measurements of CSF and cerebral blood flow. A 1-D tube model of the SSS was constructed based on in vivo measurements in the literature. Pressure and flow throughout the cardiovascular and CSF system were determined for different values of craniospinal compliance. SCBF results indicated that the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar SC each had a signature waveform shape. The cerebral blood flow to CSF transfer function reproduced an in vivo-like CSF flow waveform. The 1-D tube model of the SSS resulted in a distribution of CSF pressure and flow and a wave speed that were similar to those in vivo. The SCBF to CSF pulse delay was found to vary a great degree along the spine depending on craniospinal compliance and vascular anatomy. The properties and anatomy of the SC arterial network and SSS were found to have an important impact on pressure and flow and perivascular fluid movement to the SC. Overall, the coupled model provides predictions about the flow and pressure environment in the SC and SSS. More detailed measurements are needed to fully validate the model.
