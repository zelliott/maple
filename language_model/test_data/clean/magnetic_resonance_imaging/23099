The idea of fMRI activation in white matter (WM) is controversial. Our recent work has used two different approaches to investigate whether there is evidence for WM fMRI. The first approach used words and faces to elicit interhemispheric transfer activation in the posterior corpus callosum (Sperry task). The second approach used checkerboard stimuli to elicit similar activation in the anterior corpus callosum (Poffenberger task). Using these different tasks, it has been possible to detect WM activation in different regions. In the current study, we report the results of a critical experiment: demonstrating that callosal activation can be experimentally manipulated within the same set of individuals.

All subjects completed both the Sperry and Poffenberger tasks. Functional MRI data were acquired at 4T, using an asymmetric spin echo spiral sequence. Data were analyzed with FSL using a model-based approach. Analyses focused on group and individual activations in WM.

Corpus callosum activation was elicited for both tasks, with activation varying according to task type. A statistical contrast of the two tasks revealed posterior callosal activation for the Sperry task and anterior callosal activation for the Poffenberger task. The Sperry task showed activation in the isthmus and middle body of the corpus callosum at the group level and in 100% of subjects. The Poffenberger task showed activation in the genu and middle body of the corpus callosum at the group level and in 94% of subjects. The WM activation replicated prior results, with the additional strength of functional mapping within the same group of individuals.
