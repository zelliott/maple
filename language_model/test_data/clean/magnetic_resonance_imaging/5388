The purpose of this article is to present and discuss the susceptibility-weighted imaging signal characteristics of the normal pediatric brain and those of a variety of pediatric brain pathologic abnormalities.

Its high susceptibility for blood products, iron depositions, and calcifications makes susceptibility-weighted imaging an important additional sequence for the diagnostic workup of pediatric brain pathologic abnormalities. Compared with conventional MRI sequences, susceptibility-weighted imaging may show lesions in better detail or with higher sensitivity. Familiarity with the pediatric susceptibility-weighted imaging signal variance is essential to prevent misdiagnosis.
