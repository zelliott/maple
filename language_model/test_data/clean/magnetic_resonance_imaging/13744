'Brain' attack' is a new term to describe the acute presentation of stroke which emphasises the need for urgent action. The article describes the basis for this new approach to acute stroke treatment. Rational treatment requires individual causes of stroke to be identified early and treatment targeted at the mechanism. Acute stroke treatment aims to preserve the ischaemic penumbra, protect neurons against further ischaemia and enhance brain plasticity to maximise recovery. There is a strong evidence base supporting the routine use of aspirin, but not heparin, in acute ischaemic stroke. There is also convincing evidence supporting intravenous thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in selected patients within 3 hours of stroke onset. Surprisingly, as many as 33% of suspected-stroke patients arrive in Accident & Emergency departments in the UK within 3 hours of onset. New techniques in MR imaging, particularly diffusion weighted imaging, are transforming the approach to diagnosis of acute stroke. Although neuroprotective drugs have proved disappointing, active neuroprotection in acute stroke should include control of blood pressure within certain limits, antipyretic therapy, maintenance of blood glucose, and early feeding and fluid replacement. Surgical hemicraniectomy should be considered in patients with malignant cerebral oedema. There is good evidence that the best way to enhance recovery from stroke is to admit the patient to a stroke unit. To enable patients to benefit from the early active approach outlined in the article, the following are needed: the development of acute stroke units; imaging protocols; and education of patients, general practitioners and the ambulance services. Stroke care has become a specialised field, requiring input from stroke physicians, as well as the multidisciplinary rehabilitation team. The British Association of Stroke Physicians (BASP) has therefore developed a curriculum which is designed to lead to the development of a new sub-specialty of stroke medicine.
