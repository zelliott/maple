Inflammation contributes to brain damage caused by ischaemic stroke. Macrophages, as the prevailing inflammatory cell population in stroke lesions, can be visualized using ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) as a cell-specific contrast agent for MRI. In this single-centre open-labelled clinical phase II study we tested the potential of USPIO-enhanced MRI for macrophage imaging in human ischaemic stroke lesions. In a series of 10 consecutive patients, USPIO contrast agent was infused at the end of the first week after symptom onset. Two follow-up MRI scans were performed 24-36 h and 48-72 h after infusion. Two distinct components of USPIO-related signal changes were discernible, one associated with blood vessels and one representing parenchymal enhancement. Vessel-associated changes appeared as signal loss on T2/T2*-weighted images and decreased from the first to second scan after USPIO infusion, most likely reflecting a transient blood pool effect of the contrast agent. Conversely, parenchymal enhancement was mainly evident on T1-weighted images, increased over time, and matched with the expected distribution of macrophages. Importantly, USPIO-induced signal alterations throughout differed from signatures of conventional gadolinium-enhanced MRI, thus being independent from breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. We suggest that increasing USPIO-enhancement on T1-weighted images indicates brain infiltration by USPIO-laden macrophages. Thus, USPIO-enhanced MRI may provide an in vivo surrogate marker of cellular inflammation in stroke and other CNS pathologies.
