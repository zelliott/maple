Twenty-five consecutive patients with idiopathic spasmodic torticollis (IST) were investigated with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In only six patients (24%) did CT or MRI reveal brain pathology (focal cortical atrophy and lacunary infarcts). No consistent pathological pattern was detected. Consequently, CT and MRI of the brain provides little diagnostic information in this disorder.
