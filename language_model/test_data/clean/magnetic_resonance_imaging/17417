We report a new patient with CDG Ig and review the five other known patients. From the data on this small number of patients, it seems that the association of psychomotor retardation, male hypogenitalism and decreased serum IgG in a patient with a type 1 pattern of serum sialotransferrins might be a clue to the diagnosis of CDG Ig.
