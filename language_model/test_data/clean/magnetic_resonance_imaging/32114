We report a case of pituicytoma, a rare primary tumor of the neurohypophysis. A 64-year-old man presented with progressive visual complaints, bitemporal hemianopsia, and headache. Imaging studies revealed distinctive features of a mass lesion that thickened the pituitary stalk with a bilobed protrusion extending into the hypothalamus. Angiography demonstrated tumor vascular supply from the superior hypophyseal arteries representing the diencephalic branches of the internal carotid arteries. We discuss the imaging and pathology of this unusual tumor.
