A Gd complex based on a polyphosphonated pyridyl ligand shows a very high stability in aqueous solution (log K(EuL) = 25.7), a high relaxivity (8.5 mM(-1) s(-1) at 25 °C and 20 MHz) and a marked and selective relaxivity enhancement (37%) in the presence of Mg(2+), opening interesting perspectives for the design of cation responsive contrast agents.
