A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method was used for a noninvasive study of current density (CD) and current pathways (CP's) inside the skull during transcranial electrostimulation in rabbits. The transcranial impulse current directions studied were those previously used in transcranial electric treatment either sagittally or bilaterally. MRI data were collected from slices perpendicular to the direction of current application. In these slices, only the perpendicular component of the CD was measured. Computer methods for accurate topographic mapping of the main areas with high CD and for reconstruction of CP's are described. It was revealed that current applied on the head sagittally passed mostly through the cerebrospinal fluid in the basal brain cisternas connected in series, and through the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles, foramina of Monro, ventrocaudal part of the third ventricle, aqueductus, and fourth ventricle. Possible connections between these CP's are suggested. Bilaterally applied current passed through the brain and skull core more diffusely without concentrations in cisternas and ventricles. The results of the present study suggest an explanation for the observation that sagittally applied current more effectively stimulates brain structures with antinociceptive function and elicits more pronounced analgesic effect.
