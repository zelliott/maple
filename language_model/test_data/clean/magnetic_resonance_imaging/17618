Paragangliomas are uncommon neoplasms with rare occurrence in the head and neck area.

The purpose of this study was to report the experience of management of these rare tumors by a team of Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) surgeons working in the context of a sub-Saharan country.

We conducted a retrospective study in the Ear, Nose and throat Department of a Dakar university hospital. The study concerned 8 patients with a highly vascular tumor located in the neck and temporal bone. The preoperative investigations were computed tomography scanning (CT scan) using contrast injection in 88% and Doppler ultrasonography for the patients with a neck mass. All the patients underwent surgery except one. In 2 cases, the management with a team of vascular surgeons was necessary. Histological examination of the tumor was realized in all cases.

The tumor was located in the neck in 5 cases (62,5%) with a carotid body tumor in three patients (37,5%) and vagal location in two (25%). The temporal bone was involved in three patients with a tympano-jugular location (37,5%). All the neck masses were operated on via a unique cervical approach. The tympano-jugular tumors were treated by radical mastoidectomy in two patients. In the third patient with a tympano-jugular tumor, with important involvement of the temporal bone, only the neck extension was operated. The histological diagnosis of paraganglioma was confirmed in all patients. Radiation therapy was delivered in two patients (25%), to complete surgery in the event of extensive temporal bone tumor and exclusive in one case of an inoperable vagal tumor. The outcomes, marked early death in one patient (14%), were good in the short and mid term for the others patients.

With the improvement of technological infrastructures, particularly with developing modern imaging, we have better knowledge of paragangliomas in the head and neck area, in our experience in a developing country. However, therapeutic approaches are still limited by modest humans and material resources.
