A patient with a selective deficit in retrieving proper names after left temporal lobectomy is reported. He showed proper name anomia in conversation, in response to photographs, and in verbal descriptions, despite being able to provide semantic information about the people he was unable to name. This report provides evidence that the rostral part of the left temporal lobe plays a crucial role in processing proper names without involvement of other verbal functions.
