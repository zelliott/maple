The LACTRIMS congress at Foz do Iguacu attracted approximately 500 delegates, representing an important medium for increasing awareness of MS within the neurology community in Latin America. It also provided a forum for neurologists in Latin America, who are already diagnosing and treating patients with MS, to discuss ideas and exchange experiences. This year's congress discussed comprehensive management of patients with MS in Latin America, and how best to achieve this within the context of the local healthcare system. An MS Forum Interactive Symposium formed part of the congress programme and gave attendees the opportunity to learn more about the MS Forum and its activities, as well as managing MS.
