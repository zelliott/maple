When patients present to the emergency room with sudden onset of focal neurologic symptoms or altered consciousness, hemorrhagic stroke is a major focus of emergency diagnostic evaluation. The entities that compose hemorrhagic stroke, intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, are readily diagnosed with advanced imaging. This article reviews current imaging options for the detection of acute hemorrhage, along with the expected imaging findings for each modality. Common and unusual causes and their distinguishing imaging features are discussed. Imaging strategies and recent work in specific imaging findings that may guide patient management in the future are also addressed.
