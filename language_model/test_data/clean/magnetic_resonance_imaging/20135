Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is a promising approach in cancer treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the vascular response of human lung tumor xenografts in vivo to RO0281501, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase receptors, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, fibroblast growth factor receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Human non-small cell lung carcinoma (H460a) xenografts grown s.c. in athymic nu/nu mice were treated p.o. with the antiangiogenic agent RO0281501. Treatment-induced changes in tumor volume, epiphyseal growth plate thickness, and microvessel density assessed by CD31 immunohistochemistry were analyzed. Tumor vascular permeability and perfusion were measured in tumors using DCE-MRI with gadopentetate dimeglumine on a 1.5 T clinical scanner to assess vascular function. Treatment with RO0281501 resulted in significant growth retardation of H460a tumors. RO0281501-treated tumors showed histologic evidence of growth plate thickening and relatively lower microvessel density compared with the controls. Regarding DCE-MRI variables, the initial slope of contrast uptake and Ak(ep) were significantly decreased on day 7 of treatment. RO0281501 is a novel antiangiogenic/antitumor agent, which is active in the H460a xenograft model. Its effects on tumor vasculature can be monitored and assessed by DCE-MRI on a 1.5 T human MR scanner with clinically available gadopentetate dimeglumine contrast, which will facilitate clinical trials with this or similar agents.
