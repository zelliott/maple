Single patient case report.

To present and discuss a case of spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma that was not associated with coagulation abnormality.

Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.

Clinical and radiological magnetic resonance imaging follow-up of the patient between August 1997 and December 1998.

The hematoma was initially extensive, ranging from T5 to L3. However, it resolved spontaneously with the subsequent development of an adhesive arachnoid cyst.

Even though urgent surgical decompression is necessary in most cases of spinal subdural hematoma, conservative management could be an option in cases with rapid resolution of the neurological deficit.
