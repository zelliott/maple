Magnetic resonance (MR) images of ameloblastoma are compared with computed tomographic (CT) images with the use of three parameters: artifact degradation, edge definition, and conspicuity. As a basis for comparison, MR imaging characterization of normal tissues is reviewed. The three cases studied demonstrate the importance of weighing heavily on MR for evaluation of tumor-normal tissue interface. MR generally proved to be superior to CT in the evaluation of recurrent disease because of its ability to differentiate tissues on the basis of their proton composition. CT images reflect the electron densities of tissues. Hence, interpreting inflammatory and postsurgical changes and differentiating them from neoplasm may be difficult. At the present time, familiarity with CT dictates that the MR evaluation complement and not substitute the CT evaluation.
