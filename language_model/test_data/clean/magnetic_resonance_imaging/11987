The reconstruction of two-dimensional spatial images with 0.5-mm resolution using radiofrequency gradients generated by an NMR coil system rotated about the sample is demonstrated for 23Na. The method retains chemical shift, should be capable of mapping T1 and T2 information, and might offer sensitivity advantages for nuclides with short T2.
