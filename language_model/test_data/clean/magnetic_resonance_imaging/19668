Congenital cardiac tumors are very rare and fibromas are the second most common type. Fibromas are benign tumors, but they have potentially serious complications. Their antenatal diagnosis is infrequently reported in the literature, and the management of these tumors is a source of controversy. We report the case of a rare form of right ventricular free wall fibroma. Antenatal diagnosis was made at 36 weeks of gestation, with subsequent successful resection at 2 weeks of age. A brief review of the literature focuses on the diagnostic approach and the clinical and surgical management of congenital cardiac fibromas.
