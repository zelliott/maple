Gorham's disease is a rare condition characterized by non-malignant proliferation of vascular or lymphatic structures of bone resulting in progressive bony destruction and often extending into surrounding soft tissues. We present two cases of MR imaging findings of Gorham's disease involving the axial and appendicular skeleton with a 10-year follow-up in one patient. MR imaging findings in this entity are reviewed.
