The vascular system can be evaluated with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), angiography, and computer-based CT image processing systems before successful transluminally placed endovascular grafting (TPEG). Noninvasive modalities are useful, but angiography is mandatory to determine whether TPEG is indicated. During the procedure, fluorography with a wide-image intensifier and high-resolution digital subtraction angiography are known to be essential, but intravascular ultrasonography is also indispensable to achieve accurate TPEG.
