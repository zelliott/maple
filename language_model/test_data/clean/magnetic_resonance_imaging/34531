Metastatic neuroblastoma in the brain without evidence of intracranial or extracranial disease elsewhere, is a very rare event. The pattern of spread is believed to be via the hematogenous route or cerebrospinal fluid. A child with a cystic neuroblastoma mass in the right temporal lobe 23 months following completion of therapy for the initial disease is described here. Chemotherapy with the protocol 'eight drugs in 1 day' was initially effective for this patient.
