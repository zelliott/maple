We report a case of 43-year-old woman with an overlap syndrome of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and dermatomyositis who developed erosive arthritis with extracapsular cysts involving multiple joints. An extensive synovectomy for the left wrist joint and a total joint replacement for the right hip joint were required to achieve complete symptom relief. She was not diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This was a rare case of SLE manifesting non-RA erosive arthritis that required surgical interventions.
