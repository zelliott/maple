Electrocardiogram gated magnetic resonance imaging was performed in nine healthy volunteers, in four patients with pulmonary hypertension, and in 16 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Fifty two short axis images in diastole were examined to assess the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging for the measurement of the thickness of the free wall of the right ventricle and the degree of hypertrophy of the right ventricular free wall in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension. Magnetic resonance imaging gave a clear image of 68% of the length of the right ventricular free wall, showing both the endocardial and epicardial margins. The mean (1 SD) thickness of the right ventricular free wall measured at a total of 512 points was 0.44 (0.12) cm in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 0.29 (0.08) cm in healthy individuals, and 0.73 (0.27) cm in patients with pulmonary hypertension.
