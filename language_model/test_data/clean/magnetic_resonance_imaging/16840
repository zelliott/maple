Secondary involvement of the urinary bladder in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is relatively common; however, primary malignant lymphoma of this organ is extremely rare. The most common type of primary bladder lymphoma is a low-grade B-cell mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. We report here on the imaging findings of a primary bladder lymphoma with bone marrow infiltration.
