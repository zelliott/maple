To discriminate Alzheimer's disease (AD) from healthy controls, the thinnest medial temporal lobe (tMTL) width on 3D-MRI was measured according to a newly developed method at the inter-collicular sulcus (ICS) level with scans aligned to the long axis of the hippocampus in 22 mild, 27 moderate probable AD patients and 41 healthy controls. For comparison, MTL width replicating the technique of Jobst et al. (jMTL) as well as hippocampal and parahippocampal volumes, were also measured. Using logistic regression taking into account age, sex, and education, tMTL width classified mild AD from controls with a sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 95% and accuracy of 92%. Similar values were obtained for moderate or total AD group versus controls. By comparison, jMTL width was only useful in distinguishing moderate AD from controls, and volumetric measures were equally sensitive in classifying mild and moderate AD in our sample. This quick, reliable, and standardized measurement of tMTL can be helpful in differentiating even mild AD from controls with reasonable accuracy.
