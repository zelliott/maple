In a CT- and NMR-study, condylar remodeling after conservative treatment of condylar dislocation fractures in growing individuals was evaluated. The regenerated condyles displayed great similarities. Two condylar parts could be differentiated--one with and one without muscular attachment. The medial part represents the former small fragment and the lateral part a bony outgrowth. One of the patients studied demonstrated a bifid condyle. NMR-records were remarkable in that each of the three patients presented a lateral pterygoid muscle with the two heads oriented one above the other rather than side by side. This does not seem to support the observation made in experiments, that the disc remains fixed to the caput in low condylar fractures.
