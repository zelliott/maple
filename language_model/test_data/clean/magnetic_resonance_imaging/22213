Diagnosis and treatment of 51 cases of parotid tumour seen and treated in King Fahad National Guard Hospital, Riyadh, are discussed here. More emphasis is placed on proper clinical history and physical examination of patients with parotid lump because usually this will provide enough information to the clinician about the nature of the swelling. Imaging studies are helpful in supporting the clinical diagnosis and determining the extent of the lesion particularly in cases of malignant tumours. Fine needle aspiration biopsy needs an expert cytologist for salivary gland neoplasm and the need for proper communication between the surgeon and cytologist is stressed. All 51 cases underwent surgical excision which is the treatment of choice. Follow-up periods were variable and short.
