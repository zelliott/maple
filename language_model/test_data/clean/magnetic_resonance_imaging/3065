With the advent of magnetic resonance fluoroscopic imaging, it is possible to obtain images at a rate which can be considered effectively real-time. Image refresh rates can be as low as 0.5 s. Such rates are fast enough to allow MR to be used for guidance of surgical instruments during micro-surgical procedures. Examples include the localization of biopsy needles within a tumor, localization of surgical tools for application of therapeutic drugs or the proper positioning of optical fibers for application of laser heat. It may also be used for long duration monitoring of a patient in an attempt to diagnose rare and short duration clinical events.
