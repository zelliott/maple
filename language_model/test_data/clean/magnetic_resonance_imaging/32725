Fibers connecting fronto-temporal and fronto-medial structures that pass through the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) subserve executive and psychomotor functioning. Both of these functions are adversely affected in schizophrenia, and may be abnormal at illness onset. In a study of first-episode psychosis, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and cognitive testing to examine ALIC integrity. Fourteen early psychosis patients and 29 healthy volunteers were included. Symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS). All structural and diffusion scans were acquired on a GE Signa 1.5T scanner. A T1-weighted 3D FSPGR Inversion Recovery imaging series was acquired for manual seeding in structural space. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed, and all DTI images were co-registered to structural space. Seeds were manually drawn bilaterally on the coronal plane at a specified location. Diffusion images were post-processed for subsequent Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis. First-episode psychosis patients had significantly smaller fronto-medial and fronto-temporal AIC tract volumes compared to healthy volunteers on the left and the right (p-values<0.04). No differences in mean fractional anisotropy (FA) were seen within either left or right tracts (p-values>0.05), nor did TBSS reveal any other differences in FA values between groups in other regions. Relationships between tract volumes and symptom severity were not observed in this study.
