Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuro-degenerative disease of unknown etiology which results in destruction of myelin. A variety of neurologic signs and symptoms are associated with MS and include myelopathy, extremity weakness, low back pain, sciatica and paresthesias. Many of these signs and symptoms are identical to those experienced by patients with spondylosis (e.g. spinal stenosis, disc herniations). The coexistence of MS with spondylosis can be problematic both for diagnosis and treatment.

During the period 1992 to 1996 we identified 7 patients with previously diagnosed MS who developed new syndromes which were thought to be related to a variety of degenerative spine conditions. The diagnosis of MS was based on standard clinical, immunological and neuroradiological criteria.

Five of 7 patients demonstrated significant improvement after surgery. One patient experienced a transient MS exacerbation after surgery.

From our series we concluded that surgery for degenerative spine conditions can be performed in a safe and effective manner in patients with coexisting multiple sclerosis.
