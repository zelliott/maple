Retrocrural tumors of the lower posterior mediastinum are rare. Most tumors in this region involve lymphatic metastasis of germ cell tumors. Formerly these tumors were resected through a combined thoracoabdominal approach, with division of the diaphragm and effecting an at least partial phrenic paresis. The ventral approach via bilateral subcostal incision with cranial extension avoids this problem and allows a bilateral access to the retrocrural space. From November 1999 to December 2005, using this approach we operated on 12 patients with residual germ cell tumors after chemotherapy. In all cases radical resection was obtained. Intra- or postoperative complications did not occur. All patients are still alive and free of disease.
