Primary leiomyosarcoma of the central nervous system is rare and has been described both de novo and following temporally remote radiotherapy for a different unrelated malignancy. The authors report the case of a 42-year-old man in whom 60Co radiation treatment had been performed for an unknown primary mass in the brainstem 25 years previously. He presented with progressive neurological deterioration after undergoing many years of conservative therapy. A stereotactic biopsy sampling procedure was performed, and examination of the left cerebral pedunculopontine lesion revealed a spindle cell neoplasm. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of the tumor obtained from definitive resection suggested leiomyosarcomatous transformation of ganglioglioma.
