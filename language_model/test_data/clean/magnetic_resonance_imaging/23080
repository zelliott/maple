Intraoperative high-field MRI in combination and close integration with microscope-based navigation serving as a common interface for the presentation of multimodal data in the surgical field seems to be one of the most promising surgical setups allowing avoiding unwanted tumor remnants while preserving neurological function. Multimodal navigation integrates standard anatomical, structural, functional, and metabolic data. Navigation achieves visualizing the initial extent of a lesion with the concomitant identification of neighboring eloquent brain structures, as well as, providing a tool for a direct correlation of histology and multimodal data. With the help of intraoperative imaging navigation data can be updated, so that brain shift can be compensated for and initially missed tumor remnants can be localized reliably.
