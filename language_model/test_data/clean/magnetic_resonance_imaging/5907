Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is one of the most common and important pathologic features of traumatic brain injury. The definitive diagnosis of DAI, especially in its early stage, is difficult. In addition, most therapeutic agents for patients with DAI are non-specific. The CT scan is widely used to identify signs of DAI. Although its sensitivity is limited to moderate to severe DAI, it remains a useful first-line imaging tool that may also identify co-morbid injuries such as intracerebral hemorrhage. Recently, investigations have sought to apply advanced imaging techniques and laboratory techniques to detect DAI. Meanwhile, some potential specific treatments that may protect injured axons or stimulate axonal regeneration have been developed. We review some new diagnostic technologies and specific therapeutic strategies for DAI.
