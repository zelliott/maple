Referring to two individual cases, the authors review clinical, radiological and histological features of benign glial cysts of the pineal gland. Both patients were young females with aggravating headaches and with convulsions in one case. Symptoms were referable to a space-occupying cystic mass of the pineal gland. On histology, both lesions proved to be non neoplastic cysts without an epithelial lining. Their histogenesis and low growth potential were reinforced by immunohistochemical analysis of pineal antigens and proliferation markers. Glial cysts of the pineal gland are not infrequent, but symptomatic occurrences are exceptional. Most glial cysts are of dysontogenic or degenerative origin. Sometimes, however, the role of hormonal influences or paraneoplastic factors must be considered. Symptoms caused by glial cysts of the pineal gland are non-specific and radiologic imaging technics may contribute little to etiologic diagnosis. Pineal cysts are curable by surgical resection or stereotactic decompression. Whatever the diagnostic approach, emphasis must be laid on the histologic examination in order to avoid unnecessarily aggressive treatment.
