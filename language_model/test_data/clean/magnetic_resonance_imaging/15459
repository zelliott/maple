An unusual combination of primary cerebral lymphoma and meningioma occurring contiguously was encountered in a 71-year-old male patient. The possibility of two separate tumours was suspected radiologically and confirmed by histology. The association of primary lymphoma and meningioma is extremely rare. Following review of the literature, current evidence would suggest that the association is probably coincidental.
