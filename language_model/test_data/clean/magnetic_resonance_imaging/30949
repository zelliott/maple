Granular cell tumors in the central nervous system are quite rare. To date, only 6 cases of granular cell tumor arising from cranial nerves have been reported in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first case of a predominant intracavernous granular-cell tumor arising from oculomotor nerve.

A 42-year-old man presented with third-nerve paresis and decreased visual acuity on the left side. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a mainly intracavernous mass partially extending to the superior orbital fissure and entrance of the optic canal. Using a pterional craniotomy, the tumor was removed from within the cavernous sinus via combined superior and lateral intradural approach, and optic nerve was also decompressed. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a granular cell tumor.

Although it is quite rare, granular cell tumor should be included into the differential diagnosis of intracavernous masses because surgical treatment is curative.
