Pituitary tumour apoplexy is a rare but life threatening condition. Cushing's disease usually presents with clinical features of Cushing's syndrome. We report a 30-year-old male patient with Cushing's disease who presented with severe headache and right third nerve palsy. MRI of the pituitary gland revealed a pituitary adenoma with infarction suggestive of apoplexy. After a transsphenoidal surgery he developed pan-hypopituitarism with diabetes insipidus. We also review the relevant literature.
