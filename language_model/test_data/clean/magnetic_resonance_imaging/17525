Schwannomas originating within the sella turcica are extremely rare. We describe the clinical, radiological and intraoperative findings of a patient with an intrasellar and suprasellar schwannoma. Gross total tumour removal was performed by a trans-sphenoidal approach. Perivascular or ectopic Schwann cells, lateral nerve plexus within the cavernous sinus, as well as Schwann cells from small nerve twigs of the dura are some of the current histopathological hypotheses for the origin of these lesions.
