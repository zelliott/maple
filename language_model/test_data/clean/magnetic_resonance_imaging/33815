Thyroid imaging has an essentially diagnostic value, but is also plays a role in definition of indications and operative techniques. Ultrasound is the most useful examination. Scintigraphy has become less useful, but remains indicated in hyperthyroidism and in certain retrosternal goitres inaccessible to ultrasound. The other examinations only have a limited value.
