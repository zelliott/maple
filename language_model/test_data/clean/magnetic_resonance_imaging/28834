To determine if there is an association between wrist ganglia and internal derangements of the wrist joint by reviewing magnetic resonance (MR) images.

Two observers retrospectively reviewed MR images of the wrist obtained in 625 patients at 1.5 T for the presence of ganglia and associated triangular fibrocartilage complex, scapholunate ligamentous, or lunotriquetral ligamentous tears that were within 3 mm of the ganglion. When available, surgery and/or pathology records were reviewed.

There were 122 ganglia and 37 internal derangements. Of the 22 ulnar-sided ganglia, 10 (45%) demonstrated associated triangular fibrocartilage complex tears. Of the 97 radial-sided ganglia, 27 (28%) demonstrated ligamentous tears related to the site of the ganglion. The radial-sided tears involved the radial aspect of the triangular fibrocartilage complex in 12 ganglia; the scapholunate ligament, in isolation, in eight ganglia; and both the triangular fibrocartilage complex and the scapholunate ligament in six ganglia. Only one of the ganglia demonstrated an associated lunotriquetral ligamentous tear. Surgical findings confirmed the ligamentous tears in 25 patients.

Wrist ganglia are associated, not infrequently, with internal derangements of the wrist.
