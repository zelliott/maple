A case of adult teratoma with malignant transformation in a 52-year-old male is reported. We describe characteristic CT, histopathologic features and histogenesis of the tumor. Gradual onset of cerebral signs and symptoms was considered to be due to the tumor originating from the silent area of the frontal lobe of the brain and possessing a slowly progressive growth character.
