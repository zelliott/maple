Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based temperature mapping very close to the surface of an ultrasound transducer is not possible due to the large magnetic susceptibility- induced image artifacts that arise from the materials used in transducer construction. Here, it is shown in phantoms that "susceptibility-compensated" MRI sequences can be used to measure thermal increases approximately 1 mm from the surface of a 4-element cymbal array transducer, which has been used widely for noninvasive transdermal drug delivery. The estimated temperatures agree well with those measured using thermocouples.
