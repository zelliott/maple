Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a viable presurgical tool for use with the pediatric epilepsy population as replacement for the intra-carotid sodium amobarbital test (IAT) used to identify hemispheric language dominance. This paper reviews the current imaging research on the identification of language cortex in pediatric epilepsy patients and in normal children. A review of the literature comparing fMRI to the IAT and electrocortical stimulation suggests that fMRI reliably identifies the dominant hemisphere, with pediatric and adult studies producing comparable results. Within-hemisphere localization of eloquent cortex with fMRI is more problematic. Paradigm selection, data analysis techniques, and considerations specific to imaging children are discussed. Utility of fMRI for studying neural plasticity as a result of brain insult (e.g., epilepsy) is also considered.
