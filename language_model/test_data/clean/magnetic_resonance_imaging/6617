Brain abscesses are rare, especially in children, but they can be life-threatening infections. To date, dental pathology has been linked to only a small number of brain abscesses. To our best knowledge this is the first reported case of a brain abscess following self-extraction of a milk tooth. We are reporting on a 12-year-old previously healthy boy who developed a brain abscess in the vicinity of the left precentral gyrus. Clinical examination prior to surgery showed a severe right hemiparesis, more pronounced in his leg. We performed an ultrasonographically guided puncture and aspiration of the abscess through a small craniotomy. Immediately after the procedure he became hemiplegic. Bacteriological examination of the aspirated pus revealed Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group F, Fusobacterium species and gram-negative rods. The same species of microorganisms were identified in a smear from the vicinity of the extracted tooth. The patient was carefully screened for possible other sources of infection, but none was found. Following appropriate antimicrobial treatment he recovered completely and returned home without any neurological deficit.
