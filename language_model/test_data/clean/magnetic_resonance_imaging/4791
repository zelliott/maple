The central neurocytoma is a recently recognized benign intraventricular tumour of young adults. The authors report a unique case of a panventricular neurocytoma with extension to the interpeduncular and prepontique cisterns which developed in a 35-year-old woman with a 7-year history of headaches and amenorrhea. They review the different pathological and topographical patterns of previously published neurocytomas and discuss the histogenesis of this rare tumour.
