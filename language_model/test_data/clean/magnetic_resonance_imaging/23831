In the appropriate clinical situation, MR imaging is a powerful tool in the diagnosis of spinal infection. Imaging of spinal infections requires the use of a combination of T1-weighted and T2-weighted or STIR sequences. Contrast enhancement is useful and helps to define paraspinal and epidural disease. Knowledge of potential pitfalls with MR imaging and of normal marrow conversion is required. With these points in mind, MR imaging will be beneficial in the care of patients with spinal infections.
