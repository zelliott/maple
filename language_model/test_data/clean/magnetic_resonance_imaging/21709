The parapharyngeal space is a rare site of parapharyngeal neoplasms: their diagnosis and therapeutic treatment offer peculiar challenges. Parapharyngeal tumours may be primary, metastatic or diffused with regaed continuity. They are mostly benign (mixed, neurogenic, vascular tumours, etc.) rather than malignant neoplasms (adenocystic carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, etc.). In order to diagnosis parapharyngeal tumours differentially it is important to consider very rare type of neoplasms such as hemangiopericytomas. In this paper the Authors describe a case of hemangiopericytoma of the parapharyngeal space indicating the main diagnosis procedures, especially CT scan, Magnetic resonance and angiography. They discuss pathological aspects with particular regard to the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant tumour of this kind as well as prognoses. The Authors also describe surgical treatment in relation to particular parapharyngeal localization.
