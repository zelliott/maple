Diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities in dogs can be challenging antemortem. Historically, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis has been used for routine diagnostic evaluation of animals with suspected neurologic disease; however, with increasing availability of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, the need for concurrent CSF analysis may be questioned.

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess and compare the diagnostic information contributed from MR imaging and CSF analysis in a population of dogs presenting with neurologic disease.

Results of concurrent MR imaging and CSF analysis were evaluated in dogs presented for neurologic diseases. Based on clinical diagnosis, the sensitivity of CSF analysis and MR imaging for detecting a nervous system abnormality was calculated. Dogs with diagnoses confirmed by other diagnostic modalities were also evaluated separately.

A total of 256 dogs were included in the study. For clinical diagnoses in which abnormalities were expected, MR imaging abnormalities were found in 89% and CSF abnormalities in 75% of dogs; CSF abnormalities were more common than MR imaging abnormalities only in inflammatory CNS disease. The majority of CSF abnormalities were nonspecific; an etiologic diagnosis was determined in only 2% of CSF samples. MR imaging excelled in detecting structural disorders, revealing 98% of vertebral abnormalities. In confirmed cases (n = 55), 76% of MR images and 9% of CSF samples were diagnostic. When intervertebral disk disease (IVDD) and vertebral malformation were excluded from analysis (n = 16 remaining), 25% of MR images and 6% of CSF cytology results were highly indicative of the confirmed diagnoses; CSF titer results provided the diagnosis in 25% of these cases.

CSF analysis may not be necessary when MR findings of IVDD or vertebral malformation/instability are obvious; however, when the cause of neurologic disorder is uncertain, concurrent MR imaging and CSF analysis provides the greatest assistance in establishing a clinical diagnosis.
