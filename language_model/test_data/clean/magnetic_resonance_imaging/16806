Abdominal ultrasound (US) is often the first-line imaging modality used to assess focal liver lesions. Due to various new gray-scaled US techniques, such as tissue harmonic imaging (THI), spatial compounding technique and speckle reduction technique, as well as contrast-enhanced techniques, abdominal ultrasound nowadays has great potential regarding detection and characterization of focal liver lesions. Furthermore, image fusion with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3D ultrasound will most likely help to improve clinical management before and after interventional procedures. This article illustrates the principles and clinical impact of recently developed techniques in the field of ultrasound.
