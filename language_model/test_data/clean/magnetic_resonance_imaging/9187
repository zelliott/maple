The origin of patchy white matter hyperintensities commonly seen in the elderly on magnetic resonance (MR) images with long repetition time (TR) is still controversial. We describe MR findings in older patients in whom white matter hyperintensities were attenuated by compression of the cerebral hemisphere from a chronic subdural hematoma. These sequential MR findings substantiate the hypothesis that leukoaraiosis may arise when drainage of the bulk flow of brain interstitial fluid is disturbed.
