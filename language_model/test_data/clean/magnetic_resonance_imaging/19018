The authors describe three children with septo-optic dysplasia (SOD)-plus: SOD and an associated malformation of cortical development. All three children had developmental delay, and two of the children had significant associated motor deficits. The associated cortical malformations with SOD include a spectrum of disorders of neuronal organization, not limited, as previously described, to schizencephaly. SOD-plus should be suspected in children with SOD and developmental delay.
