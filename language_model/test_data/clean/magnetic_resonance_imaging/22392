A 60-year-old male with a past history of T12 fracture had epidural analgesia for a radical prostatectomy. It was unknown prior to epidural insertion that the patient had a canal stenosis at T12 from the previous injury. The patient developed severe bilateral buttock pain after epidural catheter removal. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a spinal subdural haematoma from T10 to L2 with mild cord compression. The patient made a successful recovery with conservative management. Neuraxial blockade should be approached with caution in patients with previous back injury, and only after a thorough assessment has been obtained to exclude spinal canal stenosis.
