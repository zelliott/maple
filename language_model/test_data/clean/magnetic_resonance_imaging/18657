Using diffusion tensor (DT) MRI and histogram analysis, we measured mean diffusivity ((-)D) of basal ganglia grey matter (GM) from eight patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), 10 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and 10 healthy controls. Patients with ADEM had higher average (-)D (p=0.02) and lower (-)D histogram peak height (p=0.008) of the basal ganglia GM than patients with MS. Microscopic tissue damage occurs in the basal ganglia of ADEM patients, but not in MS patients with a similar burden of MRI-visible brain lesions.
