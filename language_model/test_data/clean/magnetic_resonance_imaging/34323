Most reports regarding pediatric syringomyelia have focused not only on Chiari malformation, but also on spinal dysraphism. However, the clinical characteristics of syringomyelia with spinal dysraphism are quite different from those of syringomyelia due to Chiari Type I malformation. The objectives of this study were to identify clinical characteristics of pediatric syringomyelia and to determine whether surgery prevents or corrects the scoliosis associated with syringomyelia.

We reviewed the records of 16 pediatric patients with syringomyelia and Chiari Type I malformation. The patients' ages ranged from 3 to 15 years, with mean age of 9.8 years. None of the patients had spinal dysraphism.

Nystagmus was observed in 2 of the 16 patients, motor weakness in 8 patients, sensory disturbance in 10 patients, and scoliosis in 13 patients. As the initial surgical procedure, foramen magnum decompression (FMD) was performed in seven patients and syringo-subarachnoid (S-S) shunting in nine patients. The motor function improved in 7 of the 8 affected patients, and the sensory disturbance improved in 9 of the 10 affected patients. The magnetic resonance images obtained after the surgery revealed marked decrease of the syrinx size in all patients. Of the 13 patients with scoliosis, 5 showed improvement, 5 stabilization, and 3 deterioration.

Compared with adolescent and adult syringomyelia, pediatric syringomyelia shows a much lower incidence of sensory disturbance and pain, but quite a high incidence of scoliosis. Surgery is effective in improving or stabilizing scoliosis in these patients.
