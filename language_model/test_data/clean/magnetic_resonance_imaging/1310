We examined thirty-five patients with various chest diseases with cardiac gated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at 1.5 tesla. Major advantages of MRI of the thorax are its abilities to display sagittal and coronal planes and to disclose vessels clearly without contrast media. We conclude MRI is useful in evaluating, 1) masses at the lung apex or base, 2) chest wall invasion, 3) hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, 4) aortic aneurysm, and 5) bronchogenic cyst.
