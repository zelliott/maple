30 MRI investigations of shoulders and 20 dissections of non embalmed cadaveric shoulders allowed us to demonstrate a particular organization of the supraspinatus muscle. In the anterior part of the muscle is an important fibrous frame with obliquely inserted muscle fibers. This organization suggests that this part of the supraspinatus muscle works as a "contractile tendon".
