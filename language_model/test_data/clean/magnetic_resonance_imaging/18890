We report a case of MELAS in which lesions were detected by perfusion-weighted MR imaging. Perfusion-weighted MRI using contrast media (PWI) and FAIR (flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery), an arterial spin labeling method, clearly showed these lesions as hyperperfused areas. One of these lesions, diminished after steroid therapy, could also be detected by FAIR.
