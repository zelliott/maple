We report on a 22-year-old male patient who presented with an intrapelvic tumor.

CT and MRI showed a left pelvic abscess, which was drained. After regression of the abscess, we removed the causative tubular structure surgically, revealing a rudimentary genital structure with parts of the Mullerian and Wolffian ducts.

This case report demonstrates an abscess formation as complication of a previously asymptomatic rudimentary genital structure, which was associated with further abnormalities, such as left testicular agenesia, perineoscrotal hypospadias and transverse testicular ectopia.
