Venous hypertension and stagnant hypoxia in the human spinal cord are poorly understood. We report a case in which a partial Brown-SÃ©quard syndrome resulted from obstruction of venous drainage on one side of the spinal cord. Neurological deterioration and eventual recovery paralleled the formation and clearance of oedema. The clinical and MRI findings support the contention that spinal cord injury arising as a result of obstruction to venous outflow occurs primarily in the white matter, spreading secondarily to the grey matter, and observations that obstruction of venous flow in the high cervical spinal cord results in changes in the lower cervical cord.
