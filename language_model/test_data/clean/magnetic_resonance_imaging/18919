Malignant tumors of the skull base represent a group of diverse and infrequent lesions. Comprehensive oncological management requires a multidisciplinary team of neurological surgeons, otolaryngologists, radiation oncologists, plastic surgeons, and medical oncologists. The authors describe an institutional experience in performing 54 combined anterior-anterolateral cranial base resections for malignant disease.

The technical considerations for preoperative workup, surgical approach, resection, and reconstruction are outlined and illustrated. Considerations for complication management and avoidance are detailed.

Overall mortality (0%) and morbidity rates (18%) are acceptable. The influence on the natural history of the disease process is an ongoing study.
