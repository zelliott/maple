Magnetic resonance and computed tomography scans of L4/5 and L5/S1 levels in 129 patients operated for herniated intervertebral disc were assessed to establish the relationship of facet joint asymmetry, disc prolapse and degenerative disease. Facet angle and spinal stenosis were measured. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlation between facet joint asymmetry and disc disease or degenerative stenosis within lumbar spine.
