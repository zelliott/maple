The purpose of this study was to characterize the normal pattern of apical tracking and to investigate whether tissue tracking imaging is more useful for evaluation of regional left-ventricular function than noncontrast harmonic echocardiography in patients after myocardial infarction.

Left ventricular longitudinal shortening plays an important role in cardiac contraction, and can be evaluated online by a new Doppler tissue imaging method.

We included 40 healthy participants and 40 patients after myocardial infarction. They underwent tissue tracking imaging and noncontrast harmonic imaging by an experienced and an inexperienced observer. Diagnostic accuracy of semiquantitative evaluation of left ventricular function was compared using magnetic resonance imaging as reference method.

Velocity-time integrals decreased from basal to apical segments in healthy participants. Tissue tracking imaging has a higher diagnostic sensitivity than noncontrast imaging for the diagnosis of regional wall-motion abnormalities (expert, 78% vs 97%, P <.01; beginner, 63% vs 91%, P <.001), whereas specificity remained unchanged (expert, 99% vs 97%, not significant; beginner, 91% vs 92%, not significant).

Tissue tracking imaging is feasible and evaluates regional systolic myocardial function quantitatively with high diagnostic accuracy compared with magnetic resonance imaging in patients after myocardial infarction, and is more accurate than noncontrast harmonic echocardiography.
