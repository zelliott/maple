We report the case of a 6-year-old male who underwent a hemicraniectomy after a right-sided middle cerebral arterial infarct. This is the youngest patient reported to have undergone this procedure for stroke-associated brain swelling. This case illustrates that hemicraniectomy for stroke can be performed safely in pediatric patients, with potential brain- and lifesaving benefits.
