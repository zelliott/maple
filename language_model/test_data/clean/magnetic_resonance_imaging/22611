There have recently been a number of new pathological findings of specimens from epileptic foci that have become widespread of surgical treatment. We reported a case with seizures resulting from brain lesions which pathologically demonstrated a coexistence with a cavernous angioma and a focal cortical dysplasia. A 24-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of generalized convulsion from 1 year ago. Brain MRI revealed an enhanced mass lesion, in diameter 1.5 cm, with hemosiderin rim in the left temporal tip. Ictal EEG showed the initiation of the spike from the lateral side of the left temporal lobe. Because the epileptogenic focus was thought to be the lateral side in the left temporal lobe, anterolateral temporal resection was performed and subsequently total removal of the tumor was performed. He had no seizure after surgery. A light microscopic examination was performed on specimens stained with hematoxilin and eosin. We verified to be pathologically coexistent with a cavernous angioma and a focal cortical dysplasia. We also found unusual neurons that were accompanied by perineuronal glial satellitosis in the subcortical white matter, those were occasionally observed in epileptic foci and were thought to be a form of neuronal migration disorders.
