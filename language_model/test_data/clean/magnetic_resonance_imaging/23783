An isolated neurinoma involving the entire length of the lacrimal nerve is reported. The tumour was large and involved both the intracranial cavernous sinus, as well as the extracranial intraorbital part of the nerve. The patient, a 45-year-old housewife had a painless progressive proptosis associated with marginally decreased lacrimation of the affected eye. There was no evidence of neurofibromatosis.
