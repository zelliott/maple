Magnetic resonance (MR) findings at the cerebral white matter and the thalamus in 44 children with spastic cerebral palsy born at preterm were analysed. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) was found in all of the children. Lesions of the thalamus were revealed in 22 children, 19 of which were in the anterior part of the pulvinar and 3 of which were in other areas. Gestational ages and birthweights of the children with a lesion of the pulvinar were significantly greater than those without lesions of the thalamus. Mental retardation and paroxysmal ocular downward deviation were more frequently seen in the children with a lesion of the pulvinar than in those without lesions of the thalamus. The children with thalamic lesions in areas other than the pulvinar showed the most severe motor and mental disabilities.
