Soft-tissue sarcoma is the most prevalent primary malignant cardiac tumor. This sarcoma usually presents with cardiac manifestations secondary to local obstruction or arrhythmias; very rarely does it present with initial symptoms of distant metastasis. We discuss the unusual case of an 18-year-old man who emergently presented with acute-on-chronic back pain. Imaging revealed a lesion on the 12th thoracic vertebra and a large mass arising from the left atrium. The cardiac mass was resected, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed it to be a pleomorphic sarcoma that had metastasized to the spine. The patient died 2 years later of diffuse metastases. In addition to the patient's case, we discuss the nature and treatment of cardiac sarcoma.
