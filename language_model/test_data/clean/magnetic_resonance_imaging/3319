Spontaneous recanalization of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is rarely observed. Mainly case reports are published. Most often early recanalization occurs within days or weeks and only a few cases of late recanalization months or years after detected occlusion are reported. Symptomatic bilateral ICA occlusion is regarded as an acceptable indication for extra-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass. The authors report on a case with bilateral symptomatic ICA occlusion and EC-IC bypass >2 years prior to detected spontaneous leftsided recanalization. Spontaneous recanalization unmasking a high degree ICA stenosis at the carotid bifurcation allowed a successful subsequent surgical recanalization in this patients. Mechanisms of early and late recanalization as well as treatment options are discussed.
