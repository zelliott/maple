Spina bifida is one of the most common open neural tube defects. There are two common types of spina bifida cystica, myelomeningocele and meningocele. Special attention to the thickness of the cystic sac (presence of intact skin and subcutaneous tissue) on magnetic resonance imaging is advantageous for determination of whether the child will profit from cesarean section in order to prevent neurological change (infection and drying of nerve tissue) and for management of spina bifida (most meningocele) during the perinatal period. Furthermore, skin detection may help to predict the prognosis of spina bifida after birth. Meningocele, with intact skin over the cyst, has a better clinical course than myelomeningocele. Some myelomeningoceles with neural tube defects in a lower position, also frequently having an intact skin over the cyst, have almost the same clinical course as a meningocele. From this, we hypothesize that a baby with spina bifida who has intact skin over the cyst might have a good prognosis neurologically. In this report, we concentrate attention on the skin over cysts in 3 cases (1 meningocele and 2 myelomeningoceles).
