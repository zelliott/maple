The volume of the encephalic ventricles was determined from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Since there are many conditions in which the encephalic ventricles become enlarged such as Alzheimer's disease and hydrocephalus, accurate measurement of the ventricles provides a valuable and safe means of aiding the diagnosis of such conditions and also provides important follow-up information in affected patients. The objective was pursued in a three phase study. This paper presents the data obtained from the first phase. This first phase demonstrated the possibility of measuring fluid filled spaces by MRI in three phantom preparations (small, medium, and large "ventricles"). The results were compared with those obtained from computerized tomography (CT) scans of the same preparations. These volumetric calculations were done with the aid of a Calcomp 9,000 digital analyzer programmed to compensate for the scale factor and slice thickness of the images. The phantom study showed that the results obtained from the MRI scans were better than those obtained from the CT scans in measuring the volume of water-filled cavities (ventricles) in gelatin phantoms. The average percent difference between volumes obtained by an imaging procedure compared to the actual volume as determined by water displacement was 15.8% for CT scanning and a more impressive 8.3% for MRI.
