A 32-year-old patient with anorexia nervosa since adolescence was admitted because of diffuse bone pain, increasing during the 2 preceding winters. She had a special aversion to dairy products and all forms of dietary fat. Low normal serum calcium and very low calciuria were noted, with a highly elevated bone fraction of alkaline phosphatase, and severe hypovitaminosis D and B12. Apart from a recent spontaneous fracture of the clavicle, Looser lines and pseudofractures were noted in a finger, fibula and malleolus. In particular, magnetic resonance imaging of the knee showed additional evidence of a pseudofracture in the femur, and medullary changes were found. Evidence for secondary hyperparathyroidism was described. Apart from the well known occurrence of osteoporosis, our case shows that osteomalacia may exceptionally occur in anorexia nervosa.
