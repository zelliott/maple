A previously non-operated 37-year-old patient presented with esophageal dysphagia for solid food and stridorous breathing. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance showed a 33-mm wide Kommerell's diverticulum. The diverticulum and the obliterated ductus arteriosus arising from it towards the pulmonary artery were resected. The left subclavian artery, which originated from the diverticulum, was reimplanted into the descending aorta. In addition to dissecting any tissue which is making vascular ring-like structures around the trachea and the esophagus, it is important to resect the diverticulum itself and reimplant the left subclavian artery arising from it, in this way leaving the aortic arch free from any additional dislocating forces.
