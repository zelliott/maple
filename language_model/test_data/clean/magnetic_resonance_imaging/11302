Magnetic resonance ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) imaging has been demonstrated using oxygen and arterial spin labeling techniques. Inhaled oxygen is used as a paramagnetic contrast agent in ventilation imaging using a multiple inversion recovery (MIR) approach. Pulmonary perfusion imaging is conducted using a flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery with an extra radiofrequency pulse (FAIRER) technique. A half Fourier single-short turbo spin echo (HASTE) sequence is used for data acquisition in both techniques. V/Q imaging was performed in ten of the twenty volunteers, while either ventilation or perfusion was imaged in the other ten. This V/Q imaging scheme is completely noninvasive, does not involve ionized radiation, and shows promising potential for clinical use in the diagnosis of lung diseases such as pulmonary embolism.
