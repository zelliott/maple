Double cortex is a neuronal migration disorder, associated with impaired cognitive function and seizures, and characterized by a subcortical band of neurons. Using functional MRI, we assessed the involvement of the subcortical band in language function and with interictal discharges. In both girls assessed, language-associated activation was in typical cortical areas, as well as in parts of the subcortical band. Interictal discharges were associated with deactivation in the subcortical band. This suggests involvement of the subcortical neurons in physiologic and pathologic functions.
