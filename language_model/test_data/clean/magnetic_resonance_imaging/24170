We describe serial MR imaging findings in a patient with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy. The patient had acute progression of neurologic symptoms and exhibited swelling of the entire length of the spinal cord with increased T2 signal and contrast enhancement on MR imaging. The spinal cord became atrophic a few years later.
