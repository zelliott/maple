Functional neuroimaging studies on cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia have suggested regional brain activation changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobe. However, less is known about the functional coupling of these areas during cognitive performance. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging, a verbal working memory (WM) task and multivariate statistical techniques to investigate the functional coupling of temporally anticorrelated neural networks during cognitive processing in patients with schizophrenia (n=16) compared to healthy controls (n=16). Independent component analysis identified 18 independent components (ICs) among which two ICs were selected for further analyses. These ICs included temporally anticorrelated networks which were most highly associated with the delay period of the task in both healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. Functional network abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia were detected within a "task-positive" lateral frontoparietal network, where increased functional connectivity was found in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal regions. In addition, aberrant functional coupling of the hippocampal cortex in patients with schizophrenia was detected within a "task-negative" medial frontotemporal network. In patients with schizophrenia, functional connectivity indices in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right hippocampal cortex were positively correlated with accuracy during the WM task, while the connectivity strength in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was negatively correlated with measures of symptom severity. These data suggest that within two temporally anticorrelated network states, patients with schizophrenia exhibit increased and persistent dorsolateral prefrontal and hippocampal connectivity during WM performance.
