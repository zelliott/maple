Hemangioma of the facial nerve is a rare cause for sensorineural hearing loss. Such was found in a 50-year-old patient with a history of slowly progressive, unilateral deafness. Pure-tone audiogram showed only residual hearing in the left ear. A stapedial reflex could not be elicited, nor could brainstem evoked potentials be recorded. Cranial CT showed a widened internal auditory meatus, while a Gadolinium MRI revealed an enhancing process of the left cerebellopontine angle. Via a translabyrinthine approach a tumor of the facial nerve was found and resected completely. Histopathologic examination demonstrated an arteriovenous hemangioma.
