Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type is caused by a mutation at codon 693 of the beta amyloid precursor protein gene. The disease is clinically characterized by strokes and dementia. In addition to cerebral plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the pathological hallmark. We investigated the correlation between radiological (white matter hyperintensities and focal lesions on magnetic resonance images) and pathological lesions (cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy and plaques) and the apolipoprotein E genotype in patients with the disease. Twenty-five patients were studied using magnetic resonance imaging, and brain tissue from 8 patients was studied histopathologically. Neither the white matter hyperintensity scores nor the number of focal lesions on magnetic resonance images were associated with the presence of an epsilon4 allele. Nor was a correlation found between the number and type of plaques and the apolipoprotein E genotype. All patients had severe amyloid angiopathy in all cortical areas investigated. This study showed that the apolipoprotein E genotype does not modulate amyloid-related structural lesions in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type.
