Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an uncommon neurologic condition associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study aimed to demonstrate the risk factors and clinical outcome of PRES in patients with SLE. Fifteen patients with SLE were diagnosed with PRES by characteristic clinical manifestations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features from 2000 to 2012. Clinical profiles and outcomes were assessed for this study population. Additionally, 48 SLE patients with neurologic symptoms who underwent brain MRI were included for comparative analyses. The median age and duration of SLE in patients with PRES was 27 and 6.1 years, respectively. Comparison between patients with and without PRES revealed significant differences in the presentation of hypertension and seizure, lupus nephritis with renal insufficiency, treatment with high-dose steroid and cyclophosphamide, recent transfusion, and lupus activity measured by SLE disease activity index. Renal failure was the single independent factor with a high odds ratio of 129.250 by multivariate analysis. Of 15 patients, four experienced relapse and two died of sepsis during hospitalization. Our results suggest that lupus nephritis with renal dysfunction and other related clinical conditions can precede the occurrence of PRES in patients with SLE. It is important to perform early brain imaging for a timely diagnosis of PRES when clinically suspected.
