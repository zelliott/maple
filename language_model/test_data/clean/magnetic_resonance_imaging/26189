In a patient with left hemianopsia, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intracranial space-occupying lesion in the right occipital region. A cerebral abscess was removed at craniotomy. Enhanced pulmonary CT showed a small coin lesion in the peripheral lingula. and at 3-D CT two nidi with feeding arteries and draining veins were seen, indicating pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. Lingular segmentectomy was performed.
