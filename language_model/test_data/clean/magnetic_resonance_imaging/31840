Spinal subdural abscess (SSA) is a rare but well-described entity. It may occur secondary to a systemic infectious focus or following a surgical procedure. There are only two SSA cases in the literature that are unrelated to such conditions and without any well-documented etiology. SSA is a neurosurgical emergency and diagnosis may be difficult. Progressive neurological deficits and severe pain with fever suggest the diagnosis. Surgical drainage and subsequent prompt antimicrobial therapy should be performed without delay. We report a patient with SSA unrelated to any predisposing condition and discuss underlying mechanisms of this disease.
