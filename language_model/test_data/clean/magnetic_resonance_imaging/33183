To review the current and relevant literature pertaining to the origin, imaging, and treatment for the sacrococcygeal teratoma in order to obtain information beneficial for radiologic technologists.

Both peer-reviewed articles and contemporary imaging textbooks were used in the research for this review. The material was analyzed further for practical and instructive components for imaging professionals.

The inquiry regarding the origin, imaging, and treatment of the sacrococcygeal teratoma yielded important facts and clinically useful information that radiologic technologists can use.

Because the sacrococcygeal teratoma is the most common congenital tumor found in newborns, all imaging professionals who may be asked to actively or indirectly care for a patient diagnosed with the condition should have a fundamental knowledge of the origin, imaging, and treatment of this potentially fatal tumor.
