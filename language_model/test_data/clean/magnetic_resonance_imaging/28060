Hemimegalencephaly is associated with a poor clinical course characterized by intractable seizures and severe encephalopathy. We present a case report of a girl with hemimegalencephaly. At the age of 9 month hemispherectomy was undertaken to preserve function of the other hemisphere. MRI and histologic examinations showed characteristic dysplastic malformations. Follow-up and the complications are described.
