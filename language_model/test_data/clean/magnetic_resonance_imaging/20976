'Internet addiction disorder' (IAD) is rapidly becoming a prevalent mental health concern in many countries around the world. The neurobiological underpinnings of internet addiction should be studied to unravel the potential heterogeneity in the disorder. The present study examines the neural correlates of response inhibition in males with and without IAD using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) Stroop task. The IAD group demonstrated significantly greater 'Stroop effect'-related activity in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices compared with their healthy peers. These results may suggest diminished efficiency of response-inhibition processes in the IAD group relative to healthy controls.
