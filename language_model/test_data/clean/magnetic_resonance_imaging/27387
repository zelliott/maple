A 48-year-old woman presented with a growing palpable mass at the left frontal area. The imaging studies and histopathological examination of the mass was consistent with dural-based Rosai-Dorfman disease with unusual transcranial extension. We reported this case not only because of its rarity, but also because of the infiltrative pattern. The infiltrative nature presented in this case may be taken into consideration for surgical treatment of intracranial Rosai-Dorfman disease.
