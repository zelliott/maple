The purpose of this work was to apply fuzzy logic image processing techniques to characterize the trabecular bone structure with high-resolution magnetic resonance images. Fifteen ex vivo high-resolution magnetic resonance images of specimens of human radii at 1.5 T and 12 in vivo high-resolution magnetic resonance images of the calcanei of peri- and postmenopausal women at 3 T were obtained. Soft segmentation using fuzzy clustering was applied to MR data to obtain fuzzy bone volume fraction maps, which were then analyzed with three-dimensional (3D) fuzzy geometrical parameters and measures of fuzziness. Geometrical parameters included fuzzy perimeter and fuzzy compactness, while measures of fuzziness included linear index of fuzziness, quadratic index of fuzziness, logarithmic fuzzy entropy, and exponential fuzzy entropy. Fuzzy parameters were validated at 1.5 T with 3D structural parameters computed from microcomputed tomography images, which allow the observation of true trabecular bone structure and with apparent MR structural indexes at 1.5 T and 3 T. The validation was statistically performed with the Pearson correlation coefficient as well as with the Bland-Altman method. Bone volume fraction correlation values (r) were up to .99 (P<.001) with good agreements based on Bland-Altman analysis showing that fuzzy clustering is a valid technique to quantify this parameter. Measures of fuzziness also showed consistent correlations to trabecular number parameters (r>.85; P<.001) and good agreements based on Bland-Altman analysis, suggesting that the level of fuzziness in high-resolution magnetic resonance images could be related to the trabecular bone structure.
