The present study documents the use of an iron oxide-based blood-pool contrast agent in functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor activity-related changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) resulting from peripheral sensory stimulation and the application of this technique to generate high-resolution functional maps. Rats, anesthetized with alpha-chloralose, were imaged during electrical stimulation (3 ms, 3 Hz, 3 V) of forelimb or hindlimb. Activation maps were generated by cross-correlation of the measured signal response and a square-wave function representative of the stimulus for each image pixel. Multislice imaging produced functional maps consistent with the known functional anatomy of rat primary somatosensory (S-I) cortex. Imaging with improved temporal resolution demonstrated rapid (<6 s) CBV increases which were sustained and relatively stable (coefficient of variation = 0.17 +/- 0.02) for forelimb stimulation periods of up to 5 min. Enabled by this sustained response we generated high-resolution (approximately 100 micrometer in-plane) functional maps showing discrete forelimb and hindlimb activation. This technique offers many advantages over other methods for the study of brain activity in the rat and has resolution sufficient to be useful in reorganization studies.
