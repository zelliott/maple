Nearly all non accidental head injuries of children are shaken baby syndromes. The non accidental head trauma refers to a traumatic encephalopathy inflicted by an adult to a child. The syndrome combines subdural haematoma, retinal haemorrhages and absence of any external lesion. The mortality and morbidity rates of the SBS are high and the SBS is the main cause of death in hospitals handling child abuse. The incidence is not well-known and most probably underestimated. Numerous risk factors linked to the aggressor, to the victim and to the factual context have been identified. The diagnosis remains difficult to make, mainly due to the absence of reliable anamnesis in a majority of cases. It should be envisaged for all infants presenting unexplained acute encephalopathy. Imagery and ophthalmologic examination are the first examinations that are required to make such diagnosis. A cerebral RMI allowed for important progress both on the level of the diagnosis and the prognosis as well as on the level of the understanding of lesions. The physiopathogeny of this syndrome has considerably progressed in recent years which raise promising prospects for therapy. The treatment of babies with SBS requires highly competent teams including paediatric neurosurgeons but also teams specialised in child abuse which can quickly take care of the families. In view of the seriousness of the problem, several communication campaigns directed to young parents and the public have been organized recently in several countries among which Belgium.
