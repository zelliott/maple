Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is an increasingly common cause of knee pain and dysfunction among skeletally immature and young adult patients. An ideal treatment strategy with an optimal surgical technique to repair the osteochondral lesions in these patients is still controversial. The goal of this study is to evaluate and report the clinical and MRI findings for the treatment of OCD in the pediatric knee with bone marrow-derived cell transplantation by using a one-step surgical technique.
