Magnetic resonance angiography is a noninvasive approach to vascular study that recently has become feasible and is quickly proving its usefulness in several areas. Currently, advances are concentrated on evaluation of vessels of the head and neck. Magnetic resonance angiography has also proved valuable in evaluation of the central vasculature, including the heart. Because magnetic resonance angiography is not a single technique and the different techniques of which it is composed have their own strengths and weaknesses, it is important that clinicians, as well as radiologists, be aware of these strengths and weaknesses. Various techniques and their applications and limitations are discussed.
