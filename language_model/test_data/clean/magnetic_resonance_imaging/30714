Repair of degenerated intervertebral discs by engineered tissue is a clinical challenge in spinal surgery. Prerequisites are cultivation of intervertebral disc cells and determination of their biologic properties. The influence of disc damage in different spinal disorders on the outcome of disc cell cultures has not been discussed previously. This study showed the feasibility of cultivation of cells from damaged human intervertebral discs and the dependence of cellular culture properties on the underlying disc disorder. Human intervertebral disc cells were isolated from disc tissue obtained during surgical procedures for scoliosis, osteochondrosis, and disc herniation. After proliferation in monolayer culture, cells were embedded in a mixed matrix composed of fibrin and hyaluronic acid. Deoxyribonucleic acid content, hydroxyproline content, and proteoglycan synthesis were determined on Days 7, 14, and 21. In a three-dimensional environment only cells obtained from scoliotic and osteochondrotic discs showed significant deoxyribonucleic acid and proteoglycan synthesis. However, hydroxyproline content increased only in cells from scoliotic discs. The results of this study show that the formation of extracellular matrix components under three-dimensional culture conditions is dependent on the nature of intervertebral disc damage of the tissue processed.
