We describe severe acute transverse myelitis in a previously healthy 9-year-old boy in whom primary human parvovirus B19 infection was confirmed serologically and B19 DNA was detected in his serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Besides erythema infectiosum, parvovirus B19 infection has various clinical manifestations; however, central nervous system involvement is rare. Even more unusual is parvovirus B19-associated acute transverse myelitis.
