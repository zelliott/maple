Since King's research on knee degeneration, meniscal-sparing techniques and other significant advances have improved outcomes. The anatomy, classification, and biomechanics of menisci are reviewed. Although the majority of traumatic meniscal damage occurs to the medial meniscus during twisting-type injuries, modern surgeons should be prepared to deal with patients of all ages with varied symptoms and mechanisms of injury. Non-operative versus operative treatments depend on many variables including the location of tear, age, and knee stability. If surgery is indicated, open and various arthroscopic techniques are available. Post-operative management and rehabilitation should be considered vital parts to any successful meniscal repair.
