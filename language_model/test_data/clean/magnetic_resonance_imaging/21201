To compare the accuracy of cardiac dual-source CT (DSCT) reconstructions obtained at 5% and 10% of the cardiac cycle and MRI for quantifying global left ventricular (LV) function and mass in heart transplant recipients.

We prospectively included 23 heart transplant recipients (21 male, mean age 60±11.7 years) who underwent cardiac DSCT and MRI examinations. We compared LV parameters on cardiac DSCT reconstructions obtained at 5% (0%-95%) and 10% (0%-90%) intervals of the cardiac cycle and on double-oblique short-axis MR images. We determined ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV), and myocardial mass using commercially available semiautomated segmentation analysis software for DSCT datasets and conventional manual contour tracing for MR studies.

Using different reconstruction intervals to quantify LV parameters at DSCT resulted in non-significant differences (P>.05). Compared to MRI, DSCT slightly overestimated LV-EDV, ESV, and mass when both 5% (11.5±25.1ml, 6.8±10.9ml, and 28.3±21.6g, respectively) and 10% (mean difference 15.3±26.3ml, 7.4±11.5ml, and 29.3±18.7g, respectively) reconstruction intervals were used. DSCT and MRI estimates of EF and SV were not significantly different.

In heart transplant recipients, DSCT allows reliable quantification of LV function and mass compared with MRI, even using 10% interval reconstructions.
