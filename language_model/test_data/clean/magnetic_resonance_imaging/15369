The purpose of this article is to highlight the normal anatomic features of the meniscal roots on photographs of dissected cadaveric knee specimens and 3-T MR images.

The meniscal roots, which are critical attachment sites of the medial and lateral menisci to the central tibial plateau, are well-visualized on intermediate-weighted, turbo spin-echo 3-T MRI and can be identified in proximity to the tibial insertions of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments.
