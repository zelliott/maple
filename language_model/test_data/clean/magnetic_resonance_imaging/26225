A novel hierarchical neural network based algorithm for automatic adjustment of display window width and center for a wide range of magnetic resonance (MR) images is presented in this paper. The algorithm consists of a feature generator utilizing both wavelet histogram and compact spatial statistical information computed from a MR image, a competitive layer based neural network for clustering MR images into different subclasses, two pairs of a radial basis function (RBF) network and a bi-modal linear estimator for each subclass, as well as a data fusion process using estimates from both estimators to compute the final display parameters. Both estimators can adapt to new kinds of MR images simply by training them with those images, which make the algorithm adaptive and extendable. The RBF based estimator performs very well for images that are similar to those in the training data set. The bi-modal linear estimator provides reasonable estimations for a wide range of images that may not be included in the training data set. The data fusion step makes the final estimation of the display parameters accurate for trained images and robust for the unknown images. The algorithm has been tested on a wide range of MR images and has shown satisfactory results.
