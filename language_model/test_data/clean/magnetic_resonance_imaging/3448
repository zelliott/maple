Histoplasmosis with central nervous system involvement typically arises in the immunocompromised patient with disseminated fungal disease. Rarely, neurologic histoplasmosis may arise as an isolated syndrome in immunocompetent individuals without evidence of general dissemination. The disease often is diagnostically challenging, and a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis. We describe an immunocompetent 13-year-old girl with atypical symptoms and unusual radiologic findings due to laboratory-confirmed histoplasma meningoencephalitis. She responded well to antifungal therapy.
