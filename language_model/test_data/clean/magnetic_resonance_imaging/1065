Primary brain tumors rarely metastasize outside of the central nervous system. A case of 37-year-old woman with a temporal lobe glial tumor which shows infratemporal and orbital invasion is presented. She had undergone a cranial operation because of temporal lobe epilepsy 8 years ago. Defects on the dura and bone flap were thought to be the mechanisms of the infratemporal fossa invasion. The case illustrates extra-axial metastasis of glioblastoma multiforme, an exceptional finding.
