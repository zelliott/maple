Usually the clinical manifestations between spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease) and metastasis are not characteristic. Nevertheless, their respective imaging presentations are typical and specific, which makes it relatively easier to attain a correct diagnosis. Imaging features of Pott's disease, in general, include narrowing of intervertebral disk space, collapse of vertebral bodies with eventual progression to kyphotic deformity, destruction of the anterior parts of adjacent vertebrae, formation of a large paravertebral abscess, and calcifications or sequestra within the paravertebral abscess. Spinal tuberculosis is usually endemic, especially in Eastern countries. However, the trend of cancer incidence is also increasing in modern society, which makes it difficult to diagnose spinal osseous lesions. This article presents a case of a 45-year-old man with a 9-month history of low back pain. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine supported the initial diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis. However, pathological examination on the excised specimen resulted in the diagnosis of spinal metastatic adenocarcinoma. We suggest that a definitive diagnosis of spinal metastasis or tuberculosis should not be based on imaging alone. Instead, more attention should be paid to atypical imaging presentations. In addition, biopsy is usually necessary for final diagnosis.
