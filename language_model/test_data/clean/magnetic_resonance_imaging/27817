We describe a case of extraosseous chordoma disseminated in the subarachnoid space with favorable long-term follow-up. During work-up of headaches in a 13-year-old girl, MRI revealed multiple cystic subarachnoid masses in the posterior fossa and spinal canal. She underwent posterior fossa craniectomy and was found to have multicentric subarachnoid chordomas with positive CSF cytology. Six years after the operation and radiotherapy, the girl is without neurological deficits despite persistent multiple subarachnoid cystic masses.
