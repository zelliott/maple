A 5 month old boy was found by his mother to have a bony mass behind the left ear which extended intracranially on MRI scan. At surgery it was entirely extradural in location. Microscopically, a biphasic appearance consisting of large pigmented cells arranged into tubules and small nonpigmented basophilic cells arranged into nests gave rise to a diagnosis of melanotic neuroectodermal tumour of infancy [MNETI]. One year after a wide local excision the patient is tumor-free and developing normally. The prognosis for MNETI in general is excellent with no requirement for additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
