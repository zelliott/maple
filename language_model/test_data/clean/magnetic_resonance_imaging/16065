Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the knee is capable of accurately identifying and characterizing cartilage injuries and degeneration. Optimal cartilage imaging requires an understanding of the relationship between cartilage structure and the MR image, acquisition of images with adequate resolution, a purposeful interrogation of the images by a reviewer possessing an understanding of the appearance of tissue pathology as well as common pitfalls and artifacts, and finally, the accurate and consistent reporting of results.
