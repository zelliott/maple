Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is a rare sarcoma of peripheral nerves found most often in deep soft tissue. This aggressive tumor is difficult to diagnose clinically and must be surgically excised for therapy. An incisional biopsy will allow for testing and in most cases, diagnosis. The authors present a case of a 39-year-old African American woman with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in association with the sural nerve. The tumor was surgically removed and sent for pathologic studies. The patient reported to her first postoperative appointment and was referred to an oncologist for follow-up. Despite multiple attempts at contacting the patient and explaining the prognosis of the diagnosis, the patient refused further follow-up care including referral to an oncologist.
