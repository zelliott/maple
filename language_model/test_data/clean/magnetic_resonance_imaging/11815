The improvement of preclinical emergency medicine has increased the long-term survival of patients which sustained severe injuries of the spinal cord. However, the incidence of late complications has been increased due to the long-term survival. With the increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in this patient group the diagnosis of typical late complications of the spinal cord has improved. In this article we suggest the following terms to describe late complications of the spinal cord: syrinx, atrophy, cyst, malacia, disruption, and thethering.
