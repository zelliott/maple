Paraspinal neurogenic tumours may have associated intraspinal tumour extension. It is important that such extension be accurately defined preoperatively in order that an appropriate surgical approach may be planned. It has been suggested in the literature that MRI (where available) should replace myelography and post myelographic CT in the preoperative evaluation of these patients. The literature is reviewed and the potential role of MRI is illustrated in three cases.
