We describe a Finnish boy with megalocornea, urticaria pigmentosa, mild delay in speech and motor development, and slightly dysmorphic facial features. The karyotype and the array-CGH analysis did not reveal any abnormalities. This combination of symptoms has not been reported previously suggesting this might be a new syndrome with an unknown etiology.
