The TNM Classification was rewritten by UICC in 1987. For non-small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma, stages T4 and N3 were redefined. Controversy exists in the literature regarding the clinical merits of CT and MRI examinations for staging. For the evaluation of very small tumors and lung parenchyma CT is superior to MRI. MRI, however, permits direct imaging of sagittal and coronal projections. This is favorable in the diagnosis of "superior sulcus tumors" and tumors with chest wall invasion. For the evaluation of T4 tumors and mediastinal lymph-node involvement, no additional contrast medium is necessary if MRI is used. Up to now, the main limitations for the application of MRI in thoracic imaging have been and still are the availability of the equipment, the costs, the necessary technical support, and the extensive study time.
