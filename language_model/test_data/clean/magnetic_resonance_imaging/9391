The paper discusses a case of recurrent posterior skull base meningioma with extracranial metastases. Metastases of meningioma may spread through venous system, lymphatic vessels and cerebrospinal fluid, and also via contact route (implantation). Penetration of dura mater of venous sinuses leads to invasion of tumor cells and their spread into pulmonary circulation, system of vena azygos and hemiazygos, vertebral venous plexuses which may facilitate further dissemination of the tumor. Histological examination of recurrent meningiomas requires additional immunohistochemical investigation with estimation of proliferative activity.
