Glial cells play an important role in normal brain function and emerging evidence would suggest that their dysfunction may be responsible for some epileptic disease states. Neuroimaging of glial cells is desirable, but there are no clear methods to assess neither their function nor localization. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now part of a standardized epilepsy imaging protocol to assess patients. Structural volumetric and T2-weighted imaging changes can assist in making a positive diagnosis in a majority of patients. The alterations reported in structural and T2 imaging is predominantly thought to reflect early neuronal loss followed by glial hypertrophy. MR spectroscopy for myo-inositol is a being pursued to identify glial alterations along with neuronal markers. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is ideal for acute epileptiform events, but is not sensitive to either glial cells or neuronal long-term changes found in epilepsy. However, DWI variants such as diffusion tensor imaging or q-space imaging may shed additional light on aberrant glial function in the future. The sensitivity and specificity of PET radioligands, including those targeting glial cells (translocator protein) hold promise in being able to image glial cells. As the role of glial function/dysfunction in epilepsy becomes more apparent neuroimaging methods will evolve to assist the clinician and researcher in visualizing their location and function.
