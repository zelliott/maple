Assessment of right ventricular function by 2-dimensional echocardiography (2DECHO) is difficult because of its complex shape. Real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DECHO) may be superior.

End-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, and ejection fraction obtained by 2DECHO, RT3DECHO short-axis disk summation (DS), and RT3DECHO apical rotation were compared with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in 71 healthy individuals.

RT3DECHO DS showed less volume underestimation compared with 2DECHO and RT3DECHO apical rotation. Test-retest variability for RT3DECHO DS end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, and ejection fraction were 3.3%, 8.7%, 10%, and 10.3%, respectively. Normal reference ranges of indexed volumes (mean +/- 2SD) for right ventricular end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, and ejection fraction were 38.6 to 92.2 mL/m(2), 7.8 to 50.6 mL/m(2), 22.5 to 42.9 mL/m(2), and 38.0% to 65.3%, respectively, for women and 47.0 to 100 mL/m(2), 23.0 to 52.6 mL/m(2), 14.2 to 48.4 mL/m(2), and 29.9% to 58.4%, respectively, for men.

RT3DECHO DS is superior to RT3DECHO apical rotation and 2DECHO for right ventricular quantification, and performs acceptably when compared with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in healthy individuals.
