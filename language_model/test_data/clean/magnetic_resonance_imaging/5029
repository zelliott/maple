We report a patient with partial oculomotor paresis due to midbrain infarction. A 69-year-old man noticed diplopia suddenly. Ptosis, and impaired adduction and supraduction were found in the right eye. The pupillary size and light reflexes were normal on both sides. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed an acute lesion in the right inferolateral oculomotor fascicle. These clinicoradiological findings suggested that the inferolateral fascicular damage could cause palsy of the levator palpebrae, medial rectus, superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles. Physicians should pay more attention to oculomotor fascicular infarction in patients with incomplete oculomotor paresis, and spared pupil sphincter and inferior rectus muscles.
