A 58-year-old male with systemic T-cell lymphoma involving the brainstem eccentrically, showed varying abnormal auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). The initial ABR demonstrated a prolonged V wave peak latency and an I-V IPL on admission. Four months later, all waves were absent bilaterally. Neuropathological examination at autopsy revealed that most of the nuclei and tracts associated with the auditory system were destroyed by lymphoid cell infiltration. It suggested that in the early stages of this disease, lymphoid cells could have involved the lower brainstem and, subsequently, in the advanced stages invaded the inferior colliculus.
