Pott's disease or spinal tuberculosis is rare, but represents the most common form of osteo-articular tuberculosis in endemic countries.

[corrected] From January 2000 to December 2010, we collected 16 cases of Pott's disease. We analyzed clinical and radiological profile, means of confirmation and treatment.

Spinal and chest pain were the most frequent signs. Four patients had neurological signs. The diagnosis was made by the detection of bacillus in the pus of paravertebral abscess in six cases, by histological study of vertebral biopsy in five cases, biopsy of another associated lesion in one case and in front of radio-clinical arguments with good clinical evolution under antibacillary treatment in four cases. The antibacillary treatment associating four drugs was indicated and correctly followed by all patients. Surgical drainage was associated in five cases. The evolution was good in all cases.

Diagnosis of Pott's disease is late when there is no neurological sign. Imaging allows to make early diagnosis with MRI. Prognosis is good when treatment is started early.
