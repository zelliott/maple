Fluid-fluid levels in bone tumors have been described in aneurysmal bone cysts and other cystic tumors of bones and soft tissue tumors. We experienced three bone tumors (simple bone cyst, bone metastasis, and osteosarcoma) and three soft tissue tumors (fibrosarcoma, two cases of cavernous hemangioma) that showed fluid-fluid levels on MR, and investigated their cause. Causes included blood in the cystic spaces, hemorrhage in the tumor, the telangiectatic component of the osteosarcoma, and the cavernous component of the hemangioma. No specific diagnosis could be made based on the finding of fluid-fluid levels. We conclude that fluid-fluid levels on MR are rather nonspecific findings in bone and soft tissue tumors and that the diagnosis should be made on the basis of other radiological and clinical findings.
