In a patient with a limited lesion of the spinal cord at the C6-C7 junction, ulnar and superficial radial-induced modulations of the motor evoked potentials (MEP) and of ongoing electromyographic (EMG) activity were observed in the biceps (above the lesion) but not in the triceps (below the lesion). This suggests an interruption of the axons of cervical propriospinal neurons. This relay transmits an indirect (disynaptic) component of corticospinal excitation to human upper limb motoneurons. Changes in it might be involved in compensatory mechanisms following central motor disorders.
