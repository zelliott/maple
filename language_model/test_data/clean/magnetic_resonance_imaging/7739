Schistosomiasis affects over 200 million people worldwide. Involvement of the CNS is a rare occurrence. We report 2 young males who presented with rapidly progressing paraparesis associated with urinary incontinence. In both cases, MRI of the spine demonstrated a diffusely enhancing mass at the conus medullaris with extensive spinal cord edema. Laboratory investigations revealed mild peripheral eosinophilia and abnormal, but non-specific, CSF analysis. In one patient, the diagnosis was made based on a rising schistosomal titer with a positive rectal biopsy. In the other patient, spinal cord biopsy revealed a granuloma. Both cases were caused by Schistosoma mansoni and patients were treated with praziquantel and steroid therapy. They both made a remarkable neurological recovery. We emphasize that a high index of suspicion should be raised in the differential diagnosis of transverse myelitis in endemic areas.
