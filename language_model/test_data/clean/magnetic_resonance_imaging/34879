Interstitial laser coagulation (ILC) is a minimally invasive treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The objective of ILC is to induce shrinking of the prostate while preserving all surrounding tissues. To achieve thermal coagulation well inside the adenoma, not at its urethral surface, laser radiation of a Nd:YAG laser or a diode laser is transmitted by specially designed laser fibers repeatedly placed in the prostate tissue. This results in secondary atrophy and regression of the prostate lobes, not sloughing of necrotic tissue. Since, July 1991, more than 800 patients have been treated in several studies. Based on initial experiences, many technical and procedural improvements of ILC have been introduced for clinical use, such as advanced radiation programs and new application devices including optical feedback systems. Imaging studies demonstrated treatment effects and allowed further treatment optimization. Clinical studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of ILC. This review summarizes several articles published on ILC and reports initial results of ongoing studies comparing ILC and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).
