The authors report the main clinical and radiographic aspects of a circumscribed myositis ossificans in a 5 year old child located in the thoracic wall, near the sternum, stimulating a malignant tumor. CT scan was more contributive than MRI, both for diagnosis and survey, because it shows better the progressive peripheral calcification typical of the lesion.
