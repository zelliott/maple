Eight magnetic resonance (MR) examinations were performed in seven patients with Achilles tendon injuries and correlated with physical examination and surgical and clinical follow-up. The MR examinations depicted the Achilles tendon in excellent detail and Achilles tendon abnormalities with greater accuracy than physical examination. Of five tendons shown to be at least partially torn on MR, palpable tendinous defects were found in only one, and plantarflexion weakness was found in four. The MR and surgical findings precisely correlated in one case. Magnetic resonance proved valuable in the evaluation of clinically equivocal Achilles tendon tears and may ultimately play a greater role as a research tool in the determination of optimal forms of therapy for specific Achilles tendon injuries.
