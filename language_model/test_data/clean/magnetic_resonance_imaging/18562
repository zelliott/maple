A review of Paget's disease produces few surprises; however, several good articles have recently been published on its appearance, on MR imaging, sarcomatous degeneration, and the disease-related occurrence of multicentric giant-cell tumors. One recent paper illustrated the possible progression of fibrous dysplasia occurring in the skull after adolescence, a finding that does not occur elsewhere. An excellent review article on the normal and abnormal calcaneus is reviewed, and two brief reports on skeletal angiomatosis are discussed. Condensing osteitis of the clavicle is well described in one article that proves it to be an entity distinct from chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis of the clavicle seen in children. Finally, a number of articles on congenital spinal anomalies are reviewed.
