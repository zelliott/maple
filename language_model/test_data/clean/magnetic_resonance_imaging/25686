Clinical manifestations, findings, management and outcome of a series of 177 cases with tumours of the limbic and paralimbic systems are presented. There was no operative mortality. Postoperatively 95% of them had no or only minor neurological deficits. Most of them were able to resume work. Pre-operatively 77% of the patients had epilepsy, but 84% became seizure-free after tumour removal. All 77 cases with malignant tumours died within 1-5 years. In the past many neurosurgeons were reluctant to attempt complete tumour removal in these areas. This series demonstrates the efficacy of highly skilled microneurosurgery.
