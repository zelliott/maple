The authors assessed whether magnetoencephalography/magnetic source imaging (MEG/MSI) identified epileptogenic zones in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In six TSC children with focal seizures, ictal video-EEG predicted the region of resection with 56% sensitivity, 80% specificity, and 77% accuracy (p = 0.02), whereas interictal MEG/MSI fared better (100%, 94%, and 95%, respectively; p < 0.0001). Interictal MEG/MSI seems to identify epileptogenic zones more accurately in children with TSC and focal intractable epilepsy.
