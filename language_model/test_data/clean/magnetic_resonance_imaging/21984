A 69-year-old man presented for further examination for left renal mass. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a heterogenous mass on the left side of a horseshoe kidney accompanied with renal vein thrombus. Aortography showed a hypervascular mass in the left kidney and aberrant arteries to the isthmus originating from the aorta. A left nephrectomy with the division of the isthmus was performed through an abdominal transperitoneal approach. Histological evaluation revealed grade 2, stage T3b, renal cell carcinoma. The patient was free of tumor, but died of intracerebral hemorrhage 5 months after the operation.
