Ovarian fibromas and cystadenofibromas are neoplasms that share a similar distinctive tissue component of dense fibrous tissue. We sought to describe the MRI features of these neoplasms and to determine if the fibrous component shows distinctive characteristics. Fourteen patients in whom MR images performed with multicoil and fast-spin-echo images and who subsequently underwent surgery for resection of ovarian fibromas or cystadenofibromas were identified from two institutions. Five patients had ovarian fibromas, and nine patients had fourteen cystadenofibromas. 1.5-T MR studies used T1-weighted spin echo and multiplanar T2-weighted fast-spin-echo images, with fat saturation gadolinium-enhanced fast multiplanar gradient-echo images in seven patients. Studies were reviewed for findings of low (approximately equal to skeletal muscle) signal intensity solid components on T2-weighted images, characteristics of gadolinium enhancement, and associated endometrial findings. Images were obtained ex vivo from three adnexal surgical specimens with an 8-cm field of view and correlated with histology. All five of the fibromas showed predominantly very low signal intensity, similar to skeletal muscle, on T2-weighted images. Two of five fibromas were in patients with endometrial polyps and increased amounts of fluid in the pelvis. Thirteen cystadenofibromas were multicystic masses with bands of very low signal intensity ranging from 2 to 20 mm in the wall of the mass, and one was predominantly solid fibrous tissue. Pathologic correlation with specimen images showed that the low signal intensity material was the subepithelial fibrous component of the cystadenofibromas. Fibrous components of ovarian fibromas and cystadenofibromas are demonstrable by MR as solid components representing fibrous tissue of very low signal intensity on T2-weighted images.
