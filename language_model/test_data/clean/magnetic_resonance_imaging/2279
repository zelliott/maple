Because no treatment is available and its rare prevalence, uterine fundal agenesis is seldom mentioned in the literature. A woman with uterine corpus agenesis, without other genital tract anomalies, presented with primary amenorrhea and infertility. Gonadotropins and ovarian steroids showed normal cyclic variations. A thorough evaluation, including history, physical examination, and appropriate imaging techniques [hysterosalpingography, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] demonstrated extreme accuracy with MRI in the diagnosis of the anatomic defect. MRI permits noninvasive differentiation of uterine anomalies and may spare the patient's diagnostic laparoscopy.
