Most neuroimaging studies of resting state networks have concentrated on functional connectivity (FC) based on instantaneous correlation in a single network. In this study we investigated both FC and effective connectivity (EC) based on Granger causality of four important networks at resting state derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging data - default mode network (DMN), hippocampal cortical memory network (HCMN), dorsal attention network (DAN) and fronto-parietal control network (FPCN).

A method called correlation-purged Granger causality analysis was used, not only enabling the simultaneous evaluation of FC and EC of all networks using a single multivariate model, but also accounting for the interaction between them resulting from the smoothing of neuronal activity by hemodynamics. FC was visualized using a force-directed layout upon which causal interactions were overlaid. FC results revealed that DAN is very tightly coupled compared to the other networks while the DMN forms the backbone around which the other networks amalgamate. The pattern of bidirectional causal interactions indicates that posterior cingulate and posterior inferior parietal lobule of DMN act as major hubs. The pattern of unidirectional causal paths revealed that hippocampus and anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) receive major inputs, likely reflecting memory encoding/retrieval and cognitive integration, respectively. Major outputs emanating from anterior insula and middle temporal area, which are directed at aPFC, may carry information about interoceptive awareness and external environment, respectively, into aPFC for integration, supporting the hypothesis that aPFC-seeded FPCN acts as a control network.

Our findings indicate the following. First, regions whose activities are not synchronized interact via time-delayed causal influences. Second, the causal interactions are organized such that cingulo-parietal regions act as hubs. Finally, segregation of different resting state networks is not clear cut but only by soft boundaries.
