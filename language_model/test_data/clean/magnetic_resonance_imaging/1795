The importance of intraspinal malformations associated with "tethered cord" (attachment of the spinal cord) has increased in recent years, because of better imaging methods using nuclear magnet resonance (MRI). Orthopedic malformations such as club feet, equinus deformity, lordosis, hip dislocation, kyphosis, and differences of leg lengths, which up till now have been mostly treated by orthopedic surgeons, are usually first examined for congenital anomalies. According to the results of this examination, a neurosurgical operation for untethering is performed. The aim of our study is to define spinal malformations more exactly and to elucidate their importance for orthopedics. In addition, indications for operating, operative aims, diagnosis, therapy and follow-up are discussed. Examples of our results are shown, and the significance for interdisciplinary cooperation is emphasized.
