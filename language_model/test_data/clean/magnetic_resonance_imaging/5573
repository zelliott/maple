Skeletal system involvement is a relatively common complication of human brucellosis. However, muscular involvement and psoas abscess are less frequently seen. Psoas abscess is usually secondary to spondylitis. We report on a 45-year-old man and a 51-year-old woman with brucellosis complicated with spondylitis and psoas abscess. The man was successfully treated with the triple antibiotic regimen with percutaneous drainage of abscess. The woman was treated using an antibiotic combination.
