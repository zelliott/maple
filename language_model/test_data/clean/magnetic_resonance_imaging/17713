Until recently, metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants were commonly used for joint replacement and resurfacings. Their use has rapidly declined following reports of Fr√ºhversagen and soft tissue disease caused by the release of metal debris from the prosthesis. Detection of these soft tissue lesions has proven difficult using conventional imaging techniques and blood metal ion tests. Current guidelines recommend the use of imaging modalities including metal artefact reduction sequence (MARS) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography and ultrasound but provide little indication which is best. MARS significantly reduces the susceptibility artefact induced by the presence of metal objects, thereby producing diagnostic quality images that can be shared with other physicians and compared over time. The clinical interpretation of MRI findings of solid pseudotumours and severe muscle atrophy is straightforward: revision is usually recommended. However, the most common MRI findings are of a cystic pseudotumour and minor muscle wasting. In these cases decision-making is difficult and we currently use multi-disciplinary and multi-colleague based meetings to make decisions regarding patient management. This article presents a comparison of imaging modalities and an update on the interpretation of MARS MRI for the investigation of patients with MoM hip implants.The English full-text version of this article is available at Springer Link (under "Supplemental").
