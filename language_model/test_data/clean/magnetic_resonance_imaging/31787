Cross-sectional.

(1) To determine the effects of the level of spinal cord injury (SCI) on skeletal muscle, intramuscular fat (IMF) cross-sectional areas (CSAs) and relative IMF; (2) to determine the relation, if any, of spasticity to each of these variables after incomplete SCI.

In-patient study at the Shepherd Center, Atlanta, GA, USA.

Thirteen individuals with incomplete SCI were classified according to their level of injury into a high level of injury group (HLI, C5-C7, n=8) and a low level of injury group (LLI, T12-L2, n=5). Spasticity was determined for thigh muscles using a modified Ashworth scale at 6 weeks post-injury. T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images were taken 6 weeks post-injury to measure thigh skeletal muscle and IMF CSAs.

Spasticity was significantly evident in the HLI group compared to the LLI group (P=0.023). Six weeks post-injury, muscle CSA was 103+/-18 cm(2) in the HLI group and 80+/-20 cm(2) in the LLI group (P=0.042). Relative IMF was 3.6+/-2.0% in HLI and 7.5+/-4.0% in LLI (P=0.021). Additionally, spasticity accounted for 54% of the variability in muscle CSA for all subjects (r (2)=0.54, P=0.006).

Spasticity may be an important factor in defending skeletal muscle size and indirectly preventing IMF accumulation early after incomplete SCI.
