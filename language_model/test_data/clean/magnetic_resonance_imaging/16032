Groin pain is a commonly encountered problem in musculoskeletal radiology. The diagnosis can be difficult to establish, based on the complex interconnected anatomy at the pubic symphysis and surrounding structures. The differential diagnosis is therefore broad, and diagnostic imaging is crucial in reaching the correct diagnosis, thus allowing appropriate therapy to be instituted. This article reviews the relevant anatomy and differential diagnoses encountered in overuse injuries of the groin. The common mechanisms of injury, presenting symptoms, and imaging findings for each diagnosis are addressed.
