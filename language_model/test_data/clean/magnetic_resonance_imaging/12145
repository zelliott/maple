A rare case of encephalo-myelo- radiculitis with high herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) antibody index of CSF was reported. The case was a 43-year-old male. Double vision, cerebellar ataxia, Th4-12 truncal segmental total sensory disturbance and urinary retention were found, but those symptoms disappeared after 3 weeks of administration of acyclovir and prednisolone. Because the HSV-1 antibody index of the CSF increased significantly, the patient's disease was summarised to have been due to HSV-1, T1-intensified MRI revealed a low-intensity area in the Th5-8 region which coincided with the lesion causing the neurological symptoms, while T2-intensified MRI revealed scattered high intensity area in the cerebral hemisphere. MRI was thus useful for confirming the lesions.
