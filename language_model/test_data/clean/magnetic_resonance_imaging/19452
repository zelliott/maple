Papillary transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder has a loose connective tissue stalk. For staging of bladder cancer on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is important to clearly separate the cancer from the bladder wall. It is possible to distinguish a stalk from the cancer by the difference of intensity on the using MRI. Sixteen stalks of 20 polypoid bladder tumors on any of the T(2)W(I), dynamic images and delayed enhanced images were demonstrated. Most of the stalks show lower signal intensity than the tumors on T(2)W(I), less enhancement on dynamic images and stronger enhancement on delayed enhanced images. The stalk consisted of fibrous connective tissue, capillary blood vessels, inflammatory cell infiltration and edema. This stalk extended from the bladder wall to the center of the tumor. Some of the superficial muscular bundles were pulled into the stalk. These histopathological findings were compatible with the patterns of signal intensities on MRI. The identification of the stalk of a polypoid tumor may be an important observation to exclude bladder wall invasion by tumor.
