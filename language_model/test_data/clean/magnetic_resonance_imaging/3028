An unusual case of parenchymal hemorrhagic metastases to the cerebrum and cerebellum in a child with retroperitoneal neuroblastoma is presented. While isolated parenchymal central nervous system (CNS) metastases have not typically been considered in association with neuroblastoma, review of the literature suggests an increased frequency of this manifestation, especially since 1980. Metastatic neuroblastoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of multiple hemorrhagic parenchymal brain lesions in the pediatric population.
