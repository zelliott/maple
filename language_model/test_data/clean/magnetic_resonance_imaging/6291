There is still a need to prove that even static magnetic fields up to 1.5 T used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are biologically safe and harmless for humans. Recordings of median and ulnar nerves and brain-stem auditory evoked potentials in 20 patients were completed prior to and after MRI investigation of the central nervous system. Neither the somatosensory nor the auditory evoked potentials exhibited any significant change of latencies, interpeak latencies or amplitudes. Since these electrophysiological parameters are highly dependent on the quality of nerve conduction and integrity of information processing in various nuclei, it may be assumed that MRI causes no lasting changes in either respect.
