To investigate cerebral structure in Tourette's syndrome (TS).

Voxel-based morphometry study of high-resolution MRIs in 31 TS patients compared with 31 controls.

Increased gray matter mainly in the left mesencephalon in 31 TS patients.

This result constitutes strong and direct evidence supporting Devinsky's hypothesis (Devinsky O. Neuroanatomy of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. Possible midbrain involvement. Arch Neurol 1983;40:508-514) according to which midbrain disturbances play an important pathogenic role in TS.
