Several findings support the hypothesis that the striatum is implicated in executive functions and in the modulation of goal-directed behavior, and could play a key role in the pathophysiology and in the production of symptoms and signs in schizophrenia. We have studied the relationship between the objective measures of the striatal structures, as evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) performance in a schizophrenic sample. Thirty-five schizophrenic patients underwent MRI scans of striatal structure and neuropsychological evaluation of executive functions by WCST. Poor WCST performers had a reduction of the left caudate nucleus and putamen, and right total striatum when compared to 24 healthy controls. Significant correlation coefficients were also observed between neuropsychological indexes and left striatal measures. The findings suggest the existence of a relationship between abnormalities of striatal structure and abnormal executive-type or organizational cognitive functions.
