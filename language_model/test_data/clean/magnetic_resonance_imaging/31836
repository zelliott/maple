The aim of this study was to assess whether the in vivo specific force and architectural characteristics of the lateral gastrocnemius (GL) muscle of early pubescent boys (n = 11, age = 10.9 +/- 0.3 yr, Tanner stage 2) differed from those of adult men (n = 12, age = 25.3 +/- 4.4 yr). Plantarflexor torque was 55% lower in the boys (77.4 +/- 21.4 N x m) compared with the adults (175.6 +/- 31.7 N x m, P < 0.01). Physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), determined in vivo using ultrasonography and MRI, was 52% smaller in the boys (P < 0.01). No difference was found in pennation angle, or in the ratio of fascicle length (L(f)) to muscle length between the boys and men. Moment arm length was 25% smaller in the boys (P < 0.01). Antagonist coactivation, assessed using surface EMG on the dorsiflexors, was not different between the boys and men (11.8 +/- 6.7% and 13.5 +/- 5.8%, respectively). Surprisingly, GL force normalized to PCSA (specific force) was significantly higher (21%) in the boys than in the men (13.1 +/- 2.0 vs. 15.9 +/- 2.7 N/cm(2), P < 0.05). This finding could not be explained by differences in moment arm length, muscle activation, or architecture, and other factors, such as tendinous characteristics and/or changes in moment arm length with contraction, may be held responsible. These observations warrant further investigation.
