Several studies have found atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether callosal atrophy is already present in the early stages of AD, and to what extent it may be associated with other structural changes in the brain, such as age-related white matter changes (ARWMC) and progression of the disease.

Twenty-eight patients in the early stages of AD and 50 non-demented elderly subjects with varying degrees of ARWMC were investigated using MRI. The CC was assessed semi-automatically, and ARWMC were rated according to the Fazekas scale.

A significant difference in posterior CC size could be detected between non-demented elderly subjects and early stage AD patients. The sizes of the total CC, rostral body and splenium at baseline were correlated with change from baseline MMSE score after a 1-year follow-up in AD patients. There was no association between CC size and ARWMC.

The present findings indicate that posterior CC atrophy is present in mild AD independently of ARWMC. Furthermore, CC atrophy may be associated with cognitive deterioration.
