Tanycytic ependymoma is a rare fibrillary variant of ependymoma with a predilection for the spinal cord. We present an unusual supratentorial subcortical tanycytic ependymoma in a 17-year old male presenting with seizures. Only two other cases of subcortical tanycytic ependymoma have been reported.
