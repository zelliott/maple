The rotator cable is an extension of the coracohumeral ligament coursing along the undersurface of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons. The rotator cable is thought to play a role in the biomechanical function of the intact and torn rotator cuff. It can be seen on all the imaging planes used for the conventional magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder. Clinically, the integrity of the rotator cable can play a role in the treatment selection for patients with a rotator cuff tear.
