Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery has seen significant progress since bioabsorbable interference screws have replaced synthetic metallic screws for ligament graft fixation within the femoral and tibial osseous tunnel. Our study compared the MR images of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using bioabsorbable interference screws with those of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using metallic screws to evaluate the MR aspects of degradation and osteointegration processes of bioabsorbable interference screws post-operatively.

Between September 1999 and December 2002 we performed MRI on 40 patients who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon auto-graft using PDLLA bioabsorbable screws in 35 cases and metallic screws in 5 cases. After surgery, all patients underwent an intensive rehabilitation programme along with clinical evaluation using the standard knee ligament evaluation form of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and radiological examinations. MR studies were performed 1, 2 and 3 years post-operatively using a 0.5-Tesla MR scanner with T1- and T2*-weighted and STIR sequences.

Thirty-three patients were clinically classified as group A IKDC (full return to sports activity) and 7 patients as group B IKDC. No foreign-body reaction was found in patients treated with bioabsorbable interference screws, both from a clinical point of view and from laboratory exams. Ferromagnetic artefacts were found in all patients treated with metallic interference screws. In patients with bioabsorbable interference screws, degradation of the screws and absence of significant artefacts allowed correct evaluation of the signal of the reconstructed ligament throughout its length, the osseous tunnels and the joint cavity. In 34 of 35 patients with bioabsorbable interference screws, the screw could not be detected due to complete degradation. In 8, 12 and 4 cases, a small cyst-like formation due to screw hydrolysis was present at the screw site within 1, 2 and 3 years from surgery respectively. Only in 4 cases was the process of osteointegration of the screw and bone plug complete 3 years after the operation, with consequent restoration of bone morphology.

The use of bioabsorbable interference screws is a valuable alternative to synthetic metallic fixation implants as the absence of artefacts allows correct post-operative MR follow-up. MRI is the only technique able to visualize all the portions of the transplant and to evaluate the healing process. Bioabsorbable interference screws usually degrade within one year. However, full osteointegration requires a long time and may not be complete 3 years after surgery. The presence of cyst-like formations at the screw site has to be regarded as a normal feature of the screw degradation process. Therefore, the use of bioabsorbable interference screws is recommended as it enables MR follow-up of the knee after ACL reconstruction.
