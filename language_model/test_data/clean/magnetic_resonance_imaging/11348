The aim of our study was to establish a simple in vivo method for water quantification in vasogenic edema, and provide data on imaging of mouse brain at 9.4 Tesla. Apparent T1 and spin density values determined by MRI were found to strongly correlate with the gravimetric water content of mouse brain undergoing cold injury. Using a two-point calibration line between the spin density values for pure water and cortex of mouse brain, as well as the corresponding water contents in vivo, water could be quantified with satisfactory accuracy.
