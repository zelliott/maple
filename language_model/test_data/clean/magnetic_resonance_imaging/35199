Cerebellum injury is a severe and underestimated complication in very low birth-weight infants. Six cases of extreme premature babies are reported: 3 of them died during the neonatal period; the other 3 survived with severe neurological disabilities. Microcephaly, strabismus, and severe developmental delay without major motor handicap are very peculiar for the preterm in the long-term outcome. Easy diagnosis is possible by specific ultrasound windows and early diagnosis is required regarding the possible severe prognosis and to organize precisely the follow-up.
