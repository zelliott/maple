Multimodality medical imaging enables measurement of the three-dimensional spatial distribution of a radiolabeled aerosol within the lung. Using a conceptual spatial morphological model these data may be transformed to provide information on deposition per airway generation. This methodology has been used to study the intrapulmonary deposition patterns of two formulations of a metered dose inhaler and two nebulizers in control subjects. The nebulizer study has also been stimulated using a computer model of deposition. The comparison between derived experimental results and those from computer modeling shows areas of agreement, although there are also areas of discrepancy. The new methodology has considerable potential value in the fields of inhalation therapy and deposition modeling, although more detailed validation is still required.
