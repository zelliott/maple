We have investigated the physicochemical and paramagnetic properties of the new gadolinium complexes of N-(pyrid-2-yl-methyl)-ethylenediamine-N,N,N-triacetic acid (Gd-PEDTA) and N-tris(2-aminoethyl)amine-N,N,N,N,N,N+hexaacetic acid(Gd-TTAHA). The relaxivities as well as the thermodynamic and conditional stability constants of these complexes with respect to the physiological relevance were determined and discussed in comparison with the commercially available gadolinium (III) diethylenetriaminpentaacetic acid/gadopentate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA, Magnevist). In case of Gd-TTAHA a twofold higher relaxivity and a complex stability similar to Gd-DTPA were determined. It is shown, that lower concentrations of Gd-TTAHA are sufficient for the same signal enhancement in the T1-weighted MR image compared with Gd-DTPA and, thus, the use of the new contrast agent Gd-TTAHA should diminish risks for health. Therefore, Gd-TTAHA might be used potentially as a new contrast agent for clinical MRI application.
