Studying discovertebral complex anatomy is extremely important for the understanding of the pathophysiology of disc degeneration which leads to vertebral endplates signal changes, also known as Modic changes.The sequelae of disc degeneration are among the leading causes of functional incapacity in both sexes and are one of the most common sources of chronic disability in the working years.
