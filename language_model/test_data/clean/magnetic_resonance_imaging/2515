To evaluate the usefulness of MIBI scintigraphy (MIBI) for parathyroid lesions, the detectability of lesions by MIBI was compared with that by Tl-Tc subtraction imaging, ultrasonography, CT and MRI in 56 histologically proved lesions. In neck lesions, ultrasonography (92%) and MIBI (85%) showed better detectability than those by the other three modalities. With MIBI, detectability was decreased for smaller parathyroid lesions that coexisted with thyroid disease. Among the five modalities, MIBI showed the highest detectability (88%) for ectopic or metastatic lesions. The smallest parathyroid lesions detected by MIBI were a parathyroid adenoma weighing 220mg and a parathyroid hyperplasia weighing 200mg. MIBI was thought to be more valuable for ectopic or metastatic parathyroid lesions.
