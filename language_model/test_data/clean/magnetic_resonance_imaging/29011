A rare case of leiomyoma of the prestyloid parapharyngeal space is reported together with computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings. The tumor appeared as a well-circumscribed ovoid mass with some calcifications and lobulations. Because the attenuation, signal intensity, and shape of the mass were not specific and were similar to those of a pleomorhic adenoma, the most common tumor of the prestyloid parapharyngeal space, radiological differentiation of leiomyoma from pleomorphic adenoma of the prestyloid parapharyngeal space was difficult.
