The Authors report their experience in the treatment of eleven patients over 70 years old (range from 70 to 83, average age 74.8, 7 males and 4 females), with histologically proven diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. The GC golden standard treatment is still debated, particularly in elderly patients. All the patients underwent a first line treament with chemotherapy (Temozolomide), followed by Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) and PCV schedule without Vincristine in case of progression of the disease. The median survival was 16.3 months, ranging from 13 to 22 months. According to our experience, elderly patients should undergo the same treatment of younger patients, provided they are in good health conditions.
