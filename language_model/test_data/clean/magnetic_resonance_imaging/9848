Tuberculosis of the sellar region, especially the pituitary gland, is rare. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate through a review of five clinical cases the value of imaging, especially MR imaging, in the evaluation of this pathology.

CT and MRI of the brain were obtained in all cases along with a chest radiograph.

Four patterns were detected on MRI: pituitary tuberculoma mimicking adenoma; pituitary abscess, extending to the cavernous sinus in one case and associated with infundibulum thickening in another; hypophysitis with suprasellar extension in association with tuberculous meningoencephalitis; and infundibular thickening associated with tuberculous meningoencephalitis. Diagnosis was based on biopsy in two cases and combination of imaging and clinical data in three cases. Outcome was favorable with anti-tuberculosis drugs.

Irrespective of the imaging features, a history of travel to an endemic region combined to other findings such as infundibular thickening should raise concern for the possibility of tuberculosis even in the absence of signs of systemic infection.
