A rare case of an extradurally growing spinal meningioma in an elderly woman is reported. Neuro-imaging, particularly magnetic resonance (MR), allowed to recognize the lesion, which, otherwise, could raise problems of differential diagnosis with a spinal metastasis. An emergency operation, required by a sudden neurological deterioration, was decisive in recovery of neurological deficits. In a review of the literature, extradurally growing spinal meningiomas appear to occur with a higher frequency than it is thought. Therefore, they are to be suspected when dealing with extradural spinal lesions.
