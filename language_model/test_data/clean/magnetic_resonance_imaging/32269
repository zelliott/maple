The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of endurance training on the early diastolic global and regional left ventricular (LV) relaxation with three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Fourteen subjects were examined with MRI before and after 3-month endurance training. Global early diastolic LV myocardial relaxation was assessed with mitral flow velocity mapping and regional LV early myocardial relaxation with myocardial tagging. LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and mass were assessed with cine Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mitral flow velocity mapping analysis revealed that the time to peak early filling shortened after training (before 112+/-32 ms, after 97+/-21, P<0.05), indicating more rapid global early myocardial relaxation. LV mass increased (97+/-19 g, 105+/-18, P<0.01) and end-systolic volume decreased (47+/-11 mL, 42+/-13, P<0.05). According to myocardial tagging analysis early myocardial relaxation in the septum and in the LV lateral wall increased (P<0.05). Regional tagging analysis showed enhanced myocardial relaxation in the basal septum (P<0.05). Global and regional LV early diastolic relaxation improved and physiological LV hypertrophy was found after the exercise training period for 3 months in healthy sedentary subjects.
