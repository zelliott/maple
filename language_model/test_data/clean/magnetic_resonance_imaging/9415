Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (LapRFA) is an established procedure for liver tumors in patients who are unsuitable for resection. A novel technique of magnetic resonance (MR) guided needle positioning during LapRFA was developed and compared to conventional ultrasound (US) guidance in a phantom model. MR-guided procedures were conducted in a 1.0 tesla high field open MR using an MR compatible endoscope and camera. The ultrasound-guided procedure was performed with a clinically established laparoscopy setup and a 2D laparoscopic US probe. During both techniques an identical monopolar non-ferromagnetic RFA needle and a silicon-based phantom model were applied. Finally needle positioning was performed by two surgeons and one interventionalist. Time to needle placement and number of trials were recorded and statistically analyzed. MR-guided needle positioning under laparoscopic control was technically feasible. Average time to correct needle placement was 2' 6″ in the LapUS group and 1' 54″ in the MR group. The number of trials was 3.2 in the LapUS group and 2.6 in the MR group. Image quality was assessed by all participants. MR images showed a better tissue to tumor contrast and allowed an improved orientation due to multiplanar visualization. MR-guided laparoscopic RFA is a promising technique offering multiplanar needle positioning with high soft tissue contrast with immediate therapy control. In a phantom model it showed comparable results regarding needle positioning to the established technique of laparoscopic US guidance.
