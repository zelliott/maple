The use of IORT as a treatment modality for patients with close or positive margins has increased over the past decade. For situations where a flat area (up to 6 cm in diameter) has to be treated intraoperatively, new applicators for superficial treatment with a miniature X-ray source (INTRABEAM system) were developed. Here we report our evaluation of the dosimetric characteristics of these new applicators and their first clinical use. Each of these flat and surface applicators consists of a radiation protective metal tube and a flattening filter, which converts the spherical dose distribution of the X-ray source into a flat one. The homogeneity of each dose distribution and depth-dose measurements were evaluated using film dosimetry in a solid water phantom and a soft X-ray ionization chamber in a water tank. The first patient was treated with 5 Gy delivered in 5 mm using a 4 cm FLAT applicator over 21 minutes. The flat applicators show the maximum homogeneity, with a uniformity ratio of 1.02-1.08 in certain depths. In 1 mm depth surface applicators show a uniformity ratio of 1.15-1.28. They also show a higher dose rate and a steeper dose gradient compared to the flat applicators. The results of this investigation demonstrated that the flat and surface applicators have unique dosimetric characteristics that need to be considered during the treatment planning stages. This work also showed that it is possible to perform a superficial localized IORT which provides new application possibilities for use of the INTRABEAM system.
