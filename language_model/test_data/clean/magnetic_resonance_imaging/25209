In the evaluation of common pancreatic diseases, MRCP is a noninvasive alternative to ERCP. Ductal anatomy can be ascertained without risk of complications. MRCP is valuable in defining common anatomic variants, determining the state of the pancreatic duct in pancreatitis, and characterizing neoplasms, especially combined with other MR imaging sequences. With the advent of MRCP, techniques requiring endoscopy and percutaneous access are largely reserved for histologic diagnosis and treatment, or for cases in which MRCP fails to establish a diagnosis.
