Post-cholecystectomy syndrome refers to a wide spectrum of conditions that pose a challenging diagnostic dilemma. Cystic duct remnant, defined as a residual duct greater than 1 cm in length, may, in the presence of stones, cause post-cholecystectomy syndrome. In this report, 4 patients with post-cholecystectomy syndrome due to cystic duct remnant are described. All underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and one was converted to open. The patients presented with pain 10 months to 9 years post-cholecystectomy and investigations demonstrated cystic duct remnant. All patients underwent successful resection with resolution of symptoms. In this era of laparoscopic surgery, where surgery favors a long cystic duct remnant, we should be aware of cystic duct stones as a possible cause of postcholecystectomy syndrome. This report highlights magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography as the optimal method for evaluating the biliary tract in these cases.
