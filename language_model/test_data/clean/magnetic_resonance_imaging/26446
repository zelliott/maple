A case report of a rare disease entity and review of the literature.

To illustrate the occurrence of an unusual disease affecting the spine and spinal canal.

Rosai-Dorman disease is considered an idiopathic benign lymphoproliferative disease that typically occurs in the earlier decades of life. The usual manifestation is painless massive cervical lymphadenopathy, although involvement of many extra nodal sites is common. This case illustrates Rosai-Dorman disease occurring in an elderly man with myelopathy and mass lesions of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal canal without typical lymphadenopathy.-

Case report illustrating clinical presentation as well as radiographic and pathologic findings, including comparisons to cases previously reported.

Surgical decompression with incomplete resection of the lesion was performed, providing diagnosis and treatment guidance. The patient experienced significant neurologic improvement of myelopathy.

Recognizing clinical and laboratory features of this disease may permit earlier diagnosis and limit or avoid surgical intervention in some cases.
