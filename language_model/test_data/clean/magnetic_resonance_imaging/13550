The authors report on a 15-year-old girl presenting with headache and nausea. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a diffuse leptomeningeal contrast enhancement 5 years after resection of a posterior fossa medulloblastoma followed by radio- and chemotherapy. A left frontal biopsy revealed tumor spread. Histopathological findings of the tumor were identical to those obtained from the original medulloblastoma. To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of late supratentorial leptomeningeal metastasis from a medulloblastoma while no local recurrence or spinal leptomeningeal dissemination had occurred.
