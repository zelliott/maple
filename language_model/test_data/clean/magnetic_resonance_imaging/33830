A case report of a spinal cord compression caused by ossification of the ligamenta flava is presented together with a review of the literature.

To present the diagnosis of ossification of the ligamenta flava in a Caucasian man with a proximal thoracic myelopathy.

This case shows that the upper parts of the thoracic spine can be involved in ossification of the ligamenta flava, which never before has been reported in Caucasian individuals. Furthermore, it is advised that computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging be combined to provide an accurate diagnosis and proper preoperative evaluation of the bony changes, spinal cord, and compression of the spinal cord.

A patient with a thoracic spinal cord compression caused by ossification of the ligamenta flava was treated surgically and made a good clinical recovery. Imaging studies, surgical findings, and results of histopathologic investigations were analyzed to substantiate the diagnosis.

The results of the surgical findings seemed to be in contrast with those of the imaging studies. This contrast was occasioned by the uncommon perioperative finding of a fusion of the completely ossified upper and lower parts of the involved adjacent ligamenta flava. Ossification of the ligamenta flava was diagnosed by histopathologic examination, which revealed endochondral ossification and lamellar bone formation without fragments of ligamenta flava.

Although rarely reported in whites, ossification of the ligamenta flava should be considered in all patients presenting with a spinal cord compression, even at high thoracic levels. The prognosis after decompressive surgery can be good, especially if intramedullary hyperintensities are absent on preoperatively performed T2-weighted magnetic resonance images.
