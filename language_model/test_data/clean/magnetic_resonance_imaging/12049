Granulocytic sarcomas are rare manifestations of diseases of the white corpuscles. The incidence of this type of disease is not yet known because it is so rare. We observed two patients, who had had a chronic myeloid leukemia for several years, and in whom such a tumor occurred during the development of a blastomatous crisis. Both patients were examined by MRI. With this method it is possible to depict changes of the bone marrow as well as extramedullary lesions. MRI is a highly sensitive, but a less specific method.
