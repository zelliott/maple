Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the breast are rare and represent less than 0.6% of all mammary malignancies. Secondary involvement of the breast in patients with diffuse disease occurs more frequently. The radiologic features of breast lymphoma are nonspecific, and the diagnosis is based on histologic criteria. We present the MR-imaging features of a case of primary NHL of the breast.
