Complete excision of sacrococcygeal chordoma is necessary at initial surgery due to its poor sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, due to the anatomic characteristics of this tumor, intralesional excision tends to be employed, resulting in local recurrences in many patients.

The clinical features and results of surgical treatment of 13 patients with sacrococcygeal chordoma who were treated at the Chiba Cancer Center and Chiba University beginning in 1972 were analyzed.

Intralesional excision was performed in eight patients, marginal excision in two patients, and wide excision in three patients. Local recurrence was observed in six patients, with a high proportion occurring in the gluteal muscles attached to the sacrum (the gluteus maximus muscle and piriform muscle). Seven patients died of their disease and six patients were alive with no evidence of disease. The 5-year survival rate was 81.8% and the 10-year survival rate was 29.1%.

It is highly possible that residual chordoma infiltrating the gluteal muscles accounts mainly for the local recurrences. Therefore, a precise preoperative assessment of the tumor infiltration into the gluteal muscles by magnetic resonance imaging is important for the prevention of local recurrence. For complete tumor removal, a radical wide posterior surgical margin of the gluteal muscles should be employed. A less radical anterior surgical margin is sufficient because there is a firm presacral fascia anterior to the sacrum. The appropriate surgical margin for the complete removal of the chordoma differs according to the location of the tumor and tissues involved.
