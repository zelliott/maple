The aim of this study is to find the different ligamentous structures in the subtalar region through dissection and to compare them with images obtained on MRI. MRI allows visualization of the different ligamentous structures with greater precision than with computerized tomography. This investigation should permit a more precise diagnosis of injuries often poorly understood in this region.
