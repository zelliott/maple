We describe an elderly patient presenting with cardio-embolic stroke who was found to have infective endocarditis (IE) affecting the mitral valve. Penicillin-resistant Facklamia hominis was identified as the causative pathogen. Despite initiation of aggressive antibiotic treatment, the patient suffered a fatal myocardial infarction 2 days post-diagnosis of IE. Facklamia spp. have not been previously reported to be associated with IE. Here, we discuss the link between IE and cardio-embolic stroke along with a discussion of various causative pathogens.
