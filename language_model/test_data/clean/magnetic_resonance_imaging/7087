The authors report an unusual case of arteriovenous communication between extracranial and intracranial vessels, accompanied by incidentally detected bilateral arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa. A 52-year-old male was admitted with a sudden onset of headache, vomiting, and conjunctival hyperemia of the right eye followed by progressive chemosis and proptosis. He had undergone a craniotomy for hypertensive right putaminal hemorrhage 4 months previously. Angiography showed the main feeding artery to be the superficial temporal artery and the draining veins to be the superficial Sylvian veins and the basal vein of Rosenthal. Partial obstruction of the right cavernous sinus was also shown. At surgery, granulation tissue continued to the dura mater through the skull aperture of previous craniotomy and adhered to the underlying damaged cerebrum. The extremely unusual nature of the communication, the operative findings, and the atypical fistulous figures suggested that communication had occurred postoperatively via newly generated vessels in granulation tissue.
