Most cases of carpal tunnel syndrome are idiopathic. One condition associated with carpal tunnel syndrome is a lipofibromatous hamartoma. We describe a case of a lipofibromatous hamartoma presenting as a soft tissue wrist swelling with associated symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome. We advocate that all soft tissue swellings of the wrist with associated neurological signs be investigated appropriately, avoiding unnecessary additional surgery.
