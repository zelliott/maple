Giant splenic artery aneurysm (GSAA) is a rare but clinically relevant disease. Its importance lies in potential rupture and hemorrhage. Early diagnosis and treatment before rupture of GSAA are crucial to GSAA patients especially to GSAA patients with portal hypertension(PHT).

Four patients of GSAA with PHT treated at our hospital from December 1999 to September 2001 were retrospectively reviewed.

GSAA was found in all patients with digital substracted angiography (DSA) and/or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) before operation. Resection of GSAA and treatment of PHT were carried out successfully with no perioperative mortality.

Patients with GSAA are apt to have PHT or segmental PHT because of suppression of the splenic vein or formation of aneurysm-portal vein fistula. Operation should be focused on GSAA, and PHT complications.
