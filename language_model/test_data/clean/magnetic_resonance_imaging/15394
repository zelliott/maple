The medial temporal lobes (MTLs) are essential for both encoding and retrieval processes in declarative memory. In addition, they are a frequent seizure focus for medically refractory epilepsy. One of the major side effects of MTL resection is a decline in memory functions. Most functional imaging paradigms have been developed to find preoperative measures that, to obtain a prognosis of postoperative memory performance, employ explicit memory encoding strategies to elicit MTL activation, and require a great amount of cognitive effort. We applied three different implicit encoding tasks, which require less effort and time, to a group of healthy subjects. We found left-lateralized activation for verbal stimuli, bilateral activation for pictures, and right-lateralized activation for faces. The present study shows that even with an implicit memory-encoding paradigm, a lateralized activation of MTL structures can be achieved. This may lead to paradigms for routine clinical application that require less cognitive effort and time on the part of patients.
