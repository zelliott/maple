The authors describe the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings of three cases of nasoalveolar cysts. Few previous reports have presented the CT and MR imaging findings of nasoalveolar cysts in detail, although a considerable number of reports have described these cysts. In the cases described, CT and MR images showed various densities and signal intensities due to different viscosities of intracystic fluid, and adjacent bony erosion of the anterior maxillary buccal cortex was seen in all cases.
