[corrected] To evaluate the results of laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal myelolipoma in a single center.

Between November 1999 and February 2006, 226 laparoscopic adrenalectomies were performed at our institution. 19 specimens corresponded with adrenal myelolipomas (8%). Mean patient age was 53.8 years (range 35 to 75) with male-to-female ratio 2:1. Clinical data was prospectively collected. Patient characteristics, lesion size evaluated by CT scan or MRI, surgical technique, operative time, operative blood loss, complications, conversion to open surgery and hospital stay were reviewed.

Nineteen adrenal myelolipomas were laparoscopically treated in eighteen patients. 16 lesions were located on the right adrenal gland (84%). Mean surgical time was 84.7 minutes (range 45 to 150). Average bleeding was 25.8 ml (range 0 to 300). Only one patient required a blood transfusion. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery. Average hospital stay was 2.1 days (range 1 to 4); no complications were registered during the immediate postoperative period. Pathology reports confirmed all specimens as myelolipomas. Mean maximum tumor diameter was 8.6 cm (range 4.5 to 14).

Adrenal myelolipoma is an infrequent, benign entity which can occasionally become symptomatic due to spontaneous hemorrhage. Typical radiographic presentation permits conservative management in asymptomatic small masses. In cases where surgical treatment is advocated, laparoscopic surgery is a safe and feasible technique with reasonable operating time as well as limited blood loss, hospital stay and convalescence.
