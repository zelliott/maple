We report a case of hepatic pseudolymphoma in a 67-year-old woman that was detected during an abdominal sonography screening. The lesion was further evaluated using CT, MRI, angiography, and contrast-enhanced sonography. The imaging features of this tumor are discussed herein. The diagnosis of pseudolymphoma was achieved via sonographically guided biopsy. The lesion regressed completely within 1 year.
