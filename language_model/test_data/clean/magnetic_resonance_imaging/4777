We report the radiological and MRI findings of bone oxalosis and their rapid and extensive progression in a child with primary hyperoxaluria (PH) type 1. We emphasize the spectrum of skeletal changes and their differences from renal osteodystrophy and the role played by imaging in the diagnosis and follow-up of oxalosis.
