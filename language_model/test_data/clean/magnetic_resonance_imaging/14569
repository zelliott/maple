Soft tissue chondromas are uncommon benign tumors found mostly in the hands and feet and rarely reported in the pediatric population. In this case presentation we describe a 10 year old boy who had an MRI for facial paralysis due to Ramsey Hunt Syndrome, which incidentally revealed a parapharyngeal mass. He underwent transoral resection of the mass without complication, and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of soft tissue chondroma. This case is unique due to the unusual location of the tumor and its presentation in a child.
