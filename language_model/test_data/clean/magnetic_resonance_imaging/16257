The field of cancer genetics is evolving rapidly, and much has changed over the past ten years in the way services are being provided and by whom they are being provided. We recount here our experience with the evolution of cancer genetic services in a community setting, focusing on collaboration with non-genetics providers to offer genetic testing for hereditary cancer. This approach allows for the most effective use of genetic counselors' expertise for challenging cases, and enables the patient to remain within their community to allow for better access to resources for long-term follow-up.
