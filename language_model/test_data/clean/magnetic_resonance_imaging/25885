Magnetic resonance imaging (MR) was performed in 14 healthy subjects and 16 patients with pancreatic disease. All the 16 patients were subjected to ultrasonography (USG), computed tomography (CT) and MR while endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed in 10 cases. In one patients with adenocarcinoma and two with gastrinoma, MR demonstrated abnormalities while USG and CT were normal. MR was, however, inferior to ERCP in demonstrating ductal abnormalities in chronic pancreatitis. Our initial experience suggests that MR is superior to other imaging modalities in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic tumors; however, it is inferior to ERCP in the diagnosis of pancreatitis.
