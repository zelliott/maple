The examination of 50 patients with nonspecific aortic arteritis (NAA) discovered that 14% of the patients had aneurysms. The latter occurred more frequently in the ascending aorta and manifest clinically as aortic regurgitation and angina pectoris. Immunological disorders were compared in NAA patients with stenotic and aneurysmic lesions (groups 1 and 2, respectively). In group 1 high IgE and CIC concentrations occurred more frequently suggesting the involvement of immunological abnormalities in genesis of aneurysms in NAA. Most of group I patients had disturbances of lipid metabolism indicated by elevated cholesterol level. The latter promoted development of atherosclerosis.
