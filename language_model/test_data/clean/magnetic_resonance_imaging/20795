Two cases of gelastic epilepsy in a 6-year-old girl with attacks of mirthful laughter and a 38-year-old male patient with episodes of laughter without any positive emotions are presented. Temporal lobe epilepsy was diagnosed in the first case and possible frontal lobe epilepsy in the second case. It is concluded that that this rare form of epilepsy can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and can clinically be accompanied by urinary incontinence.
