A case of epithelioid and spindle cell haemangioma of bone occurring in the proximal femur is presented. The tumour had typical microscopic features with a striking lobular pattern comprising spindled and epithelioid areas with admixed inflammatory cells. The case represents only the eighth reported example of this rare tumour, which appears to fit in the spectrum of epithelioid haemangioma. This is the first case to involve the proximal portion of a long bone. A review of the classification and features of similar vascular tumours of bone is presented.
