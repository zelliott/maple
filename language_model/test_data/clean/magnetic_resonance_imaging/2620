An 11-year-old boy with mild hemophilia A was admitted to our hospital because of focal convulsions. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an old occipital infarct. Protein C, S, antithrombin III, anticardiolipin antibodies and fibrinogen were normal. Heterozygosity for factor V Leiden mutation was detected. We suggest that factor V Leiden mutation should be studied in hemophiliacs with thrombosis.
