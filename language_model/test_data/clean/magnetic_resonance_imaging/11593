Biliary cystadenomas and their malignant counterparts, biliary cystadenocarcinomas, are rare cystic tumors that arise from hepatobiliary epithelium. Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) are the initial imaging modalities used for the evaluation of biliary cystic tumors, but are not specific. MRI and MRCP, because of increased contrast and spatial resolution, may be a more specific imaging modality in the detection of biliary cystic neoplasms. We present a case of biliary cystadenocarcinoma imaged by MRI and MRCP in a 65 year-old man managed conservatively for 7 years.
