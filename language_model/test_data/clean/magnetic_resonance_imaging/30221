Bone fluorosis is a rare metabolic disease characterized by massive bone fixation of fluorine. It is seen endemically around phosphate mines in North Africa. Neurologic complications, such as medullar compression may rarely reveal the disease. We report a case of cervical myelopathy due to bone fluorosis causing tetraparesis. Medullar compression was caused by posterior vertebral ligament calcification. Diagnosis was based on the characteristic radiologic aspect, and confirmed by the dosage of serum and urine levels of fluorine. Cervical laminectomy resulted in significant pain improvement, despite persistent motor deficit.
