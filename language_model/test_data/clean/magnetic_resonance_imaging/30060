A 60-year-old man had a workup for atypical angina. Noninvasive investigations, including computed tomography, showed no evidence for coronary artery disease. A few months later the patient was hospitalized because of severe epileptic seizures. Thyrotoxicosis was diagnosed and emergency thyroidectomy was performed. Two months after discharge the patient was again referred because of exercise-induced angina pectoris.

Echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large aneurysm of the lateral wall of the left ventricle with a thrombus adhering to the wall. Coronary angiography and levocardiography confirmed the aneurysm and detected an occlusion of the distal part of the circumflex artery.

Surgical aneurysm resection with thrombectomy and endoventricular circular plasty (Dor procedure) was performed without postoperative complications. Six months after surgery the patient was in good general condition without any angina. Follow-up echocardiography as well as cardiac MRI gave proof of an excellent postoperative result.

Noninvasive preoperative diagnosis and documentation as well as postoperative monitoring with modern imaging modalities, such as echocardiography and MRI are of great value in patients with left ventricular aneurysm.
