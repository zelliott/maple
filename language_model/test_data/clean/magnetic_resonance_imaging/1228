To build digitized visible model of the parapharyngeal space(PPS) of Chinese visible human.

Cross-sectional images from the Chinese visible human data set were reviewed and the structures of the parapharyngeal space were confirmed on a section-by-section basis. Three-dimensional computer reconstructions of the parapharyngeal space and surrounding structures were generated from these data using PC and imaging software.

The three-dimensional reconstructed images displayed perfectly the anatomical relationships of the parapharyngeal space, parotid, muscles, mandible and vessels. All reconstructed structures can be represented individually or jointly, any diameter and angle of the structures reconstructed could be measured conveniently.

The Chinese visible human data set can provide complete and accurate data. The digitized model of the parapharyngeal space and its surroundings offer unique insights into the complex anatomy, and provide morphological data for image diagnosis and operation of the parapharyngeal space.
