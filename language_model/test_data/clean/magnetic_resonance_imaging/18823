This is a case report of a right posterolateral L5-S1 disc herniation that migrated to the left cephalad level to impinge on the left L5 nerve root as it exited the dura. The resultant free fragment migration is a rare variation of a posterolateral disc disruption.

The purpose is to report a rare variation of lumbar disc herniation not previously reported in the literature.

Case report.

A 60-year-old white woman.

Resolution of the patient's left lower extremity symptoms.

Not applicable.

The patient experienced resolution of most of her left lower extremity symptoms after a slightly modified microscopically assisted lumbar hemilaminectomy, discectomy and nerve root decompression.

This is a rare right to left migration of a sequestrated disc herniation, which was effectively treated with surgery.
