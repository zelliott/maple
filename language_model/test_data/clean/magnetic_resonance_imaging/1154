To assess the frequency, imaging findings, and significance of early-enhancing nonneoplastic (EN) lesions with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver following partial hepatectomy.

We retrospectively reviewed MR images after partial hepatectomy in 30 patients. Postoperative MRI was performed in 1-12 months (mean, 3.7 months) after partial hepatectomy. We defined the EN lesion as a lesion that was ill defined; irregular, wedge shaped, or serpiginous; located along the liver edge; not visible on unenhanced MR images; did not appear hypointense on portal venous- or equilibrium-phase images; or a combination of those imaging findings.

A total of 39 EN lesions (size range, 5-60 mm; mean, 25.2 mm) in 19 patients and 17 recurrent tumors (size range, 5-50 mm; mean, 16.8 mm) in 10 patients newly appeared after partial hepatectomy. The EN lesions were diagnosed as pseudolesions by the second postoperative follow-up MRI in 17 patients or contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in two. A total of 13 EN lesions (33%) were located along the liver edge and 20 (51%) were adjacent to the resected area. The shape was circular in 11 (28%), oval in three (8%), irregular in 11 (28%), wedge shaped in five (13%), and serpiginous in nine (23%). No EN lesion showed hypointensity on gadolinium-enhanced portal venous-phase or equilibrium-phase images. A total of 14 EN lesions (36%) showed slight hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. The confidence levels for malignancy probability assigned by blinded radiologists were lower with EN lesions than with recurrent tumors (P < 0.001).

EN lesions are frequently seen in MRI following partial hepatectomy, and occasionally are slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted images, mimicking malignant tumors. However, most EN lesions can be correctly diagnosed with MRI findings.
