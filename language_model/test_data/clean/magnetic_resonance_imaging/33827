A retrospective study evaluating magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomographic myelography, and clinical parameters in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy.

To investigate whether magnetic resonance imaging can predict the surgical outcome in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy.

No previous studies have established whether areas of high signal intensity in T2-weighted magnetic resonance images can be a predictor of surgical outcomes.

Fifty patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy were examined by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic myelography before surgery and by delayed computed tomographic myelography after surgery. The correlation between the recovery rate and the clinical and imaging parameters was analyzed.

The best prognostic factor was the transverse area of the spinal cord at maximum compression (correlation coefficient, R = 0.58). The presence of high signal intensity areas on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images correlated poorly with the recovery rate (R = -0.29). However, patients with multisegmental areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images tended to have poor surgical results associated with muscle atrophy in the upper extremities. Postoperative delayed computed tomographic myelography showed that multisegmental areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images probably represent cavitation in the central spinal cord.

Patients with multisegmental areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images tended to have poorer surgical results. However, the transverse area of the spinal cord at the level of maximum compression was a better prognostic indicator.
