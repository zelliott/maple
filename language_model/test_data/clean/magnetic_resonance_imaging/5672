Hip pain is a common complaint in patients of all ages. Recent advances in imaging and treatment are changing the approach to the evaluation and management of hip pain. Abnormal femoral and acetabular morphology and lesions of the acetabular labrum and cartilage are increasingly recognized as crucial in the development of degenerative changes. In addition, femoroacetabular impingement is increasingly recognized as an etiologic factor in hip pain. This article discusses techniques for MR arthrography of the hip, normal anatomy at hip MR arthrography, common intra-articular pathologies in patients with hip pain, and imaging findings of femoroacetabular impingement.
