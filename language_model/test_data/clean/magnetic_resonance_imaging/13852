Visual hallucinations may accompany many neurological and psychiatric disorders. A common localization principle is that lesions to the early sensory cortices lead to elementary hallucinations, whereas complex perceptual experiences are related to the pathology of higher-level cortical regions. We report the case of a patient who experienced complex, non-stereotyped, multimodal (visual and somatosensory) hallucinations following an acute ischaemic vascular lesion in the right medial occipital lobe. This illustrates that the phenomenology of hallucinations not necessarily reflects the exact localization of cerebral pathology. Instead, the damaged area may serve as a focus of an abnormally activated neuronal network.
