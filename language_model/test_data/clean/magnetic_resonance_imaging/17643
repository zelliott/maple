We present a unique case of idiopathic pulmonary vein stenosis in an adult who presented with progressive dyspnea and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was treated by balloon angioplasty and is well at 6 months post-treatment follow-up. The etiology of pulmonary vein stenosis in this case is difficult to ascertain, but is likely to be congenital.
