To determine whether the motion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the lumbar spine degrades T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images, a spine phantom, three healthy volunteers, and a prospective series of 20 patients suspected of having lumbar spine disease underwent MR imaging with and without motion-compensation techniques. In the phantom, pulsation amplitudes as low as 3 mm (within the physiologic range of human lumbar CSF motion) reduced image quality on conventional images but not on motion-compensated images. Similar findings were observed in two volunteers and 11 patients. The magnitude of the artifacts was variable; they could impair visualization of the conus, decrease contrast or reduce the sharpness of the CSF-thecal sac interface, and cause focal regions of reduced CSF signal intensity adjacent to bulging disks. Image quality was most improved when peripheral gating was combined with even-echo rephasing. In the patient group, the use of motion-compensation techniques increased the CSF signal-to-noise ratio by an average of 29% (P less than .01); this resulted in improved contrast between the conus and extradural structures. The data suggest that CSF motion compensation is clinically useful during T2-weighted MR imaging of the lumbar spine.
