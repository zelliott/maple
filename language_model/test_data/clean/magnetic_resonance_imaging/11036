The general presentation of osseous and soft-tissue neoplasms of the foot and ankle is not different from lesions encountered in other parts of the body and imaging features may be nonspecific. Some lesions, however, have a predilection for the foot and ankle and may have typical imaging features, such as plantar fibromatosis or intraosseous lipoma. This presentation aims to give an overview of bone and soft-tissue tumours of the foot and ankle and to discuss the strength of each imaging modality in the diagnosis.
