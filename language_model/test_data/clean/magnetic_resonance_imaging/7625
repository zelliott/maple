The objective of this study was to improve the knowledge of the clinical and MRI presentation of general paresis of the insane (GPI) and achieve its early diagnosis. Fifteen patients with GPI were gathered. Their clinical data and brain MRI information were analyzed. The age range was 33-62 years (mean: 48·8 years). The disease lasted 34 days-28 months (mean: 10·87 months). Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assays (TPHAs) on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and sera were positive. All patients were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and primarily showed progressive cognitive impairment, mostly accompanied with emotional disturbance and psychosis. The accompanying symptoms included epilepsy (n  =  7), ataxia (n  =  5), cerebral vascular disease (n  =  3), and limbs tremor (n  =  2). Typical Argyll Robertson's pupil was observed in two cases. A CSF examination showed elevated white blood cell (WBC) and protein level. Purely cerebral atrophy was found in three cases. Abnormal high signals were found in nine cases in different brain area, mainly in bilateral temporal, insular, and frontal lobes and hippocampus in T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), which was accompanied by cerebral and/or hippocampus atrophy. Purely atrophy of bilateral or unilateral hippocampus was found in two cases. Cerebral infarction lesions were found in three cases. Contrary to the previous reports, the hippocampal atrophy and bilateral abnormal signals of hippocampus and temporal lobe in brain MRI were more common in cases with GPI. Abnormal signals were probably related to proliferation of glial cells rather than cytotoxic edema. The pathogenesis of the abnormal signals needs to be further explored. General paresis of the insane has a wide variety of central nervous system manifestations, either clinically or neuroradiologically. Identification of these presentations could be important for early diagnosis.
