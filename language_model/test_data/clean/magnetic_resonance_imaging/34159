To present the imaging findings and treatment options for incomplete intertrochanteric fractures.

Among 31 patients with the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging diagnosis of incomplete intertrochanteric fracture, 30 also underwent radiography. MR and radiographic findings were compared. Note was made of fracture length and extent as depicted on the coronal and axial MR images, treatment (surgical vs conservative), and follow-up.

Correlation between radiographic and MR findings was poor. Incomplete intertrochanteric fracture was the prospective radiographic diagnosis in only one case. Fracture in 18 patients was treated surgically and in 13 was managed conservatively. In both groups, the average age of the patients and length of the fractures and the percentage of separate fractures involving the greater trochanter and crossing the midline of the femur in the axial plane were the same. Fractures crossed the midline in the coronal plane in 50% of the surgical group but in only 23% of the nonsurgical group. Average time from injury to ambulation was 2 days less in the surgical group, but no difference in functional status was found subjectively between the two groups at clinical follow-up.

Incomplete intertrochanteric fractures are a previously unrecognized subset of intertrochanteric fractures that are diagnosed unequivocally only with MR imaging.
