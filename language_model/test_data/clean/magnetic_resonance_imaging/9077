The authors describe the reactivation of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in three patients with lesions in the prefronto-subcortical circuits after decades of being asymptomatic. The patients also reported the emergence of new OCD symptoms and motor/phonic tics as well as mental rituals thematically related to the negative experience of suffering cognitive and motor deficits.
