The authors report their experience about three children (two girls, one boy; average age 1.6 years) with a spontaneous regression of optic gliomas. All of them had a previous diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1). None of them underwent surgery or biopsy nor received chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The complete regression was documented by MRI scans performed during a mean follow-up of 6.3 years.

Moreover, the authors analyze the features of the 16 cases previously reported in English literature of spontaneously regressed optic gliomas with an overview of the different therapeutic strategies. The knowledge that this kind of tumor, particularly in young patients, may regress is important in the decision of the best therapeutic approach.
