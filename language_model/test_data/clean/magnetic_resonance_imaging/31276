Haemangioma of infancy is a common birthmark. As spontaneous involution is the rule, it is usually treated conservatively. Periorbital haemangiomata may require intervention if symptomatic and this may be early or late, where plastic surgery may be required. It has not previously been recognised that deep periorbital lesions may lead to a baggy appearance of the eyelids because of excess fatty tissue. The management of this condition is described in different clinical presentations illustrated by three female patients with a history of infantile periorbital haemangioma. Two were treated by blepharoplasty, during which an excess of fatty tissue was found, deep to the orbital septum. Birthmark stigmata were eradicated and symmetry was achieved.
