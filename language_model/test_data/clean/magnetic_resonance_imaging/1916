Transvenous placement of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters has become commonplace in selected patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). IVC filters have been shown to have excellent therapeutic efficacy and low complication rates. Penetration of the IVC by filter hooks or struts has been reported and commonly noted to be inconsequential. We report a laceration of a lumbar artery by a stainless steel Greenfield (SSG) filter strut that resulted in a near fatal hemorrhage, and review the world literature on caval perforation by IVC filters.
