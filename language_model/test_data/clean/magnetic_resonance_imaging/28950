Indinavir-induced lipodystrophy constitutes a new complication of this therapeutic category. It is characterized by loss of fat from the face and limbs and accumulation of fat in the abdominal wall (possibly simulating an abdominal mass), but also in the abdominal cavity (retroperitoneum, greater omentum, mesocolon, mesentery). This complication, whose frequency is currently assessed to be between 24 to 64%, occurs an average of 10 months after starting treatment. It is often accompanied by laboratory abnormalities, such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia or insulin resistance. The pathophysiology and long-term consequences of this complication are still poorly understood.
