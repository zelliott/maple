Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy of an EDTA or citrate plasma sample (also referred to as "Fossel test" after Fossel, who first described it) started out as a promising method for fast and simple diagnosis of malignancies. Although the results of our own studies of the head and neck area confirm this tendency, we believe--and so do meanwhile also other investigators--that the clinical use of this test in its present form is not feasible because of lacking specificity.
