The most common sites of nerve entrapment are in the upper extremity, commonly diagnosed based on clinical findings and electrophysiologic studies. Cross-sectional imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, have been used to enhance diagnostic accuracy and provide anatomic mapping of abnormalities. MR neurography offers multiplanar high-resolution imaging of upper extremity nerves as well as adjacent soft tissues, and provides an objective assessment of the neuromuscular anatomy and related abnormalities. This article reviews the normal 3-T MR neurographic appearance of the upper extremity nerves, and abnormal findings related to injury, entrapment, and other pathologic conditions.
