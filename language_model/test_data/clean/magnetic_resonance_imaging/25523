The French healthcare system is organised according to a political, geographical and demographic framework. In France today, less than 20 hospitals have dedicated intensive care units for acute stroke patients. In the 1999 national survey, 94% of stroke patients were admitted to public hospitals, 35% were treated in neurological wards and 4% had access to an intensive care stroke unit. To improve the quality of care and resource utilisation, a national plan for stroke will be implemented at regional level during the next five-year plan. After a long period of status quo, many positive actions for stroke care have been initiated within a couple of years, based on the evidence of more effective stroke treatments, such as thrombolysis and the specialist care provided by stroke units.
