To evaluate the clinical value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the uterus and the pelvis in infertile female with symptomatic endometriosis for the assessment of uterine morphology and function.

Forty-one infertile women (mean age: 33.2 years) with symptomatic endometriosis documented by laparoscopy were evaluated with high-field MRI (Sonata, Siemens) using T2- and T1-weighted sequences. In addition, the patients underwent hysterosalpingoscintigraphy (HSSG) for evaluation of the uterotubal transport capacity. Pathologic findings of the uterine junction zone were correlated with the laparoscopic results, clinical symptoms and uterotubal transport capacity.

Adenomyosis was diagnosed on T2-weigthed MR-images in 35 (85.4 %) patients (focal adenomatosis in 26 patients and diffuse adenomatosis in 9). Patients showing signs of adenomyosis tended to be older than patients without adenomyosis (mean age 34.1 years vs. 30.1 years) and showed a longer history of symptomatic endometriosis. A positive transport capacity in HSSG was observed in 73.1 % (19/26) of the patients with focal adenomyosis and in only 22.2 % (2/9) of patients with diffuse adenomyosis. In 83.3 % (5/6) of the patients without signs of adenomyosis, a positive uterotubal transport was documented.

MRI of the uterus is a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of adenomyosis and for planning further therapies. Patients with the diagnosis of adenomyosis showed a reduced uterotubal transport capacity that depended on the severity of adenomyotic changes and might be a possible cause of infertility.
