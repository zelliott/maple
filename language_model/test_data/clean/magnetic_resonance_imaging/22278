Granulocytic sarcomas involving the spine in patients without myelogenous leukemia are rare. We report three cases and review the literature.

Three patients presented with spinal epidural tumors, which caused spinal cord compression in one and cauda equina compression in two.

All patients underwent surgery, and biopsies revealed histological features of granulocytic sarcomas. Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies showed no evidence of acute leukemia at initial presentation, for all three patients.

Granulocytic sarcomas in nonleukemic patients are rare, and when they affect the spine they are frequently misdiagnosed. Appropriate therapy for these tumors requires early identification.
