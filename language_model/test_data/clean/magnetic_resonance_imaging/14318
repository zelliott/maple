Radiological examination of an unstable shoulder relies on straight X-ray images which are better than CT scans to detect bone lesions consecutive to anterior destabilizing accidents. The indications of CT arthrography are very limited. Radiological studies of the rotator cuff must necessarily include a standard radiological examination. Contrast arthrography is used either to find out whether or not the cuff is damaged, or when the tear is thought to be small. Arthropneumotomography is useful in the preoperative assessment of severe postero-superior tears. CT arthrography is very good to explore the subscapular muscle and to detect medial dislocation of the biceps long head tendon. The first results of MRI are encouraging, and when the cost of this method is reduced it might replace arthrography.
