The purposes of this study were to illustrate the sonographic features of focal hepatic lesions with peritumoral sparing of fatty infiltration in patients with hepatic steatosis, to correlate the sonographic findings with CT and MRI findings, and to discuss the possible mechanisms.

Various focal hepatic lesions can accompany peritumoral sparing of fatty infiltration in patients with hepatic steatosis, and they can manifest with an atypical sonographic appearance.
