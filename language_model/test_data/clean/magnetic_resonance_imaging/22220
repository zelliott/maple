The case of a patient with apraxia of eyelid opening and blepharospasm occurring during the course of idiopathic torsion dystonia and previously treated with stereotaxic subthalamotomy is presented. The anatomic basis of this lid movement disorder is suggested to be located in the rostral brain stem. There was a considerable amelioration after treatment with trihexyphenidyl.
