A 19-year-old woman who had decreased eight centimeters in stature was diagnosed as Cushing's disease with multiple spine compression fractures. At the age of 18, the patient had a complex fracture and gradually presented the features of Cushing's syndrome. Her plasma ACTH and cortisol levels were extremely high. Radiological findings and chemical markers for bone metabolism showed severe osteoporosis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of a pituitary microadenoma. After transsphenoidal surgery was performed, subsequently all endocrine data improved. This case indicates that Cushing's syndrome should be considered for severe osteoporotic juvenile patients.
