Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome associated with hypertension rarely presents with predominant involvement of the brainstem and sparing of the supratentorial regions. In this study, the clinical and neuroimaging features of a 39-year-old woman with hypertensive encephalopathy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings localized to pons and bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles were described. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome associated with hypertension rarely shows isolated brainstem and cerebellum involvement, and it is important to be familiar with the lack of correlation between the severity of the radiological abnormality and the clinical status.
