The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of T(2)-weighted, steady-state susceptibility-enhanced contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to characterize brain tumor heterogeneity and tumor vascularization. In vivo T(2)-weighted MRI experiments were carried out on normal rats (n = 11) and rats bearing C6 glioma (n = 17), before and after the injection of a remanent superparamagnetic contrast agent. The DeltaR(2) variations of the transverse relaxation rate due to the injection of the contrast agent were used to generate relative cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps. Contrast enhancement of the tumor was shown to reflect tissue vascularization rather than leakage of the blood-brain barrier. The quantitative results clearly show the heterogeneity of tumor vascularization and reveal a high vessel density in the peripheral area (CBV(per) approximately 17.2 +/- 2.3 sec(-1)) and a low vessel density in the central area of the tumor (CBV(cen) approximately 2.5 +/- 0.5 sec(-1)).
