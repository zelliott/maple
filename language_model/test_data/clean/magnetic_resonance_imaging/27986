In 6 patients with an incomplete transverse section, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a spinal haematoma. The MR signal intensity changed with the interval between the haemorrhage and the MR investigation. Signal intensities of T1- and T2-weighted images exhibited specific changes with time after the haemorrhage, allowing for a retrospective assessment of the time of onset of the haemorrhage.
