Neuroimaging is critical in the evaluation of patients with TIA. CT and MRI are the two available options for imaging. Head CT is more widely available and commonly used. Diffusion MRI is the recommended modality to image an ischemic lesion. The presence of a diffusion lesion in a patient with transient neurological symptoms is an indicator of a high risk of recurrent stroke. Perfusion imaging with perfusion MRI or CT perfusion may improve the detection of ischemic lesions. Noninvasive vessel imaging may detect a symptomatic vessel lesion associated with an increased risk of stroke.
