The authors report 2 cases of primary spinal intramedullary lymphoma and review all previously reported magnetic resonance imaging findings on this disease. The most common finding was a solid and homogeneously enhanced mass that was hyperintense on T2-weighted images, without associated syringomyelia. In a few cases, swelling of the spinal cord was minimal.
