Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in the development of cerebral infarction as a major mediator of angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the VEGF gene polymorphisms were associated with the risks of acute cerebral infarction.

We examined the distribution of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), -1154G/A, 936C/T and -2578C/A, in the promoter and coding region of the VEGF gene in DNA samples from 147 Chinese patients with acute cerebral infarction and 131 control subjects.

There was no significant difference in allele and genotype distributions of -1154G/A, 936C/T and -2578C/A with the risk of acute cerebral infarction when compared with controls. However, haplotype analysis from the above-mentioned three polymorphisms showed that haplotype ACC was significantly lower in patients with acute cerebral infarction (0.020) than in controls (0.054) (p = 0.034).

These data suggested that the -1154/, 936/ and -2578/ ACC haplotype was associated with the risk of acute cerebral infarction with an OR of 0.361, and it may reduce the risk of acute cerebral infarction through the regulation of VEGF expression.
