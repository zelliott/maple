A patient presenting with recurrent ischemic attacks was demonstrated to have complete occlusion of the right common and left internal carotid arteries. An external carotid angiogram showed a large left superficial temporal artery (STA) supplying both sides of the scalp. 123I-IMP single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed hypoperfusion of the both hemispheres, especially the left cerebral hemisphere. An extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass was performed using a radial artery graft interpositioned between the proximal part of the STA and the M2 segment, thus preserving blood flow to the scalp through the STA. Postoperative angiography after 1 year showed good circulation through the anastomosis, and 123I-IMP SPECT studies demonstrated increased cerebral perfusion. The patient improved clinically. The surgical technique is described below.
