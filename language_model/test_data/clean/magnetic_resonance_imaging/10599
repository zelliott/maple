The role of FDG-PET in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is unclear. It was the aim of this study to investigate the role of FDG-PET in detecting PCNSL and in predicting response to chemotherapy.

An FDG-PET scan of the brain was performed in 15 patients with histologically proven PCNSL (16 PET examinations, Siemens ECAT EXACT). PET was planned to investigate patients at the time of primary diagnosis, after chemotherapy and at the time of suspected relapse in seven, five and three cases, respectively. All except two patients simultaneously underwent MRI of the brain. FDG-PET results were correlated with histological results after stereotactic biopsy (primary diagnosis group) and with clinical data and MRI during follow-up.

Six of the seven patients in the primary diagnosis group demonstrated a true positive finding (86%). In one of the true positive PET patients, there were two tumour lesions, one of which was only detectable on the FLAIR MRI sequence. In five patients, FDG-PET showed no sign of PCNSL during ongoing chemotherapy. These results were confirmed by the clinical follow-up (mean 26.6 months). MRI demonstrated minimal residual disease which had disappeared on further follow-up MRI in three of these five patients at the time of PET scanning. Recurrence of disease was confirmed concordantly by FDG-PET and MRI in three different patients. The standardised uptake value of all tumours was 10.2 (4.3-13.7).

PCNSLs demonstrate high FDG uptake and can be diagnosed by FDG-PET with high sensitivity. It seems that FDG-PET is suitable for early therapeutic monitoring after chemotherapy.
