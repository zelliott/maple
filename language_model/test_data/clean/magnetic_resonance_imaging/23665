Six cases of spinal epidural abscess are presented. All patients were young with no predisposing conditions. All were treated with laminectomy and intravenous antibiotics. The patients with no neurological deficit recovered completely, while patients with pre-existing neurological deficit had a poorer outcome. Emphasis is given to early detection and surgical management to prevent irreversible damage to the spinal cord.
