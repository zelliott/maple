Combined MRI/MRS studies were performed in 9 girls with Rett syndrome of different ages. NAA, as marker of neuronal tissue, was found to decrease with increasing age. There was no evidence for a defective energy metabolism. The data point towards a probably secondary degenerative process in the pathogenesis of Rett syndrome.
