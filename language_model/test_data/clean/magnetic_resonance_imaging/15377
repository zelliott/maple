The purpose of our study was to assess the effect of an i.v. injection of iodinated radiographic contrast medium on human renal blood flow using cine phase-contrast MRI.

We examined 12 healthy adult volunteers. Blood flow in one renal artery was measured using cine phase-contrast imaging (1.5-T MR system). Each volunteer received 120 mL of isotonic sodium chloride on study day 1 and 120 mL of a low-osmolar, nonionic, iodinated contrast medium (iomeprol, 400 mg I/mL) on study day 2. Repetitive measurements were performed before (up to five measurements in 5 minutes) and after (up to 13 measurements in 30 minutes) the injection was started.

Mean basal renal artery blood flow was 664 mL/min. In response to the injection of the test substances, we found a significantly larger decrease in average renal blood flow for contrast medium than for sodium chloride (31.9 mL/min vs 18.3 mL/min, p = 0.0481). Furthermore, in analyzing the measurements at early time points, we found a significant decrease (11.4% +/- 4.7% [SD]; Bonferroni-corrected, p < 0.05) in renal blood flow 2 minutes after the injection of the contrast medium was started. Sodium chloride did not produce a significant effect at any time.

Cine phase-contrast MRI can measure a decrease in renal blood flow in humans in response to an i.v. injection of iodinated radiographic contrast medium. Therefore, cine phase-contrast MRI can be a helpful and noninvasive tool for further investigations of contrast media-induced changes in human renal blood flow and their possible impact on the development of contrast-induced nephropathy.
