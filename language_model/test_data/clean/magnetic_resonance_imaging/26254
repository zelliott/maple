Long-term outcome of 17 patients who harbored a large or giant aneurysm of posterior fossa was summarized. The anatomical distribution of aneurysms included eight cases of basilar artery (BA) bifurcation aneurysms, three cases of BA trunk aneurysms, and six cases of vertebral artery (VA) aneurysms. Eight patients received surgical or endovascular treatment for their lesion. The clinical outcome was good recovery in six, moderate disability in one, and vegetative state in one case, respectively. The other nine patients were followed conservatively. Four of them had fatal aneurysmal rupture, and another two patients suffered from aggravation of pre-existing symptoms related to their aneurysm. Only three patients remain intact. Comparison of the radiographic parameters between those who bled and those who did not bleed revealed that those with subsequent rupture had significantly higher rate of aneurysmal thrombus and had a trend for larger diameter of the aneurysm. Although more aggressive and multidisciplinary measure should be taken to these patients to improve their long-term outcome, our results showed the limitation of treatment for these patients in the present era at the same time. The patients with broad neck BA bifurcation aneurysm in which efferent vessels were incorporated into aneurysmal dome, and those with fusiform, giant BA trunk aneurysm with thrombus were the least amenable to treatment in our series.
