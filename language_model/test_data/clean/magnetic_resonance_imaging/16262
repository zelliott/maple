Neglected or chronic rupture of the Achilles tendon usually needs a reconstruction procedure. Many graft sources have been reported for this procedure, such as a proximal V-Y gastrocnemius tendon flap, flexor hallucis longus tendon, fascia lata, plantaris tendon, synthetic materials, and peroneus brevis. However, how to fix the graft at the calcaneal site remains controversial.

An alternative technique to anatomically reconstruct the Achilles tendon using an autogenous peroneal longus tendon with EndoButton-CL fixation at the calcaneal site for treatment of a patient who had a chronic neglected rupture of the Achilles tendon is described.

The patient was allowed to begin gentle exercise, such as swimming and cycling 12 weeks after surgery, and encouraged to augment rehabilitation of hindfoot eversion and ankle plantar flexion. The ankle plantar flexion and hindfoot eversion strength was not reduced after active rehabilitation in 2.5 years of follow-up.

Our technique reuses two small central incisions, thus, preserving skin integrity as much as possible to reduce wound breakdown or infection. The management of chronic or neglected Achilles tendon rupture by autogenous peroneal longus tendon with EndoButton-CL fixation at the calcaneal site is an anatomic and safe, but technically demanding technique.
