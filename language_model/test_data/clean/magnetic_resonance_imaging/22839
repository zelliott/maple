Continuously moving table (CMT) MRI is a new method that is capable of generating 3D, seamless, large field-of-view (FOV) images by acquiring readouts along the patient superior-inferior axis as the subject is translated through the scanner. For applications that require artifact-free images, such as arterial-phase contrast-enhanced (CE) angiography of the legs, a major challenge is to match the MR data acquisition and patient table motion with the dynamics of blood flow in the region of interest (ROI). Instead of restricting the CMT to predetermined constant table speeds, we adopted a more general approach in which the table motion is decoupled from the phase-encoding order. In our approach the table moves adaptively and in response to operator-provided feedback obtained from viewing real-time preview (or fluoroscopic) images. This interactivity is accomplished by integrating high temporal-spatial resolution encoding of the table position with real-time hybrid-space filling and image reconstruction. Experimental results obtained using our prototype interactive CMT (iCMT) system on a peripheral vascular phantom and five healthy volunteers demonstrate the feasibility of this robust and rapid imaging method for acquiring 3D large-FOV continuous images with patient-specific adaptive table motion profiles.
