In vivo single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 4.7T and ex vivo high-resolution proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HR-NMR) at 500 MHz were used to study the composition of adipose tissues in Zucker obese and Zucker lean rats. Lipid composition was characterized by unsaturation and polyunsaturation indexes and mean chain lengths. In vitro experiments were conducted in known mixtures of triglycerides and oils in order to validate the method. To avoid inaccuracies due to partial peak overlapping in MRS, peak quantification was performed after fitting of spectral peaks by using the QUEST algorithm. The intensity of different spectral lines was also corrected for T2 relaxation. Albeit with different sensitivity and accuracy, both techniques revealed that white adipose tissue is characterized by lower unsaturation and polyunsaturation indexes in obese rats compared with controls. HR-NMR revealed similar differences in brown adipose tissue. The present findings confirm the hypothesis that obese and lean Zucker rats have different adipose tissue composition.
