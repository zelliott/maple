The investigation of hepatobiliary tumors, in the pediatric population, usually begins with an ultrasonographic (US) examination. It is readily available without ionizing radiation and does not need sedation. Therefore US is an outstanding imaging modality for screening and follow-up. Doppler and color Doppler interrogation are part of the examination to assess vascularity of the lesions and vascular anatomy. Magnetic resonance imaging is a comprehensive imaging modality with multiplanar capability to assess the liver parenchyma, gallbladder, and biliary tree and is free of ionizing radiation. This article highlights the current status of imaging of the most common hepatobiliary tumors in children.
