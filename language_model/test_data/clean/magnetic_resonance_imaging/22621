Our objective was to detail peritoneal anatomy, techniques for optimizing peritoneal MRI, and the MRI characteristics of several disease processes that frequently involve the peritoneum.

Homogeneous fat suppression and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, including delayed imaging, are critical technical factors for successful lesion detection and characterization on peritoneal MRI.
