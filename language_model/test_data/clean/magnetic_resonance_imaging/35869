In eleven Han-Wistar rats, experimental renal haematomas were produced and scanned by magnetic resonance tomography at two hours to 21 days. Bleeding during the first three or four days showed prolongation of T1 and T2 relaxation times. On subsequent days there was shortening of the T1 and T2 times. Gadolinium DTPA produced a marked effect in the second to fourth day following the trauma, if the examination was carried out 90 to 120 minutes after the administration of contrast medium. Gadolinium can be used in determining the age and clarifying the differential diagnosis of an bleeding if there is clinical support.
