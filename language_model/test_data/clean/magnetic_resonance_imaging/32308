The purpose of this study was to determine whether prenatal MRI provides additional information about fetal sacrococcygeal teratoma compared with prenatal sonography.

Twenty-two pregnant women with fetal sacrococcygeal teratoma underwent prenatal MRI (mean gestational age, 23 weeks). The size, location, mass characteristics, and compressive effects of the tumors were determined and correlated with sonography and postnatal findings.

Based on the MRI findings, the following American Academy of Pediatrics, Surgical Section classifications were assigned: type I in six patients, type II in 12, and type III in four. No type IV tumors were found. The sacrococcygeal teratoma appeared entirely cystic in five fetuses, microcystic in one, mixed cystic and solid in 12, and solid in four. The diagnosis of sacrococcygeal teratoma was accurate in all cases assessed at our center using both MRI and sonography. Two additional patients initially referred with the diagnosis of sacrococcygeal teratoma had a different diagnosis at reevaluation at our institution (healthy, n = 1; myelomeningocele, n = 1). MRI was superior to sonography for detecting displacement of the colon (n = 11), urinary tract dilatation (n = 9), hip dislocation (n = 4), intraspinal extension (n = 2), and vaginal dilation (n = 1). In fetuses with sacrococcygeal teratoma types II and III, MRI better showed the cephalic extent of the tumor compared with sonography. MRI findings were confirmed at surgery or autopsy in all patients. Three fetuses with high output cardiac physiology underwent open fetal resection of the tumor at 21-, 24-, and 26-weeks' gestational age with two surviving.

Our results show that ultrafast fetal MRI is a useful adjunct to the prenatal evaluation of fetal sacrococcygeal teratoma. Compared with sonography, MRI more accurately characterized the intrapelvic and abdominal extent of the tumors and provided more information on compression of adjacent organs. The additional anatomic resolution provided by MRI resulted in more accurate prenatal counseling and improved preoperative planning for surgical resection.
