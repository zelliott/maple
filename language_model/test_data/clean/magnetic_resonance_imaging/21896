We report our experience with five lesions exclusively involving the entire cavernous sinus in which an essentially extradural surgical approach was used. There were two cases of cavernous haemangioma, two cases of meningioma and one case of fungal granuloma. The dural cover of the superior orbital fissure, and mandibular and maxillary divisions of the fifth nerve was dissected along with the dura of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. The presence of a relatively large intracavernous bulge due to the tumour assisted in this dissection. The contents of the cavernous sinus were exposed from an anterolateral, lateral and inferior approach. Through the corridor available between the splayed out cranial nerves, a radical resection of the tumour was accomplished in each case. The technical advantages of this approach are discussed in light of the anatomy of the dural configuration of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus.
