We report an 80-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who was found to have subchondral insufficiency fracture of the right femoral head after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Initially, plain radiographs showed no obvious changes, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an irregular, discontinuous, low-intensity band on T1-weighted images of the right hip. She underwent hemiarthroplasty of the hip. This report describes a rare case of subchondral insufficiency fracture of the femoral head after TKA in a patient with RA.
