The dynamic pre- and post-contrast MRI and helical CT imaging findings in a patient with inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver are described. On immediate post gadolinium spoiled gradient echo images multiple, ill defined, irregular, and intensely enhancing lesions were seen. Rapid washout of contrast was noted. Periportal involvement was also shown on T2-weighted fat suppressed images. Lesions showed greater conspicuity on MRI than CT. MRI findings in this rare entity led to performance of a diagnostic open surgical biopsy.
