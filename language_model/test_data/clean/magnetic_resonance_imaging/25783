Radiologists play a vital role in the management of malignant liver disease, both by providing accurate data regarding extent and segmental localization of lesions as well as demonstrating their relationship to major vascular structures. The interrelationship between the major cross-sectional imaging modalities (ultrasound, CT, and MRI) must be understood in order to use each modality effectively and efficiently. Characteristic behavior of certain tumors (such as venous invasion by hepatomas) can help in recognition of tumor type and may have a major impact on decisions regarding resectability. Pitfalls in liver imaging (such as the presence of benign conditions that may mimic malignant lesions) must be well understood in order to avoid errors in diagnosis. Difficulties may arise in underdetection of tumors arising in chronically diseased livers and overstatement of the extent of tumors in livers with coexistent benign and malignant lesions. The appearances and behavior of primary and metastatic liver cancer is reviewed, emphasizing the features listed previously.
