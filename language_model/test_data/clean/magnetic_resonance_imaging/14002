To explore the potential of perfusion-corrected diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in characterizing soft-tissue tumors.

Diffusion-weighted MRI was performed in 23 histologically proven soft-tissue masses using a diffusion-weighted spin-echo sequence with diffusion gradient strengths yielding five b-values (0-701 seconds/mm(2)). True diffusion coefficients and perfusion fractions were estimated and compared with apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs).

ADC values of all tumors, subcutaneous fat, and muscle were significantly higher than true diffusion coefficients, indicating a contribution of perfusion to the ADC. True diffusion coefficients of malignant tumors (1.08 x 10(-3) mm(2)/second) were significantly lower than those of benign masses (1.71 x 10(-3) mm(2)/second), whereas ADC values between these groups were not significantly different.

Perfusion-corrected diffusion-weighted MRI has potential in differentiating benign from malignant soft-tissue masses.
