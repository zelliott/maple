We present a very rare case of an intracranial ganglioneurocytoma. This 57-year-old female patient noticed some concentration difficulties for about 5 months. Visual acuity was 80% on both sides. CT and MRI of her head demonstrated a 3 x 2.5 x 2.8 cm3 lesion within the third ventricle with inhomogenous enhancement of contrast medium. After a right pterional approach the tumor could be removed completely. Postoperatively there was a paresis of the oculomotor nerve on the right side and psychological changes. Histological examination revealed neuronal differentiation with neurocytes and small ganglionic cells and the tumor was graded as a ganglioneurocytoma (WHO grade II). Follow-up examination 6 months after the operation showed improvement of her third nerve paresis and of her neuropsychological deficits. MRI showed no recurrence.
