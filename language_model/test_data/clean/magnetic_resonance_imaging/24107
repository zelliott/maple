To evaluate impaired respiratory mechanics in pulmonary emphysema, dynamic breathing magnetic resonance imaging (BMRI) was acquired with fast-gradient echo pulse sequences at fixed thoracic planes over two to three slow, deep respiratory cycles in 6 controls and 28 patients with pulmonary emphysema including 9 patients undergoing lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). Respiratory motions of the diaphragm and chest wall (D/CW) were assessed by a cine-loop view, a fusion display of maximal inspiratory and expiratory images, and the time-distance curves. By contrast with normal subjects with regular synchronous D/CW motions, the patients frequently showed reduced, irregular, or asynchronous motions, with significant decreases in the maximal amplitude of D/CW motions (MAD and MACW), and the length of apposition of the diaphragm (LAD) (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, P < 0. 01, respectively). After LVRS, nine patients showed improvements in D/CW configuration and mobility, with significantly increased MAD, MACW, and LAD (P < 0.01, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.05, respectively). In 40 studies of 28 patients including the post-LVRS examinations, the normalized MAD and MACW significantly correlated with %FEV(1) (r = 0. 881 and r = 0.906; P < 0.0001, respectively). BMRI seems useful for noninvasively and directly assessing the impaired respiratory mechanics associated with abnormal ventilation in pulmonary emphysema, and also for monitoring the effects of LVRS.
