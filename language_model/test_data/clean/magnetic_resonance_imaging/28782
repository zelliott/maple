A 45 y old man suffered since a long time from right-sided hearing loss, tinnitus and, very recently, facial palsy. CT-scanning and MRI showed a very large intrapetrous lesion centered on the jugular foramen suggestive for a glomus tumor. During surgery a facial schwannoma was disclosed. The management and therapy of this lesion is discussed.
