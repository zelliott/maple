Symptomatic ossification of the yellow ligament (OYL) at the lower thoracic level is uncommon. Although wide laminectomy has, until now, been the primary treatment for this disease, we propose a less invasive technique based on a new method of three-dimensional computed tomography (CT).

The clinical features and radiologic imaging findings of 37 patients with OYL (mean age, 54 years) were analyzed. The surgical approach was selected based on the position of the depicted OYL on 3D CT scan in each patient.

The male-to-female ratio was 3:1. Involvement of the upper thoracic region was seen 11 times; of the middle region 8 times, and of the lower region 40 times (several patients had involvement in more than one region). About half of the patients complained of gait disturbance on admission caused by the markedly enlarged OYL. No postoperative complications were found. Neurologic deterioration was observed in only one patient.

OYL should be treated as early as possible, using the least invasive technique available. By using 3D CT, we were able to perform limited surgery consisting of foraminotomy or extended partial laminectomy at the affected level after confirming the anatomic location of the OYL. In laterally extended OYL, it is necessary to decompress the radicular artery in order to prevent ischemic damage to the spinal cord.
