We report on identical premature twins (monochorionic diamniotic). As fetuses, they both demonstrated sonographic and MRI evidence of cerebral bilateral ventriculomegaly. Neonatal brain US showed bilateral ventriculomegaly, similar in both twins. During follow-up, these physical and imaging similarities persisted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on similar bilateral ventriculomegaly in Identical Twins (IT). A genetic origin of this finding in our IT is suggested. Should more cases of ventriculomegaly be reported in the future in several sets of IT, cerebral ventriculomegaly can then be added to the list of similar CNS features observed in identical twins.
