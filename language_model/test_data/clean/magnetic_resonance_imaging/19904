Multislice Q2TIPS is a widely used pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL) technique for efficient and accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Slices are typically acquired inferior to superior from a tagging plane. Superior slices show signal loss greater than the loss expected from blood T1 decay. In order to assess the reasons for this additional signal loss, three single-slice acquisition studies were compared to multislice acquisition (six slices) in healthy volunteers. In Study 1 (n=8), the tagging plane was fixed in location, and the inversion time (TI2) was 1500 ms for each slice. For Study 2 (n=12), the tagging plane was fixed as in Study 1; however, TI2 increased as slices were acquired further from the tagging plane. In Study 3 (n=9), the tagging plane was kept adjacent to the imaging slice, and TI2 was 1500 ms for every slice. Gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CBF were measured per slice. GM SNR from single-slice acquisitions was significantly higher at slices 4-6 in Study 2 and at slices 2-6 in Study 3 compared to multislice acquisitions. Signal loss in distal slices of multislice acquisitions can be attributed to the destruction of tagged bolus in addition to blood T1 decay. If limited brain coverage is acceptable, perfusion images with greater SNR are achievable with limited slices and placement of the tagging region immediately adjacent to the site of interest.
