Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a new, rare, and severe disease occurring in patients with renal failure who have been exposed to gadolinium. The pathogenesis of NSF is not completely known. In fact, the first warning about a significant relationship between NSF and gadolinium (a contrast medium used in magnetic resonance imaging) was only issued in 2006. No cases of NSF have been reported in Italy to date. A nationwide investigation should therefore be carried out to assess the real prevalence of NSF within the Italian uremic population. Furthermore, we need guidelines to reduce the risk of NSF in renal patients undergoing MRI with contrast medium.
