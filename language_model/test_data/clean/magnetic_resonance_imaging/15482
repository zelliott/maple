Local recurrence and port-site metastasis remain a concern in urologic laparoscopic oncologic surgery. Portsite recurrence of renal-cell carcinoma after retroperitoneal and transperitoneal radical nephrectomy has been well documented. We report the first case of a port-site metastasis secondary to a partial nephrectomy and perform a literature review of this subject.
