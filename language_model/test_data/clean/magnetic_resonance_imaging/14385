Based on 46 enosteal cartilaginous tumours of the long tubular bones (43 patients) the established radiological and Mirra's histopathological criteria of tumour status are assessed independently and compared retrospectively. In lesions of Lodwick's type I B (37 cases) with mineralisation of the cartilaginous matrix and facultatively cortical arrosion, lack of periosteal reaction, destruction of the corticalis and parosseal tumour extension none of Mirra's histopathological criteria of malignancy was found. It may be expected that biopsy and histopathological examination will not give valuable additional information in this radiological constellation, because there are no known definite histopathological criteria of benignity. Suspicious radiological findings should prompt complete resection of the lesion. Biopsy and histopathological classification are always crucial when matrix mineralisation is lacking and therefore the diagnosis of a cartilaginous tumour cannot be established radiologically.
