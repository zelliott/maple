We report a case of a woman, aged 53 years, presenting with a right atrial mass due to idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis with periaortic involvement. This challenging diagnosis was confirmed by different imaging modalities and histopathologic analysis. The diagnosis of cardiac tumours is often difficult. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an intracavitary cardiac mass due to fibrosing mediastinitis. This rare disorder, which is characterized by invasive proliferation of fibrous tissue within the mediastinum, should be included in the differential diagnosis of intracardiac tumours.
