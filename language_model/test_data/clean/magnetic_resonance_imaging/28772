The long-term treatment with interferon beta-1b of a 7-year-old male with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is documented. Thirty-two months after initiating treatment, he demonstrates dramatic clinical improvement, without relapse, despite high titers of neutralizing antibodies to interferon beta-1b. It appears reasonable to attribute a role in his improvement to interferon beta-1b.
