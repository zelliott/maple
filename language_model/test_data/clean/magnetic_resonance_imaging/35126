A five-yr-old girl, who was a renal transplant recipient, presented with nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort, papules, and vesicles on her body. She was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and varicella zoster infection because her serum amylase and lipase levels were positive. Fourteen months later, she was readmitted with nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain similar to the previous symptoms and was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. This case report indicates that acute pancreatitis can be one of a number of complications following pediatric renal transplantation and can recur because of various causes.
