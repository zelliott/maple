Myelopathy is a rare central nervous system (CNS) complication associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is the most frequent form of SLE-related myelopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically shows increased signal intensity in T2-weighted images and cord swelling. In the present paper, we describe six cases of SLE-related myelopathy with multiple increased signals in the T2-weighted images involving continuous levels of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord, a distinctive feature recently named 'longitudinal myelitis'. The clinical and laboratory findings are similar to those presented by ATM patients, including paraparesis, sensory level and sphincter disturbances. Four patients had positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) suggesting that this could be a characteristic of longitudinal myelitis. Treatment in all cases included high doses of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents (intravenous (i.v.) cyclophosphamide). Anticoagulation therapy was given to one patient and two others received low doses of aspirin. The outcome was mainly unfavorable with slow improvement in only one case, no improvement in two and relapse of the myelopathy in the remaining three. In conclusion, longitudinal myelitis is an unusual form of SLE-related myelopathy, it might be associated with aPL and it has a poor prognosis.
