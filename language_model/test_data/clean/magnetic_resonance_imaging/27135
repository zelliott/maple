A simple method of measuring baseline cerebrospinal fluid volume fraction (V(CSF) ) in three-dimensional is proposed that used the characteristic of cerebrospinal fluid with very long T(2) . It is based on the fitting of monoexponential decay of only cerebrospinal fluid signal, using a nonselective T(2) preparation scheme. Three-dimensional gradient- and spin-echo acquisition also improves signal-to-noise ratio efficiency and brain coverage. Both V(CSF) and T(2,CSF) are fitted voxel by voxel and analyzed in different cortical areas across subjects. V(CSF) is largely regionally dependent (occipital: 8.9 ± 1.7%, temporal: 11.4 ± 2.4%, and frontal: 21.4 ± 6.9%). Measured T(2,CSF) was 1573 ± 146 msec within cortical lobes as compared with 2062 ± 37 msec from ventricle regions. Different parameter set were compared, and the robustness of the new method is demonstrated. Conversely, when comparing with the proposed approach, large overestimation of segmentation based method using T(1) -weighted images is found, and the underlying causes are suggested.
