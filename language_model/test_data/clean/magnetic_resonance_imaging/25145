Generally, ganglion or synovial cysts have been reported to originate from numerous structures in and around the knee joint, including the anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, popliteal tendon, and menisci. Nevertheless, a ganglion is not a synovial cyst and there is no synovial lining. Meniscal cysts present a subgroup of ganglion cysts that occur in association with meniscal tears. We report 2 cases of unusual meniscal cyst from the anterior segment of the lateral meniscus without any meniscal tear and discuss the possibility of their pathogenesis and treatment.
