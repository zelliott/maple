We report a case of an interventricular ependymoma which was surgically removed but also required bilateral transection of the fornices resulting in memory impairment which gradually improved. Functional MR images using a memory paradigm showed that recovery correlated with cortical plasticity involving activation of the orbitofrontal cortex and the middle temporal gyrus.
