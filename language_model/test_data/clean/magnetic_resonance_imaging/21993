Numerous surgical options are available to physicians treating patients with renal adenocarcinoma. In the current clinical setting, imaging plays a key role in determining which options are selected. Newer imaging techniques such as helical CT with CT angiography, MRI, and ultrasound (US) have improved staging capabilities in this patient population. However, to approach staging accuracies recently reported, attention must be paid to proper imaging parameters. This article describes the strengths, limitations, and proper techniques used for staging renal adenocarcinoma with CT, MRI, and US.
