Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a single shot fast spin-echo technique was evaluated as a noninvasive alternative to cystourethography or colpocystorectography in patients with pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence. Thirty-two patients were included in this prospective study. Colpocystorectography was performed in 10 patients who previously had undergone hysterectomy and in 2 patients without history of hysterectomy with clinical suspicion of rectoceles. Bead-chain cystourethrography was performed in 20 patients without hysterectomy. For dynamic MRI, a single-slice half-Fourier RARE sequence (imaging time 2 seconds) was used to depict the pelvic organs at different levels of pelvic strain. The results obtained with dynamic MRI were correlated with the x-ray findings. All 17 cystoceles, 10 rectoceles, 2 enteroceles, and 7 vaginal prolapses could be demonstrated on MRI. Diagnostic information gained from these images was equivalent to that obtained with colpocystorectography and superior to that obtained with cystourethrography; with the latter, important findings were missed (four rectoceles). We conclude that dynamic MRI of the pelvic floor with a half-Fourier RARE sequence can reliably detect descents of all three pelvic compartments, that it requires no contrast agent, and that no radiation exposure is involved.
