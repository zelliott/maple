Proteus syndrome is a rarely described dysplasia syndrome of the group of congenital hamartomas that arises from mosaic mutation. An extraordinary case history including imaging studies will be reported. This 17-year-old girl suffered from cachexia, lifelong chronic obstipation, different dysplasias, and lipomatous tumor-like lesions. The following findings were marked: macrodactyly, nevi, hemihypertrophy, aggressive lipomatosis, hemangiomas of the spleen, and skull and cerebral malformations. Additionally, an intestinal affection with fatty wall thickening was detected. In contrast to reports in the literature describing a reduced lifespan with a mean of few years, our patient is still alive. The treatment should take a palliative symptomatic approach considering the clinical situation.
