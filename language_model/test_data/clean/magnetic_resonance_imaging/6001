The aim of this study was to investigate cortical activation in response to binaural stimulus presentations in an individual (FX) with a circumscribed traumatic hemorrhagic lesion of the right inferior colliculus. FX and control subjects were exposed to complex sounds while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging assessment. Whereas normally-hearing individuals show well-balanced bilateral activation patterns in response to binaural auditory stimulation, the same stimuli produced stronger activation in the left hemisphere in FX. Combined with previous data, these findings reinforce the notion that the inferior colliculus is an essential auditory relay and that its loss cannot be significantly compensated.
