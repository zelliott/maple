Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is typically associated with distal upper limb weakness and wasting. However, proximal muscle bulk, particularly of biceps brachii, may be well preserved even in the presence of severe proximal weakness. Here we report 3 patients with MMN who had true muscle hypertrophy of severely weakened biceps muscles and positive motor symptoms including cramp and fasciculations in these muscles. Electromyographic studies demonstrated markedly impaired recruitment in the affected muscles and continuous motor unit activity comprising multiple fasciculation potentials at a frequency of up to 30 per minute. We propose that this continuous motor unit activity may have contributed to the hypertrophy in these muscles.
