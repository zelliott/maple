To present a case series of three patients with neuroretinitis associated with multiple sclerosis.

Retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive, interventional case series.

Thirty-five consecutive patients with neuroretinitis.

The records of 35 consecutive patients with neuroretinitis were reviewed for prior, concurrent, or subsequent development of multiple sclerosis.

Presentation, clinical course, and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

Three of 35 patients (8.6%) with neuroretinitis were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis by the McDonald criteria. One of the three patients underwent brain biopsy that further confirmed multiple sclerosis. Neuroretinitis in the three patients occurred after the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. All three patients with multiple sclerosis had been treated with interferon beta before or concurrently with the development of neuroretinitis.

Neuroretinitis can be an associated manifestation of multiple sclerosis. The possible association between neuroretinitis and interferon beta warrants further investigation.
