The records of all patients with orbital cavernous hemangioma managed at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University from Jan. 1, 1986 to Dec. 31, 2000 (n = 214) were reviewed retrospectively. Among them, 126 patients were female and 88 were male. The mean age was 39.4 years, ranging from 5.0 to 68.0 years. The left orbit was affected in 127 cases and the right one in 87 cases. No case showed bilateral involvement. A painless, gradually progressive proptosis and visual disturbance were the main clinical signs. Ninety-three percent of the patients (199/214) could be accurately diagnosed preoperatively based on echography and CT/MRI. The tumors were removed successfully by standard lateral orbitotomy in 35% (75/214) and by anterior orbitotomy in 65% (139/214). Anterior orbitotomy has become an important surgical procedure in the treatment of orbital cavernous hemangioma with excellent effect.
