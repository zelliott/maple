Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is an uncommon cause of spinal cord compression. It may be associated with various causative factors, but in many patients, anticoagulation can be implicated. It is noteworthy that many of the reported cases were anticoagulated in the therapeutic range. Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma should be suspected in any patient receiving anticoagulant agents who complains of local or referred spinal pain associated with limb weakness, sensory deficits, or urinary retention. Early diagnosis and treatment are very important for the functional recovery of the patient. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging is the most suitable neuroradiological method for early diagnosis. Although primary management is the surgical evacuation of the spinal epidural hematoma via laminectomy, rare cases in which the patient is improving rapidly and progressively could be treated conservatively. A 22-yr-old man with a spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma who was receiving warfarin treatment for a mechanical aortic valve is presented in this article.
