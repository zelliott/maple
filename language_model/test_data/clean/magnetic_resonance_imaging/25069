The purpose of this study was to design and build an optimized Radio Frequency (RF) coil configuration, that would facilitate the acquisition of high resolution 3-dimensional (3D) images of arthritic and normal rabbit knees. A surface coil transmit surface coil receive configuration was built, in order to ensure adequate B(1) homogeneity over the imaging volume and maximum filling factor, and hence to maximize the Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) and resolution of the 3-dimensional images. The two coils were passively decoupled using crossed diodes and lambda/4 lines, both during the transmit and receive phases of the imaging experiment. A specialized animal bed, to optimize the use of the coils and minimize the experiment setup time was designed and constructed. Three dimensional images of resolution 156 x 156 x 468 microm, were acquired in 20 min; the results, in terms both of the high resolution images and the ease with which the experimental setup could be reproduced, demonstrated that this configuration is ideal for imaging rabbit knee joints.
