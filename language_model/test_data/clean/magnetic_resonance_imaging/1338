Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the gastrointestinal tract may be useful for detection of inflammatory and neoplastic processes and staging of neoplasms. Successful application of MRI depends upon the use of proper gut contrast material, glucagon, and scan sequences that diminish the effect of respiratory motion. Current uses of MRI center on the evaluation and staging of rectal tumors and on the distinction between recurrent tumor and fibrosis.
