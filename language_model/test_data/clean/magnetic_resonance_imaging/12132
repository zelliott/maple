Thirty-eight patients with mediastinal and/or hilar masses were imaged by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results were analyzed retrospectively regarding the ability to demonstrate the masses, their number, size, definition, location and tissue characteristics. CT and MRI showed equivalent results in 32 cases; additional information was obtained in two patients by CT, in four patients by MRI. In view of the specific advantages and limitations of both CT and MRI we believed that in patients with mediastinal and/or hilar masses, contrast enhanced CT remains the procedure of choice after performing plain chest radiographs; in certain cases MRI will prove useful for further evaluation.
