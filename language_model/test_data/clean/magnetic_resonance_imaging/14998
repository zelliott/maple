A double-chambered right ventricle is a rare heart defect in which the right ventricle is separated into a high-pressure proximal and low-pressure distal chamber. This defect is considered to be congenital and typically presents in infancy or childhood but has been reported to present rarely in adults. It can be caused by the presence of anomalous muscle tissue, hypertrophy of the endogenous trabecular bands, or an aberrant moderator band; all of which will typically result in progressive obstruction of the outflow tract. In this paper, we will discuss the general anatomy of the right ventricle, the relevant embryology of the heart, and the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of a double-chambered right ventricle.
