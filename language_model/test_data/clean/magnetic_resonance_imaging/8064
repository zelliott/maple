We present a simple and intuitive means for determining the flip angles (FAs) required for smooth transitions between static pseudo steady states (SPSSs) in fast spin echo (FSE) imaging with variable FA (VFA) echo trains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of single and multiple transition pulses to successfully vary refocusing FAs while retaining high signal levels. The graphical interpretation presented here is consistent with previous analytical techniques and permits accurate signal-intensity predictions along the echo train.
