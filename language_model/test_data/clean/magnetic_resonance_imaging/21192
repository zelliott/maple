Neuroglial cysts are uncommon congenital lesion with own wall, which can be confined into or outside the central nervous system. In the central nervous system the cyst is located commonly in the brain. Spinal intramedullary neuroglial cyst are exceptional. Our objective is to present a case of intramedullary neuroglial cyst, to discuss the differentiels diagnosis and to show difficulties of its medical taking care.

A 60 year-old man, without past history, was admitted to the hospital with a compression of conus medullaris since one year. The clinical examination revealed paraparesis and genito-sphincterian disorders. MRI of the spine revealed intramedullary cyst at T12-L1 level. The patient underwent cystic evacuation, a large marsupialization of the cavity and a wall biopsy. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of neuroglial cyst. The postoperative outcome was favourable with a partial improvement of motor weakness. Postoperative MRI showed a persistent residual cavity.

Neuroglial intramedullary cyst is uncommon. It is a benign lesion. Complete surgical resection is very difficult seen the absence of defined plan cleavage.
