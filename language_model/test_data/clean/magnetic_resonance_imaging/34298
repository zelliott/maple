Magnetic resonance urographic (MRU) techniques possess image quality and diagnostic capability that are improving with increasingly sophisticated imaging sequences and shorter scanning times. We describe the application of a fast breath-hold MR sequence (HASTE) in the assessment of ureteric obstruction in pregnancy. In the patient presented, HASTE MRU was successful in depicting ureteral anatomy and demonstrated dilation of both ureters below the level of the pelvic brim. This observation suggested distal ureteral obstruction rather than simple hydronephrosis of pregnancy. As a result, bilateral nephrostomies were performed and neonatal prematurity was avoided. Interestingly, in this patient, HASTE MR imaging also showed evidence of concurrent fetal hydronephrosis.
