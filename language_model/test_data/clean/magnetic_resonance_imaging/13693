Clear cell chondrosarcoma is a rare variant of the bone tumors with distinct radiologic and pathologic features. In this report two cases of clear cell chondrosarcomas with atypical radiologic appearances are presented. The findings of X-ray films and MRI are described with histologic correlation. In the first case the lesion showed a very expansile and long segment involvement of the humerus. In the second case the lesion was located in the diaphysis of the femur causing a large cortical destruction.
