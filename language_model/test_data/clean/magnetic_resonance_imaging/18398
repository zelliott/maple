Limb and trunk muscles of 57 patients with the juvenile or adult form of myotonic dystrophy were studied by imaging techniques (ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging). Typical findings were atrophy of the tibialis anterior and triceps brachii muscles and fatty degeneration of the vastus intermedius, sartorius, tibialis anterior and soleus muscles as well as of medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging was the most sensitive technique in depicting mesenchymal muscle alterations, followed by computed tomography and ultrasound. The data support that imaging is more sensitive in detecting the myopathy than measurement of the creatine kinase activity.
