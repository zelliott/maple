We report a 23-year-old man with left dominant parietal cortical dysplasia manifesting as ictal asomatognosia. The man had experienced seizures, during which he underwent ictal asomatognosia as a feeling of loss of his right extremities. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) showed interictal discharges in the left parietal region of his brain. Magnetic resonance fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging revealed a hyperintense lesion in the left superior parietal lobule. A [(123)I]-iomazenil (IMZ) single-photon-emission CT scan demonstrated an area of low IMZ binding coincident with the lesion observed in the MRI scan. Invasive EEG monitoring showed ictal discharges in the cortex posterior to the postcentral sulcus. High-frequency electrical stimulation of the same area of the cortex also induced asomatognosia of the patient's right forearm. We performed a corticectomy of the anterior part of the superior parietal lobule, which resulted in no new neurological deficits. The seizures disappeared after surgery with the maintenance of preoperative medication. Therefore, the anterior part of the superior parietal lobule may be a symptomatogenic zone for ictal asomatognosia.
