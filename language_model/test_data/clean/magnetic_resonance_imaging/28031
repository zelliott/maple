The first case report is an undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the ear. This patient complained with pain and discharging ear, which led us to practice a TC followed by an attico-antrotomy. The pathologist could detect in the removed tissue the neoplasm in its early evolutive stages. In the other case the earache and the suppuration suggested at first a carcinoma. In spite of the TAC and MR exams the surgery that followed was not confirmative of the tumor presence.
