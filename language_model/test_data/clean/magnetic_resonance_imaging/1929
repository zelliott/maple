This report describes a case of metastatic meningioma involving the first thoracic vertebral body in a 63-year-old woman. The patient was treated surgically 10 years earlier for a benign meningioma of the right parietal vault. Local recurrence was diagnosed in 1992. Despite the gamma-knife radiosurgery, recurrence required surgical treatment in 1999. Histological findings were compatible with atypical meningioma (grade II WHO). One year later, the patient presented left C8 cervicobrachial neuralgia. Investigation led to discovery of a D1 tumor that was a metastasis of the atypical intracranial meningioma. A resection of the vertebral T1 body with C7-T2 osteosynthesis was performed with an excellent recovery and no postoperative complication.
