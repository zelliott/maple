Atrial Myxomas are benign primary tumors of the heart, arising mainly from the left atrium. Clinical signs and symptoms produced by atrial myxomas may be non-specific or result in mechanical obstruction of cardiac function, arrhythmias, and embolization. The authors present a case of a 60-year-old woman who developed total left hemiparesis resulting from left atrial myxoma embolization causing complete occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery.
