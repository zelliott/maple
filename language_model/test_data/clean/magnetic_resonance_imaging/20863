Between January 2000 and January 2011, we diagnosed three patients with isolated craniopharyngioma in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). Brain MRI revealed cystic lesions with various imaging characteristics, including hypointensity on T1-weighted (T1W) images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted (T2W) images. The first patient's lesion showed rim enhancement after gadolinium administration. The second patient's lesion showed mixed signal intensity on both T1W and T2W images. The third patient's MRI showed a well-defined cystic lesion in the right CPA that compressed the brainstem. This lesion was hyperintense on T1W images and hypointense relative to cerebrospinal fluid on T2W images, and was peripherally enhanced after gadolinium administration. All three patients underwent surgical intervention through a suboccipital retrosigmoid craniotomy/craniectomy and lesions that did not adhere to adjacent tissues were removed completely. Histopathological examination confirmed the tumors to be adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. The post-operative course was uneventful for all patients uneventful and no tumor recurrences were detected at the last follow-up. Primary CPA craniopharyngioma can be completely removed surgically, provided it does not densely adhere to vital structures.
