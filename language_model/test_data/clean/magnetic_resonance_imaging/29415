We report on a patient affected by ICF syndrome (immunodeficiency, centromeric instability of chromosomes 1, 9 and 16 and facial dysmorphism), who presented with slowing in mentation, mild right hemiparesis and focal motor seizures. MRI study of the brain suggested a diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which was confirmed by JC virus DNA detection on CSF by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This is a unique case of adult infective neurological complication described in ICF Syndrome.
