Intradural arachnoid cysts are relatively uncommon pouches of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) found within the subarachnoid space. The authors present a series of eight symptomatic patients in whom syrinx cavities were associated with arachnoid cysts, and they discuss treatment strategies for this entity.

The population comprised eight men whose mean age was 50 years (range 35-81 years). All patients experienced gait difficulty, and it was the chief complaint in seven; arm pain was the primary complaint in one. No patient had a history of spinal trauma, meningitis, or previous spinal surgery at the level of the syrinx cavity or arachnoid cyst. In each patient imaging revealed a syrinx cavity affecting two to 10 vertebral levels. Posterior thoracic arachnoid cysts were found in proximity to the syrinx cavity in each case. There was no evidence of cavity enhancement, Chiari malformation, tethered cord, or hydrocephalus. All patients underwent thoracic laminectomy and resection of the arachnoid cyst wall, and postoperative neurological improvement was documented in each case. The mean follow-up duration was 19 months (range 4-37 months). Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the disappearance of the arachnoid cyst and a significant decrease in syrinx cavity size in each patient.

Spinal arachnoid cysts can be associated with syringomyelia, likely due to alterations in normal CSF dynamics. In symptomatic patients these cysts should be resected and the normal CSF flow restored. The results of the present series indicate that neurological improvement and reduction in syrinx cavity size can be achieved in patients with syringomyelia associated with intradural arachnoid cysts.
