MR imaging provides clinically useful information in detecting and characterizing pathology of the rotator cuff and other shoulder disorders in a noninvasive fashion. Complete and partial tears of the rotator cuff as well as factors contributing to impingement can be detected and characterized with MR imaging. The size and location of complete tears of the rotator cuff can be accurately determined with MR imaging.
