We report the results of a near total myeloablation in preparation for bone marrow transplantation in a boy with minimal symptoms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Severe cerebral X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy developed in the patient after failure of bone marrow transplantation. This experience suggests that immunotherapy alone is not responsible for the improvement observed in some patients with X-ALD after BMT.
