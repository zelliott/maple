A MRI of the lumbal spine was performed on a patient with lumbago. Besides the fact of no evidence for a myelopathy caused by a herniated disc a both-sided iliac vein thrombosis could be seen. In further examination the coincidence of a congenital absence of vena cava inferior with distinctive collateral vessel systems over lumbal and spinal veins and heterozygosis for Factor V Leiden abnormality could be identified as cause for thrombosis. It is very likely that symptoms developed as a result of spinal vein hyperplasia and consecutive myelon compression.
