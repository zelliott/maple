MRI has contributed to significant advances in the understanding of neurological diseases in humans. It has also been used to evaluate the spectrum of mouse models spanning from developmental abnormalities during embryogenesis, evaluation of transgenic and knockout models, through various neurological diseases such as stroke, tumors, degenerative and inflammatory diseases. The MRI techniques used clinically are technically more challenging in the mouse because of the size of the brain; however, mouse imaging provides researchers with the ability to explore cellular and molecular imaging that one day may translate into clinical practice. This article presents an overview of the use of MRI in mouse models of a variety of neurological disorders and a brief review of cellular imaging using magnetically tagged cells in the mouse central nervous system.
