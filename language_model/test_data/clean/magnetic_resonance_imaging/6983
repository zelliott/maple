We report the case of an aneurysm of the superior gluteal artery that occurred more than ten years after a pelvic trauma. The diagnosis of this uncommon condition is sometimes difficult because of the predominant neurologic symptoms. Rupture can be life-threatening. The patient was treated by an embolization; thereafter a surgical procedure with control of the internal iliac artery and an endoaneurysmorrhaphy was performed. The main characteristics of this pathology are indicated.
