This study aimed to investigate the localization of the lipoma, as well as associated intracranial and extracranial lesions in 14 patients immediately following hospital admission. The pathological findings from the neurological examinations of these patients are also investigated.

Fourteen patients who were admitted to our clinic with a variety of symptoms and diagnosed with intracranial lipoma were included in the study. Problems presented upon admission, neurological findings, and other existing system abnormalities were evaluated. Localization of the lipomas and accompanying pathologies were determined by using computerised tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

The most frequent reasons for admission of patients with intracranial lipomas were: headache 7 (50%), trauma 3 (21.5%), epilepsy 3 (21.5%) and one with symptoms due to the local mass effect of tumor (7%). Although the pericallosal region is accepted as the region where lipomas commonly occur, this study found the most frequent occurrence in the quadrigeminal cistern. Intracranial lipoma calcification was only evident in 1 of the 14 patients. In addition, contrary to the expectations, intracranial and extracranial lesions accompanying lipomas were rare. All patients received systematic treatment.

This study showed that intracranial lipomas are more frequent in the quadrigeminal region of the brain; most are asymptomatic, generally caught incidentally; and accompanying intracranial and extracranial pathologies are less common than expected.
