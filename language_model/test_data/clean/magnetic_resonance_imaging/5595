Bannayan-Zonana syndrome is a rare entity characterized by macrocephaly and multiple soft tissue and visceral hamartomas and lipomas. Knowledge of this syndrome is important given the risk of sometimes fatal bleeding and visceral neoplasia in adulthood. We report on a new case, original in its sporadic occurrence and rapidly fatal progression.
