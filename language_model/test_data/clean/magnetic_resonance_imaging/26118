We carried out radial MRI in 30 hips with moderate osteoarthritis and in ten normal hips. On a scout view containing the entire acetabular rim, 12 vertical radial slices were set at 15 degrees intervals. Different appearances were observed in different parts of the joint. In the weight-bearing portion, from 45 degrees anterosuperior to 45 degrees posterosuperior, 'attenuation' (n = 16) and 'disappearance' (n = 25) were observed as abnormalities of the labrum with 'capsular stripping' (n = 29) and 'extraosseous high signal lesion' (n = 27) as capsular abnormalities, seen more often in the anterosuperior portion. In all 12 planes there were osteophytes on the acetabular edge (n = 24), femoral head (n = 22) and/or at the central acetabulum (n = 6), a bone cyst on the acetabulum (n = 18) and/or the femoral head (n = 9), irregularity of the articular cartilage (n = 30), and an effusion (n = 28). Our findings indicate that radial MRI may be a useful non-invasive diagnostic method for demonstrating pathology in moderate osteoarthritis of the hip.
