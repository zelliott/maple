Four horses were examined because of chronic forelimb lameness. In all horses, the cause of the lameness was localized to the metacarpus by means of physical examination and diagnostic anesthesia, and radiography of the affected limb revealed a small exostosis of the second metacarpal bone. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed suspensory desmitis in the region of this exostosis in all 4 horses. In addition, an abnormal area of low signal intensity, suggestive of an adhesion, was seen between the exostosis and the suspensory ligament. In all horses, an adhesion between the suspensory ligament and the exostosis on the second metacarpal bone was identified and transected at surgery, and the exostosis and distal portion of the second metacarpal bone were removed. All horses were able to return to their previous athletic use following a 6-month rest and rehabilitation program for treatment of the suspensory desmitis. Findings in these horses suggest that adhesions between the suspensory ligament and an exostosis of the second metacarpal bone may be a cause of chronic or recurrent forelimb lameness in horses.
