CT and MR have permitted radiology to play a greater, but not definitive, role in detecting the pathologic components of tuberous sclerosis. SEN may be identified in only 80% of patients. Tubers are more ubiquitous and readily identified by MR in children and adults when the brain is myelinated. Since tubers are predominantly peripheral hypomyelinated lesions, the detection of small lesions may be delayed until an infant is over 16-18 months of age when the myelin will have extended to the junction between the cortical white and gray matter. SEGA typically evolve later during the first and second decades of life. Successful genetic counseling implies a need to detect tuberous sclerosis at a stage during infancy when imaging may fail to confirm the diagnosis, so tuberous sclerosis remains a clinical diagnosis.
