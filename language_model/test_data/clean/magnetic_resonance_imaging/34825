Macrodystrophia lipomatosa is a congenital form of localized gigantism characterized by an overgrowth of all mesenchymal elements with a disproportionate increase of adipose tissue. We describe a patient with macrodystrophia lipomatosa affecting the foot who exhibited characteristic MR findings that distinguish the lesion from other conditions associated with localized gigantism.
