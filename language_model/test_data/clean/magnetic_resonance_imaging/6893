This report describes a child having the syndrome of overlapping phenotypic features of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE). Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed a point mutation at position A3243G, whereas activity of thymidine phosphorylase and its corresponding gene analysis were normal. The most striking feature of this case was paralysis of one segment of the terminal ileum observed on laparotomy. The electron microscopic findings of the resected ileum and colon by limited right hemicolectomy disclosed accumulation of numerous enlarged mitochondria with ill-defined cristae which were similar to mitochondria reported in three previous MELAS cases and one MNGIE case with intestinal dysmotility. We emphasize that the MELAS and MNGIE phenotypes overlapped in this case and that the mechanism of acute ileus in MELAS was associated with functional paralysis of the intestine.
