We report on a 43-year-old female who, for 27 years, had thoracic scoliosis with curve convexity to the left side. She complained of rapid progression of the central cord syndrome in the past two years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a syringomyelia with a direct connection between the fourth ventricle and the syrinx. The patient underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and showed rapid neurologic improvement. A follow-up MRI showed dramatic shrinkage of the syrinx.
