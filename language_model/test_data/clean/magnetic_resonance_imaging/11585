A patient developed pendular seesaw nystagmus after receiving radiation and intrathecal methotrexate treatment for central nervous system lymphoma. Nystagmus developed without evidence of a brainstem lesion on magnetic resonance imaging. This case expands the causes of seesaw nystagmus and lends further support to the notion that midbrain lesions are not a prerequisite for its development.
