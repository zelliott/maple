The causes of herniated disc in vivo vary, and recent studies stress the role of intradiscal pressure as an important factor. Identifying causes of increased intradiscal pressure is difficult. This case report describes the diagnosis of a herniated nucleus pulposus in a 20-yr-old healthy man, with sudden onset of emesis. The diagnosis was made by a complete history, physical examination, electrodiagnostic studies, and magnetic resonance imaging. This etiology of herniated nucleus pulposus has not been described in the medical literature, and the severity of the symptoms, clinical examination, electrodiagnostic findings, and radiologic findings are discussed. Intradiscal pressures and their role in herniated nucleus pulposus are discussed, with a review of the medical literature on the measurement of intradiscal pressure. The amount of force required to produce a herniated nucleus pulposus is also discussed.
