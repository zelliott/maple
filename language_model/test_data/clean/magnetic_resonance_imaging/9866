Panayiotopoulos syndrome is early-onset benign childhood epilepsy, now classified as an electroclinical syndrome. The original description in 1989 focused on the triad of nocturnal seizures, tonic eye deviation, and vomiting. With available data from the long-term studies, a wide variety of manifestations have been described, with recognition of autonomic features as being the most prominent aspect of this epilepsy. The presenting symptoms are usually focal seizures comprising autonomic symptoms and/or behavioral changes. Majority of these seizures are in sleep, with half of the seizures progressing to become secondarily generalized. Occasionally, these seizures can present with prominent autonomic features such as ictal vomiting, pallor, flushing/cyanosis, and tachycardia with prolonged thermoregulatory changes lasting for hours, constituting autonomic status epilepticus. Recovery from this autonomic status epilepticus is within hours and is always complete. Autonomic status epilepticus has been previously reported in this epilepsy syndrome, but ictal cardiorespiratory arrest is extremely rare, with only 4 cases being reported in literature. All 4 cases reported in literature recovered spontaneously and did not require resuscitation. Here we present a 3Â½-year-old male child with Panayiotopoulos syndrome who presented with status epilepticus and ictal cardiorespiratory arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation for revival.
