A 7-year-old female was discovered to be severely hypertensive. Urinary noradrenaline excretion and plasma noradrenaline level were elevated. Plasma renin activity was markedly elevated. She was found to have a mass in the hilus of the left kidney and left renal artery stenosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the mass revealed an extremely bright lesion on T2 weighted image. DMSA renal scintigraphy revealed a low uptake rate (4.7%) in the left kidney. A diagnosis of extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma associated with left sided renal artery stenosis was made. The mass and left kidney were removed. Electronmicroscopic examination of the mass revealed characteristic neurosecretory granules. There was only slight fibrosis in the wall of the removed left renal artery.
