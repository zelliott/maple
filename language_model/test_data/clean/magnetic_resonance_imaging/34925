In two infants aged 5 days and 2 months paresis of the legs due to spinal cord compression by a dumbbell neuroblastoma suddenly appeared. Immediate surgical resection of only the paraspinal tumor mass was performed. Without any further treatment, prompt spontaneous regression of the intraspinal component occurred, and the paresis disappeared within 2 weeks in both infants. We advocate surgical excision of the paraspinal tumor mass as the sole treatment in infants with symptomatic dumbbell neuroblastoma.
