Magnetic resonance tomographic findings and clinical symptoms were compared by using the results of 596 studies. The clinical diagnoses and types of Arnold-Chiari's anomaly, which were revealed by magnetic resonance tomography as groups I, II, and III were also evaluated. A contribution of fluid dynamic disorders, including intracranial hypertension and hydrocephalus, was assessed. No relationship was found between the clinical manifestations and the ascending degree of cerebellar tonsils. The combination of Arnold-Chiari's anomaly with syringomyelia and osteochondrosis and a role of magnetic resonance tomography in the identification of the anomaly for correct choice of therapy in spinal pathology were shown. It was concluded that magnetic resonance tomography should be used in all cases of spinal diseases or suspected diseases of the craniospinal transition.
