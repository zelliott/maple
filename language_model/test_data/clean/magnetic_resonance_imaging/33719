Two cases of intramedullary spinal cord sarcoidosis are reported. These lesions could not be differentiated from neoplastic spinal cord tumors by clinical findings or imaging studies. In magnetic resonance imaging, the lesions were enhanced around the gray matter with gadlinium diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). The true diagnosis was established only by histologic examination of the surgical specimen. The possibility of intramedullary sarcoidosis presenting as a tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the spinal cord.
