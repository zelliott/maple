Magnetization transfer (MT) technique is a promising method in differential diagnosis of diseases in parenchymal tissues. Basic knowledge about circumstances and elementary factors that influence MT and its parameters is still insufficient, however. Having a meal before the magnetic resonance (MR) examination could change liver MT parameters compared to fasting state through alteration in liver perfusion, blood flow, and content of portal blood (proteins and other derivates from a meal). If MT parameters can be altered by a meal, then MR liver studies should always be performed after fasting. Before MRI examinations we examined three healthy volunteers after a high-fat meal with Doppler ultrasound technique to find out duration and magnitude of changes in portal blood flow. Duration of > or = 50% increased peak-flow value compared to fasting state in portal vein was > 90 min, which is enough for our MR examination. With a low-field 0.1-T MR imager we examined 10 healthy volunteers after a short (range from 3 h 45 min to 17 h 30 min) fast and also immediately after a high-fat meal. Magnetization transfer parameters, magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and magnetization transfer rate Rwm of liver tissue were determined. MTR changed significantly (Student paired two-tailed t-test, p = .0044) after a meal, but Rwm did not (p = .0952). We recommend a 4 h fast before MR examination that aims to determine the MTR of liver tissue.
