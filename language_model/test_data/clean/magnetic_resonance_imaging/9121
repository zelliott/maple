A 5-year-old boy presented with acute onset of chorea and dysarthria. During his workup, a heart murmur was noted. Echocardiography revealed multiple mobile masses in the left ventricular outflow tract related to the mitral valve. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography did not detect any abnormalities. He underwent a subtotal resection of the mass to preserve valvular function. The anatomic pathology was papillary fibroelastoma.
