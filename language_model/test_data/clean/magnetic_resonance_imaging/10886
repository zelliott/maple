We present a report of a patient with an isolated scaphoid dislocation associated with a hyperextension and axial loading injury of the carpus required a careful and extensive clinical and radiographic evaluation leading to surgical intervention to reduce and stabilize the scaphoid and to reduce and hold internally the axial carpal injury. Knowledge of the anatomy and the potential injury patterns of the carpus will aid the hand surgeon with injury recognition and proper treatment.
