The study of hominin brain evolution focuses on the interiors of fossilized braincases. Applications of recent three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques for visualizing and measuring >>virtual endocasts<< from braincases in combination with advances in computer graphics and software for acquiring relevant data are transforming the way in which fossil skulls are analyzed, and improving the quality of paleoneurological investigations. Although CT imaging is preferred for fossil skulls, a novel method that combines high-resolution MRI of physical endocasts, electronic reconstruction of their missing parts, and warping of the resulting virtual endocasts is currently being developed and has great potential for future studies of hominin brain evolution. Applications of CT and MR techniques have already resulted in surprising new findings, which are briefly outlined. Exciting revelations about hominin brain evolution are expected as the 21st century unfolds.
