A 6-year-old boy presented with weakness of the right upper and lower limbs, noted since infancy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed periventricular nodular heterotopia lining the trigone and occipital horns of bilateral lateral ventricles along with herniation of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum suggestive of Chiari type 1 malformation. The association of periventricular nodular heterotopia with Chiari type 1 malformation has not been described earlier in children.
