We have developed a new interdisciplinary approach for removing large clivus and upper cervical spine tumors. This approach is a combination of the Le Fort I osteotomy, midfacial degloving, and median labiomandibular glossotomy. Our approach gives an excellent, wide surgical field from the nasopharynx, including the base of the skull, to the base of the tongue and permits sufficiently safe extirpation of clivus and upper cervical spine tumors that may not be removed by transoral or transcervical approaches. Our approach not only incorporates the merits of each approach but also creates a larger surgical field that may be modified or expanded to accommodate the removal of more bulky tumors in this region. This novel approach will facilitate more successful resection of tumors arising between the nasopharynx, including the skull base, and the retropharyngeal area.
