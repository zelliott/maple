The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of Gd-DTPA MRI in the detection of recurrent tumor after laserinduced thermotherapy (LITT) of experimental liver metastases.

LITT was performed at different energy levels in VX-2 tumor-bearing rabbits (n = 80). MRI and histology were placed at 0, 24, 96 hours, and 14 days. Signal intensities were calculated of the transition between thermally damaged and undamaged tissue (transition zone = TZ) and of the surrounding tissue (reference zone = RZ).

Tumor recurrence was seen in 47 animals. At 24 hours sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was 92, 100, and 95% in TZ and 23, 100, and 50% in RZ. At 14 days sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was 100, 11, and 60% in TZ and 100, 89, and 95% in RZ.

Recurrence is best excluded in TZ at 24 hour and in RZ at 14 day with an accuracy up to 95%.
