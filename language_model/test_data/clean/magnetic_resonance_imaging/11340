An intravascular iron-based contrast agent was used as a sodium (23Na) MRI T2 relaxant in an effort to suppress the blood signal from the ventricular cavities in normal and infarcted canine myocardium in vivo. 23Na MRI signal decreases in blood were attributed to decreases in the fast (T2f) and slow (T2s) transverse relaxation components, which were quantified as a function of dose and MRI echo time (TE). In vivo 23Na MRI signal decreases up to 65% were noted in ventricular blood when imaging under dose and TE conditions of 10 mg/kg body weight and 5 ms, respectively. Contrast injection followed by subsequent 23Na MRI in canine myocardial infarction led to a clear delineation of the location of the injured tissue, as identified by postmortem triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, and to an improvement in the contrast-to-noise ratio between the blood in the ventricular chamber and the infarcted tissue that was as high as 3.3-fold in the postcontrast images in comparison to the precontrast images.
