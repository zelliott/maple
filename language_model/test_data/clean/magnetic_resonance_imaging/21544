This retrospective study focuses on 14 patients with ganglioglioma of the cerebral hemispheres who received surgical treatment in the Neurosciences Department/Neurosurgery of "La Sapienza" University of Rome between 1953 and 1990. The data are analyzed together with those on 98 published cases of ganglioglioma confined to the cerebral hemispheres. These tumours have no sex preference but a decided preference for the young (mean age 18 years). They are characterized by a history of epilepsy often of long standing and sometimes refractory to drugs. The most frequent site is the temporal lobe (61%). At operation the tumour proved to be solid in 52% of cases and the satellite cyst at the tumour wall in 48%. Removal was total in 65% of cases. Even after subtotal removal, the prognosis is good in terms both of survival and of seizure control. Radiotherapy seems to have no role in the treatment of these tumours.
