Perfusion MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the pituitary gland was performed in 20 healthy volunteers and 63 patients with various lesions involving the pituitary gland. All patients underwent sequential contrast-enhanced MRI using spoiled gradient recalled sequences with high temporal resolution (7 seconds). Four pituitary areas (pituitary stalk, posterior lobe, postero-superior, and antero-inferior adenohypophysis) were tested with a selected region of interest. Maximal contrast percentual variation was calculated. The timing of enhancement in normal patients matched perfectly with normal pituitary vascularization. Abnormal timing in pathological condition was investigated.
