In 1990, Hamada et al. radiographically classified massive rotator cuff tears into five grades. Walch et al. subsequently subdivided Grade 4 to reflect the presence/absence of subacromial arthritis and emphasize glenohumeral arthritis as a characteristic of Grade 4.

We therefore determined (1) whether patient characteristics and MRI findings differed between the grades at initial examination and final followup; (2) which factors affected progression to a higher grade; (3) whether the retear rate of repaired tendons differed among the grades; and (4) whether the radiographic grades at final followup differed from those at initial examination among patients treated operatively.

We retrospectively reviewed 75 patients with massive rotator cuff tears. Thirty-four patients were treated nonoperatively and 41 operatively.

Patients with Grade 3, 4, or 5 tears had a higher incidence of fatty muscle degeneration of the subscapularis muscle than patients with Grade 1 or 2 tears. In 26 patients with Grade 1 or 2 tears at initial examination, duration of followup was longer in patients who remained at Grade 1 or 2 than in those who progressed to Grade 3, 4, or 5 at final followup. The retear rate of repaired supraspinatus tendon was more frequent in Grade 2 than Grade 1 tears. In operated cases, radiographic grades at final followup did not develop to Grades 3 to 5.

We believe cuff repair should be performed before acromiohumeral interval narrowing. Our observations are consistent with the temporal concepts of massive cuff tear pathomechanics proposed by Burkhart and Hansen et al.
