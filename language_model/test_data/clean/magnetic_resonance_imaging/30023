The aim of this study was to assess the value of direct magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography of the wrist for detecting full-thickness tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). Twenty-four consecutive patients who had ulnar-sided wrist pain and clinical suspicion of TFCC tear were included in the study. All patients underwent direct MR arthrography and then wrist arthroscopy, and the results of MR arthrography were compared with the arthroscopic findings. The positive predictive value of MR arthrography in detecting TFCC full-thickness tear was 0.95, and the negative predictive value was 0.50. The sensitivity of MR arthrography in detecting a TFCC full-thickness tear was 74% (15/19), and specificity was 80% (4/5). The overall accuracy of MR arthrography in detecting a full-thickness tear of the TFCC in our study was 79% (19/24). We believe that diagnosis of tears in the TFCC by direct MR arthrography is not entirely satisfactory, although MR arthrography has a high positive predictive value for detecting TFCC tears. Negative results of MR arthrography in patients with clinical suspicion of TFCC tear should be interpreted with caution.
