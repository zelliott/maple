The article describes the development of symptoms in a 59-year-old patient. Dyskinesia and speech disorder were the only clinical features in the beginning. Increased immunological parameters and only slight hypokinetic-rigid signs for a long time made the diagnostical and therapeutical process more difficult, as well as atypical findings in neuroimaging techniques. Corticobasal degeneration was diagnosed about 6 years after onset of clinical symptoms.
