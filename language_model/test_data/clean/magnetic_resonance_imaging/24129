We present a case of diffuse hepatocellular carcinoma of the liver with unusual radiological findings. On both CT and MR imaging, the posterior half of the right hepatic lobe showed a unique attenuation/intensity bordered by a clear margin, as if painted in two tones. It appeared to be analogous to "straight border sign," which is known to reflect hepatic venous stoppage. Autopsy revealed congestive hepatic infarction congruous with the area of altered attenuation/intensity caused by tumor thrombus in the corresponding branch of the hepatic vein.
