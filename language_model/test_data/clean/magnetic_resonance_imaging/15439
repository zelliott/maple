Three-dimensional, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D-FLAIR) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently been developed to detect hemorrhage or high concentrations of protein. We present a patient with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, in whom high signals in the cochlear and vestibular apparatus were identified with 3D-FLAIR. The high signal areas in 3D-FLAIR were not detected by T1- and T2-weighted MRI in this case. This is the first report of high concentrations of protein in the inner ear in Ramsay Hunt syndrome using 3D-FLAIR, and suggests that high concentrations of protein in the inner ear are associated with hearing deterioration in some patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. 3D-FLAIR could be a useful diagnostic tool in the early stages of Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
