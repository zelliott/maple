Tarsal tunnel syndrome is a compressive neuropathy of the tibial nerve with multiple causes. This syndrome is difficult to diagnose and can be missed because of its subjective symptomatology.

In our patient, suspected post-traumatic tarsal tunnel syndrome was confirmed at MRI. This case highlights muscle signal anomalies caused by their denervation in the tibial nerve territory.

MRI can provide supplementary information to the electromyography (EMG) and contribute to positive and etiologic diagnosis of peripheral nerve lesions.
