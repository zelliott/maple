In a case of calcified intrahepatic portal vein thrombus CT demonstrated a branching calcified intrahepatic mass with peripheral enhancement following dynamic bolus contrast medium administration. The distinction from intrahepatic choledocholithiasis was made with normal cholangiography. Calcified portal vein thrombus should be considered an unusual cause of branching calcified intrahepatic mass on CT.
