Adult aseptic osteonecrosis (ON) represents a clinical picture with unexplained etiology. Since curative treatment of this disease often succeeds only in the early stage, pain therapy plays an important role in the treatment process.

We compared established and novel treatment options for ON as well as our own results after i.v. administration of the prostacyclin analogue iloprost with corresponding studies in the literature.

In addition to treatment with nonsteroidal antirheumatic agents and opioids, surgical "core decompression," vasoactive medications, and hyperbaric oxygenation are effective. Treatment with iloprost for 5 days resulted in highly significant pain reduction.

Symptomatic treatment is indicated in all stages of ON and curative treatment in stage I and early stage II. In cases of disease progression in the large joints, early endoprosthetic replacement is indicated to avoid secondary damage. In addition to employing vasoactive substances, a further curative treatment approach could be the use of mesenchymal stem cells.
