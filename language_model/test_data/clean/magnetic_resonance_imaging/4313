The surgical treatment of transsphenoidal cephaloceles in children is controversial. Reduction and repair via a transcranial approach are associated with high postoperative rates of morbidity, mortality, and hypothalamic dysfunction. In this study, four patients, aged 3 to 35 months at surgery, underwent successful transpalatal repair of two encephaloceles and two meningoceles. Two patients presented with nasal obstruction in infancy, one presented with unexplained meningitis, and in one patient the lesion was found incidentally during evaluation for seizures. Two children had median cleft face syndrome, another had an associated Arnold-Chiari type I malformation, and the fourth had no other cranial abnormalities. All patients underwent preoperative evaluation including magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Auditory, ophthalmological, genetic, endocrinological, or other evaluation was undertaken as indicated. Lesions were approached through the median raphe of the hard and soft palates. All cephaloceles were easily visualized and dissected after division of the nasal palatal mucosa. The dural sac and its contents were reduced by surface coagulation after division and dissection of the overlying mucosa. Once reduced, the bone defect was obliterated in three of four patients. The dura was not opened and anomalous neural elements were not resected. At follow-up evaluation, all patients demonstrated resolution of preoperative symptoms without evidence of infection or lasting morbidity. Follow-up MR imaging showed reduction in all cases. The authors conclude that this transpalatal approach is safe and reliable for the treatment of transsphenoidal cephaloceles in young children.
