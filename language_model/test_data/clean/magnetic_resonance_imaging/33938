This study investigates the potential of microscopic Magnetic Resonance Imaging to obtain information for 3D digital atlases of mouse development using fixed samples. Fixed samples allow direct comparison with already published atlases and provide a testing ground for future in vivo efforts. 3D MR images of mouse embryos (dpc 6.5-16) illustrate that the necessary contrast and level of detail is available with this technique. Diffusion weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and multi-valued data sets are presented as examples of uniquely MR methods of obtaining anatomical information. MRI is performed non-invasively on the intact sample, leaving open the possibility of other manipulations (e.g. classical histology, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and in vitro growth for unfixed samples) after conducting the MRI experiment.
