Both genetics and neuroimaging have developed rapidly in the past few years. Recently the two methods have been combined in a new technique called genetic neuroimaging.

To provide an overview of the backgrounds and the possibilities of genetic neuroimaging.

In this review we first discuss genetic and neuroimaging research methods that are currently in use and then discuss their synergistic combination. Finally we analyse two recent cases in which genetic neuroimaging was used to study an individual's vulnerability to affective and psychotic symptoms. results Results are very promising, particularly with regard to research into vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. It is expected that the use of genetic neuroimaging procedures will increase. Genetic and neuroimaging methods are often exceedingly complex, which means they cannot be easily accessed by the general public.

Genetic neuroimaging is an important method to study the relation between candidate genes and variations in cognitive and emotional functioning and the vulnerability to psychiatric disorders.
