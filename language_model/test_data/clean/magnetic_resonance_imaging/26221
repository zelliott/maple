We report on an 18-month-old Japanese girl with 46,XX,del(22)(q13.1q13.2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of interstitial deletion of a 22q13.1-q13.2 segment. Clinical features included hearing loss accompanied by inner ear anomalies, hypotonia and minor anomalies, such as a long philtrum, full eyelids, epicanthus, left transverse palmar crease and psychomotor developmental delay. Despite the chromosomal deletion, her physical growth was accelerated: her height was between the 75th and 90th percentiles for her age. Her brain MRI showed signs of delayed myelination. The three-dimensional MRI of the inner ear showed abnormalities of the cochlea and vestibule in both ears. Clinical features of the patient are similar to those of a patient with a del(22)(q13.1q13.33) karyotype previously reported by Romain et al.
