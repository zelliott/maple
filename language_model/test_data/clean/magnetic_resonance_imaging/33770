The Steel-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome (progressive supranuclear palsy: PSP) was described over a quarter of a century age. Although the full expressed form is very typical, it is overlooked due to unusual ways without axial dystonia and opthalmic signs, with akinesia and dysequilibrium. The many reports of PSP suggested that the abnormalities of it were vaster than Parkinson's disease. The abnormalities of neurotransmitters or neuromodulators were found not only dopamine system but also serotonin and acetylcholine system. On the basis of them, the various trials of neurotransmitter replacement were done without very successful results so far. Transplantation and nerve growth factor are also tried to treat PSP now.
