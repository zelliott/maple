Small cell carcinoma of the major salivary glands are very seldom. If there is such a tumor always have in mind that it can be a metastatic process of another small cell carcinoma in other locations of the body. That's why first of all a primary in the bronchial system has to be excluded with special diagnostics.

We present the case of a 72-year-old woman suffering from a small cell carcinoma of Parotid gland. Because a surgical therapy was impossible she underwent a radiotherapy.

First choice for therapy of tumors of the major salivary glands is surgical therapy in combination with radiation/chemotherapy. If this is not possible a primary radiotherapy sometimes in combination with chemotherapy seems to be another therapeutic option.
