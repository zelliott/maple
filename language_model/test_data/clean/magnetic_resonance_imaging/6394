Intramedullary dermoid tumors are unusual. Traditional methods of diagnosing spinal tumors have included clinical suspicion, plain roentgenography, myelography, and computed tomography. A case of intramedullary tumor provisionally diagnosed preoperatively by traditional methods and specifically as dermoid tumor with the assistance of magnetic resonance imaging is presented. Diagnosis and treatment of spinal dermoid tumors with an emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging is discussed.
