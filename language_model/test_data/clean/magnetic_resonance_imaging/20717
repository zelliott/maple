Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) impairment and cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) are associated in elderly or patients with overt cerebral ischemia. Such association has not been confirmed for asymptomatic middle-aged individuals with risk factors for stroke. We assessed the relationship between the CVR and the presence of WMLs in a middle-aged population-based cohort of hypertensive men.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) examination were performed in 54 hypertensive men, all at 60 years of age, without a history of stroke, neurologic deficits, or carotid stenosis. The CVR of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was expressed as the vasomotor reactivity reserve (VMRr).

WMLs were detected in 22 men (40.7%); all WMLs were classified as mild (first grade of the Fazekas modified scale). The VMRr was lower in patients with WMLs (mean 55%; s.e. 3%) compared to those without WMLs (mean 65%; s.e. 3%; P = 0.03). The lower VMRr in patients with WMLs was consistent after controlling for confounders. A higher pulsatility index (PI) in subjects with WMLs (mean 1.08; s.e. 0.05) compared to those without WMLs (mean 0.90; s.e. 0.05; P = 0.01) was not consistent after controlling for confounders.

The CVR was lower in middle-aged hypertensive men with WMLs compared to those without WMLs indicating that even a low load of WMLs may reflect some functional impairment of the cerebral microvasculature.
