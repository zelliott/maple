The authors describe an unusual case of an intradural cerebellar chordoma, the first such case to be reported in a child. A 9-year-old girl presented with headaches and papilloedema, and a discrete cerebellar mass was resected, which was shown histologically to be chordoma. There was no bony or dural association, and after radiologically proven complete resection it was elected that the child be followed expectantly.

The case is compared with the few previously reported intradural chordomas, and insights into the origins and management of such cases are discussed.
