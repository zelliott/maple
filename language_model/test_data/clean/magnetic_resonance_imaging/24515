The aim of this study was to compare the upper extremity musculoskeletal complications in the patients who had been receiving hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).

The patients who had been receiving HD (n=17) or CAPD (n=15) were included to the study. The age, gender, duration of dialysis were recorded. The physical findings related to musculoskeletal system in the upper extremity were researched. The cervical, shoulder, hand standard radiographies and shoulder magnetic resonance imaging were investigated.

The mean duration of HD and CAPD were 53.60 ± 36.03 and 49.17 ± 33.14 months, respectively (p=0.720). Only 6.3% of the CAPD group had signs of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). There were not any differences in the frequency of cervical destructive spondyloarthropathy, decreased height of vertebral corpus in the examination of cervical radiography (p=0.579) and also in the frequency of erosions in the humeral head and bones of hand, cyst in the clavicula, erosive osteoarthropathy and osteoporosis detected in the bones of hands (p> 0.005). In the examination of shoulder MR imaging, 80% of the HD group and 47.1% of the CAPD group had supraspinatus tendinitis (p=0.059). The frequency of subscapularis, biceps and infraspinatus tendinitis were not different in HD and CAPD groups (p> 0.05).

The musculoskeletal system complications of the upper extremity were common in the patients undergoing dialysis therapy. The most common complications were osteoporosis of the hand region and supraspinatus tendinitis.

Prospective, Level 2b.
