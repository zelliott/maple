Epidural fat is a reservoir of lipophilic substances that cushions the pulsatile movements of the dural sac, protects nerve structures, and facilitates the movement of the dural sac over the periosteum of the spinal canal during flexion and extension. Excessive epidural fat can compress the underlying structures, however, and affect the placement of catheters and the distribution of injected solutions. This review discusses changes in epidural fat related to various diseases and events: lipomatosis, epidural lymphoma, arachnoid cysts, epidural hematoma, meningiomas, angiolipomas, spondylolysis, scoliosis, spinal stenosis, and liposarcoma. Also discussed are the sequencing and protocols for magnetic resonance imaging that enable epidural fat to be observed and distinguished from neighboring structures. The relevance of epidural fat in spinal surgery is considered. Finally, we discuss the possible anesthetic implications of the abnormal deposition of epidural fat, to explain the unexpected complications that can arise during performance of epidural anesthesia.
