This study aimed to develop a 0.014-in., anti-solenoid loop (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging guidewire (MRIG) for intravascular 3.0-T MR imaging.

We first designed the ASL MRIG, which was made of a coaxial cable with its extended inner conductor and outer conductor connected to two micro-anti-solenoids. We then evaluated in vitro the functionality of the ASL MRIG by imaging a "vessel" in a phantom and achieving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and SNR contour map of the new 0.014-in. ASL MRIG. Subsequently, we validated in vivo the feasibility of using the ASL MRIG to generate intravenous 3.0-T MR images of parallel iliofemoral arteries of near-human-sized living pigs.

In vitro evaluation showed that the 0.014-in. ASL MRIG functioned well as a receiver coil with the 3.0-T MR scanner, clearly displaying the vessel wall with even distribution of MR signals and SNR contours from the ASL MRIG. Of the in vivo studies, the new ASL MRIG enabled us to successfully generate intravenous 3.0-T MR imaging of the iliofemoral arteries.

This study confirms that it is possible to build such small-looped MRIG at 0.014 in. for intravascular 3.0-T MR imaging.
