Cerebral hemorrhage, which is an important clinical problem, is often monitored and studied using expensive devices, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) that are unavailable in economically underdeveloped regions. Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) is a new type of non-contact, non-invasive, and low-cost detection technology, and exhibits prospects for wide application, especially for the detection of brain diseases. However, the previous studies on MIT have focused on laboratory models and rarely on in vivo applications because the induced signals produced by biological tissues are notably weak. Based on the symmetry between the two brain hemispheres and the fact that a local brain hemorrhage will not affect the contra-lateral hemisphere, a symmetric cancellation-type sensor detection system, which is characterized by one excitation coil and two receiving coils, was designed to improve the detection sensitivity of MIT. This method was subsequently used to detect the occurrence of cerebral hematomas in rabbits. The average phase drift induced by a 3-ml injection of autologous blood was 1.885Â°, which is a fivefold improvement compared with the traditional single excitation coil and single receiving coil method. The results indicate that this system has high sensitivity and anti-interference ability and high practical value.
