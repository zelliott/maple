The pathophysiology of focal spinal cord MRI T2 hyperintensity (SCHI) in patients with cervical spondylosis is uncertain. This study was undertaken to determine the frequency and cause of SCHI. The authors reviewed serial cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports and reviewed scans with spondylosis and cord compression or SCHI. The authors noted the location, shape, and extent of SCHI, and severity of spondylosis (expressed as a spondylosis score [SS]). The authors recorded the age and vascular risk factors for each patient. Nineteen of 273 scans (7%) with cervical spondylosis and 19 of 36 scans (53%) with cord compression had SCHI. The SCHI extended for one vertebral level from the compression in 12 patients and for three vertebral levels in 5 patients, and were distant from the compression in 2 patients. The SCHI had a focal, symmetrical, anterior spinal artery terminal zone location in 16 of 19 scans (84%). A rim isointense with normal cord separated all SCHI from the pial surface. Patients with SCHI were older (58.3 years +/- 12.8 years versus 46.8 +/- 8.1 years) (p = 0.007) and had a higher SS (5.7 +/- 2.4 versus 3.9 +/- 1.4) (p = 0.02) than patients without SCHI. The SCHI relates to the severity of cervical spondylosis. The anterior spinal artery territory location, the normal cord between SCHI and the compressive lesion, and the presence of SCHI at a distance from the compressive level all suggest an ischemic basis for SCHI.
