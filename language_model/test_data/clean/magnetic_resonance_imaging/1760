Nephron-sparing surgery of renal cell carcinoma in the 1970's and 1980's in patients with bilateral renal tumors or reduced renal function (imperative indication) has shown a very low risk of recurrent cancer. Today, nephron-sparing surgery in renal cell carcinoma is considered in an increasing number of patients with expected sufficient renal function after nephrectomy (elective indication). Resection technique, the use of Tabotamp(R) to reduce bleeding, and pseudotumors do complicate the interpretation of the images. It has been not yet defined which diagnostic modality is best suited for follow-up after renal cell carcinoma resection. Follow-up protocols in different institutions show a wide variety. The follow-up of patients after nephron-sparing surgery is performed by annual sonography or MRI every three months. Up to now, CT and ultrasound are the standard methods. MRI with its multiplanar imaging and improved soft tissue contrast seems to have an equal diagnostic value. Additionally, MRI seems to be suited for patients with reduced renal function. The aim of this paper is to give guidelines for the radiologist to understand the different surgical procedures and to evaluate the postoperative findings. Different imaging modalities in the follow-up of patients and special radiological phenomena are discussed.
