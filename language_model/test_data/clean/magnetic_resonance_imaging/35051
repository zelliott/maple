Rare papers focusing on spinal hemangioblastoma, especially with large clinical series, had been published before. In our hospital, there are 68 cases of spinal hemangioblastoma treated surgically. We analysed their clinical materials retrospectively.

The clinical characteristics, the relationship between the tumor and spine, the anatomical segments, and surgical outcome of the 68 spinal hemangioblastoma patients were analysed.

In our series, the operative mortality was 0. In 60.4% of those patients with single lesion, their clinical symptoms improved significantly after surgery; while the similar improvement was found in 35% of those patients with multiple lesions.

For single spinal hemangioblastoma, the surgical outcome is quite satisfied. For those patients with multiple lesion caused by VHL diseases, surgical outcome is also acceptable.
