Technetium-99mWBC SPECT and contrast material enhanced MRI were used for the diagnostics of mild myocarditis. The use of labeled leukocytes and paramagnetic contrast agent allow visualizing inflammation of myocardium and assessing the efficacy of treatment. 49 patients aged 14 to 49 years old were studied. Case presentation demonstrates high information and diagnostic value of used methods.
