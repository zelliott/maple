To define magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography imaging findings of matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) grafts of the knee in order to describe implant behaviour and to compare findings with validated clinical scores 30 and 60 months after MACI implant.

Thirteen patients were recruited (10 male, 3 female) with a total number of 15 chondral lesions. Each patient underwent an MACI procedure and MR arthrography 30 and 60 months after surgery. MR arthrography was performed using a dedicated coil with a 1.5-Tesla unit. The status of the chondral implant was evaluated with the modified MOCART scoring scale. The lining of the implant, the integration to the border zone, the surface and structure of the repaired tissue were assessed, and the presence of bone marrow oedema and effusion was evaluated. For clinical assessment, the Cincinnati score was used.

At 60 months, the abnormality showed worsening in 1 out of 15 cases. Integration showed improvement in 3 out of 15 cases, and worsening in 3 out of 15 cases. Two surfaces of the implant showed further deterioration at 60 months, and 1 afflicted implant fully recovered after the same time interval. Implant contrast enhancement at 30 months was seen in 2 out of 15 cases, 1 of which recovered at 60 months. According to the MOCART score, 4 cases were rated 68.4 out of 75 at 30 months and 65 out of 75 at 60 months. The mean clinical score decreased from 8.6 out of 10 at 30 months to 8.1 out of 10 at 60 months.

Magnetic resonance arthrography improved the evaluation of implants and facilitated the characterisation of MACI integration with contiguous tissues. The follow-up showed significant changes in MACI, even at 60 months, allowing for useful long-term MR evaluations.
