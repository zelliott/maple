Gestational choriocarcinoma is a rare malignant tumour with a strong metastatic potential. We report a case of a 31-year-old patient with a gestational trophoblastic tumor revealed by renal and pulmonary metastases, one year after a normal pregnancy. The diagnosis was established by the pathologist on the radical nephrectomy specimen. The evolution was quickly favorable after adequate treatment using multiagent chemotherapy. This case highlights the polymorphic aspects of the gestational choriocarcinoma and stresses the importance of a betaHCG assessment anytime abnormal symptoms occur in the outcome of a pregnancy.
