Tuberculosis is an infectious disease with a decreasing incidence in Germany. In particular, the occurrence of reinfections and possible complications associated with this disease, such as tuberculous meningitis/encephalitis and Landouzy sepsis are rare in industrial countries. In this article the intensive care treatment of a patient who initially underwent surgery for spinal stenosis is reported. Due to recurrent appearance of neurological symptoms with increasing severity and abscess formation in the spine, further surgery was performed. Additionally, the patient developed sepsis and meningitis. At this time an infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis could be detected in both cerebrospinal fluid and abscess material of the spine suggesting a Landouzy sepsis, tuberculous meningitis/encephalitis and the suspicion of an underlying Pott's disease.
