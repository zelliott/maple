Primary epiploic appendagitis (PEA) occurs secondary to inflammation of an epiploic appendage, and is considered to be a rare cause of acute abdomen. In this case report, we describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of PEA correlated with computed tomographic (CT) findings. MRI findings included an oval shaped fat intensity mass with a central dot on T1- and T2-weighted images, which possessed an enhancing rim on postgadolinium T1-weighted fat saturated images. The lesion was best visualized on postcontrast T1-weighted fat saturated images. MRI findings of PEA should be considered in the differential diagnosis with the other causes of acute abdominal pain.
