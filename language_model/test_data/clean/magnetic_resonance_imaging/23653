Although 8-10 Gy of external radiation therapy for +HIV associated parotid hypertrophy has achieved high response rates, the responses were transient with only 1/12 of patients retaining cosmetic control at median follow-up procedures of 9.5 months. Retreatment for failures after 8-10 Gy has also been unsatisfactory. Having shown that 24 Gy of external radiation therapy for benign parotid hypertrophy produced more durable cosmetic control than 8-10 Gy, we now report on longer follow-up periods on a group of patients receiving 24 Gy.

Twenty +HIV patients with clinical and radiographic evidence of lymphoepithelial lesions of the parotid were treated with 24 Gy of external radiation therapy using daily 1.5 Gy fractions; parallel opposed technique and 6 MV photons were used in 19 patients, and unilateral electron treatment was performed for one patient.

With a mean follow-up period of 24 months, the cosmetic control appears durable. We have had no late failures past 24 months. Two patients have complained of modest xerostomia. There was no correlation with size of the cyst and eventual cosmetic result.

Twenty-four Gy produces durable parotid control for HIV associated lymphoepithelial lesions of the parotid glands in +HIV patients. Failures after 2 years are uncommon and the side effects have been tolerable.
