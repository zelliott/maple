Hemangiopericytoma is a rare vascular tumor, usually occurring in adults. The tumor is believed to originate from pericytes, the contractile cells surrounding capillaries. It has predilection for the musculoskeletal system. Clinically, the tumor occurs at any age, with highest incidence between the third and sixth decades and without any sex predilection. Head and neck hemangiopericytoma incidence in all age groups ranges from 9.4 to 28%. In children, head and neck hemangiopericytoma is as frequent as 35%, with the highest frequency (46%) found in infants. We report a case of hemangiopericytoma of the tongue in a 6-year-old child resembling to the infantile/congenital type, which was treated by a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and brachytherapy. This approach has resulted in a normal functioning tongue for the past 5 years.
