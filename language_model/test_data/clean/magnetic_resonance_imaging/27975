In 15 patients, impotent as a result of prostatomembranous urethral disruption consequent to pelvic crush injuries, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and duplex ultrasound were used to establish anatomical and pathophysiological criteria for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. All patients were initially treated by suprapubic cystostomy diversion for at least 3 months, after which urethral reconstruction was performed. All men were potent before the pelvic trauma, with loss of sexual function immediately thereafter. Preoperative MRI demonstrated prostatic displacement in 13 cases (86.7%) and cavernous injury in 12 (80%). Duplex ultrasound revealed the cause of erectile failure as vasculogenic in 12 patients (80%) and neurogenic in 3 (20%). Treatment of impotence was deferred for at least 18 months after injury. Of the neurogenic group 2 patients were started on intracavernous injection therapy and 1 refused treatment. Of the vasculogenic group 3 patients underwent successful revascularization, 2 are on injection therapy and 1 had a penile prosthesis inserted. The detailed anatomical information obtainable with pelvic MRI and the functional data provided by duplex ultrasonography enabled us to identify the individual organic components of posttraumatic impotence and to select effective cause-specific therapy.
