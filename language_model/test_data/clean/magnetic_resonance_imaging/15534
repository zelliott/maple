Merkel cells carcinoma (MCC) is an uncommon skin lesion, considered a malignancy of the neuroendocrine system, which is found mainly in elderly people. Its incidence is highly correlated with sun exposure or immunodeficiency syndromes. MCC is often an aggressive tumour with high tendency for local recurrence, lymph node involvement and distant metastasis. To our best knowledge 20 cases originated from the auricle have been described, 2 of them arising from external ear canal. The authors report a case of the ear canal characterized by two others synchronous tumours and the occurrence of a malignant high grade lymphoma, in which contribute of the pathologist was essential for a critical review. MCC diagnosis is not always easy for its pathological and clinical features and it should always be considered in presence of lymphoma. A multidisciplinary approach is basic.
