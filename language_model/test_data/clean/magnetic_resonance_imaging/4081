Serous surface papillary carcinoma (SSPC) is a malignant tumor originating from the surface epithelium of the ovary, and is characterized by macroscopic normal ovaries accompanied by diffuse peritoneal dissemination. Therefore diagnosis of SSPC cannot usually be made preoperatively. We report on two cases of SSPC in which US, CT, and MR demonstrated nodularities along the surface of the normal-sized ovaries, adjacent organs and pelvic peritoneum in addition to findings of peritoneal seeding. These imaging findings may suggest the correct preoperative diagnosis of SSPC.
