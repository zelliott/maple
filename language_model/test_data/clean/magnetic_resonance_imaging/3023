We report the cases of two children who underwent CT, MR, MRA and angiography in the diagnosis of postoperative aneurysmal dilatation of the supraclinoid carotid arteries following surgical resection of craniopharyngioma. Craniopharyngiomas are relatively common lesions, accounting for 6-7% of brain tumors in children. They are histologically benign, causing symptoms by their growth within the sella and suprasellar cistern with compression of adjacent structures, especially the pituitary gland, hypothalamus and optic nerves, chiasm, and tracts. Complete surgical resection, particularly of large tumors, is complicated by the fact that the lesions are usually found within the circle of Willis, with displacement and adherence to the adventitia of these vessels [1, 2]. Recent reports in the neurosurgical literature have described aneurysmal dilatation of the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries following aggressive surgical resection of craniopharyngioma [3, 4].
