Patients who have haemophilia often present with joint problems. Haemarthrosis can occur spontaneously or after minor trauma. Later, degenerative changes can cause pain and loss of motion. Avascular necrosis of the talus has a high incidence after serious trauma. Furthermore, avascular necrosis of the talus has been associated with multiple systemic conditions. The association of haemophilia and avascular necrosis of the femoral head has been described. This study reports three cases (four ankles) where we suspect an avascular necrosis of the talus in children with haemophilia. To the authors' knowledge, the possible association of haemophilia and avascular necrosis of the talus has not yet been described in children.
