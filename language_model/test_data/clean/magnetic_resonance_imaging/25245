Research is needed to assess the validity of the Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (CDC/TMD). The purpose of this study was to test the reliability of the clinical diagnosis of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) degenerative joint disease (DJD) as compared with the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 'gold standard'. The TMJ DJD group comprised 48 joints in 24 consecutive patients who were assigned a clinical bilateral diagnosis of TMJ DJD. The TMJ non-DJD group consisted of 82 joints in 41 consecutive patients without a TMJ-related diagnosis of TMD. Bilateral sagittal and coronal MR images were obtained subsequently to establish the corresponding diagnosis of degenerative joint changes. An MRI diagnosis of osteoarthrosis (OA) was defined by the presence of flattening, subchondral sclerosis, surface irregularities, and erosion of the condyle or presence of condylar deformities associated with flattening, subchondral sclerosis, surface irregularities, erosion and osteophyte. For the CDC/TMD interpretations, the positive predictive of DJD for OA was 67%, and for the presence of degenerative joint changes 88%. The overall diagnostic agreement for DJD was 44.6% with a corresponding K-value of 0.01. Most of the disagreement was due to false-negative interpretations of asymptomatic joints. The results suggest CDC/TMD to be predictive for degenerative joint changes but insufficient for determination of OA. Patients assigned a clinical TMJ-related diagnosis of DJD may need to be supplemented by evidence from MRI to determine the presence or absence of OA.
