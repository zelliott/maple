Cushing's disease resulting from intrasellar gangliocytomas is very rare and only three cases have been reported to date. All of the cases were female. We present a fourth case of Cushing's disease resulting from intrasellar gangliocytoma. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed a pituitary macrotumor with suprasellar extension. A greenish-gray colored homogenous tumor was subtotally removed by a transcranial approach. Histological diagnosis was gangliocytoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported instance of a tumor causing Cushing's disease in a man in the absence of a pituitary adenoma component.
