Several studies have now demonstrated that the motor cortical representations are dynamically maintained in both normal and brain-injured animals. Functional plasticity in the motor cortex of normal animals is accompanied by changes in synaptic morphology; these changes are skill-dependent rather than simply use-dependent. Finally, motor cortical areas undergo substantial functional alterations after focal ischemic infarcts; motor experience is a potent and adaptive modulator of injury-related plasticity. These recent neuroscientific advances set the stage for the development of new, more effective interventions in chronic stroke populations that are based on the basic mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity.
