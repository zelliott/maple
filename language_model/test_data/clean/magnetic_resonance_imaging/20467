Moebius syndrome is a rare disease characterized by congenital facial paralysis and abducens palsy. Involvement of other cranial nerves, orofacial dysmorphism, and limb abnormalities are frequently associated. Reported here is the case of a 10-month-old child born with Moebius syndrome and presenting with holoprosencephaly, following exposure in utero to misoprostol. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report describing this association. The etiologic hypotheses of Moebius syndrome are also discussed.
