Five cases of children with cerebrovascular disease presentations to the emergency department (ED) were selected as a series to illustrate the variety of presentation of cerebrovascular disease in children. This series shows that although cerebrovascular disease in children is uncommon, it is likely that cases will occasionally present acutely to an ED. The emergency physician's role in the management of suspected acute strokes in children is that of immediate stabilization, imaging to rule out hemorrhage, other studies to rule out emergent acute disease, and timely consultation for further management. Computed tomography (CT) is useful to detect an acute hemorrhage or old ischemic lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging has superior image resolution over CT, but CT may be more practical initially. Magnetic resonance angiography is a useful part of the stroke workup in children.
