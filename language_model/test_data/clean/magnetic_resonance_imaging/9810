To compare two MR sequences at 1.5 T-T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images-by using macroscopic sections to determine which image type enables the most accurate assessment of cervical carcinoma.

Forty consecutive patients (mean age, 39.2 years) with biopsy-proven cervical carcinoma were included. Each MR sequence was assessed for tumour localisations, tumour margins, and cancer extent with the consensus of two readers, and tumour margins were rated on a five-point scale. MR findings were correlated with histopathological findings. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) obtained with each image were compared using nonparametric tests.

Thirty-one of 40 patients underwent hysterectomies and nine of 40 underwent trachelectomies. In 36 patients, lesions were identified on at least one sequence. The tumours at stage 1B or higher were detected in 94.7% on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images and in 76.3% on T2-weighted images (P < 0.05). Tumour margins appeared significantly more distinct on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images than on T2-weighted images (P < 0.001). The CNRs obtained using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those obtained using T2-weighted images.

Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging is more useful for assessing cervical carcinoma than T2-weighted imaging.
