One-dimensional composite Mn-Fe oxide nanostructures of different sizes (nanoneedles, nanorods, and nanowires) were prepared by a linker-induced organization of manganese-doped iron oxide nanoparticles. The nanostructures were obtained by the treatment of MnFe(2)O(4) nanoparticles in the presence of cystamine. The average lengths of nanoneedle, nanorod, and nanowire are approximately 400, 800, and 1000 nm, respectively. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) were employed to characterize the morphologies and the elemental contents of the nanostructures. As an example of their potential applications, these nanostructures were explored as the cell-labeling agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The magnetic contrast properties of the nanostructures were characterized by a 1.5 T (Tesla) whole body MR system. 10 microg/mL of the nanostructures caused substantial negative contrast. After in vitro incubation, the nanostructures could be effectively incorporated into the cells of a monocyte/macrophage cell line (RAW264.7). These cells' viability and proliferation potential were not affected when the labeling concentration was less than 50 microg/mL.
