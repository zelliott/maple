Recirculating and detached flow patterns close to the carotid bifurcation are thought to play an important role in the development of carotid stenoses by promoting atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to investigate a flow regime with strong transient characteristics, including vortex shedding and transport to develop methodologies appropriate to the analysis of carotid stenoses. The existence of a regular periodic vortex street behind a cylindrical flow obstruction was predicted and analysed in detail by Theodore van Karman in the early 20th century. This model was chosen in our study for both ease of phantom construction and of theoretical modelling using finite element computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results of the theoretical calculations have been compared with two methods of flow visualization-laser sheet imaging and real-time echo planar magnitude MR imaging. Flow was investigated over a range of Reynold's number from 40 through 400 through which vortex shedding is predicted. Good overall agreement was obtained between the theoretical (16 mm-CFD) and experimental (16+/-2 mm-Laser, 17+/-2 mm-MRI) estimates of the Karman Vortex street wavelength for a Reynolds number of 200.
