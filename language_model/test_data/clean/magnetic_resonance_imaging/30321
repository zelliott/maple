Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in 32 patients recently clinically diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) by McDonald's criteria are presented. Demyelinization plaques were examined according to their number, size and location in brain tissue. Classification was done by Frederiksen's quantification. The study included 18 (56.3%) female and 1-4 (43.7%) male patients aged 17-44, mean 32 +/- 2.4 years. The predominant plaque location was periventricular (100%), involving lateral brain chambers, followed by subcortical, pontine, corpus callosum, cerebellar and other locations (medulla oblongata, spinal marrow). According to plaque number, patients were divided into six groups, from 2-6 plaques (group 1), to 26 lesions (divided into four subgroups). Patients with at least one plaque 15 mm in diameter were allocated to a separate group. The largest was the group with 7-15 plaques (37%). According to plaque size, patients were divided into three groups: plaque of up to 6 mm in diameter, 6-15 mm in diameter, and at least one plaque 15 mm in diameter. Patients with plaque size 6-15 mm were found to predominate (64%). There was a surprisingly high incidence of severe brain damage, i. e. higher degrees by Frederiksen's quantification. The third and fourth quantification degrees were most common, with a significant number of plaques not exceeding 15 mm in diameter; however, there also were been patients with plaques of 15 mm in diameter, which is quite surprising at this early stage of the disease. This pilot study indicated that research should be extended to patients newly clinically diagnosed with MS, comparing their clinical symptoms and Frederiksen's quantification.
