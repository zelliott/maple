Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune-mediated disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). Disease typically starts with an abrupt onset of neurologic symptoms and signs within days to weeks after a viral infection or immunization. Neuropathological examination of the CNS in ADEM reveals involvement of white matter, with infiltration of monocytoid cells and perivenous demyelination.
