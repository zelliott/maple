Sinus mucoceles are benign and expansive pseudocystic formations situated in the paranasal sinuses. Their pathogenicity is still misunderstood. Clinical signs are multiple and often delayed due to tumour localisation. CT-scan is the best diagnostical investigation and surgery the treatment of choice. Marsupialization under endoscopic control is becoming widespread.
