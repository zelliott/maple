The correlation between scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and activation measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging in a dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (DLPFC) activating task was examined in 15 MDMA-using subjects and 19 controls. A significant correlation between BIS scores and DLPFC activation was found, supporting a role for the DLPFC in BIS-measured impulsivity.
