The visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (AT) areas and the subcutaneous hip AT area were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in relation to serum lipid and plasma insulin levels in 12 growth hormone-deficient (GHD) adults before and after 6 months of replacement therapy with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) and in 12 healthy control subjects. Compared with control subjects, GHD patients had a significantly increased amount of visceral AT, which was inversely related with plasma HDL cholesterol and positively correlated with plasma triglyceride levels. Visceral AT was not associated with plasma total and LDL cholesterol or plasma insulin concentrations. GHD patients also had elevated serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels compared with control subjects. After 6 months of rhGH replacement therapy the mean visceral, subcutaneous abdominal, and subcutaneous hip AT areas and serum concentration of total cholesterol decreased significantly, whereas serum HDL cholesterol concentration increased significantly. No significant correlations were found between changes in the amount of AT and changes in serum lipid and plasma insulin levels.
