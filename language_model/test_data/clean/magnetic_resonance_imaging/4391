Wandering spleen is the term commonly applied to splenic hypermobility that results from laxity or maldevelopment of its suspensory ligaments. It comes to medical attention usually as an abdominal mass, or when the spleen undergoes torsion. Diagnosis on clinical grounds alone is rarely made, and ultrasonography, CT and MRI findings have no specific characteristics for this condition. 99mTc-labeled colloid taken up by the spleen may provide a specific diagnosis. We report a case of wandering spleen, in which the preoperative diagnosis was made on the basis of sequential liver-spleen scintigraphy with 99mTc-Sn-colloid and blood-pool scintigraphy with 99mTc-RBC. This is a rare case, in which hypermobility was assessed by sequential 99mTc-Sn-colloid scintigraphy, and to our knowledge, is the first case in which 99mTc-RBC scintigraphy provided useful information on splenic blood volume and its location.
