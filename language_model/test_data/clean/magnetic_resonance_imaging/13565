The authors report the unusual case of a 58-year-old woman (MJP) suffering from left temporal throbbing headache, associated with confusion. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 5 x 3 x 2 cm hematoma at the left posterior temporal--parietal junction (PTPJ). Repeated MRI of MJP's brain performed during a 4-month follow-up period showed decrease in hematoma size (2.3 x 1.5 x 1) with evidence for development of encephalomalacia and resorption of blood products involving the area of hemorrhage. MJP had mild transcortical sensory aphasia characterized by difficulty with reading and processing, with semantic paraphasic errors while speaking and some difficulty with repetition. MJP had remained normotensive and seizure free, on Vasotec therapy and Dilantin prophylaxis. An in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) performed during an 8-month follow-up period showed reduced concentration for N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) by 19.3% (F=4.09, P<0.04), and myo-inositol by 32.0% (F=5.16, P<0.02) in the left orbital frontal cortex (OFC) as compared with 16 healthy subjects (age- and sex-matched). Cognitive tests (the Wechsler abbreviated scale of intelligence (WASI) and the Stroop color--word interference) showed a significant impairment suggesting involvement of higher-order cognitive functioning (memory, learning, and general intelligence) and attentional system. The Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) showed increased anxiety at the moment of the current examination and decreased tendency to be anxious over a long period of time. The Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory revealed minimal anxiety and mild to moderate levels of depression. It is hypothesized that the PTPJ hematoma triggered long-distance pathways linking PTPJ area and frontal lobe, including OFC, which resulted in abnormal chemical changes in the left OFC and in cognitive tests impairment, and in long-term anxiety state changes.
