Strain-encoded magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was prospectively evaluated for direct imaging of systolic myocardial strain and compared with cross-registered delayed contrast material-enhanced MR imaging in five healthy volunteers and nine patients with infarction. Local contractile performance was decreased in infarcted myocardium versus that in remote and adjacent myocardium (P < .01) and in adjacent versus remote myocardium (P < .05). The extent of dysfunctional myocardium, as assessed with strain-encoded MR imaging, was greater than that of hyperenhancement, as assessed with delayed contrast-enhanced MR imaging (P < .05). Strain values obtained with strain-encoded MR imaging were strongly correlated with those obtained with three-dimensional tagged MR imaging (r = 0.75, P < .001). Strain-encoded MR imaging provides spatially resolved (1.5 x 2.5-mm) imaging and measurement of myocardial strain in humans without the need for postprocessing, which may improve routine comprehensive evaluation of myocardial viability.
