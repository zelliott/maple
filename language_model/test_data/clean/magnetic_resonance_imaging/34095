To evaluate native and contrast enhanced T1-weighted spin (T1-SE), cine gradient echo (Cine-GE), and T2-weighted turbo spin (T2-TSE) sequences in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of cardiac myxomas.

15 patients with echocardiographically suspected cardiac atrial myxomas underwent 0.5 T-MR imaging of the heart with native T1-SE, contrast-enhanced T1-SE, Cine-GE, and T2-TSE sequences. MR images were evaluated for signal intensity (SI) and lesion's conspicuity. Results were confirmed histologically (14 x) or by follow-up (1 x).

MRI revealed myxomas in 9 patients, sarcomas in three patients, and thrombi in three patients. Lesion conspicuity was better in Cine-GE and T2-TSE compared with native and contrast-enhanced T1-SE sequences. Myxomas were characterized by an intermediate SI similar to myocardium in T1-SE, high SI similar to water in T2-TSE, and low to moderately high enhancement (range 19-75%, mean 48%).

Distinct SI characteristics together with anatomical-topographical features (attachment to the interatrial septum, no infiltration of myocardium and vessels) are diagnostic for cardiac myxomas. Cine-GE and T2-TSE sequences are the sequences of choice for detection of myxomas and other atrial masses. T2-TSE and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences are most useful for mass characterisation and differentiation between myxomas, malignant tumors, and thrombi.
