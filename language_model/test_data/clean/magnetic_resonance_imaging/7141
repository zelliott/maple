At present, the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is shown to be unreliable. In the absence of any laboratory or blood test, a study of the brain configuration using Magnetic Resonance Imaging, can help to demonstrate the differential atrophy involving the temporal lobe more than elsewhere, which is present in the majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease. Area measurements have been obtained in the coronal slice and comparison made between 20 controls and 10 patients suffering from early dementia.
