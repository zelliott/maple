To audit the accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) staging of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in daily reporting, the MR images of 101 adult patients with newly diagnosed NPC reported between December 1996 and February 2002 were reviewed retrospectively. Based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer (AJCC/UICC) TNM staging criteria (1997), the tumour staging obtained from the MR reports and the MR films was compared by two experienced head and neck radiologists. The number of patients being upstaged, downstaged or unchanged was noted. In all stages, the NPC staging obtained from the MR reports revealed 18 (17.8%) understaged, eight (7.9%) overstaged and 75 (74.2%) the same stage when compared to the staging obtained from the MR films based on the AJCC/UICC criteria. The percentage of patients being understaged or overstaged, in decreasing order of frequency, were stages II, III, IV and I. Magnetic resonance of NPC should be reported by radiologists who are not only familiar with the pathology of this condition and its pattern of spread but who should also base their reports on the AICC/UICC staging criteria. The necessity to improve our MR staging accuracy is largely because it determines the type of therapy to be given and this has to be appropriate and adequate for a successful treatment.
