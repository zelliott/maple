Despite optimization of medical therapy, a large number of patients with Parkinson's disease continue to be disabled. For this group, alternate treatment strategies such as neurosurgical intervention can be considered. Recent advances in neurosurgical techniques and in understanding the pathophysiology of motor disturbances in PD have made surgery safer and more effective. Functional neurosurgical procedures to lesion or electrically modulate dysfunctional basal ganglia circuits or to protect or restore dopaminergic transmission are being increasingly used. These procedures are having a profound impact on the motor disturbances of PD and are producing important improvements in quality of life of patients.
