Injuries related to participation in golf are becoming more common given the increasing popularity of the sport itself. Golf is considered to be an activity associated with a moderate risk for sports injuries. Golf injuries are usually attributable to overuse or traumatic mechanisms and primarily occur at the elbow, wrist, shoulder, and lumbar spine. None of these injuries are unique to golf, but each of these injuries represent the most common injuries associated with golfing. This article reviews a wide range of injuries that are encountered in golfers and describes the magnetic resonance imaging findings of each of these injuries.
