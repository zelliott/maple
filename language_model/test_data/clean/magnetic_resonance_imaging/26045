A 58-years-old man, with no medical past history, was examined for abdominal pain and weight loss. An enlarged kidney could be palpated, and abdominal echography showed left hydronephrosis due to ureteral compression by abdominal aortic aneurysm. Laboratory data showed an inflammatory syndrome. CT scan suggested the diagnosis of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. The use of corticosteroids brought about the regression of the symptoms and the resolution of the ureteral obstruction, permitting aneurysmectomy and prosthesis replacement without ureterolysis. This report shows the interest of preoperative radiological diagnosis of the inflammatory character of abdominal aneurysm. For uncomplicated cases, preoperative treatment using corticosteroids could allow partial regression of the periaortic inflammation and easier surgical repair.
