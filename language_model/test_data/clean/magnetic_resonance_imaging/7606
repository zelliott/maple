The aorta plays a major role in the cardiovascular system and its function and structure are primarily affected by aging, eating habits, life style and other cardiovascular risk factors, inducing increased stiffness which is associated with cardiovascular and cerebral morbi-mortality. Our objective was to develop and validate a robust subject-specific one-dimensional wave propagation numerical model of the descending aorta. This model with a cross-sectional area, velocity and pressure formulation is built using geometric and hemodynamic data measured on a specific person and is validated against in vivo data acquired on the same subject at three distinct anatomical locations along the thoracic aorta. We studied seven healthy volunteers, who underwent carotid applanation tonometry and aortic cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Responses of our model in terms of changes in central pressure waveform with arterial alterations were consistent with previously described physiological knowledge. Quantitative validation averaged over the three descending aortic locations and the seven subjects provided low rms errors (given in percentage of the maximal clinical value) between simulated and CMR data, i.e. area: 10±6%, velocity: 11±3%, flow rate: 9±3%. Finally, we also found low rms (5±2%) when comparing simulated pressure in the proximal aortic location against tonometric carotid pressure curves. In conclusion, this simple model performs similar to more complex models of the entire systemic arterial tree at a fraction of the cost, and could be of major usefulness in the non-invasive and local estimation of proximal biomechanical and hemodynamic indices.
