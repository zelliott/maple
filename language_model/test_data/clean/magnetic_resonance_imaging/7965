We assessed the accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) in monitoring response to therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) using ileocolonoscopy as a reference standard.

We performed a prospective multicenter study of 48 patients with active CD and ulcers in at least one ileocolonic segment. All patients underwent ileocolonoscopy and MRE at baseline and 12 weeks after completing treatment with corticosteroids (CS) or anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. Disease activity was quantified using Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) and Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA). The primary analysis was to determine the accuracy of MRE in identification of healing, defined as the disappearance of ulcers in endoscopy examination. Additional analyses established the accuracy of MRE in determining endoscopic remission (a CDEIS score <3.5) and change in severity based on consideration of all segments.

MRE determined ulcer healing with 90% accuracy and endoscopic remission with 83% accuracy. The mean CDEIS and MaRIA scores significantly changed at week 12 in segments with ulcer healing, based on endoscopic examination (CDEIS: 21.28 ± 9.10 at baseline vs 2.73 ± 4.12 at 12 weeks; P < .001 and MaRIA: 18.86 ± 9.50 at baseline vs 8.73 ± 5.88 at 12 weeks; P < .001). The MaRIA score accurately detected changes in lesion severity (Guyatt score: 1.2 and standardized effect size: 1.07). MRE was as reliable as endoscopy in assessing healing; no significant changes in CDEIS or MaRIA scores were observed in segments with persistent ulcers, based on endoscopic examination (CDEIS: 26.43 ± 9.06 at baseline vs 20.77 ± 9.13 at 12 weeks; P = .18 and MaRIA: 22.13 ± 8.42 at baseline vs 20.77 ± 9.17 at 12 weeks; P = .42). The magnitude of change in CDEIS scores correlated with those in MaRIA scores (r = 0.51; P < .001).

MRE evaluates ulcer healing with a high level of accuracy when ileocolonoscopy is used as the reference standard. The MaRIA is a valid, responsive, and reliable index assessing response to therapy in patients with CD.
