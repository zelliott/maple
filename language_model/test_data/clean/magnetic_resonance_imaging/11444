Eikenella corrodens is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rod that frequently exists as part of normal human flora in the upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. Recently, E. corrodens is reported as a rare causative agent of empyematic lesion. We report a case of 10-year-old girl with acute subdural abscess. She developed a high grade fever, swelling of the left periorbital area, right sided partial seizure and hemiplegia. Brain CT and MRI showed left parietal subdural abscess. Because intravenous antibiotic therapy was not effective enough and her neurological symptoms progressed, surgical drainage was performed in order to decompress the brain and to determine the causative agents. Through careful bacterial cultures, E. corrodens and Streptococcus constellatus were detected from the subdural abscess. After the drainage operation and a three week course of appropriate chemotherapy, the abscess completely disappeared and no sequela remained.
