To investigate the correlation between the magnetic resonance imaging findings and subsequent surgical findings for a series of dogs presenting with suspected pharyngeal stick injuries to the Animal Health Trust, Newmarket, between 1995 and 2004.

Magnetic resonance imaging findings were reviewed for patients undergoing a scan of the pharyngeal or cervical area for suspected foreign bodies during the years 1995 to 2004.

Case signalment, history and clinical signs were similar to those reported in previous studies. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated foreign material in six of seven cases where this was present. There was good correlation between diagnosis of a foreign body at magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent surgical identification.

Compared with other imaging modalities, magnetic resonance imaging is very helpful for this type of injury, especially in chronic cases where radiographic evidence of a foreign body is unlikely. It is a valuable aid in the diagnosis of pharyngeal penetration injury and in surgical planning.
