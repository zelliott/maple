The authors have developed a novel sterile draped touch display solution for convenient intraoperative access to imaging data. This study describes the technology and clinical experience of the system.

We developed a flexible, mounted touch display solution (Apple iPad) that allows fixation of the display on the operation microscope and fine adjustments during surgery when the microscope is moved. We compared this setup with a conventional wall-mounted flat-panel and a mobile display stand in illustrative cases of vestibular schwannoma.

The surgeon was able to employ the system without the need to leave the operation field or the need for external assistance while referring to imaging data. Commanding through imaging data with sterile gloves on the touch display was more convenient, more precise, and faster compared with other modalities.

The operation-microscope-mounted touch display provides useful assistance for intraoperative imaging visualization in neurosurgical procedures.
