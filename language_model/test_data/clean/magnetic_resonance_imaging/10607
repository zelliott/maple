Knowledge of hind foot bone motion is important for understanding gait as well as various foot pathologies, but the three-dimensional (3D) motion of these bones remains incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to quantify the motion of the talus, calcaneus, navicular, and cuboid in normal adult feet during open chain quasi-static uniplanar plantar flexion motion. Magnetic resonance images of the right feet of six normal young adult males were taken from which 3D virtual models were made of each hind foot bone. The 3D motion of these models was analyzed. Each hind foot bone rotated in the same plane about half as much as the foot (mean 0.54 degrees of bone rotation per degree of foot motion, range 0.40-0.73 degrees per degree of foot motion as measured relative to the fixed tibia). Talar motion was primarily uniaxial, but the calcaneus, navicular, and cuboid bones exhibited biplanar (sometimes triplanar) translation in addition to biaxial rotation. Net translational motions of these bones averaged 0.39 mm of bone translation per degree of foot motion (range 0.06-0.62 mm per degree of foot motion). These data reflect the functional anatomy of the foot, extend the findings of prior studies, provide a standard for comparison to patients with congenital or acquired foot deformities, and establish an objective reference for quantitatively assessing the efficacy of various hind foot therapies.
