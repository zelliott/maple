High-resolution magnetic resonance image makes it possible to examine the radiological anatomy of the orbital portion of the optic nerve in patients with papilledema. The longitudinal diameters of the orbital portion of the optic nerve and its subarachnoidal space were measured on coronal images just behind the eyeball, in the middle of the latter and the orbital apex, and at the orbital apex in 10 healthy volunteers and 20 patients with papilledema. In patients with papilledema, the diameter of the subarachnoidal space of the optic nerve was increased as compared with that in the control group. In its moderate form, that of the optic nerve was significantly increased as compared to the control group. In patients with severe papilledema and secondary atrophy, the diameter of the optic nerve just behind the eyeball was significantly less than that in patients with moderate papilledema. It may be suggested that elevated intracranial pressure leads to the dilated subarachnoidal space of the optic nerve. The clinical and X-ray signs of atrophy of the optic nerve are detectable in patients with severe papilledema and secondary atrophy.
