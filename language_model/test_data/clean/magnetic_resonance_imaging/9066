Encephalitis with anti-NMDA receptor antibodies is a recently-recognised form of paraneoplastic encephalitis characterized by a prodromal phase of unspecific illness with fever resembling viral disease, followed by memory loss, psychiatric features, seizures, disturbed consciousness, prominent abnormal movements and autonomic imbalance. Association with ovarian teratoma is common. Neurological outcome can be good, especially when surgery is performed at an early stage. Here, we report a case of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis associated with ovarian teratoma presenting with inaugural complex partial status epilepticus. The nature of abnormal movements at early stages was unclear and abnormal movements were misinterpreted as the recurrence of partial epileptic seizures. Despite its rarity, all clinicians treating epilepsy and movement disorders should be familiar with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, that appears to be a very severe but curable disease.
