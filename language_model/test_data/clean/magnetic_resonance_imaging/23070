Since the first patients underwent intracranial tumor removal with the radicality control of intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) in September 2005 in our department, the majority of operations performed in the ioMRI room have been indicated for high grade gliomas. In order to elucidate the role of ioMRI scanning in patients harboring high-grade gliomas (HGG) on their survival, one hundred ninety three patients with gliomas WHO grades III and IV were operated either in a standard microsurgical neuronavigated fashion or using additionally ioMRI and were included in a follow-up study. The series started with surgeries from September 2005 until October 2007. Patient attribution to the two groups was based on the logistical availability of the ioMRI on a scheduled surgery day, and on the assumed "difficulty" of the surgery based on the location of the glioma in or near to an eloquent area. Surgery was intended to be as radical as possible without reduction of quality of life. First surgery was performed in 103 patients (75 WHO IV and 28 WHO III) and will be the main topic of this paper. In 60 patients, ioMRI was used, while in 43 patients standard microsurgical neuronavigated resection techniques were applied. Patients were followed in regular intervals mostly until death. Statistical analysis showed a median survival time for patients in whom ioMRI had been used of 20, 37 months compared to 10, 3 months in the cohort who had undergone conventional microsurgical removal. Major influencing concomitants were WHO grades and age which were balanced in both groups.
