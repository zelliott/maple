We investigated a patient with coronary arteriovenous fistula (CAVF) by two-dimensional echocardiography (2-DE), cardiac Doppler, cardiac catheterization and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). These investigations clearly showed the abnormal vascular structures. NMR is another valuable noninvasive and safe method of confirming the presence of a CAVF.
