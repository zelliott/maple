A 70-year-old Japanese male farmer, born and living in Kyoto prefecture, developed gait disturbance, with tendency to fall at age 68, and muscle atrophy and weakness of the right shoulder and arm a year and half later. All symptoms have been progressive ever since. The patient manifested marked dementia, parkinsonism associated with limitation of ocular movements in all directions with slow saccade, loss of startle reflex, asymmetric muscle atrophy and weakness in shoulder girdles and upper limbs with hyperreflexia, and positive Babinski reflexes. The needle electromyogram showed evidence of active denervation. Brain MRI showed cortical atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes, and midbrain tegmentum. Cerebral blood flow image on SPECT suggested hypoperfusion in the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices and basal ganglia bilaterally. Thus, it is most likely that the present case suffered from clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and progressive supranuclear palsy at the same time. Relation to the ALS/Parkinsonism/Dementia complex reported from Kii peninsula and Guam was discussed.
