Neurologic manifestations of wasp sting are uncommon and delayed in onset (Sachdev et al. [1]). Various central and peripheral nervous system presentations have been described including wasp sting encephalopathy, cerebral infarction, optic neuropathy, polyradiculopathy, neuromuscular junction disorders, etc [1]. Cerebral infarction is a rare manifestation and sequential bilateral hemiparesis has been reported in only one case (Riggs [2]). We report a case of a young boy presented with bilateral cavernous sinus thrombosis with bilateral cerebral infarcts, a rare combination.
