We report a case of leiomyosarcoma of the distal femur arising at the site of a previous anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a metallic interference screw. This, to our knowledge, is the first reported case of a malignancy occurring at the site of a prior anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. We discuss lesions occurring after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
