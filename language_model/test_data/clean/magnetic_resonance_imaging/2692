To bring to the fore the most important prognostic factors in Ewing's sarcoma (ES) with current protocols, we studied the classical prognostic factors, dose intensity (DI) of actual received drugs, age and histological response to induction therapy and their correlation in 39 patients with localized ES treated from 11/85 to 06/95 to identify eventual predictors of event-free survival (EFS). Inclusion criteria were age 35 yr or less, definitive local treatment by our team and chemotherapy including at least 4 drugs: vincristine (VCR), dactinomycin (DACT), doxorubicin (DOXO) cyclophosphamide (CPX). The endpoint was the absence of relapse. Parameters related to the status of patients were tested using the Chi square test or Fisher's exact test. The non parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for quantitative data. When necessary stratified analysis was done using the Mantel Cox test. With a median follow-up of 7 yr, overall survival (OS) and EFS were both 67% at 7 yr. According to univariate analysis, the significant predictors of survival were the DI of VCR and DACT, the histological response to preoperative chemotherapy (CT), the patient's age (< 18 yr DFS: 84%; > 18 yr DFS: 38%). The risk of metastases was almost tenfold higher in patients with low received DI of VCR (DFS 40% versus 95%) and of DACT (DFS 48% versus 94%). The prognostic value of primary tumor characteristics (tumoral volume or location) was erased by the comprehensive treatment. Following multivariate analysis, the actual received DI of VCR (p < 0.02) and DACT (p < 0.03) and the histological response to preoperative CT (p < 0.05) were retained as the only significant independent predictors of EFS. Taking into account the actual received DI of VCR and DACT, the prognostic value of age disappears. In conclusion, this study points out the main role of the drug DI in ES (particularly VCR and DACT) and of histological response to preoperative CT.
