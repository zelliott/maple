A 6-month-old miniature Schnauzer presented with hypernatremia and clinical signs of vomiting, diarrhea, inappetence, and lethargy. The dog did not consume water on its own. Hypernatremia and the related clinical signs were resolved by fluid administration. Endocrinological investigations and urinalysis excluded the possibility of diabetes insipidus and hyperaldosteronism. Therefore, the dog was diagnosed with hypodipsic hypernatremia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed dysgenesis of the corpus callosum and other forebrain structures. On the basis of these findings, congenital brain malformation associated with failure of the osmoreceptor system was suspected.
