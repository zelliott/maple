The authors report three cases of cerebral germinoma that occurred in young adults with unusual presentation.

All three patients presented with hemiparesis and were treated at Seoul National University. A histological diagnosis of germinoma was made by a stereotactic biopsy in all three cases.

Magnetic resonance (MR) images showed that their tumors were located in the internal capsule and thalamus, and were associated with ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere and brain stem atrophy. The hemiparesis slowly progressed and this was accompanied by a haemorrhagic cyst in each patient.

Clinical diagnosis was not easy because of the unusual clinical presentations and atypical MR imaging findings. It is suggested that cerebral germinoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of a haemorrhagic mass which is associated with cerebral atrophy in the thalamus, basal ganglia, or internal capsule, especially in adolescents or young adults.
