Reconstruction of the anterior crucial ligament can be performed by using an autogenous transplant from the patellar ligament. Employing postoperative MR investigation, reaction of the non-vascularised tendon was studied. In 16 patients 20 knees were investigated by applying a 1.5 tesla magnet with T1-weighted (TR 500 ms, TE 15 ms) and a T2*-weighted (FISP 3D: TR 30 ms, TE 10 ms, flip angle 40 degrees). Postoperative MR follow-up showed an increase in signal intensity and diameter in T1-weighted images. This represents revascularisation of the transplant.
