Two-dimensional colour Doppler echocardiography was performed on a 1-month-old male infant with criss-cross heart, double outlet right ventricle, ventricular septum defect and pulmonary stenosis. Complex structural abnormalities were suspected after two-dimensional echocardiography (2-D echo) and confirmed by colour Doppler and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We stress that the blood streams in the ventricular inflow tracts revealed by colour Doppler and the spatial relationships of the cardiac segments disclosed by MRI are essential to make an accurate non-invasive diagnosis of this complex malformation.
