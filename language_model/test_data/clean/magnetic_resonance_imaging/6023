Cyclosporine (CsA) related encephalopathy has not been well documented after heart transplantation. We report 2 cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). The first case was a 68-year-old woman who underwent heart transplantation and received immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, and CsA. On day 14, she developed arterial hypertension, headache, visual disturbances, and generalized seizures. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed diffuse and bilateral high signals in the frontal posterior and the occipital areas. The second case was a 19-year-old man with a heart transplant receiving immunosuppression with prednisone and CsA. On day 44, he developed acute headache and generalized seizures. T2-weighted MRI of the brain showed diffuse high signals in the cerebellum, right lenticular and occipital areas. In both cases blood CsA concentration was therapeutic. Both cases recovered but in the first case neurologic findings were reversed only after CsA withdrawal.
