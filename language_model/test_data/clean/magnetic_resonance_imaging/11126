To report an unusual case of large synchronous lumbar disc herniation in adult twins.

Case report and relevant literature review.

The authors report a case of adult female monozygotic twins who synchronously presented with huge lumbar disc herniation. Rather than being a curious coincidence, this case highlights the potential importance of hereditary factors in the causation of lumbar disc degeneration. The relevant literature regarding the role of genetic factors and their relationship to other risk factors in lumbar disc degeneration is reviewed and discussed.

Synchronous lumbar disc herniation in adult twins is a rare event. It, however, sheds light on the role of genetic factors in disc degeneration.
