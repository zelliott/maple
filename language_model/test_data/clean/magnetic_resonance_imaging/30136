Central neurocytoma is classically recognized as an intraventricular benign brain tumour. Extraventricular localisation is rarer. We report two intraventricular neurocytoma and another bulbar extraventricular neurocytoma. Histologically, central neurocytoma presents remarkable likeness characteristics to oligodendroglioma, but immunohistochemical study distinguishes this tumour. Imaging appearances (CT, MRI) raise the diagnosis and immunohistochemical study confirm it. The purpose of our work is to assess the value of imaging (CT, MRI) in the diagnosis of central neurocytoma.
