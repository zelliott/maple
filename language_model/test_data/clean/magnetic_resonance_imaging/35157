We present a rare case of an infratemporal fossa mucocele with facial paresthesia in a 36-year-old man. Both computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a cystic lesion occupying the left infratemporal fossa. Marsupialization using transmaxillary and endoscopic intranasal approaches was performed to drain the mucocele into the nasal cavity and the application of mitomycin C to preserve the drainage of mucocele, which may be a good surgical option for the complete excision of infratemporal fossa cystic lesions without causing postoperative morbidity.
