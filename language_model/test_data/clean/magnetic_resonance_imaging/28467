A 37-year-old female migraine patient is described, who suffered from episodes with pure lexical agraphia as the only symptom of migraine aura. The MRI showed multiple subcortical white matter lesions. Central inflammatory and demyelinating disorders were excluded. This case suggests that, during a migraine aura, even very circumscribed brain areas involved in complex neuro-psychological processing can be affected.
