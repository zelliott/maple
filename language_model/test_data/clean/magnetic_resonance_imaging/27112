The aim of this study was to compare thoracic duct (TD) configuration depicted by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with TD configuration described in the anatomical literature.

MRI Scans were acquired with a three-dimensional T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) MRI with a two-dimensional prospective acquisition correction (PACE) technique in 63 patients. We found with MRI that TD displacement occurred more on the left side than that reported in the anatomical literature, and this tendency was more marked in elderly patients. In patients with marked leftward TD displacement, the TD configuration on MRI was compared to the descending aortic configuration on chest radiography. The degree of correspondence between the MRI findings and the anatomical literature was assessed by a Ï‡(2) goodness-of-fit test, and P < 0.05 indicated a significant difference. The degree of similarity was determined between TD configuration and aortic configuration by Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W).

On MRI scans the TD was often located to the left of the mid-vertebral line compared to the location reported in the anatomical literature (P < 0.001). Nine patients had marked leftward TD displacement, a configuration similar to that of the descending aorta (W = 1); however, no association with age was established.

The TD configuration depicted by MRI differed from that described in the anatomical literature.
