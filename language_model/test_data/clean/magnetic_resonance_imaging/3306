Reports on the MRI findings of cerebral corticosubcortical lesions in osmotic myelinolysis (OM) are rare despite several pathological descriptions of this involvement. We report two patients with subcortical lesions associated with OM that were characteristically distributed along the crowns and sides of the cerebral gyri on T(2) weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery MRI. We also discuss the MRI characteristics of corticosubcortical lesions in OM.
