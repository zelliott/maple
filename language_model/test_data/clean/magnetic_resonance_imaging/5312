Interpretation of magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography images of the glenohumeral ligaments is made difficult by anatomical variations and by the lack of descriptions of signs of pathology of the ligaments. In this review, we describe the normal and pathologic appearance of the glenohumeral ligaments of the shoulder. These ligaments play an important role in stabilization of the shoulder. Both 1.5 and 3 T MR units were used to acquire the MR images. The principal investigator reviewed the imaging reports and arthroscopic reports. All cases were correlated with arthroscopy. Lesions of the superior glenohumeral, middle glenohumeral, and inferior glenohumeral, including humeral avulsion of the glenoid ligament are discussed. Diagnosis of lesions of the glenohumeral ligaments remains a challenge.
