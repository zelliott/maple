A nine-year-old girl presented with headache, purpura and mild left hemiparesis. Laboratory evaluation revealed thrombotic microangiopathy with ADAMTS13 deficiency, with auto-antibodies to ADAMTS13. She was treated with plasma exchange and steroids, following which she improved transiently, relapsing within 2 months. The relapse was refractory to conventional therapy and rituximab was tried. She had good response to rituximab and has been in remission for the past 12 months. Rituximab may be a promising option for children with acquired TTP refractory to plasma exchange and steroids.
