Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides useful information for characterization of various ovarian masses as neoplastic or nonneoplastic and, when neoplastic, on a spectrum from benign to malignant. The use of MR imaging for diagnosis of ovarian masses includes consideration of morphologic characteristics and signal intensity characteristics on T1- and T2-weighted images. The morphologic characteristics of cystic masses, cystic and solid masses, and predominantly solid masses provide important information. In general, cystic masses represent benign tumors, whereas cystic and solid masses are strongly associated with malignancy. Predominantly solid masses include benign, borderline malignant, and malignant tumors. T1-weighted images provide useful information for characterization because hemorrhagic adnexal masses (eg, endometriotic cyst) and cystic teratomas can be correctly diagnosed when the mass has high signal intensity. Significant low signal intensity in solid masses on T2-weighted images is indicative of fibrothecomas and Brenner tumors because extensive fibrous tissue produces significant low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. A strategy for diagnosis of ovarian masses with MR imaging incorporates signal intensity characteristics into morphologic characteristics.
