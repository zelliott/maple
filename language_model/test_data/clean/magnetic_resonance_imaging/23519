Whether there are differences in knee anthropometry between Asian and white knees remains unclear. Three-dimensional knee models were constructed using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of healthy Chinese and white subjects. The morphologic measurements of the femur included mediolateral, anteroposterior dimensions, and aspect ratio. The tibial measurements included mediolateral, medial/lateral anteroposterior dimension, aspect ratio, and posterior slope of medial/lateral plateau. The results showed that Chinese knees were generally smaller than white knees. In addition, the femoral aspect ratio of Chinese females was significantly smaller than that of white females (1.24 ± 0.04 vs 1.28 ± 0.06). Tibial aspect ratio differences between Chinese and white males (1.82 ± 0.07 vs 1.75 ± 0.11), though significant, were likely a reflection of differences in knee size between races. These racial differences should be considered in the design of total knee arthroplasty prosthesis for Asian population.
