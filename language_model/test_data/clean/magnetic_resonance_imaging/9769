Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the preferred imaging modality for evaluating internal derangement of the knee, due to its superior soft tissue contrast resolution, multiplanar imaging capability, and lack of ionizing radiation. The superb image quality facilitates learning of normal imaging anatomy and conceptualizing spatial relationships of anatomic structures, leading to improved understanding of pathologic processes, mechanisms of injury, and injury patterns, and ultimately increased diagnostic accuracy. This article depicts normal MR imaging anatomy and commonly encountered anatomic variants using representative MR images of the knee, and describes and explains the rationale of routine knee MR imaging protocol.
