One or both breasts of 296 patients with equivocal clinical or mammographic findings were examined with MRI. T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) and gradient-echo (FFE) sequences were acquired before and after i.v. application of Gadolinium DTPA. 50 lesions with enhancement after Gd-DTPA were biopsied--26 carcinomas, 17 proliferating mastopathic tissues, 5 fibroadenomas and 1 abscess were found. Contrast enhanced MRI with 2D-SE and FFE sequences is an effective technique for evaluating suspicious breast lesions with high diagnostic accuracy.
