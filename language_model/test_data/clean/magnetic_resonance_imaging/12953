A 28-year-old man suffering from a Ewing tumour arising from the 9th-11th ribs with infiltration of neuroforamina without distant metastases was planned to receive radiotherapy following primary intralesional surgery and induction chemotherapy. Due to pleural infiltration and effusion, a hemithorax irradiation with a sequential boost to the primary tumour site had to be administered. Different treatment planning variants failed to provide sufficient radiotherapy planning in view of target volume coverage and avoidance of organs at risk, especially due to high calculated radiation doses potentially compromising the left kidney.

To prevent left kidney organ exposure, an autotransplantation of the left kidney into the right fossa iliaca was performed. An infiltration of the kidney was initially excluded.

Postoperatively, a renal scintigraphy showed a normal function of both kidneys allowing sufficient radiotherapy treatment planning. Target volume coverage was easily obtained using a combination of hemithorax irradiation and a sequential boost by an intensity-modulated-radiotherapy technique.

In difficult individual treatment situations, surgical transpositions as well as organ autotransplantation might be useful in reducing radiotherapy organ dose levels.
