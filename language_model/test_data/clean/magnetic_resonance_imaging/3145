Neuronal migration disorders may manifest as epilepsy alone and this is usually the case in nodular subependymal heterotopia, of which we present 5 cases. We consider this entity to be a well-defined epileptic syndrome because it is found nearly exclusively in women and is characterized by nearly constant seizures which start in the second or third decade of life, familial aggregation of cases, a clinical and EEG profile that suggests a temporal focus and the absence of associated cognitive or motor deficits. Seizures are usually controllable with medication.
