We investigated the results of 31 hips in 26 patients with nontraumatic (n = 20) and steroid-induced (n = 6) avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH) treated with vascularized iliac pedicle bone graft (PBG). The average age at operation was 38.3 years. Three were women and 23 men. The average follow-up was 8.0 years. The Harris hip score prior to operation and at latest follow-up improved from 62 to 83; one hip collapsed and was revised with a bipolar endoprosthesis. At the final follow-up, 19 hips (63%) were clinically rated as good to excellent, 4 fair, and 7 poor. At the final follow-up, 15 of 27 hips (56%) of stage II before operation showed progressive collapse after bone grafting. In steroid-induced ANFH, in three women, 2 of 4 hips showed poor results. These results are only slightly better than those of core decompression and no better than those obtained after decompression and simple nonvascularized grafts to provide support for the subchondral bone. We concluded that vascularized PBG is sometimes indicated for ANFH in an early stage before collapse of the femoral head.
