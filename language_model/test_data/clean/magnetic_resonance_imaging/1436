A case of intracerebral multifocal gliomas with von Recklinghausen's disease is reported. A 12-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital with an episode of convulsive attacks which were uncontrolled by anticonvulsants. CT scan and MRI revealed small well circumscribed tumors in the left frontal cortex and left parietal subcortex. Both of the tumors revealed low density in plain CT scan and low intensity in T1 weighted MRI. The vascularity of these tumors was poor in cerebral angiography. In other words these tumors were of a similar nature. The histology of the frontal tumor, which was totally removed surgically, showed typical pilocytic astrocytoma. The other tumor in the left parietal subcortex must also be included in the category of low grade glioma. In the sixth month after the operation, we could find neither recurrence of the frontal glioma nor enlargement of the parietal tumor, on CT and MRI findings. Immunohistochemically, the outer portion of the Rosenthal fiber in this tumor was positive for GFAP and S-100 protein, but the inner portion was negative, because the GFAP and S-100 protein there had degenerated. The cytoplasm of this tumor's cell was abundant with mitochondria and Golgi's bodies compared to the fibrillary astrocytoma. This case may be the first case of multifocal gliomas in the same cerebral hemisphere. We suggest that multifocal gliomas grow naturally, and over the years, tumors combine with each other and finally constitute a large type diffuse glioma.
