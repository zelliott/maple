We reported a successful case of the modified Norwood operation for a 21-day-old neonate with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (MS and AS) associated with an aberrant right subclavian artery and a persistent left superior vena cava. The modified Norwood operation was performed without total circulatory arrest and Cardiac arrest. A 4 mm Gore-Tex graft, which was anastomosed between the right carotid artery and the right pulmonary artery for systemic-pulmonary shunt, was used for cerebral perfusion during aortic arch reconstruction. Coronary perfusion was performed with a small cannula placed on the relatively large ascending aorta during anastomosis between the main pulmonary artery and the ascending aorta. Equine pericardial patch was used for aortic arch reconstruction and the ascending aorta was directly anastomosed to a part of the main PA. Postoperative course was uneventful and postoperative MRI revealed no stenosis of the aortic arch and the pulmonary artery.
