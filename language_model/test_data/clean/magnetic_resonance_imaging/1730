Our objective was to study the frequency of anterior intermeniscal ligament on MR imaging and to make a classification according to its insertion sites on MR images. Sagittal T1-weighted and thin-section transverse T2*-weighted MR images of the knee were prospectively evaluated in 229 subjects without significant synovial effusion or total rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. By using thin-section transverse images, the ligament was classified into three types according to its insertion sites (type A: between anterior horns of medial and lateral menisci; type B: between anterior horn of medial meniscus and anterior margin of lateral meniscus; type C: between anterior margins of medial and lateral menisci). On sagittal images location of the ligament was determined with respect to a line drawn between anterior of the tibial epiphysis and posterior of the intercondylar notch to look for a relation between its type on transverse images and location on sagittal images. Separately, arthroscopy was made in 36 patients to verify the MR assessment of the presence of the ligament. Anterior intermeniscal ligament was found in 53% of the subjects. Type B was the most common group (58%). Magnetic resonance imaging has a sensitivity and a specificity of 67 and 100%, respectively, in the detection of the ligament. Types A and C had a statistically significant location posterior and anterior, respectively, to the master line on sagittal images. In arthroscopy, the ligament was either cord-like (67%) or flat (33%) in appearance. Routine sagittal MR images can help identify anterior intermeniscal ligament.
