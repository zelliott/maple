Electron paramagnetic resonance imaging (EPRI) promises to provide new insights into the physiology of tissues in health and disease. Understanding the in vivo imaging capability of this new modality requires comparison with other physiologically responsive techniques. Here, an initial comparison between 2D EPR spatial imaging of a narrow single line injectable paramagnetic trityl spin probe and 2D slice-selected carbogen subtraction BOLD MRI is presented. The images were obtained from the same FSa fibrosarcoma grown in the leg of a C3H mouse. This tumor was unusual in comparison with others imaged with subtraction BOLD MRI because of its peripheral distribution of intensity. The spatial distribution of the EPR spin probe showed the same peripheral distribution. The pixel resolutions of these images are comparable. These images provide an early in vivo comparison of EPRI with a well-established imaging modality. The comparison validates the in vivo distribution of spin probe as imaged with EPRI, and provides a proof of principle for the comparison of BOLD and EPRI.
