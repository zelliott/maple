The aim of this study was to characterize the association between trait anhedonia and regional gray matter volume in patients with schizophrenia. Forty-six patients with schizophrenia and 56 healthy controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to acquire high-resolution T1-weighted images. Trait anhedonia was measured using the Chapman Revised Physical Anhedonia Scale (PAS). Voxel-based morphometry was performed to investigate brain volume correlates of trait anhedonia. Several brain regions in the patient group, including the left precuneus and right posterior cingulate (PCC), were found to show significantly less correlation with PAS scores than those of the control group. Post-hoc analysis revealed that negative correlations between the regional gray matter volume and the PAS scores in the patient group were found at a trend level in the left precuneus and the right PCC. In conclusion, these findings suggest that trait anhedonia in patients with schizophrenia could possibly be associated with a volume deficit in brain regions related to default-mode, which reflects the impairment of self-referential processing and reward anticipation.
