We present a review of our single-institution experience, over 19 years, with aortobronchial and aortoesophageal fistulae due to descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 10 cases involving surgery for aortobronchial and aortoesophageal fistulae in our clinic from February 1985 through October 2004. Pathologic or predisposing conditions associated with aortobronchial fistula were descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (n=8), previous aortic surgery (n=1), and concomitant aortoesophageal fistula (n=1). Three patients presented emergently with aortobronchial fistula (n=2) and aortoesophageal fistula (n=1). Ages of the 10 patients ranged from 42 to 74 years (median, 63 years). The median cross-clamp time was 34 minutes (range, 27-41 min). Repairs, in 9 patients, involved an inlay of prosthetic tube graft using the clamp-and-sew technique, and in 1 patient repair involved patch aortoplasty. The operative mortality rate was 20%:1 patient had acute concomitant aortoesophageal and aortobronchial fistulae, and another had chronic aortobronchial fistula. There was no embolic stroke or paraplegia. During follow-up (median, 2.5 years), there were no deaths or postoperative morbidity We conclude that repair of aortobronchial and aortoesophageal fistulae using the clamp-and-sew technique can be performed with acceptable operative mortality and long-term results. However, the mortality rate continues to be highly significant in patients with acute bleeding aortobronchial fistula or with aortoesophageal fistula, despite rapid surgical intervention.
