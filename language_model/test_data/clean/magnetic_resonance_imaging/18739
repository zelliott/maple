Brain magnetic resonance imaging scans occasionally reveal asymmetrical ventricles with no identifiable cause. A case is presented that highlights a possible connection between transient choroid plexus cysts and benign asymmetrical ventricles.

The patient was a 2.5-week-old asymptomatic boy. Transcranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the infant to have a left frontal horn choroid plexus cyst and a mildly dilated left lateral ventricle. Head circumference was at 90% of the norm for age. The neurological examination revealed nothing abnormal. Four months later, follow-up magnetic resonance imaging revealed complete resolution of the cyst with persistent ventricular asymmetry.

No surgical intervention was undertaken. The lesion was assessed via x-ray.

Spontaneously resolving choroid plexus cysts of infancy causing outflow obstruction of the lateral ventricle may be one of the underlying causes of benign asymmetrical ventricles.
