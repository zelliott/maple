We reported a case of pontine hemorrhage showing hemiasomatognosia. A 74-year-old, right-handed man was admitted to our hospital complaining of numbness of left upper and lower extremities. Neurological examination revealed marked disturbance of superficial and deep sensation of left half of his body without hemiparesis and consciousness disturbance. Neuropsychologically, he had experience of having lost the perception of his left upper limb, which was referred to "conscious hemiasomatognosia" by Frederiks. Brain CT and MRI showed a pontine hematoma involving the right medial lemniscus, the right spinothalamic tract and the right medial longitudinal fasciculus. One week after the onset, hemiasomatognosia disappeared with improvement of sensory disturbance. These indicate that this form of hemiasomatognosia may be associated with transient blockage of somesthetic input.
