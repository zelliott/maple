Community acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is emerging as an important pathogen in paranasal sinus disease. However, sinonasal CA-MRSA has not been reported as a source of central skull base osteomyelitis. We report an unusual case of a previously healthy and immunocompetent adult who developed meningitis, central skull base osteomyelitis, and occipital condylar cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea from CA-MRSA sphenoid sinusitis requiring endoscopic surgical repair. This case clearly demonstrates the expanding spectrum of severe infections caused by CA-MRSA, which requires prompt diagnosis, a high level of suspicion, and appropriate medical and/or surgical management.
