The authors compared ictal SPECT injection performed by medical personnel with self-injection ictal SPECT in six patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Self-injection was safe and started faster. Self-injection subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM) was localizing in three patients who had a complex partial seizure, but only one of three patients who had a simple partial seizure, which may limit its usefulness in clinical practice. The localizing information of self-injection was better in three patients, and obviated the need for depth-EEG studies in one patient.
