We present a 10-month-old child with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) secondary to chronic active hepatitis due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. A total of 35 paediatric cases of pontine and/or extrapontine myelinolysis are reported and, to our knowledge, CPM secondary to CMV hepatitis in an infant has not been previously reported. The MRI findings are highlighted.
