Congenital diverticulum of the left ventricle, a rare malformation, is usually associated with midline thoracoabdominal defect. We describe a case with congenital left ventricular diverticulum presenting as an isolated lesion. The lesion was suspected on two-dimensional echocardiography and was confirmed by cardiac catheterization and magnetic resonance imaging.
