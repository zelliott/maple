Minor salivary gland carcinosarcoma is a rare malignancy with an ominous prognosis. This report recounts a single case of supraglottic minor salivary gland carcinosarcoma that was treated aggressively. We discuss the peculiarities of the histology, with special mention of the distinction that must be made between mucosal-origin and salivary-gland-origin carcinosarcoma. Carcinosarcomas are aggressive regardless of their origin, but differentiating their origin is important because the prognosis is worse for those that arise in salivary glands than for those that originate in the surface epithelium. This report adds to the literature a new case of minor salivary-gland-origin carcinosarcoma involving the upper airway. It is the first case we could identify in which the supraglottis was involved.
