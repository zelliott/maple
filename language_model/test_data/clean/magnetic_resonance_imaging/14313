The diagnosis of epiphyseolysis of the femoral head in its early stages is often unclear when using conventional radiography. In order to obtain additional information, we examined seven patients by means of MRT. In all cases the T1-weighted sequences showed widened, ill-defined epiphyseal plates. The epiphyseal displacement was shown accurately by sections of the sagittal plane. T2-weighted sequences showed the presence of an effusion in the hip joints of five patients. In all patients there was increased signal intensity in the metaphysis and in the femoral neck and head. The increased signal intensity appears to be an early sign for the presence of an epiphyseolysis.
