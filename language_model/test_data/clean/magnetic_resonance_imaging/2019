A case of carotid body tumour (paraganglioma) which is both unusual and highly vascular, arising from the carotid body is reported. The patient was a 68-year-old female with a right submandibular swelling. The initial pathological diagnosis was obtained from the incisional biopsy. Carotid angiography revealed the feeding vessels arising only from the external carotid artery. The tumour was completely removed and no evidence of recurrence could be found 2-years postoperatively.
