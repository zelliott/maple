We report an unusual case of dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour (DNT) located in the occipital lobe presenting with only headache. A 31 year old woman presented with headache. She had no history of epilepsy and neurological examination revealed no abnormal findings. Computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed a multilobulated mass lesion with calcification in the right occipital lobe. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a heterogeneously enhanced mass with hypointense signals on T1- and hyperintense signals on T2-weighted images. The lesion was totally resected and histopathologically diagnosed as DNT. Physicians must bear in mind that DNT may occur in the occipital lobe and present with only mass effect.
