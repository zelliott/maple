Discitis is an inflammatory disease of the intervertebral disc which has usually a benign evolution in childhood. It often recognizes an infectious etiology. Still discussed however is the possibility of a primitive discal involvement (not secondary to a vertebral inflammation) or of a non infectious etiology and the subsequent more correct diagnostic-therapeutic procedures. We report a case of a girl with discitis diagnosed early and treated with antibiotics and orthopedic corset, whose follow-up shows a benign evolution. We underline the importance of modern neuroradiological imaging: in particular, MR plays a major role in the inflammatory diseases of the column, both in diagnosis and in follow-up. MR scans of the involved disc allow frequent controls without radiogenic risks and with a good resolution because of the multiplanarity typical of the method.
