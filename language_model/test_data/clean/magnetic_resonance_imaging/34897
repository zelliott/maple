Studies using functional imaging tools and in-vivo stimulation have contributed to more precise anatomical localization of the brain areas that are active in specific saccade eye movement tasks in intact human beings. They provide a unique perspective on in-vivo brain function and complement studies in patients with known cerebral lesions and abnormal eye movements.
