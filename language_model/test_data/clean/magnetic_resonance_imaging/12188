From October 1983 to January 1990 in 493 patients 499 injured anterior cruciate ligaments were reconstructed by a composite tendon graft. The autogenous graft, semitendinosus tendon or quadriceps-patella periost-patellar tendon, both anatomically attached distally, was augmented with the polypropylene braid (Kennedy LAD). In the period of January to November 1984 in 81 patients anterior cruciate ligament replacement was performed. A retrospective 2-years follow-up in 72 patients and a second 5-years follow-up in 67 of those 72 patients was possible. There were 38 patients with an acute rupture and 34 patients with chronic instability. Clinical and instrumented laxity revealed a mean displacement difference of not more than 3 mm in 84% of the patients in comparison of the involved with the normal knee at the 2-years and 5-years follow-up. 80% of strength analyses showed a physiological balance of quadriceps and hamstrings in the 5-years follow-up. In the 2-years follow-up only 41% of patients practiced former sports activities again, whereas in the 5-years follow-up 80% of the patients were able to join former sports. 80 to 100 points of Lysholm score demonstrating good to very good results were reached in 91% of the patients. Especially cartilage damages in cases of chronic instabilities worsened the results mentioned by the patients.
