We examined changes to the protruded lumbar disc after intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in two patients with chronic discogenic low back pain who underwent IDET. MRI was performed before and 6 months after the treatments. In the follow-up MRI studies, the protrusions were almost abolished and normalized in both patients. We thus confirmed shrinkage of the protruded disc by IDET on MRI images in two patients.
