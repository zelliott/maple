Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain function is used in neurorehabilitation to gain insight into the mechanisms of neural recovery following neurological injuries such as stroke. The behavioral paradigms involving the use of force motor tasks utilized in the scanner often lack the ability to control details of motor performance. They are often limited by subjectiveness, lack of repeatability, and complexity that may exclude evaluation of patients with poor function. In this paper we describe a novel MR compatible wrist device that is capable of measuring isometric forces generated at the hand and joint moments along wrist flexion-extension and wrist ulnar-radial deviation axes. Joint moments measured by the system can be visually displayed to the individual and used during target matching block or event related paradigms. Through a small set of pilot testing both inside and outside the MR environment, we have found that the force tracking tasks and performance in the scanner are reproducible, and that high quality force and moment recordings can be made during fMRI studies without compromising the fMRI images. Furthermore, the device recordings are extremely sensitive making it possible for individuals with poor hand and wrist function to be tested.
