Fast Spin-Echo Magnetic Resonance Imaging facilitates multiplanar target and trajectory selection in functional disorders by rapidly delineating gray matter, white matter, vascular, and ventricular structures. Errors due to anatomic variation or co-existing lesions can be avoided as are movement artifacts. Although not a substitute for physiologic target corroboration, the method facilitates safety and efficacy of "functional" stereotactic procedures.
