The efficiency of laparoscopic para-aortic lymphadenectomy and radiodiagnostic methods in pre-treatment clarification of tumor lesion extent in stage IB2-III cervical cancer patients was compared. The Magnetic Resonance or sonographic imaging data was found to be inferior to lymph nodes morphological investigation followed by morphological study of distant lymph nodes. The results demonstrate the adequacy of surgical staging by laparoscopic para-aortic lymphadenectomy in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer for therapy tactics decision making.
