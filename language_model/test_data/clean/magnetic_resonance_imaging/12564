Unlike Aspergillus sinusitis, sinus infections by mucormycosis are often invasive and have a lethal potential. We report two cases of chronic sinusitis with unilateral uncomplicated diagnosis of mucormycosis confirmed by pathology or mycology and discuss the therapeutic strategy.

Case 1) An immunocompetent patient with a right chronically sphenoid sinusitis uncomplicated underwent endonasal surgery in our institution. Rhizopus Oryzae was found on the surgical mycological specimen. The patient received no adjuvant medical therapy after surgery, because there were no invasive clinical or radiological criteria and no histopathological confirmation. Clinical, radiological and mycological follow-up was done. Case 2) A patient with a chronic maxillary sinusitis underwent endonasal surgery in our institution. Histological analysis found filaments in favor of mucormycosis without vascular emboli. We decided in agreement with the national reference center for mycology not to treat medically.

A follow up of more than 3 years for both cases tends to confirm this collective decision.
