The authors present the methodology and the results of a trial of 3D-reconstruction of the fibrous frame of the rotator cuff taken from high resolution MRI. The accuracy of the method used is discussed. A precise reconstruction of the soft tissues is possible and provides an interesting model to study the mechanical role of the rotator cuff muscles. An example of biomechanical application of the 3D images is given.
