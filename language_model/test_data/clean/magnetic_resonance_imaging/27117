Multidimensional spatially selective excitation (SSE) has stimulated a variety of useful applications in magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which have regained considerable interest after the recent introduction of parallel excitation. For SSE, radiofrequency pulses are designed specifically for certain time-courses of spatially encoding magnetic fields (SEM) which are applied simultaneously with the radiofrequency pulses. However, experimental imperfections of gradient-systems and undesired SEM field contributions often prevent the correct co-action of radiofrequency pulses and gradient-waveforms and therefore degrade the fidelity of excitation patterns, especially for parallel excitation. To cope with such imperfections, a classical measurement of k-space-trajectories can be performed followed by an adaptation of the SSE-pulses. However, this method is limited to linear SEM field distributions, which are describable in the k-space-formalism. Hence, this work presents a more sophisticated method consisting in a spatially resolved measurement of the temporal phase evolution of the transverse magnetization. This exhaustive phase information can be incorporated into pulse-design algorithms to compensate even for undesired spatially nonlinear, dynamic SEM field contributions. Both approaches are assessed in various experimental scenarios and individual benefits and limitations are discussed. The adaptation of SSE-pulses to experimentally achieved calibration data turned out to be very beneficial, and especially the novel spatially resolved method exhibited high potential for robust SSE even in adverse experimental setups.
