Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ideal for imaging the joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. It produces anatomically detailed images of bone, cartilage, tendons and synovial membrane. It can reveal structural damage, in the form of bone erosion, cartilage thinning and/or tendon rupture, and regions of inflammation, using sequences that reveal water content and vascularity. MRI synovitis, tenosynovitis and bone oedema/osteitis all have prognostic significance, and MRI studies of RA have helped elucidate the mechanisms whereby bone and synovial inflammation lead to joint damage. Bone oedema/osteitis has become an important imaging biomarker, and can be used to help predict progression from undifferentiated arthritis to definite RA. Recent MRI studies have confirmed that subclinical inflammation is often present in patients in clinical remission, and these data may affect disease management. Finally, recent clinical trials are reviewed, in which MRI outcome measures are being established as sensitive response markers.
