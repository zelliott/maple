This study examined the relationship between four radiological parameters (Pavlov's ratio, sagittal diameter, spinal cord area, and spinal canal area) in patients with a traumatic cervical spine injury, as well as the correlation between these parameters and the neurological outcome.

A total of 212 cervical spinal levels in 53 patients with a distractive-extension injury were examined. The following four parameters were measured: Pavlov's ratio on the plain lateral radiographs, the sagittal diameter, the spinal cord area, and the spinal canal area on the MRI scans. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the parameters at each level and between the levels of each parameter were evaluated. The correlation between the radiological parameters and the spinal cord injury status classified into four categories, A (complete), B (incomplete), C (radiculopathy), and D (normal) was assessed.

The mean Pavlov's ratio, sagittal diameter, spinal cord area and spinal canal area was 0.84, 12.9 mm, 82.8 mm(2) and 236.8 mm(2), respectively. An examination of the correlation between the radiological spinal stenosis and clinical spinal cord injury revealed an increase in the values of the four radiological parameters from cohorts A to D. Pavlov's ratio was the only parameter showing statistically significant correlation with the clinical status (p = 0.006).

There was a correlation between the underlying spinal stenosis and the development of neurological impairment after a traumatic cervical spine injury. In addition, it is believed that Pavlov's ratio can be used to help determine and predict the neurological outcome.
