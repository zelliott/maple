We surveyed 33 UK MR units that have been developed by New Opportunity Funding (NOF) with reference to planning for and provision of anaesthetic services. The likely clinical and resource implications were documented. Units were developed predominantly in acute general hospitals with paediatric, critically ill and neuroscience patients represented. It may be predicted that up to 50% of newly built units will require anaesthetic provision and this should be anticipated at the planning stage. A senior anaesthetist should be involved in the planning process.
