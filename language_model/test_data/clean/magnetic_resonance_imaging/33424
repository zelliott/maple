Puncture wounds of the foot are commonly seen in the hospital emergency room. They are usually managed appropriately; however, a percentage go on to skin infection with subsequent joint and osseous involvement. This is particularly true in the adolescent patient. This manuscript was written to inform the foot specialist on the etiology, medical, and surgical management of osteomyelitis secondary to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, two pediatric case histories that occurred within 6 months of each other are presented.
