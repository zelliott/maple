The present fMRI study examined effective connectivity within an emotional network composed of three brain areas: Amygdala (AMY), Anterior Cingulate Cortex (AAC) and Orbito-Frontal (OFC) in processing fearful faces. Two tasks: an incidental perception (gender identification) and an intentional detection (effortful discrimination) task were performed by 14 and 10 young healthy volunteers, respectively. Participants were scanned while viewing fearful, neutral and ambiguous facial expressions. Effective connectivity was assessed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results show that the hypothetical network fits the experimental data for both tasks and in both hemispheres. The comparison between Tasks 1 and 2 reveals significant differences in strength and direction of the connectivity patterns for the left and to a less stringent threshold for the right hemisphere. The path coefficients analysis suggests that the fearful information generated in AMY, reaches the OFC through the ACC in incidental perception, while in intentional perception, the route followed is in a reverse direction from OFC to ACC. Our findings confirm a differential brain connectivity between incidental and intentional processing of fearful faces.
