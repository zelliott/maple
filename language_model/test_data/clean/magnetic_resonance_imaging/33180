Vascular tumors are the most common benign tumors of the head and neck in infancy and childhood. Vascular anomalies of the head and neck were divided into 2 categories including hemangiomas and vascular malformations. Oral and maxillofacial hemangiomas and vascular malformations are congenital lesions with various clinical characteristics, manifestations, indications, and possibilities for treatment. This paper reports a case of large arteriovenous malformations including a description of the features demonstrated by panoramic radiography, cone beam computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The differential diagnosis and treatment modalities (including embolization with N-butylcyanoacrylate in this case) are also discussed following the case presentation, along with the available literature review.
