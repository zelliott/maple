Femoral neuropathy secondary to iliacus haematoma in the absence of a bleeding diathesis is rare. Of the few documented cases in the literature, most have occurred in adolescents participating in sport. We report a case of femoral nerve palsy complicating an iliacus haematoma occurring in a young person with minimal trauma that resolved with non-operative management. Although rare, iliacus haematoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of groin pain as the number of children and young adults participating in sport increases.
