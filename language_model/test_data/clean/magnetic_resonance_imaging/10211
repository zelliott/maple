Define normal sulcation patterns and their chronological order of appearance on transabdominal ultrasound by comparing them with brain maturation references available in fetopathological studies and MRI findings.

By means of a prospective study, 158 normal fetal brains aged 21 to 34 gestational weeks have been analyzed with standardized data by transabdominal ultrasound in eleven different views using axial, coronal and sagittal orientation.

The sequential development of cerebral sulci has been described according to the gestational age. This chronology was consistent with anatomo-pathologic references presenting a mean late period of one week and with MRI but without any late period. This study is available on the following website:

This ultrasound study provides accurate landmarks and imaging features of normal fetal brain sulcation. The analysis and the knowledge of this sulcation provide better understanding of the brain cortex maturation and may be helpful in diagnosing brain diseases.
