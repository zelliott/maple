The recent advances in imaging of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), especially the introduction of MR imaging and surface colls allowing precise visualization of superficial structures led us to reconsider the different techniques used in this very complex anatomical region, due to both its morphology and function. We also tried to determine their respective role, especially in the study of TMJ dysfunction syndromes, that represent the most frequent pathology of this region. Conventional radiography allows us to appreciate the overall amplitude of the joint movements, and to study bone abnormalities, but CT is much more precise in the study of cortical bone. In TMJ dysfunction, the joint itself is studied by either arthrography or MRI, but both techniques have their limitations and remain complementary in some aspects, which are detailed here, so that the choice between them depends on availability and therapeutic indications.
