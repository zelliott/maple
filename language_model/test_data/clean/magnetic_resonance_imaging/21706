A young male with phenylketonuria diagnosed in his 9-th month of life is presented. At the age of 20 years signs of central nervous system involvement became more pronounced, with extrapyramidal syndrome and with simultaneous very striking increase of phenylalanine level. The neurological signs were reduced after administration of Levodopa (Nakom) and return to more strict diet and Lofenalac.
