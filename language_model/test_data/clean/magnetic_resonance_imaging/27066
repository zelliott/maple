Diagnosis of injuries to the ligamentous structures of the wrist can be a challenge, particularly when there is involvement of the small, complex structures of the proximal wrist. Recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, especially in spatial and contrast resolution, have facilitated more precise visualization of these structures. However, there are a number of pitfalls that may cause difficulty in diagnosis of injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), lunotriquetral ligament, and scapholunate ligament. Use of inappropriate MR imaging sequences and MR imaging artifacts may decrease the accuracy of diagnosis of injuries to the TFCC and wrist ligaments, whereas variant anatomy of the proximal wrist structures may mimic disease of the TFCC and wrist ligaments. Knowledge of the detailed anatomy of the wrist, as well as variant patterns of structure morphology and signal intensity, can help differentiate actual disease from normal or variant appearances at assessment with MR imaging.
