Radiation therapy is a potentially curative treatment for corticotroph adenomas refractory to surgery. Protons have an advantage over photons (x-rays) by depositing energy at the target with no exit dose, providing a lower dose to adjacent normal tissues. Until recently, proton stereotactic radiotherapy (PSR) was available at only two U.S. centers; use will increase as proton facilities are under development.

Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PSR for persistent Cushing's disease (CD) and Nelson's syndrome (NS).

This was a retrospective review of 38 patients (33 with CD and five with NS) treated between 1992 and 2005.

All patients had transsphenoidal surgery without biochemical cure. Four had previous irradiation with photons. The patients with NS underwent bilateral adrenalectomy 29-228 months (median 40) before PSR.

Single-fraction PSR was delivered at a median dose of 20 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (range 15-20) on 1 treatment day.

Complete response (CR) was defined as sustained (> or =3 months) normalization of urinary free cortisol off medical therapy. CR in NS was based on normalization of plasma corticotropin.

At a median follow-up of 62 months (range 20-136), CR was achieved in five patients (100%) with NS and 17 (52%) patients with CD. Among all patients with CR, median time to CR was 18 months (range 5-49). No secondary tumors were noted on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans, and there was no clinical evidence of optic nerve damage, seizure, or brain injury. There were 17 patients (52%) who developed new pituitary deficits.

PSR is effective for patients with persistent corticotroph adenomas with low morbidity after a median follow-up of 62 months; longer follow-up is warranted for late radiation-related sequelae.
