Management of congenital heart diseases (CHD) frequently is a diagnostic challenge. MRI, as a complement to echocardiography, plays an important role in the non-invasive evaluation of these anomalies. MRI allows high resolution anatomical evaluation of these structures in multiple planes as well as functional evaluation. These features are helpful to further characterize extra-cardiac anomalies that may be difficult to assess at US and even angiography. MRI is thus a valuable imaging tool in the evaluation of CHD.
