Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory osteoarticular disease. Although the etiology remains unknown, proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor Î± and interleukin-6, have been implicated in the development of AS. Here, we report that a patient with AS, whose disease had been refractory to conventional treatment regimens and who needed to receive continuous corticosteroid, responded well to tocilizumab. While further clinical evaluation is required, tocilizumab may be an optional treatment for AS.
