MRI method of assessment of medio-patellar plica of the knee is presented. The results have been verified arthroscopically. Twenty seven patients have underwent MRI of the knee, arthroscopy followed in 15 cases. MRI revealed the plica in 15 patients, no plica was found in 5 cases and 3 examinations were not conclusive. Arthroscopy confirmed pathology in 9 cases; the plica was also found in one of "not conclusive" cases. MRI rendered 0.7 specificity, 0.9 sensitivity and positive prognostic value was 0.6. MRI proved to be highly sensitive but delivered no means to differentiate symptomatic and asymptomatic plicae.
