The biological and physical properties of albumin and nitroxides make them attractive candidates as special purpose MRI contrast agents which could be used to study the intravascular compartment or specific targets in tissues. In this study, albumin-nitroxide complexes were prepared by reduction and alkylation of the disulfide bonds of the protein and characterized by electron spin resonance and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy. An average of six nitroxides were bound covalently to each molecule of human serum albumin. The water proton relaxivity of the protein-bound nitroxide (at 20 MHz and 37 degrees C) was 4-fold greater than that of the free nitroxide. The digestion of the nitroxide-albumin complexes by cells or by trypsin decreased the relaxivity of the nitroxide-protein complex. The rate of reduction of albumin-bound nitroxide by cells was much slower than that of the free nitroxide but still was oxygen-sensitive (2-3-fold increase in the rate of reduction in the absence of oxygen).
