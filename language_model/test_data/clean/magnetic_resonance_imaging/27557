In this report of two cases of solitary cerebral meningeal melanoma, a rare tumor that presents both diagnostic and management challenges, the diagnosis of these lesions was based on a solitary leptomeningeal mass on MRI, a high mitotic rate on histology and the absence of extracerebral localizations. Although the radiological patterns can mimic those of other melanocytic tumors, MRI is a useful diagnostic tool for narrowing the differential diagnosis. Surgical removal remains the only effective treatment of these lesions, and can lead to prolonged survival in a few cases.
