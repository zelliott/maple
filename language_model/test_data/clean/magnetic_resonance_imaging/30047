Subtalar dislocation is considered a severe injury but occurs rarely and studies generally refer to relatively small patient collectives. We investigated the functional outcome in 22 cases to determine the long-term prognosis. Since associated foot injury is common, we compared the outcome for 12 cases of isolated subtalar luxation with 10 cases of collateral fractures of the adjacent bones of the hind foot and Talus. 19 cases of complex, partially open injuries after high energy trauma have got excluded because of the apparently poor long-term results. The Kitaoka-hind-foot-Score (AOFAS) after mean follow up of 8.3 years indicated a significantly better outcome for isolated luxation. Nearly 50 % of isolated luxations had a excellent outcome (73 %, mean score 89), luxations with associated fractures had mainly good and fair results (73 %, mean score 74). Analysis of the gait pattern by dynamic plantar pressure measurement demonstrated lower pressures in the isolated luxation group and higher pressures in the group with associated fractures in the lateral region of the forefoot with shorter phases of weight bearing.
