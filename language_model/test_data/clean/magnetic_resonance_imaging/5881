The purpose of this report was to review our experience with using breast magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate breast implant integrity and to offer a decision tree to assist physicians in managing these patients. Data were available for 81 patients with 146 implants placed either unilaterally or bilaterally for either cosmesis or breast reconstruction. The chief complaint for a majority of patients (n = 24) was breast pain. Thirty-two patients were found to have 44 ruptured implants, the majority of whom were found to have either contracture (n = 7) or negative findings (n = 7) on physician examination. The likelihood of rupture increased with number of years in place. When a patient presents for a possible implant rupture, the initial concern is to rule out malignancy, but because clinical and radiologic findings are often convoluted and complicated, a decision tree is helpful.
