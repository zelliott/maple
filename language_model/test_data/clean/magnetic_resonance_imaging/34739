MR tagging is a recent imaging development that, in cardiac applications, makes possible the tracking of points in the myocardium during the cardiac cycle. Researchers have developed semiautomated, computer-based methods for analyzing tagged images, but the images are complex and present a challenge to automated tracking systems. Simulation can provide an inexhaustible supply of images for testing and validation of tag tracking software and preview the effect of parameter changes in acquisition. SIMTAG is an interactive computer program that simulates two-dimensional tagged-MR experiments. The mathematic model used in the simulation and algorithms for simulating image noise and object deformation are described. Examples of the use of simulated images in SPAMM parameter selection, a comparison of tag contrast in signal-averaged SPAMM and CSPAMM, and simulated images as test sets for tag-tracking software are presented.
