We sought to clarify whether apparently silent cerebral infarcts and periventricular hyperintensities are associated with depressed cognitive function in middle-aged subjects. Subjects were 84 middle-aged neurologically normal adults who wished to undergo a screening examination of the brain. We performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and neuropsychologic tests in all subjects. Silent cerebral infarcts and periventricular hyperintensities, respectively, were detected in 21 and 14 of 84 subjects. Mini-mental state (MMS) and Raven's colored progressive matrices (RCPM) scores were significantly lower in subjects with than without silent cerebral infarcts. By two-factor analysis of variance, MMS score was affected by silent cerebral infarcts or periventricular hyperintensities, with interactions between the two lesion types (P < 0.05). Silent cerebral infarcts may be an independent factor in the pathogenesis of intellectual dysfunction, but truly independent analysis is difficult because many subjects with silent cerebral infarcts also have periventricular hyperintensities.
