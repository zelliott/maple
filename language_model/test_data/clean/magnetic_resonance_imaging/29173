Distal aneurysms of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) are rare. Most have been located at the cerebellopontine angle. Only three cases, including ours, located in the medial branch of the AICA have been reported in the literature.

A 55-year-old female presented with epilepsy that she experienced for the first time. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no abnormality. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) disclosed a rare aneurysm at the medial branch of the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery. In the blood workup on her admission, a mild inflammatory sign was found, and bacterial aneurysm was suggested as the presumptive differential diagnosis. Repeated DSA was performed 3 months after admission, but the aneurysm did not disappear. She then underwent a suboccipital craniotomy in the prone position.

The aneurysm was clipped and partially resected for the pathological examination. Histologic examination revealed a true aneurysm. She was discharged without neurological deficit.

In this report, we summarize the previous cases and discuss the location and clinical manifestations of aneurysms of the AICA through a review of the literature.
