MRI findings of sarcoidosis are usually intraparenchymal granuloma with leptomeningeal lesions. This appearance is dependent upon leptomeningeal lesions subsequently infiltrating to parenchyma. We describe a 52-year-old man with slowly progressive paresthesias and weakness in his legs. MRI showed diffuse leptomeningeal lesions throughout the brainstem and spinal cord without intraparenchymal lesions. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed by cervical lymph node biopsy which detected noncaseating granuloma. Only leptomeningeal lesions throughout the brainstem and spinal cord could be observed in sarcoidosis.
