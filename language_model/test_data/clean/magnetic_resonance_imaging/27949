The confirmation of the diagnosis of intralobar pulmonary sequestration usually requires angiographic demonstration of the systemic arterial supply, and venous drainage. Magnetic resonance angiography (MR angiography) is a new, non-invasive imaging modality for examinations of the vasculature. In this report we describe its successful application in intralobar pulmonary sequestration demonstrating the feeding systemic artery, including its intrapulmonary branching, and the type of the venous return.
