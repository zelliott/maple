Fibrocartilaginous mesenchymoma of bone is a rare primary neoplasm. Our literature search produced only 12 previously reported cases. Radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings have been described, but the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance has not been reported previously. We report a patient with fibrocartilaginous mesenchymoma of the ilium and describe the imaging findings on conventional radiography, bone scan, CT, and MRI.
