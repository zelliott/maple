This study evaluated a brief screening instrument for predicting psychological distress in patients undertaking magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The scale is adapted from Wolpe and Lang's (1964) Fear Survey Schedule (FSS; see Lukins, Davan, & Drummond, 1997). Noise and/or confinement were identified as the most unpleasant feature of the MRI by 48.3% of 118 outpatients. The MRI-FSS (Lukins et al., 1997; 9 items) significantly predicted the number of panic attack symptoms and state anxiety experienced during MRI scan better than a range of other measures. There was a significant increase in MRI-FSS scores from prescan to postscan among those who experienced high levels of anxiety during the scan. The MRI-FSS appears to be a useful indicator of likely adverse psychological reactions in the MRI scan that is sensitive to the sequelae of the MRI procedure.
