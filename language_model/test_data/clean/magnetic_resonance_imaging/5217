Recently, several studies using diffusion-sensitized MRI reported changes in patients with high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS) suggestive of subtle brain tissue damage. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the microstructural cerebral white matter integrity in asymptomatic patients with high-grade ICAS.

In 15 asymptomatic patients with unilateral high grade (>70%) ICAS, we used 3T MRI including DTI. We used a region-of-interest approach comparing quantitative DTI metrics between both hemispheres including the so-called border zones. MR images were also assessed for periventricular white matter lesions (PWML) as well as collaterals via the circle of Willis.

There was no significant intraindividual difference of fractional anisotropy or mean diffusivity values between the hemispheres for any region. PWML was graded 0° in 6 patients, I° in 9 and II° in 2.

In clinically asymptomatic patients with high-grade unilateral ICAS, there was no difference between the DTI parameters of the affected and the unaffected hemisphere. These findings contrast with other studies in asymptomatic high-grade ICAS, which is likely due to patient selection. These findings argue against concomitant chronic tissue integrity changes and implicate the benignity of asymptomatic carotid artery disease in individual patients.
