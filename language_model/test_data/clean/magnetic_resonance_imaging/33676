A case of extramedullary hemopoiesis in an 18-yr-old girl suffering from beta-thalassemia is reported. Extramedullary hemopoietic masses were localized apart from the paraspinal region in the retrocrural areas as well as the presacral region associated with massive destruction of the sacrum. The importance of recognition of hemopoietic masses in these regions in conditions other than hereditary hemolytic anaemias is briefly discussed.
