Root lesions in the lumbo-sacral region are rare, compared with injuries of the roots of the brachial plexus. They occur almost exclusively in association with serious injuries of the pelvis. The present case, without pelvic injury, is a rarity. The appearances on myelography and CT are well known, but the findings on MRI are also described and the value of this non-invasive procedure is discussed.
