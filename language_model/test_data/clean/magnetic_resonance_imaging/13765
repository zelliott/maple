A prospective non-randomised study fibrin sealant injection to manage patients with fistula-in-ano, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) monitoring, was performed during the period 5/6/1999 to 28/2/2000. The aim was to determine whether a fibrin sealant could be used as a treatment modality for anorectal fistula and the usefulness of MRI perineum to monitor the disease activity. Ten patients were included in the study. Mean age was 47 years (range 7 months to 70 years). Male: female ratio was 9:1. Mean follow-up duration was 26.4 weeks. The overall success rate was 60%. The success rate of different fistula types were different (60%, 0%, 100% for intersphincteric, transphincteric, subcutaneous, respectively). Variable decrease in signal on STIR images and contrast enhancement was noted in the patients with successful and failure of fibrin sealant injection. In conclusion, fibrin sealant injection is a useful alternative treatment in the management of fistula-in-ano. MRI is helpful in delineating the anatomy of fistula-in-ano but not a useful tool to follow-up disease activity.
