To investigate the potential value of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) in evaluating the consistency of brain tumors.

Six patients with known solid brain tumor underwent brain MRE studies. Consistency of brain tumors was evaluated at surgery. Correspondence of MRE evaluation with operative result was studied.

The elasticity of tumors in six patients evaluated by MRE agreed with the tumor consistency given by the operative results.

MRE could be used as an imaging technique for noninvasive assessment of the consistency of brain tumor in vivo.
