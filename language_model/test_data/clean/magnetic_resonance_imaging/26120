We studied the sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance arthrography (MRa) for the diagnosis of lesions of the acetabular labrum in 20 cadaver hips. The MRa results were compared with macroscopic and histological findings. We found that the labrum could be satisfactorily delineated by MRa and that large detachments could be identified satisfactorily. The diagnosis of small detachments and degeneration of the labrum was less reliable.
