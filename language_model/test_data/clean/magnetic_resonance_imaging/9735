To report 4 cases of posterior scleritis with unusually unremarkable ultrasonography findings in which diagnosis was based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination.

Retrospective noncomparative case series.

Four patients.

Patients suffering from suspected posterior scleritis and previously misdiagnosed with a range of conditions after an unremarkable B-scan ultrasonography. A new and thorough review of systems, including MRI examination of the eye/orbit, was carried out.

All included patients were diagnosed with posterior scleritis based on MRI findings. Systemic treatment with immunosuppressors (2 patients), antibiotics (1 patient), or no treatment (1 patient) got their inflammatory condition under control.

MRI may play a potential role in the diagnosis of posterior scleritis particularly in those clinically suspicious cases with nondefinitive ultrasonography. Further studies on this matter are warranted.
