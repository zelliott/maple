Perfusion measurements in lung tissue using arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques are hampered by strong microscopic field gradients induced by susceptibility differences between the alveolar air and the lung parenchyma. A true fast imaging with steady precession (True-FISP) sequence was adapted for applications in flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) lung perfusion imaging at 0.2 Tesla and 1.5 Tesla. Conditions of microscopic static field distribution were assessed in four healthy volunteers at both field strengths using multiecho gradient-echo sequences. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of the frequency distribution for 180-277 Hz at 1.5 Tesla were more than threefold higher compared to 39-109 Hz at 0.2 Tesla. The influence of microscopic field inhomogeneities on the True-FISP signal yield was simulated numerically. Conditions allowed for the development of a FAIR True-FISP sequence for lung perfusion measurement at 0.2 Tesla, whereas at 1.5 Tesla microscopic field inhomogeneities appeared too distinct. Perfusion measurements of lung tissue were performed on eight healthy volunteers and two patients at 0.2 Tesla using the optimized FAIR True-FISP sequence. The average perfusion rates in peripheral lung regions in transverse, sagittal, and coronal slices of the left/right lung were 418/400, 398/416, and 370/368 ml/100 g/min, respectively. This work suggests that FAIR True-FISP sequences can be considered appropriate for noninvasive lung perfusion examinations at low field strength.
