A 14-year-old girl with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented with periorbital swelling of the right eyelid associated with enlargement of the lacrimal gland and cervical lymphadenopathy. Radiographic imaging showed diffuse enlargement and enhancement of the right lacrimal gland. The patient underwent an incisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland that showed atypical lymphocytes consistent with recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The lacrimal gland is a rare extramedullary site for recurrence of this disease.
