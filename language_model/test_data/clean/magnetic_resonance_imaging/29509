Four patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma were treated with a magnetic targeted carrier bound to doxorubicin (MTC-DOX) by using a joint magnetic resonance (MR) imaging/conventional angiography system consisting of a 1.5-T short-bore magnet connected to a C-arm angiography unit by a sliding tabletop. Selective transcatheter delivery of the MTC-DOX to the hepatic artery was monitored by using intraprocedural MR imaging, and interim catheter manipulation was performed with fluoroscopic guidance to optimize agent delivery to the tumor and minimize delivery to normal tissue. The final fraction of treated tumor volume ranged from 0.64 to 0.91. The fraction of affected normal liver volume ranged from 0.07 to 0.30. The dual MR imaging/conventional angiography system shows promise for directing magnetically targeted tumor therapies.
