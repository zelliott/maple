The authors reported the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detection of manganese (Mn) deposition in the basal ganglia of a pancreatoduodenectomized patient following 30-day parenteral nutrition. A multi-trace element supplement solution including 20 micromol Mn/day was parenterally administered for 30 days postoperatively. The serum level of total bilirubin normalized on the 3rd postoperative day, while the level of alkaline phosphatase continued to exceed the higher limit of normal controls even 2 months after operation. T1-weighted MRI on the 49th postoperative day demonstrated bilateral and symmetrical hyperintense lesions in the globus pallidus. The whole-blood Mn level on the 67th postoperative day was 3.1 (normal range 0.8-2.5) microg/l. T1-weighted MRI on the 103rd postoperative day revealed improvement in the hyperintense lesions, and MRI on the 225th postoperative day revealed no abnormality. The blood Mn level normalized on the 194th postoperative day. Even short-term postoperative parenteral nutrition may result in Mn deposition in the brain, especially in patients with cholestasis following pancreatoduodenectomy.
