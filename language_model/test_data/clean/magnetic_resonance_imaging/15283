The aim of the study was to evaluate diastolic function in patients with constrictive pericarditis using velocity-encoded flow measurements before and after pericardectomy.

Velocity-encoded flow measurements were performed at the atrioventricular valves in nine patients with constrictive pericarditis. The resulting flow curves were evaluated. For assessment of diastolic function the amplitudes of the E and A waves were measured and the E to A wave ratios calculated. Appearance of mid-diastolic flow, indicating diastolic dysfunction, was registered.

The measurements at the mitral valves prior to pericardectomy revealed diastolic dysfunction grade I in two patients, grade II in three patients, and grade III in three patients. Mid-diastolic flow was detected in two patients. At the tricuspid valves diastolic dysfunction grade I was present in two patients, grade II in four patients, and grade III in three patients. Improvement of diastolic function after pericardectomy was documented in five patients at the mitral valve and in two patients at the tricuspid valve.

Velocity-encoded flow measurements are feasible and a valuable tool for assessment of diastolic function in patients with constrictive pericarditis prior to and after pericardectomy.
