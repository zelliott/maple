The accuracy of ultra-low field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to medium-field MRI in detecting syringomyelia and associated Chiari malformations is examined. In all cases the size of the syrinxes and the type and extent of the Chiari malformations was clearly shown at low-field MRI. The present spatial solution and high sensitivity allows for low-field imagers to localize even minor morphological changes of the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum.
