We report a case of giant hepatic cavernous hemangioma associated with spontaneous subacute intratumoral hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an oval, homogeneous, high-intensity lesion with a low-intensity rim in the original high-intensity tumor on T2-weighted images. On T1-weighted images, this oval lesion showed heterogeneous high intensity with peripheral higher intensity. The histologic specimen confirmed hepatic hemangioma with intratumoral hemorrhage.
