The study was undertaken to optimize the diagnosis of fetal CNS and facial malformations, by using a complex of ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. A hundred and forty-four fetuses with suspected CNS and facial malformations were examined. The US study conducted by a specially developed protocol was supplemented by MRI (48 fetuses) also made by a specially developed protocol. Various fetal CNS malformations, such as neural tube defects, congenital endbrain malformations, cystic lesions, tumors, ventricular complex anomalies, defects of the face and eyes, multiple defects, including CNS and facial anomalies, were detected. With MRI, the diagnosis was changed in 33% of cases. The application of a complex of US and MRI studies enhances the efficiency of diagnosis of congenital CNS and facial malformations in the fetus. MRI in the diagnosis of fetal CNS and facial malformations has a number of advantages and should be used if there is some difficulty in establishing a diagnosis when an US study is performed.
