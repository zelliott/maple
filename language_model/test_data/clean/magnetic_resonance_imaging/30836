Legionnaires' disease is often associated with neurological findings. Despite such findings, computed tomography and neuropathological investigations are typically normal. This report describes a reversible lesion of the corpus callosum identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a patient with legionnaires' disease. MRI may show previously undocumented neuropathology in acute legionnaires' disease. Legionella pneumophila infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of conditions associated with reversible lesions of the corpus callosum.
