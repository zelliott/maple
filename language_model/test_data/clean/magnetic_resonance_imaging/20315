Due to the actual interest for bioengineering in the osteoarthritis (OA) healing context, researchers need accurate qualitative and quantitative methodologies to evaluate in vivo the integration and functionality of their cartilage-like biomaterials. As in clinical diagnostic strategies, advances in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) seem promising for non-vulnerant assessments of articular cartilage bio-architecture and morphology in small animal models. These experimental models are commonly used to monitor the physiopathology of OA and to evaluate therapeutic responses mediated by chondroprotective drugs or tissue engineering. Nowadays, the application of MR protocols to in vivo small animal cartilage imaging is achievable with the development of high magnetic fields and the adaptation of methodologies to reach the required spatial resolution and contrast. The purpose of this article is to summarize these current MRI strategies used for in vivo small animal articular cartilage assessments.
