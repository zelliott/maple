The case of a 53-year-old female patient admitted to the Emergency department with symptoms from right third cranial nerve of acute onset, is presented. Cranial CT, performed in emergency, documented an intra-axial mass which required an in-depth diagnostic study with cranial MRI after contrast administration. Conventional MRI and DWI helped in correct lesion characterization and in the differential diagnosis with other brain disorders.
