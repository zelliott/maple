To define the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to intradiverticular bladder tumour.

Five cases are reported in which initial diverticulectomy was followed by cystectomy in one case, systemic MVAC chemotherapy in 2 cases and concomitant radiotherapy-chemotherapy (CRC) in 2 cases.

One patient has died (MVAC), one patient is in partial remission (MVAC) and three patients are in complete remission (1 cystectomy and 2 CRC).

Intradiverticular bladder tumour is a disease with a poor prognosis, whose histological features require aggressive treatment. Concomitant radiotherapy-chemotherapy appears to be a useful alternative.
