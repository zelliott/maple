Retroperitoneal enteric duplication cysts (EDC) are rare lesions and its presentation during adulthood is a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. The diagnosis of this condition is established following histopathological analysis, which often requires surgical intervention.

We report a case of a retroperitoneal enteric duplication cysts, presenting as a cystic lesion of the pancreas in a 19-year-old woman.

We recommend surgical intervention for retroperitoneal EDCs due to its potential local complications including pressure effects on surrounding structures and neoplastic change.
