Anorectal and urologic sequelae are observed in long-term survivors of sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT). In this study we evaluate the incidence and predictors of anorectal and urologic complications in SCT.

A retrospective review was performed for all SCT patients who underwent resection at a single institution between 2000 and 2012. Enrollment criteria included a minimum of 12months follow-up. Categorical variables were analyzed by Fisher's exact test and continuous variables by Mann Whitney test (p<0.05).

Forty-five patients were studied. Anorectal complications occurred in 29%, including severe chronic constipation (n=13) and fecal incontinence (n=4). Urologic complications occurred in 33%, including neurogenic bladder (n=12), vesicoureteral reflux (n=5), and urinary incontinence (n=7). Prenatal imaging by fetal MRI demonstrated mass effect with obstruction of the bowel (n=4) or bladder and collecting system (n=7) in a subset of patients with postnatal complications (anorectal 4/4, PPV 100%; urologic 6/7, PPV 86%). Postnatal complications were associated with obstructive findings on prenatal imaging, prenatal therapeutic interventions, Altman classification, perineal reconstruction, and tumor recurrence. No anorectal or urologic complications occurred in patients with Altman type I tumors.

Urologic and anorectal complications are common in patients with SCT. Higher Altman classification and prenatal imaging suggestive of intestinal or urologic obstruction should prompt focused prenatal counseling and postnatal screening for anorectal and urologic dysfunction.
