Angiolipomas of the spinal canal are extremely uncommon benign neoplasms composed of mature lipomatous and angiomatous elements. A case of thoracic spinal extradural angiolipoma producing progressive spinal cord compression in a 54-year old housewife is presented and 74 previously reported cases in the world literature over a period spanning nearly one century from 1890 to the present are analysed. The 75 total cases (46 females and 29 males) ranged in age from 6 to 73 years (mean 42.7, SD 15.9; median 43). The angiolipomas were located in the extradural compartment in 72 patients and intradural compartment in 3; 14 of the extradural lesions infiltrated the surrounding bone (infiltrating subgroup). Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the fat-density lesions in all the cases that we studied. The findings indicate that spinal angiolipomas predominantly affect women. Their preponderance in peri- or postmenopausal women, and their fluctuating clinical course during the pregnancy support a role of hormonal influence on the development of the lesion. They often involve the thoracic region, and produce symptoms and signs of spinal compression and, in some cases, bone involvement. MRI is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis of these lesions. Non-infiltrating angiolipomas can usually be removed easily through a laminectomy, but infiltrating angiolipoma can be only partially resected. However, outcome is not worse in the infiltrating than in the non-infiltrating lesions and appears to be relatively independent of the completeness of the surgical removal. Subtotal resection usually provides substantial symptomatic relief, because these lesions are slow growing and do not undergo malignant transformation. The results of this review show that angiolipomas of the spinal canal have a good prognosis after surgical removal, even if infiltrating.
