No information has been available regarding middle cerebral artery (MCA) dissection occurring as a result of athletics. We describe a case of cerebral infarction in the right MCA region that occurred in young, right-handed tennis player while he was serving. Angiography with a contrast medium and a 3-dimensional rotational system revealed proximal M2 stenosis, and emergency superficial temporal artery-MCA anastomosis was performed. As a result, the patient showed a complete recovery and resumed all activities of daily life, including playing tennis. Because sports such as tennis, in which players vigorously swing their heads while serving, could lead to intracranial artery dissection, we advise that the possibility of MCA dissection should be considered in athletes with certain neurological symptoms, including headache.
