Recent advances in nanotechnology have produced a variety of nanoparticles ranging from semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), metallic nanoparticles, to polymeric nanoparticles. Their unique electronic, magnetic, and optical properties have enabled a broad spectrum of biomedical applications such as ultrasensitive detection, medical imaging, and specific therapeutics. MNPs made from iron oxide, in particular, have attracted extensive interest and have already been used in clinical studies owing to their capability of deep-tissue imaging, non-immunogenesis, and low toxicity. In this Research Highlight article, we attempt to highlight the recent breakthroughs in MNP synthesis based on a non-hydrolytic approach, nanoparticle (NP) surface engineering, their unique structural and magnetic properties, and current applications in ultrasensitive detection and imaging with a special focus on innovative bioassays. We will also discuss our perspectives on future research directions.
