Intramedullary fat-containing benign childhood tumors of the cord include lipomas, dermoid cysts, and teratomas. These are embryonal tumors. Most intramedullary fat-containing tumors are solitary. Multiple intramedullary lipomas are rare and may represent a spinal lipomatous malformation. The presence of another intramedullary dermoid tumor in the same case is rare.

The intent of this case report is to look at magnetic resonance features and possible mechanisms of association of these fat-containing intramedullary tumors.

A 3-year-old male child presented with spastic quadriplegia.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of spine was done on a 1.5-T scanner in different planes.

MRI showed multiple intramedullary spinal lipomas with an intramedullary dermoid involving the conus, cord atrophy, and subarachnoid fat droplets.

Multiple intramedullary lipomas with an intramedullary dermoid represent a form of spinal lipomatous malformation. Both may represent embryogenic mesenchymal inclusions and hamartomatous growth, which can be accurately diagnosed with MRI.
