Traditional methods of reconstruction of the hair-bearing scalp can provide incorrect directional hair growth and may require secondary procedures to complete. We present a case of reconstruction of the anterior hairline after tumour resection in an infant. Lessons learned from the case have led to a novel method for a single stage reconstruction of the anterior hairline using pedicled superficial artery flaps.
