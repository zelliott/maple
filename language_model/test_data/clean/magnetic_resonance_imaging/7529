Septic arthritis of sterno-clavicular joint is a rare entity which is often associated with predisposing conditions like intravenous drug abuse and diabetes. Its prevalence in healthy subjects with absence of medical co-morbidities has been sporadically reported. Due to the rarity of the condition, diagnosis is often delayed predisposing the patients to serious complications. Clinical suspicion supported by haematological and radiological investigations is needed for early diagnosis. Dysphagia as a complication of sterno-clavicular joint infection has not been reported. In this study, we report a case of sterno-clavicular joint infection causing dysphagia and review the literature with regards to aetiology, predisposing factors and treatment options. The aim of this study is to highlight the importance of early diagnosis in suspected cases of septic arthritis of sterno-clavicular joint and institution of intravenous antibiotics.
