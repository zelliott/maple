A multislice spin-lock (MS-SL) pulse sequence is implemented on a clinical scanner to acquire multiple images with spin-lock-generated contrast of the knee joints of six healthy human subjects. The MS-SL sequence produces images with T1rho contrast with an additional factor of intrinsic T2rho weighting, which hinders direct measurement of T1rho. A method is presented to compensate the MS-SL-generated data with regard to T2rho in an effort to accurately calculate multislice T1rho maps in a feasible experimental time. The T2rho-compensated multislice T1rho maps produced errors in the measurement of T1rho in healthy patellar cartilage of approximately 5% compared to the gold standard measurement of T1rho acquired with single-slice spin-lock pulse sequence. The MS-SL sequence has potential as an important clinical tool for the acquisition of multislice T1rho-weighted images and/or quantitative multislice T1rho maps.
