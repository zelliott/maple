To evaluate lateralization of speech production at the level of the Rolandic cortex, functional magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 Tesla, 27 parallel axial slices, EPI-technique) was performed during a speech task (continuous silent recitation of the names of the months of the year). As control conditions, non-speech tongue movements and silent singing of a well-known melody with the syllable 'la' as its carrier were considered. Tongue movements produced symmetrical activation at the lower primary motor cortex. During automatic speech a strong functional lateralization to the left hemisphere emerged within the same area. In contrast, singing yielded a predominant right-sided activation of the Rolandic region. Functional lateralization of speech production therefore seems to include the precentral gyrus as well as Broca's area.
