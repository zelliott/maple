The authors present the use of cortical sulci, segmented from magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and functional data from functional (f)MR imaging and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in the image-guided surgical management of lesions adjacent to the sensorimotor cortex.

In an initial set of 11 patients, sulci near lesions were automatically segmented from MR imaging data sets, then MEG and fMR imaging examinations were performed. Relevant functional information was preoperatively interpreted and selected from MEG and fMR imaging and subsequently transferred to the navigation system for selected sulci. A neuronavigation system consisting of a surgical microscope with enhanced reality overlay display was used. Data were displayed as contours on the cut-plane images of a stereotactic workstation and as contours on the overlay screen of the head-up display within the optical path of the right eyepiece of the surgical microscope.

This method, in which both sulcal and functional mapping are used for surgery planning and neuronavigation, provides helpful information. It is a promising procedure for the treatment of patients who harbor lesions in areas around the eloquent cortex.
