Malignant gliomas encompassing the eloquent areas cannot be removed totally and their surgical extirpation is followed by adjuvant therapy for the residual tumor. Recently, we have employed fibrin glue as a vehicle for the sustained release of ACNU (nimustine hydrochloride) by spray application following subtotal tumor removal in two patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. Follow-up MRI at six months demonstrated no neuroradiological evidence of tumor recurrence in the site of operation. We conclude, this novel mode of intra-operative local chemotherapy by spray application of fibrin glue containing antineoplastic agent is effective in the control of residual tumor progression and may also prevent local recurrence and hence suggests its possible role as an adjuvant therapy in the management of malignant gliomas.
