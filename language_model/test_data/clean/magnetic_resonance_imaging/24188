We studied short interval change of cranial computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer single photon emission computed tomography (99mTc-ECD SPECT) in a case of Wilson's disease. Before treatment, CT scan showed low density changes in the bilateral thalamus and basal ganglia, and MRI demonstrated high intensity in same lesions. 99mTc-ECD SPECT study revealed a hypoperfusion in bilateral thalamus. After 2 months under D-penicillamine therapy, neurological findings had improvement. Hypoperfusion in the thalamus with 99mTc-ECD SPECT significantly improved, whereas abnormal findings of CT scan and MRI persisted. 99mTc-ECD SPECT study may be useful for the planning of the treatment of Wilson's disease.
