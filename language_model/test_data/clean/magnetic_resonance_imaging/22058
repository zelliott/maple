Conventional myelography was compared with a new type of MR technique using a fat-suppressing 3D fast imaging with steady precession (FISP) sequence for diagnosis of the lumbar root compression syndrome. 80 patients with discogenic disease in the lumbar spine were examined with a 1.0-T whole-body MR system (Siemens Magnetom Impact, Erlangen, Germany). A strongly T2(*)-weighted 3D FISP sequence was applied in the sagittal orientation. To obtain fat suppression, a frequency-selective 1-3-3-1 prepulse was applied prior to the imaging sequence. The acquired 3D data set was evaluated using a maximum intensity projection (MIP) program. The measurement time was 7 min, 47 s. Magnetic resonance myelography has significant advantages over conventional myelography, particularly in cases of extreme spinal canal stenosis. Compared with the conventional method, this new MR technique shows comparable sensitivity in the visualization of the spinal nerve roots in the lumbar spine.
