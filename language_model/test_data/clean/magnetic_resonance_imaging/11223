A 25-year-old male presented with an intracranial tuberculoma mimicking falx meningioma manifesting as right lower monoparesis. The patient had a past history of pulmonary tuberculosis, cured by antituberculous therapy. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed a lesion mimicking a falx meningioma. Surgery achieved subtotal resection. Histological and biochemical examinations revealed the surgical specimen was tuberculoma. He was treated with antituberculous therapy, and his gait disturbance disappeared. Follow-up MR imaging showed no regrowth.
