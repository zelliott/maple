The objectives of this article are to provide a pictorial review of labral anatomy and physiology, with particular attention to commonly seen anatomic variants and pitfalls, and to present standard imaging techniques and approaches to MRI interpretation to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of superior labral anteroposterior (SLAP) lesions.

Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of SLAP tears. Knowledge of glenolabral anatomy, related structures and variants, proper imaging techniques, and a systematic approach to MRI interpretation is important in the diagnosis and treatment planning of the 10 types of SLAP lesions. Arthroscopy offers a means for definitive diagnosis.
