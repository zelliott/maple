To describe the presence of prostatic tissue in 46,XX patients with the classical form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH); to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) measured in congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients with regard to the detection of prostatic tissue in pelvic MRI.

We studied 52 children and adolescents, 32 with the classical form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, 10 boys and 10 girls without CAH. Pelvic MRI was performed in all patients to detect prostatic tissue. Prostate specific antigen, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were measured in all patients. We used Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve for PSA discrimination capacity.

Five girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia showed image of prostatic tissue on pelvic MRI. Prostate specific antigen showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 88.9%, respectively, taking 0.1 ng/mL as the cutoff level.

The incidence of prostatic tissue in 46,XX patients with the classical form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia was 15.6%. PSA demonstrated to be a good marker of prostatic tissue in these patients and should be used to screen patients to be submitted to image studies.
