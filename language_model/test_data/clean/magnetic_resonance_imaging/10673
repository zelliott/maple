To report an association between spastic paraplegia type 2 with axonal peripheral neuropathy and apparent proteolipid protein gene (PLP1) silencing in a family.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, custom array comparative genomic hybridization, and semi-quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction analyses were used to examine the PLP1 genomic region.

Electrodiagnostic studies and a sural nerve biopsy showed features of a dystrophic axonal neuropathy. Molecular studies identified a small duplication downstream of PLP1.

We propose the duplication to result in PLP1 gene silencing by virtue of a position effect. Our observations suggest that genomic rearrangements that do not include PLP1 coding sequences should be considered as yet another potential mutational mechanism underlying PLP1-related dysmyelinating disorders.
