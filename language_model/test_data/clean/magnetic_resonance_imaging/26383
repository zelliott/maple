Mucoceles are benign expansive conditions, chronically evolving, from paranasal sinuses. Most frequent localized in the ethmofrontal area and related with sinusal ostial drainage. Maxillary mucoceles are rarer and related with traumatic, tumoral or surgical pathologies, particularly with the Caldwell-Luc incision. These mucoceles demand an aggressive treatment als those etmofrontals in order to achieve a radical exeresis through an outer incision. We report 2 cases of maxillary mucocele. The first was a big one of idiopathic type, the other was associated to an inverted papilloma sitting in the external wall of the affected nasal cavity. Review of the literature in regard of pathogenesis, radiological diagnosis and management of these cases.
