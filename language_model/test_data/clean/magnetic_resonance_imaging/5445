Talo-calcaneal coalitions may be intra-articular or extra-articular in position and may be classified as fibrous, cartilaginous or osseous in morphology. Fibrous coalitions, particularly extra-articular talo-calcaneal coalitions, may have cross-sectional imaging findings that resemble normal anatomic variants, particularly the medial talo-calcaneal ligament and to a lesser extent the presence of an accessory articular facet between the posterior margin of the sustentaculum and postero-medial process of the talus. Typically, in the adult fibrous coalition, there will be some osseous deformity at the entheses, allowing differentiation from a medial talo-calcaneal ligament. The anatomy of the subtalar joint and its ligamentous supports, normal anatomic variations and their corresponding imaging appearance are reviewed in the first part of this article. In the second part, the various forms of talo-calcaneal coalition and their imaging appearance are reviewed.
