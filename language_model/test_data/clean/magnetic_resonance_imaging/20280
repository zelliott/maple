This study aimed to determine the clinical and neuroimaging correlates of the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in stroke patients with age-related confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMH).

The Neuropsychiatric Inventory was utilized to detect the presence of 12 symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify clinical and neuroimaging correlates of the presence of symptoms.

Seventy-seven stroke patients (mean WMH volume: 39.5 cm(3)) were recruited. Thirty patients (39%) had â‰¥ 1 neuropsychiatric symptom. Poor executive function was associated with the presence of any symptoms and symptoms other than depression. More severe left frontal WMH was associated with depression.

Executive dysfunction and left frontal WMH are correlated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in these patients.
