A 30-year-old Caucasian female was admitted with severe biventricular congestive heart failure secondary to cocaineinduced cardiomyopathy. Contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance did not reveal myocardial oedema or focal fibrosis. The systolic ventricular function recovered fully after 10 weeks of abstinence from cocaine and supportive medical treatment. This case report is the first to describe findings with magnetic resonance for this condition, and briefly discusses its potential value in the evaluation of patients with cocaine-induced heart failure.
