MR imaging provides exact measurement of the epiphyseal angle by drawing a ventral tangent to the femoral neck in parasagittal images along the femoral neck. The average MR imaging angle was 49.7 degrees in SCFE. Important information is provided about the activity of the slipping process (reattachment) and the contralateral epiphysis.
