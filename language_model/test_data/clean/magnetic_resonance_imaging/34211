A recurrent aneurysmal bone cyst of the proximal phalanx treated with curettage, cryosurgery, and bone grafting is presented. There is no evidence of recurrence after 5 years. Although cryosurgery is commonly used as an adjuvant for intralesional treatment for aneurysmal bone cyst, there have been no reports of its use for the treatment of a lesion arising in the hand.
