Oxidative stress is revealed as the main contributor in the pathophysiology of neuroinflammation. Analyzing plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with different clinical phenotypes of neuroinflammation, defined as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), and those defined as relapsing remitting multiples sclerosis (RRMS), we tested peripheral and CNS oxidative stress intensity in these neuroinflammatory acute attacks. All obtained values changes were assessed regarding clinical and radiological features of CNS inflammation. The obtained results revealed an increase in malondialdehyde levels in plasma and CSF in CIS and RRMS patients compared to control values (p < 0.05). The obtained values were most prevailed in both study group, CIS and RRMS, in patients with severe clinical presentation (p < 0.05). Measured activities of catalase and total superoxide dismutase were higher in CIS and RRMS patients in plasma compared to control values (p < 0.05), parallel with an increased catalase activity and decrease in superoxide dismutase activity in CSF regarding values obtained in control group (p < 0.05). The positive correlations regarding clinical score were obtained for all tested biomarkers (p < 0.01). Although the positive correlations were observed in MDA levels in plasma and CSF, for both study patients, and their radiological findings (p < 0.01), and a negative correlation in plasma SOD activity and CIS patients' radiological findings (p < 0.01), no other similar correlations were obtained. These findings might be useful in providing the earliest antioxidative treatment in neuroinflammation aimed to preserve total and CNS antioxidative capacity parallel with delaying irreversible, later neurological disabilities.
