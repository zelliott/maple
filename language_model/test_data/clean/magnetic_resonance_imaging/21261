Long wait times for access to Nuclear Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations are a concern and for this reason the project "Appropriateness of referrals for MRI examinations" has been launched in Latium (Italy). The aim of this preliminary study was to describe the main characteristics of MRI referrals in the region. Findings highlight a large variation in referral rates across the region, with 80% of MRI referrals being ordered by general practitioners and family pediatricians. The latter points to the possibility of inappropriate referrals for MRI imaging in Latium.
