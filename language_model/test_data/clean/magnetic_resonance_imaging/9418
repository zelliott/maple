To describe a novel nerve-sparing technique for the resection of intercostal nerve schwannomas. This case demonstrates that intercostal neuralgia can be caused by intercostal schwannomas and that it can be relieved by their removal.

A young woman with schwannomatosis had progressively worsening intercostal neuralgia caused by compression of the intercostal nerve against the rib by tandem intercostal schwannomas. After the tumors were removed, her symptoms were completely relieved. A thoracoscopic technique was used to define the involved fascicles and to facilitate removal of the tumors while sparing the uninvolved nerve.

The patient's radicular pain was relieved completely by the tumor resection. Thoracoscopic surgery offers a safe and minimally invasive technique for removal of intercostal schwannomas and is a valid alternative to open thoracotomy. Removal of thoracic schwannomas can relieve intercostal neuralgia.
