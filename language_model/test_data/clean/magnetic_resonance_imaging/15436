Granular cell tumor is a rare tumor, probably of Schwann cell origin. The head and neck are most frequently affected, but hypopharyngeal lesion is extremely rare. We report the seventh case of hypopharyngeal granular cell tumor. Immunohistochemical staining for S100 protein is helpful for the correct diagnosis. There is some possibility of malignancy despite absence of histological evidence, thus the treatment is exclusively surgical resection. The microlaryngoscopic approach is feasible for hypopharyngeal lesions in most cases. Recurrence can occur even after appropriate resection.
