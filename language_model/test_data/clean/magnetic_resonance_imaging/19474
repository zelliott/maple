The cerebellopontine (CP) angle is bound anterolaterally by the posterior aspect of the petrous temporal bone and posteromedially by the cerebellum and pons. It contains important vascular structures and cranial nerves and is subject to a certain gamut of lesions, notably tumors with interesting radiological manifestations. Radiological investigation of these lesions has seen significant improvement in recent decades. Magnetic resonance is the imaging modality of choice for lesions of the CP angle and internal auditory canal. Lesions of the CP angles usually are divided into those native to the angle (vestibular schwannoma, meningioma, epidermoid, arachnoid cyst, metastases, lipoma, etc.) and those extending to the angle from adjacent structures (gliomas, ependymomas, choroid plexus papillomas, vascular malformations). Vestibular schwannomas are by far the most important lesion of the CP angle.
