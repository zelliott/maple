Brainstem cavernous malformations are associated with a considerable risk of hemorrhage and subsequent morbidity. This study provides a detailed work-up of clinical and radiological outcome as well as identification of prognostic factors in patients who had suffered from symptomatic hemorrhages. Patients who had undergone surgery of symptomatic BSCMs were evaluated pre- and postoperatively both neurologically and neuroradiologically supplemented by telephone interviews. Additionally, patients were scored according to the Scandinavian Stroke Scale. Multiple uni- and multivariate analyses of possible clinical and radiological prognostic factors were conducted. The study population comprised 35 patients. Mean age at operation was 39.3 ± 13.0 years with microsurgical resection of a total of 37 different BSCMs between 2002 and 2011. Median clinical follow-up was 44.0 months (range 8-116 months). Postoperative MRI showed eventually complete resection of all BSCMs. Postoperative overall outcome revealed complete resolution of neurological symptoms for 5/35 patients, 14/35 improved and 9/35 remained unchanged. 7/35 suffered from a postoperative new and permanent neurological deficit, mostly affecting the facial nerve or hemipareses with mild impairment. Pre- and postoperative Scandinavian Stroke Scale scores were 11.0 ± 2.4 and 11.4 ± 2.2 (p = 0.55). None of the analyzed factors were found to significantly correlate with patients' clinical outcome. Complete resection of brainstem cavernous malformations can be achieved with an acceptable risk for long-term morbidity and surgery-related new deficits (~20 %). Neurological outcome is mainly determined within the first 6 months after surgery. Surgical treatment of brainstem cavernous malformations is recommended in symptomatic patients, in whom the lesion is accessible for surgery.
