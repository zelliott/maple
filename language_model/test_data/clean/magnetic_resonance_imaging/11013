Besides conventional x-ray, in the diagnostic work up of initial changes in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 3-phase bone scintigraphy (3P-Sz) is as well established as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The AIM of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of a newly developed low field MRI with proven methods such as conventional x-ray and 3P-Sz.

42 patients were studied using a one days protocol with 3P-Sz, MRI, and x-ray of the hands with yearly follow up examinations. Images were visually assessed by two blinded nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists and classified as RA-typical and non-RA-typical changes. All methods were compared to the summarised findings interpreted by a rheumatologist in consideration of the Ritchie articular index as gold-standard.

24/42 patients presented with clinical symptoms of initial changes by rheumatoid arthritis. Conventional x-ray revealed in 20/24 patients within the correct diagnosis in the study period. On the other hand 3P-Sz and low field MRI concordantly showed all 24 patients with initial changes due to RA. Time of detection showed variations with a tendency to later findings by conventional x-ray.

In the diagnostic work up of initial changes conventional x-ray should be the first choice in imaging. Our findings suggest that MRI represents an equally sensitive method for the diagnosis of initial changes due to RA in the region of the hands as compared to the 3P-Sz. The limitation of the low field MRI is the small field of view, so we prefer 3P-Sz or high field MRI in the diagnosis of patients with suspected RA.
