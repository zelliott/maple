Glucagonomas are rare functional endocrine tumors of the pancreas that classically present with symptoms of glucagon excess, including rash, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, and weight loss. Metastatic disease at presentation is common but is often limited to the liver and regional lymph nodes. We describe an unusual case of a patient with glucagonoma who presented with a pathologic vertebral fracture. This tumor had no evidence of active hormone secretion but tested positive for glucagon by immunohistochemical staining.
