The authors recently managed a case of combined pure esophageal, duodenal, biliary, and pancreatic ductal atresia in a fetus and newborn with Trisomy 21. The authors present a case report and review of the literature, emphasizing the prenatal radiographic features of the combined lesions and the high incidence of associated anomalies including Down's syndrome. Prenatal suspicion of these anomalies warrants karyotype analysis as well as careful pre- and postnatal screening for other anomalies.
