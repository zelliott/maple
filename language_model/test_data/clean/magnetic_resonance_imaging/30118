Using a number of interesting cases, we illustrate how attention to vascular anatomic features and blood flow patterns can facilitate the diagnosis of an orbital lesion. True vascular lesions can be differentiated from nonvascular mimics, and normal variants of the orbital blood flow pattern can be differentiated from pathologic alterations.

Accuracy of radiologic diagnosis can be improved by an understanding of orbital vascular anatomy and blood flow patterns and with optimal use of imaging techniques.
