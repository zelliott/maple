This study was performed to compare two proposed algorithms used when evaluating an adrenal mass discovered during staging evaluation of a patient with a known malignancy. Such evaluation was meant to lead to determination of the relative charges associated with each algorithm.

Fifty-four patients with known malignancies who required evaluation of an adrenal mass underwent both chemical shift imaging (CSI) and CT-guided for CSI. The hospital charges incurred for each procedure and any associated complications were normalized using national relative-value scale charges and conversion factors. A decision analysis was performed to compare the relative charges that would have been incurred if adrenal MR imaging had been performed in all patients, followed by CT-guided biopsy only in those patients with MR findings not diagnostic of adrenocortical adenoma, and the relative charges incurred if only CT-guided adrenal biopsy had been performed in every patient.

Twenty-three (43%) of 54 adrenal masses were shown to be metastases by CT-guided biopsy. The sensitivity and specificity of CSI for the diagnosis of adrenocortical adenoma were 94% and 100%, respectively. The charges incurred by performing MR imaging as the initial examination with subsequent CT-guided biopsy only in those patients with CSI findings not diagnostic of adenoma would have been similar to those incurred by first performing CT-guided adrenal biopsy in every patient.

CSI is an accurate, noninvasive technique for evaluating adrenal masses in patients with cancer. If CT-guided biopsy is used only when CSI is not diagnostic of adrenocortical adenoma, the associated charges would be virtually the same as when CT-guided biopsy is performed as the first test in every patient. Moreover, biopsies could have been avoided in 54% of these patients.
