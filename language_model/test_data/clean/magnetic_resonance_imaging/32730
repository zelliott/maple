We aim to review the current knowledge on diagnosis, clinical features and main management modalities of olecranon bursitis. We underline that the first treatment line is conservative, including ice, rest, anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs and, occasionally, bursal fluid aspiration. In unresponsive patients, although open excisional procedures allow to completely remove the pathological bursal tissue, arthroscopy is increasingly being considered as a suitable new modality of management. These minimally invasive procedures, although not free from complications, avoid the wound problems often occurring following open excision.
