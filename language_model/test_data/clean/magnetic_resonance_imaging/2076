Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides the most detailed evaluation of the sacroiliac (SI) joint and surrounding soft tissue. Therefore, this technique represents the most sensitive and specific method in early diagnosis of infectious sacroiliitis. Among three patients diagnosed as having infectious sacroiliitis in our hospital, the short tau inversion recovery sequence (STIR) was found to be more effective than the T1 contrast-enhanced sequence, particularly in delineating all findings of the SI joint inflammation and allowing for the early detection of septic sacroiliitis.
