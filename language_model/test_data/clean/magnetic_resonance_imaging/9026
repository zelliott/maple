To compare the imaging procedures and surgical strategies used to treat placenta accreta at referral centers in France and Argentina.

A total of 52 women suspected of having placenta accreta underwent ultrasound and placental magnetic resonance imaging evaluations at these centers between May 2003 and October 2006. Findings and management were recorded.

The use of the 2 imaging technologies was similar in France and Argentina and conservative surgical treatment was predominant in both groups. The placenta was left in situ in 64.7% of cases at the French center whereas resection of the placenta and invaded area were performed in 91.4% of cases in Argentina.

The same diagnostic tools were used in the 2 groups, but there were differences in diagnostic accuracy and in the types of surgical procedures performed.
