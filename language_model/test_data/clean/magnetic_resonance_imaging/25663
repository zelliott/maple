In 24 patients with lesions of the achilles tendon MRI and ultrasound was performed to compare the results with clinical examination. MRI had an accuracy of 100%, ultrasound of 90%. Especially partial rupture with chronic degenerative lesions of the tendon can be diagnosed more accurate by MRI which enables easier indication for treatment. By MRI diagnostic differentiation of our patients in four groups was possible.
