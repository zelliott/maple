We report a new strategy for designing a signal off-to-on-type (19)F MRI chemical probe that operates in biological environments. The present strategy is based on the control of adherence of a (19)F MRI chemical probe to certain blood proteins, accompanied by a change in transverse relaxation time of (19)F nuclei.
