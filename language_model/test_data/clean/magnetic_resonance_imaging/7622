The trust region method which originated from the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm for mixed effect model estimation are considered in the context of second level functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. We first present the mathematical and optimization details of the method for the mixed effect model analysis, then we compare the proposed methods with the conventional expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm based on a series of datasets (synthetic and real human fMRI datasets). From simulation studies, we found a higher damping factor for the LM algorithm is better than lower damping factor for the fMRI data analysis. More importantly, in most cases, the expectation trust region algorithm is superior to the EM algorithm in terms of accuracy if the random effect variance is large. We also compare these algorithms on real human datasets which comprise repeated measures of fMRI in phased-encoded and random block experiment designs. We observed that the proposed method is faster in computation and robust to Gaussian noise for the fMRI analysis. The advantages and limitations of the suggested methods are discussed.
