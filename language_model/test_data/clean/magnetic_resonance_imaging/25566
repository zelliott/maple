Mediastinal lymphangioma is a rare benign tumor that is usually seen in anterior mediastimun of the adult. A 15-year-old girl with anterior mediastinal tumor, 10 cm in length, was suspected to have lymphangioma based on magnetic resonance imaging. She underwent tumor resection under video-assisted thoracic surgery. Pathological examination reveled that tumor was composed of lymphatic ducts and smooth muscles, and diagnosis of lymphangioma was established. Both the onset of young age and location of left side of the mediastinum are considered to be unusual.
