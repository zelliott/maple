To evaluate the mandibular canal using volume interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) sequencing in patients with cysts and tumors of the mandible.

Twenty-five patients with mandibular cysts and tumors were recruited for a study in the authors' institution to compare the role of multidetector row computed tomography with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in jaw lesions. Of these 25 patients, VIBE was performed in 12 patients (age range, 16 to 52 yrs; 11 male and 1 female patients) and formed the study group. The status (normal/destroyed/attenuated) and position of the inferior alveolar canal (normal/displaced) on panoramic reconstructed computed tomographic (CT) images and curved multiplanar reformatted (MPR) images reconstructed from VIBE images were analyzed. The contralateral normal mandibular canal was used as the control in these patients.

In all 12 patients, the inferior alveolar canal on the normal side was visualized as a hyperintense structure in relation to the hypointense bone on the curved MPR VIBE images. In 9 patients, the inferior alveolar canal was equally well visualized on panoramic CT and curved MPR VIBE images. In 2 patients, the inferior alveolar canal was better visualized on curved MPR VIBE images; in 1 patient, the course of the mandibular canal was better seen on panoramic CT images.

MR reconstructions with VIBE sequencing as source images provide images comparable to CT reconstructed images for evaluation of the mandibular canal. Three-dimensional (3D) VIBE sequencing can be added to the MR protocol to visualize the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle. 3D VIBE sequencing increases the diagnostic capabilities of MRI when used to image mandibular cysts and tumors.
