This report describes a young patient with a rapidly progressive kyphosis caused by collapse of a severely osteoporotic thoracolumbar spine, which led to impairment of cardiopulmonary function.

To highlight the treatment strategy, difficulty of diagnosis, operative stabilization, and outcome.

Little is known about natural history, treatment options, and results of this condition.

The magnitude of bone loss was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and the deformity was visualized by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Laboratory investigations also were performed before and during halotraction in an attempt to establish a diagnosis. These data constituted the preoperation information required to assess later results of medical and surgical intervention.

An extensive evaluation of possible underlying etiologies failed to identify a specific etiology. Before and during halotraction, bone mineral substitutes were given, partially correcting the bone mineral content as measured on repeated dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans. In addition, the thoracic kyphosis was partially corrected, from 100 degrees to 70 degrees Cobb's angle. Subsequently, a combined anterior and posterior stabilization was performed from C7 to S1 using a vascularized fibula graft, a double Isola rod system (AcroMed, Cleveland, OH), and a carbonate apatite cancellous bone cement to reinforce the pedicle screws. At follow-up assessment 40 months surgery, the patient was asymptomatic and fully mobilized, with radiographs showing complete incorporation of the grafts and no loosening of the fixation device.

The diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties of progressive spine deformity caused by severe osteoporosis in young patients emphasizes the importance of a thoroughly planned treatment strategy. Halotraction is recommended to stop progression of the deformity, or even partially correct it, and to allow time to search for the diagnosis and bone mineral substitution. Surgical treatment using vascularized fibular strut grafts and a strong fixation device was successful. Biocompatible carbonated apatite cancellous bone cement was successfully used to reinforce pedicle screw fixation.
