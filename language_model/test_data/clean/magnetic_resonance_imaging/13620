The objectives were to study the clinical and neurological abnormalities in children with cerebral palsy and to attempt to correlate the signs with radiological abnormalities detected by CT scan and/or MRI of the brain. In a prospective, hospital-based study, 65 children with cerebral palsy were examined neurologically and their perinatal history was reviewed. Their cranial CT scan, and/or magnetic resonance images were studied. The association between the gestational ages, perinatal history, neurological deficits, and the radiological appearances were studied. Of the 24 preterm-born and 41 term-born children, 23 had spastic diplegia; 57 per cent of these children has significant periventricular leucomalacia, which was more common among preterm-born children. Of the 13 children with hemiplegia, 12 had unilateral lesions on neuroimaging. Spastic tetraplegia was associated with extensive, bilateral, diffuse brain damage. Extrapyramidal cerebral palsy was far more common among term-born infants and 80 per cent of these showed significant abnormalities in the basal ganglia region. Ataxic cerebral palsy was an uncommon variety and there was no significant correlation between neurological signs and abnormalities on brain imaging. In conclusion, the radiological findings were closely related to the type of cerebral palsy and the neurological deficit except in the ataxic type. We believe that CT and MRI imaging are helpful in understanding the pathology and the timing of the lesion in cerebral palsy.
