The effective connectivity networks among overlapped core regions recruited by motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) were explored by means of conditional Granger causality and graph-theoretic method, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our results demonstrated more circuits of effective connectivity among the selected seed regions during right-hand performance than during left-hand performance, implying the influences of brain asymmetry of right-handedness on effective connectivity networks. The increased causal connections were found during ME than during MI, suggesting that the ME network may have some additional connections compared to MI networks to execute the overt physical movement. Furthermore, the In-Out degrees of information flow suggested left dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and superior parietal lobule (SPL) as causal sources in ME/MI tasks, highlighting the dominant function of left PMd, IPL and SPL. These findings depicted the causal connectivity of motor related core regions in fronto-parietal circuit and might indicate the conversion of causal networks between ME and MI.
