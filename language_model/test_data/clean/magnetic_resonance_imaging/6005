We here present a 6-month-old girl with cystic hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma and elevated a-fetoprotein (aFP). Following hepatectomy of the left lobe and partial right lobectomy, decline of the serum aFP was observed. The child has been well for 20 years and it is one among a few cases with such a long observational period.
