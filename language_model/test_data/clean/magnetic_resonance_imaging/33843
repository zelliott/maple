During the past decade there has been increasing use of omental transposition to the brain of patients who experienced neurologic sequelae after a cerebral infarction. This paper reports the long-term neurologic effects seen in a patient who underwent omental transposition 31 months after a stroke. Her postoperative follow-up period has been 13 years.

The patient had an expressive aphasia, a right hemiparesis and the inability to read which occurred immediately after her stroke. After surgery she demonstrated subjective and objective improvement in her speech and mobility. She also regained her ability to read shortly after surgery.

The patient demonstrated that omental transposition to the brain can improve neurologic function in the presence of a long-standing cerebral infarction and that the clinical improvement can be maintained over an extended period.
