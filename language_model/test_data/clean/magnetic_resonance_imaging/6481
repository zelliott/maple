This study was undertaken to determine the complication rate in intracranial endoscopic neurosurgery.

The complications in our series of endoscopic intracranial procedures for the treatment of hydrocephalus, colloid and arachnoid cysts, as well as intraventricular tumors, were analyzed.

Although the complication rate in endoscopic neurosurgery is low, severe, rarely even life-threatening, complications may occur. The complication rate decreases markedly with surgical experience, indicating a steep learning curve.
