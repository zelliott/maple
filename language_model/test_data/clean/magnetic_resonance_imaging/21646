Recent advances in modern technologies have enabled us to investigate higher brain functions non-invasively in human subjects. These techniques include topographic analysis of the scalp-recorded electric potentials, recording of the magnetic field generated from the brain, measurement of regional cerebral blood flow changes in association with various forms of activation (activation study), measurement of regional cerebral glucose metabolism, transcranial magnetic stimulation of cortical areas, measurement of chemical change in the brain in association with functional conditions by the use of magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, and dynamic functional MR imaging.
