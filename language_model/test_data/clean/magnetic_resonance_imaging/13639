The aim of this study was to assess cross-sectional imaging features and the value of CT and MRI in primary hemangiopericytoma of bone. In five patients with histologically proven primary osseous hemangiopericytoma CT and MR scans were evaluated retrospectively. Both CT and MRI were available in four patients each. In three patients both imaging techniques were available. On CT primary hemangiopericytoma of bone presents as an expansive lytic lesion with bone destruction and inhomogeneous contrast enhancement. Magnetic resonance imaging depicts osseous hemangiopericytoma as hyperintense lesion on T2-weighted images with intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images. Curvilinear tubular structures of signal void in the tumor matrix on T1-weighted images and corresponding hyperintense structures on T2-weighted and on fat-suppressed short tau inversion recovery images were present in three patients. Although cross-sectional imaging findings are non-specific, they add to the diagnosis and provide valuable information about the extent of bone destruction and local tumor spread in patients with primary osseous hemangiopericytoma. While CT demonstrates the extent of bone destruction best, MRI better visualizes medullary and soft tissue extension of the tumor. Curvilinear signal abnormalities support the diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma of bone. This imaging pattern is best visualized on fat-suppressed or contrast enhanced T1-weighted MR images.
