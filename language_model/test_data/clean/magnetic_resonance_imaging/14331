The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is biological. If ultrasound enables the visualization of certain adrenal tumours or hepatic metastasis, in fact two tests enable the topographic diagnosis, the screening of ectopic localizations and metastasis. They are IMBG scintigraphy and tomographic scanning. The place of magnetic resonance imaging is not yet specified. However, it has many advantages: absence of irradiations, good anatomic precision, meticulous screening of ectopic forms, of metastases and of adenopathies, study of the tissue characterization, good definition of the tumour relation with the vascular pedicles and the neighbouring structures.
