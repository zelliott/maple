When the adrenal gland is calcified but no mass is found, the calcification is usually assumed to be due to prior adrenal hemorrhage. We report a case of adrenal calcification without a noncalcified mass in a child who subsequently presented with neuroblastoma elsewhere. This case has implications for the investigation of children with adrenal calcification.
