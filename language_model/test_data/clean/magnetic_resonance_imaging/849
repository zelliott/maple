Minimally invasive resection of hyperfunctional parathyroid glands is an alternative to open surgery. However, it requires a precise preoperative localization. This study evaluated the diagnostic use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, parathyroid scintigraphy, and consecutive image fusion.

17 patients (9 women, 8 men; age: 29-72 years; mean: 51.2 years) with primary hyperparathyroidism were included. Examination by MRI used unenhanced T1- and T2-weighted sequences as well as contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences. (99m)Tc-MIBI scintigraphy consisted of planar and SPECT (single photon emission tomography) imaging techniques. In order to improve the anatomical localization of a scintigraphic focus, SPECT-data were fused with the corresponding MR-data using a modified version of the Express 5.0 software (Advanced Visual Systems, Waltham, MA). Results of image fusion were then compared to histopathology.

In 14/17 patients, a single parathyroid adenoma was found. There were 3 cases with hyperplastic glands. MRI detected 10 (71%), scintigraphy 12 (86%) adenomas. Both modalities detected 1/3 patients with hyperplasia. Image fusion improved the anatomical assignment of the 13 scintigraphic foci in five patients and was helpful in the interpretation of inconclusive MR-findings in two patients.

Both MRI and (99m)Tc-MIBI scintigraphy sensitively detect parathyroid adenomas but are less reliable in case of hyperplastic glands. In case of a scintigraphic focus, image fusion considerably improves its topographic assignment. Furthermore, it facilitates the evaluation of inconclusive MRI findings.
