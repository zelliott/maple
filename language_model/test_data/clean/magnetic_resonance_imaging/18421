The most common femoral shaft tumours in children are eosinophilic granuloma and Ewing's sarcoma. Three children in the first decade of life with rare femoral shaft tumours are reported. There was one osteosarcoma and two chondrosarcomas. Radiographic differential diagnosis of the femoral shaft tumours and microscopic diagnostic difficulties of chondrosarcoma are discussed.
