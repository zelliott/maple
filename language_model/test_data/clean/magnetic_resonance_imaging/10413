A novel and fast magnetic resonance imaging approach for imaging the optic nerve and the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid sheath is presented. The method provides high contrast between the nerve and cerebrospinal fluid and allows for accurate quantification of the optic nerve and its cerebrospinal fluid sheath diameter within 1.5 seconds scan time. Results of a volunteer study illustrate that measurements can reliably be performed even in the distal part of the intraorbital optic nerve track. Accuracy of quantification of the new technique is demonstrated by the assessment of changes in the optic nerve and CSF sheath diameter between straight gaze and 30 degrees abduction.
