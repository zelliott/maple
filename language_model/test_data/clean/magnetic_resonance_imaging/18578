Cardiovocal syndrome is a rare clinical diagnosis that signifies vocal cord palsy associated with various cardiovascular diseases. The radiological manifestations of six cases of clinically diagnosed cardiovocal syndrome are reviewed retrospectively. The common clinical presentation of these six cases was hoarseness that was due to left vocal cord palsy. By means of chest X-rays (CXR) and cardioangiography, four cases were respectively diagnosed to have atrial septal defect (n = 1), ventricular septal defect (n = 1) and mitral stenosis (n = 2), all of which were associated with a common radiological finding of dilatation of pulmonary trunk. The other two cases were separately diagnosed to have proximal descending aortic saccular aneurysm (n = 1) by means of CXR and angiography, and fusiform ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 1) by computed tomography and magnetic resonance image. All these radiological presentations of either aortic aneurysm or dilated pulmonary trunk were associated with encroachment of aorticopulmonary window for which the left recurrent laryngeal nerve was presumably compressed with the result of left vocal cord palsy. Hoarseness that is caused by these underlying cardiovascular diseases is correctable after treatment of the underlying diseases. Hence, clinicians and radiologists should pay attention to the radiological manifestations of patients whose chief complaints are hoarseness and cardiovocal syndrome.
