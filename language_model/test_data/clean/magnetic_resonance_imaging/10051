A variety of portal vein anomalies that occur in children can be identified by US, CT, MRI and portal venography. Although these abnormalities can also occur in adults, there are certain pathological processes and aberrations within the portal system that are specific to children. Knowledge of the embryology and anatomy of the portal vein is of benefit in the understanding of these anomalies. Identifying deviations from normal portal architecture is important in the work-up for surgery such as liver transplantation, and prior to interventional procedures such as stent placement or embolization. The aim of this paper is to summarize the various types of congenital and acquired portal vein abnormalities that occur in children, describe their radiological features and provide images to demonstrate the differences from normal portal venous anatomy.
