Chordoma that arises along the spinal axis metastasizes to the lung on occasion. Chordoma has been reported to have characteristic cytologic features in fine needle aspiration cytology in primary and metastatic foci.

A 76-year-old female had a tumor on the buttock and tumors in the lung. Exfoliative cytology of the sputum showed cohesive, epithelioid clusters composed of pale-stained, broad cytoplasm with a lacelike pattern, minimal nuclear atypism with anisonucleosis and characteristic mucoid substances.

Cytopathologists should be aware of the possibility of metastatic chordoma when epithelioid tumor cell clusters with benign-looking features embedded in a mucoid substance are detected in aspiration cytology or sputum.
