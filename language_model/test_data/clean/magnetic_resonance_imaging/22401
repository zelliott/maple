Oncocytic neoplasms are a group of rare tumours that mostly affect the parotid gland (80%), sometimes affect the submandibular gland (9%) and rarely affect the intraoral minor salivary glands. The incidence of oncocytic neoplasms represents approximately 1% of parotid neoplasms and bilateral presentation is very rare. Herein we describe a single case involving bilateral presentation of oncocytoma of the parotid glands.
