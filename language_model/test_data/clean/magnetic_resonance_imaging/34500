This study evaluates the magnetic resonance characteristics of spinal epidural abscesses and their associated disc space infections.

The results were correlated with history, clinical, and laboratory findings to provide guidelines for early and appropriate diagnosis of epidural spinal infections.

Imaging signs of spinal infections have been reported before, but not with special attention to early clinical and imaging findings.

Thirteen patients (10 men, 3 women; age range, 32-64 years) with progressive sensorimotor deficit were studied. All patients had a neurologic examination after admission and a magnetic resonance imaging scan done within the first 48 hours. In all cases, T1-weighted images before and after administration of gadolinium were obtained. T2-weighted images were acquired in eight cases as well. Ten patients subsequently underwent open surgery; in three cases, a percutaneous biopsy and drainage was performed.

Cervical discitis was found in five patients, and thoracic discitis was seen in another five cases. Three patients had an epidural infection without a concomitant discitis. Neurologic and clinical findings varied considerably. Despite clinical signs of spinal cord involvement, a spinal cord lesion was demonstrated only once. Signal change in T2-weighted images may be the first sign of disc space infection. Because a neurologic deficit may occur before any change is visible, follow-up examinations may be required if epidural infection is suspected on clinical grounds.

Magnetic resonance imaging is the appropriate method for diagnostic work-up of progressive neurologic deficit resulting from epidural infection.
