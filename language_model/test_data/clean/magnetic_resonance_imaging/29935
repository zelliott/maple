This review of progress in cardiac imaging techniques summarizes the most significant development reported in the last year on different echocardiographic techniques and their application in a range of settings, from the treatment of heart failure to their use in intraoperative monitoring and guiding interventional procedures. Large sections are devoted to recent developments in three-dimensional imaging and, because of its clinical importance, to magnetic resonance imaging. Finally, there is a comprehensive update on the use of multidetector computed tomography in cardiology.
