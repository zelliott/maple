This paper reports on an experimental study of in vivo tissue damage in the rabbit brain with focused ultrasound (FUS) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathological analysis. Ten ultrasonic lesions (tissue damage) were created in five rabbits using a focused ultrasound beam of 1.5 MHz, electrical power input to the transducer of 70-85 W, and an exposure duration of 15-20 seconds. T1- and T2-weighted fast spin-echo (FSE) and Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences were used to detect the ultrasonic lesions after treatment. Imaging was performed for 4-8 hours after treatment, after which the animals were immediately sacrificed. Ultrasonic lesion diameter was measured on MRI and histological sections after correction for tissue shrinkage during the histological processing. The T1-weighted images showed lesions poorly, whereas both T2-weighted and FLAIR images showed lesions clearly. The lesion diameters on both T2 and FLAIR imaging correlated well with measurements from histology. The time delay before lesions appeared on T2-weighted imaging was 15 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the exposure location in the brain. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 1999;10:146-153.
