Gene targeting techniques are a revolutionary tool in determining gene function. The mouse is the only mammal in which these methods can be performed. For morphologic and histologic characterization, a broad armamentarium is available for the mouse. However, for functional studies, the 20- to 25-g mouse provides unique challenges. We have successfully established tail-cuff, intra-arterial, and telemetric blood pressure and heart rate measurements for the mouse. We have also succeeded in measuring renal blood flow, cortical and medullary blood flow, and glomerular filtration rate under various conditions. We have been able to make sophisticated assessments of myocardial performance by using direct intraventricular determinations of pressure and volume. Other investigators have established micropuncture and microperfusion techniques for the mouse. Imaging techniques for the mouse including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are currently feasible. Thus, we will be able to characterize the physiology of any hypertensive mouse model that may become available.
