The purpose of this pictorial essay is to describe magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features of acute processes involving the bowel. While computed tomography (CT) is likely to remain the modality of choice in this setting, the advantages of MR include high soft tissue contrast, lack of ionizing radiation, and the ability to administer gadolinium in patients with a history of allergic reaction to iodinated contrast material. With the increasing utilization of abdominal/pelvic MR, radiologists must recognize the MR features of acute bowel pathology. Key MR findings of a variety of causes of acute abdominal pain are illustrated.
