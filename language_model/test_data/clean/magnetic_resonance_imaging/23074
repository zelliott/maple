The 3T ioMRI in Prague is composed of two independent suites: the operating theatre and the 3T MR suite, both of which can and do work independently. They are connected by a double door and a special transportation system. The whole operating table is moved on rails to and from the MR gantry. Anaesthesiological equipment is built from paramagnetic material, which is also moved to and from the MR suite. The integral parts of the multifunctional surgical suite (MFSS) are the neuronavigation system, electrophysiological monitoring, surgical microscope with availability of indocyanin green angiography and fluorescence-guided glioma resection technique and endoscopy equipment. The operating theatre is equipped in a normal fashion with the exception of a head holder that is paramagnetic. MR radiologist and MR assistants are alerted approximately 30 min before the requested intraoperative and out-patient service is interrupted to clean the MR suite. The ioMRI takes 15-20 min and immediately after the door closes the out patient activity is resumed. Intraoperative MR was performed in 332 surgeries in the first 17 months of operation. The most frequent indications were pituitary adenomas, followed by gliomas. Other indications were less frequent and included meningiomas, cavernomas, aneurysms, epilepsy surgery, intramedullary lesions, non-pituitary sellar lesions, metastases and various other surgeries. In 332 cases no technical or medical complication connected with ioMRI was encountered.
