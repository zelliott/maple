This article reviews the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A summary of the current MRI techniques is included, emphasizing the choice of pulsing sequences, imaging plane, surface coils and intravenous and oral contrast agents for each of the different segments of the GI tract. The multiple available oral contrast agents are reviewed, including the role of both positive and negative. Finally, the major clinical applications of MRI in the GI tract are discussed by major disease categories (congenital abnormalities, inflammatory disease and benign and malignant neoplasms). The latter is further subdivided by GI tract segments such as esophagus, stomach, small bowel and colon.
