Two sibling cases of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with parkinsonism were reported. One was a woman of 39 years old, and another was her sister of 36 years old. In both cases, febrile convulsion appeared on 1.5 year old, and mental deterioration, ataxic -spastic gait, cataract and swelling of Achilles tendons developed in order since entrance into elementary school. Five years ago, while they were in hospital at the first time, they were diagnosed as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis by mental disturbance, cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract sign, histologically xanthomatous granuloma of Achilles tendons and hypercholestanolemia and family history of autosomal recessive trait. After the second admission, parkinsonism was noticed in addition to those findings above. Parkinsonism consisted of the following: Resting tremor of parkinsonian type, mild muscle rigidity of forearm and intrinsic-plus hand were observed in the elder sister, and generalized severe rigidity and bradykinesia in the younger sister. In both cases, brain CT showed the pontocerebellar atrophy, and the bilateral low density area in corona radiata, posterior portion of internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, tegmentum of midbrain and deep matter of cerebellum. Brain MRI also showed abnormal intensity in the same regions as on the brain CT. Administration of anti-parkinsonian drugs was challenged for the parkinsonism. Oral L-dopa test (500 mg) moderately improved parkinsonism in both cases. Therapy of diphenylpyraline hydrochloride (10 mg/day) entirely inhibited parkinsonian tremor and mild rigidity in the elder sister but was less effective for severe rigidity in the younger sister than administration of L-dopa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
