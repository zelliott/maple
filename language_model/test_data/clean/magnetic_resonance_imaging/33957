We report two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments which reveal a cortical network activated when perceiving coloured grids, and experiencing the McCollough effect (ME). Our results show that perception of red-black and green-black grids activate the right fusiform gyrus (area V4) plus the left and right lingual gyri, right striate cortex (V1) and left insula. The ME activated the left anterior fusiform gyrus as well as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and in common with colour perception, the left insula. These data confirm the critical role of the fusiform gyrus in actual and illusory colour perception as well as revealing localized frontal cortical activation associated with the ME, which would suggest that a 'top-down' mechanism is implicated in this illusion.
