Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is a rare but highly malignant tumor of soft tissues often appearing as a small tender mass in the deep tissues of the distal extremities. We have studied 17 patients with such lesions treated since 1986 and have a high incidence of local recurrence and metastasis with a survival rate of only 47% despite surgery and for many of the patients, adjuvant therapy. The purpose of this article is to warn the readers of the dangers related to treating this seemingly benign lesion and urge them to perform wide surgery and utilize adjuvant therapy.
