We describe 4 patients, 2 with multiple myeloma and 2 with Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia, who developed arthritis due to invasion of articular and periarticular structures by malignant cells. Articular manifestations in lymphoplasmacytic disorders are most often related to metabolic or septic complications, sometimes to immunoglobulin deposits, but can also result from tumoral joint involvement.
