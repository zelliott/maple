A 54-year-old female presented with a presternal abscess and developed axillary lymphadenopathy. Imaging confirmed the presence of sternal osteomyelitis. The osteomyelitis was cured by resection and muscle flap reconstruction. Although tuberculosis was suspected, the organism was only cultured after the fourth surgical procedure. Surgeons should be aware that negative microbiology does not exclude a diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
