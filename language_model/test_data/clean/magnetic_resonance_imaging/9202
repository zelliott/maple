In this article, we review recently published data on the role of the insula in refractory partial epilepsy and summarize our own experience in the investigation and treatment of this entity. Case studies and evoked responses obtained from insular cortical stimulation reveal a wide array of clinical manifestations which may mimic temporal, frontal or parietal lobe seizures. Clinicians should hence lower their threshold to sample the insula with intracerebral electrodes. Lack of recognition of insular seizures may explain part of epilepsy surgery failures. Advances in microneurosurgery open the way to safer insular resection.
