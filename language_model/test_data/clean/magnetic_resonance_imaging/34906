To report a case of orbital foreign body granuloma formation, mimicking tumor recurrence, secondary to the use of Avitene after enucleation for intraocular retinoblastoma.

Eight months after undergoing enucleation for retinoblastoma, a 21-month-old boy underwent a biopsy of an orbital mass.

Histopathologic examination of the orbital biopsy specimen disclosed a proliferative granulomatous foreign body reaction surrounding multiple foci of a coarse fibrillar intercellular substance consistent with Avitene. No retinoblastoma cells were present.

A foreign body reaction should be included in the differential diagnosis of orbital mass lesions after surgery in which Avitene is used.
