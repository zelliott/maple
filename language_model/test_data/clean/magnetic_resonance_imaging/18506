The present study shows that for assessment of LVEF, MRI and the standard methods seem to provide information of similar value. For absolute volume measurements, MRI and RNA are superior to single plane angiography and 2 DE using the modified Simpson-rule. The time consuming transversal MRI method does not seem to be superior to the oblique multislice method, when apical aneurysms can be ruled out. MRI thus seems to be an accurate method for determination of LV stroke volume as well as for determination of LVEF and hence for diastolic and systolic volumes. MRI, however, depends of a good image quality, which is crucial especially in dilated ventricles containing stagnant or slowly moving blood.
