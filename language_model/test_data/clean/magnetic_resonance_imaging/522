The authors report a case of navigation-guided tumour ablation of a high-grade epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of the right parotid gland extending to the skull base. Immediate functional reconstruction of the mandible with a prosthetic temporomandibular joint and facial nerve was performed. Postoperative follow-up showed no evidence of local tumour recurrence or distant metastasis with satisfactory temporomandibular and facial nerve function.
