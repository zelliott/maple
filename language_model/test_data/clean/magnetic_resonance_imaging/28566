The aim of the suppression of pituitary adrenal axis in the management of patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia is to reduce the hypersecretion of adrenal androgens. However, the local consequences of the hyperreactivity of corticotropin cells during inadequate therapy is not well defined. In this case report, we present the observation of a 28-year-old patient with congenital adrenal hyperplasia with inadequate treatment in whom a pituitary enlargement was detected after MR imaging for headaches. This observation underlines the need for a pituitary follow-up in these specific patients.
