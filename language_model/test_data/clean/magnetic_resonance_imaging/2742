Chronic posttraumatic thoracic aortic aneurysms are rare. The natural history of these aneurysms is symptomatic enlargement. Herein is reported a chronic posttraumatic thoracic aortic aneurysm that became symptomatic by producing extrinsic compression of the esophagus. Despite the chronic nature of these aneurysms they should be repaired when found.
