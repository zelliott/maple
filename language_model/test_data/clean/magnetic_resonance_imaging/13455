Fast gradient echo (GE) MR imaging during breathhold was performed in 73 abdominal MR examinations in order to determine the value of GE technique in the reduction of movement artefacts and improvement of image quality. The results were compared with conventional spin-echo (SE) technique. T1-weighted SE images consistently demonstrated normal anatomy and pathology. T2*-weighted and intermediate GE technique proved to be superior to T2-weighted SE technique in a considerable number of cases providing not only better delineation of normal structures but also better lesion detection. At this stage GE technique should be considered as an adjunct to T1-weighted SE technique. If the artefacts presently inherent to GE imaging could be reduced or compensated for, this technique of rapid MR imaging during suspended respiration could become an important tool being one of the fastest techniques for abdominal MR imaging.
