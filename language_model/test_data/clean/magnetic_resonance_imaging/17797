We aimed on identifying the differences of febrile and afebrile seizures associated with mild rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) in the pediatric population.

Medical charts of pediatric patients who had been admitted between July 1999 and June 2011 due to RVGE were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects were ultimately divided into three groups; 'no seizure' (NS: patients without seizure), 'febrile seizure' (FS: patients with fever during seizure), 'afebrile seizure' (AFS: patients without fever during seizure). Comparisons between groups were carried out on demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, electroencephalogram findings, brain magnetic resonance imaging findings, antiepileptic treatment, and prognosis.

Among the 755 subjects who had been admitted due to mild rotavirus enteritis, 696 (90.3%) did not have any seizures, 17 (2.2%) had febrile seizures, 42 (5.5%) had afebrile seizures. The duration of gastrointestinal symptoms before the onset of seizures were significantly shorter in the FS group compared to the AFS group (1.3±0.8 vs. 2.8±1.0 days; p<0.0001). A single seizure attack was significantly higher in the AFS group (3.0±1.6 vs. 1.7±1.0 episodes; p=0.0003), and the frequency of seizures that were of focal type with or without secondary generalization were significantly higher in the AFS group (33.3% vs. 6.0%; p=0.0139). All patients among the FS and AFS group had not received further antiepileptic treatment after discharge, and none developed epilepsy during follow up period.

Despite some differences in seizure characteristics, both febrile and afebrile seizures associated with mild RVGE were mostly benign with a favorable prognosis.
