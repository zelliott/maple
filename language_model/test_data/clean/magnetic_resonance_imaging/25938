Due to their cost effectiveness and accessibility, computed tomography (CT) scans are being utilized when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appears to be the diagnostic technique of choice. Because of their availability, CT scans are still used for diagnosis of disc herniations. MRI may, however, be superior in its specificity. In taking into account the subjective complaint and orthopedic and neurological findings, a disk herniation can often be diagnosed without a CT scan or MRI. However, should the patient fail to respond to conservative care or show unusual symptoms, an MRI is indicated. This article discusses a case where MRI would be the imaging procedure of choice.
