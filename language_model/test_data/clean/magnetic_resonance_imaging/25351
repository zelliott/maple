A paraganglioma is an extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma, rarely observed during pregnancy. Maternal prognosis depends on early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management prior to tumor resection. The tumor is localized by ultrasonography or MRI. During the post-partum, and if MRI is not available, CT is often sufficient. We report a paragangliona in a patient with intrauterine fetal demise at 27 weeks gestation diagnosed by ultrasonography and computed tomography, who underwent surgical resection.
