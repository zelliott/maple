Cellular schwannomas are a benign variant of classic schwannomas. Their histologic appearance closely mimics that of malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumors, which are high-grade sarcomas. In this article, we describe what to our knowledge is the first reported case of a cellular schwannoma of the paranasal sinuses and only the 33rd reported case of any schwannoma at this site. We also discuss the histology and management of cellular schwannomas and review the pertinent literature.
