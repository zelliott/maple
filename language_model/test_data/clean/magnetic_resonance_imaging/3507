Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an uncommon but noteworthy primary pediatric renal malignancy. There is a paucity of published data regarding the CT/MRI appearances and accuracy of pretreatment radiologic staging of this form of cancer in children.

To review the various CT/MRI appearances of pediatric RCC and assess the accuracy of pretreatment radiologic staging using these imaging modalities.

Institutional Departments of Pathology and Radiology records were searched from 1995 through 2010 for children (younger than 18 years of age) with RCC. Available pretreatment contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT and MRI examinations were reviewed by two radiologists. Pertinent imaging findings were documented by consensus, and correlation was made between radiologic and surgicopathological TNM staging.

Pretreatment imaging studies from 10 RCCs in nine children (four girls and five boys; mean age 12.9 years) were reviewed. The mean size of the primary tumor was 6.2 cm (range, 1.5-12.6 cm). Ninety percent of RCCs demonstrated heterogeneous postcontrast enhancement. Fifty percent of masses had associated hemorrhage, while 40% contained internal calcification. Regarding TNM staging, N staging was correct for 10 of 10 tumors, while M staging was correct for 10 of 10 tumors. Imaging correctly staged only 4 of 10 tumors with respect to T stage. Radiologic and surgicopathological overall staging were concordant for 8 of 10 tumors.

Pediatric RCCs typically present as large, heterogeneous masses, and they commonly hemorrhage and contain internal calcification. Radiologic and surgicopathological overall TNM staging are frequently concordant, although radiologic T staging is often incorrect.
