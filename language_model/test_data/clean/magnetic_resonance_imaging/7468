The aim of this prospective study of patients with breast cancer was to identify non-responders to docetaxel in neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET).

We analyzed the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of (18)F-FDG-PET before and after the first course and the reduction rate in tumor size shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before the first and after the fourth course of docetaxel.

None of the eight patients (0%) whose SUVmax decrease was less than 18% revealed a clinical partial response or clinical complete response; Seven out of the sixteen patients (44%) with an SUVmax decrease over 45% achieved a complete response.

An SUVmax reduction rate less than 18% is observed in patients with breast cancer after the first course of docetaxel in NCT and may be indicator of non-response to docetaxel.
