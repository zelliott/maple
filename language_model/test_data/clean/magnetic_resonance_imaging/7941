To evaluate the additional value of dobutamine stress testing in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) by relating stress imaging parameters at baseline to relevant parameters of clinical condition and right ventricular (RV) size during a serial follow-up.

We prospectively included 27 patients (14 ± 4 years at baseline), who were studied twice with a 5-year interval. Patients underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to assess RV systolic and diastolic function at rest and during dobutamine stress. Normal response to dobutamine was defined as a decrease in RV end-systolic volume, and a increase in RV ejection fraction (EF) during stress. Exercise testing and electrocardiography were performed to determine peak oxygen uptake (peak VO₂), QRS duration, and QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval. RV volumes, QRS duration, and QTc interval increased significantly from baseline to follow-up; peak VO₂ tended to decrease (95 ± 20-89 ± 14%, P = 0.086). Response to dobutamine was normal in 26 of 27 patients and remained stable during the follow-up [relative increase in RVEF during stress: +25 ± 9% (baseline) vs. +27 ± 10% (follow-up)]. A smaller relative increase in RVEF during stress at baseline related to a larger relative decrease in peak VO₂ during the follow-up (r = 0.59, P = 0.004). No significant associations were found with the relative increase in QRS duration, QTc interval, or RV end-diastolic volume during a 5-year follow-up.

In a young TOF population, response to dobutamine stress was normal and remained stable during the 5-year follow-up. A smaller increase in RVEF during stress at baseline was predictive for a larger decrease in peak VO₂ during the 5-year follow-up.
