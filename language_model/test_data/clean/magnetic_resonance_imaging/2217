Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH) is a rare benign reactive lesion usually found in thrombosed subcutaneous blood vessels. It uncommonly occurs in the central nervous system and may be mistaken for a more malignant type of tumour such as angiosarcoma. We present a first case of multiple IPEH occurring intracranially in a 51-year-old woman. She developed neurological compromises secondary to the mass affect of the haematoma arising from one of the lesions. Prompt surgical evacuation of the haematoma stabilized her condition. Surgical treatment, pathological findings, radiographic characteristics, and a review of the literature are presented.
