Metastasis to bone from endometrial adenocarcinoma is rare, when metastasises it usually locates in axial skeleton. Metastasis to extremities is extremely rare. Additionally the detection of the bone metastasis as a presenting feature is uncommon. In the present study we report the 10th cases of bone metastasis in the literature which located at tibial diaphysis and originated from endometrial adenocarcinoma as a presenting feature of the primary disease.

Single tibial lesion was observed in a 70 years old woman. Biopsy confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the unknown origin. We couldn't find the primary origin with aggressive work-up. Tibial lesion regressed with radiotherapy. Endometrial adenocarcinoma is detected after the end of disease-free one year with the symptom of vaginal bleeding. After 47 months from initial tibial lesion and 35 months from gynaecologic operation, patient is still alive and disease free.

Patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma presenting an isolated skeletal metastasis may exhibit an unusual group with a better prognosis.
