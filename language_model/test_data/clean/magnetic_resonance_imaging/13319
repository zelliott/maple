Excavated optic disk anomalies, such as morning glory disk anomaly, peripapillary staphyloma, and optic disk coloboma, are rare. Contractile movement of a given lesion is even rarer. Only 4 patients with morning glory disk anomalies accompanied by contractile movement have been reported. We offer a computerized analysis of the contraction, observable on a video recording of a patient with this disorder, with an explanation of the possible pathogenesis of the disorder.
