To investigate the influence of diabetes mellitus on higher cognitive functions electrophysiologically, we studied auditory P300 event-related potentials (P300) in 40 NIDDM patients, taking into account wave I-V latencies (I-V) in auditory brainstem evoked potentials, clinical parameters and head MRI findings. Compared with 20 controls, diabetics had significantly longer P300 and I-V latencies. P300 latencies in diabetics correlated with neither I-V, HbA1, blood glucose levels, nor disease duration. Of the 13 diabetics investigated neuroradiologically, four had lacunar infarcts with prolonged electrophysiological values. The remaining nine had normal MRI scans, but their physiological parameters were still significantly longer than those of controls. These findings suggest that NIDDM can independently alter higher cognitive and the central auditory pathway functions. Our data also suggest that these alterations occur regardless of the recent metabolic derangement and disease duration. Cerebrovascular ischemia, if present, also appears to contribute in part to cognitive alterations.
