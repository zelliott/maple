Review Mayo Clinic experience of localized tongue amyloidosis.

Case series with retrospective chart review.

Academic medical center.

Cases of localized tongue amyloidosis were identified from the dysproteinemia database at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Electronic records were reviewed with focus on presenting symptoms, laboratory results (ie, serum or urine immunoelectrophoresis, bone marrow biopsy, and fat aspirate analysis), treatment modality, and status of disease at follow-up.

Six cases of localized tongue amyloidosis presented to the Mayo Clinic between 1969 and 2011. Mean patient age was 69 years (range, 43-90). Patients presented with asymptomatic tongue mass(es). Biopsy of the tongue mass in all patients showed amyloid on Congo red stains. Work-up for systemic amyloidosis, including bone marrow biopsy, fat aspiration, and serum and urine protein immunoelectrophoresis, was negative for all 6 patients, nor was there other organ involvement. Two patients underwent resection of the lesions, and the remaining patients elected for observation. Recurrence requiring repeat excision occurred in 1 of the patients that underwent resection. Repeat evaluation for systemic involvement was performed in 3 patients 1 to 3 years after the initial diagnosis. None of these patients went on to develop systemic involvement.

Localized tongue amyloidosis remains a rare diagnosis and requires exclusion of systemic involvement. Localized lesions may be observed or resected; however, recurrence may occur with resection. Patients with localized tongue amyloidosis do not appear to be at increased risk of developing systemic involvement.
