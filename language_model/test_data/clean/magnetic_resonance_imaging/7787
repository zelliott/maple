Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) is a low-grade neoplasm of the choroid plexus that typically occurs in childhood and comprises under 1% of adult brain tumors. In this article, we report our experience delivering craniospinal irradiation (CSI) to a highly unusual case of disseminated CPP in an adult patient 8 years after an initial near total resection. The patient remains free of disease progression 3 years after completing radiation.
