Central neurocytoma (CN) is a rare, benign tumour of neuronal differentiation which affects young patients and is generally found in the lateral or third ventricles. Its radiological features are non-specific and, in the past, these tumours were confused with other intraventricular lesions. Only recently, thanks to their characteristic features on immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, have they been recognized as a separate entity. We present the clinico-pathological features of five cases of CN treated at our Institution between 1986 and 1994. The importance of diagnostic suspicion, total microsurgical excision and the role of radiotherapy is discussed.
