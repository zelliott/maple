The diagnostical possibilities of the RM in the study of the odontogenic myxoma at extensive diffusion in the upper maxilla are examined. Owing to its complexity and to close connections with the surrounding soft tissues, the midfacial region makes the conventional means of imaging difficult and inadequate. Really the tumor have very high local aggressivity. Where it is much bulky, invades diffusely the cavitary components, damages their walls with laminar structure, insinuates itself among the soft tissues of the jugal, pterygo-maxillary and infraorbital regions, taking up gorges where it slips the classical clinical an also the conventional instrumental diagnostics. The AA. have verified the utility of the MR imaging to the definition of the limits of the tumor, which makes the surgery more adequate to the necessities of an oncological treatment tending both to the radicality and to conservation of structures with high morphological and functional complexity.
