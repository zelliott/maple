We report the case of a 74-year old man who experienced two transient cerebral ischaemic accidents at 24 days' interval, showing that the isolated calcifications on chordae of the mitral valve posterior leaflet responsible for these accidents were exceptionally malformed. Two-dimensional echocardiography was the key examination, as it revealed a left intraventricular mass beneath the smaller mitral valve leaflet. Having excluded other cardiac causes of cerebral ischaemic accident, and faced with the recurrent character of these accidents, we decided to operate. Surgery confirmed the diagnosis. It consisted of resection of the calcified and ulcerated mass, combined with repair of the smaller mitral valve leaflet. Isolated calcifications of the mitral valve chordae are an exceptional cause of embolic accidents of cardiac origin.
