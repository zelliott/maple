We report a photographically documented false-positive edrophonium test in a patient with a histologically verified brainstem glioma. While a positive response to intravenous edrophonium should usually be regarded as confirmatory for myasthenia gravis, the possibility of a false-positive test must be considered in patients with atypical physical findings.
