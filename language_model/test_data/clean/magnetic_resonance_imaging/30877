A 16-year-old boy presented to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences hospital with signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. A CT scan showed obstructive hydrocephalus from a large posterior third ventricle mass lesion. The patient underwent a subtotal resection of the tumour, followed by radiotherapy. Histological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features of the tumour were consistent with primary malignant rhabdoid tumour. The age of presentation and location of the lesion were unusual.
