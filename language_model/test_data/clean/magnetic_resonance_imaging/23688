The bone marrow of the whole body was imaged by MRI in five normal volunteers. The fast short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence and sequential imaging using a moving-table system made sagittal and coronal whole body marrow imaging possible within an examination time of 10 minutes. The images obtained showed high resolution and reflected normal red and yellow marrow distribution in all subjects. Additional abnormalities including humeral bone cyst, hepatic cavernous hemangiomas, and maxillary retention cyst were detected. Fast STIR with the table-moving technique was considered a suitable method for rapid bone marrow survey.
