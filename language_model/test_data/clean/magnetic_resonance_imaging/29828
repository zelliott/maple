The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is often performed at the end of a routine MRI examination during which, dependent on the clinical indication, contrast agent has been administered; however, the effects of Gd-DTPA injection on the results of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-fMRI remain unknown. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of the intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA on the results of pre-surgical localization of the primary motor cortex by BOLD-fMRI at 3 T. Eight normal subjects were included in this study. After the anatomical scans, pre- and post-contrast fMRI scanning was performed. The number of significantly activated voxels and the mean percentage signal change were compared. The mean number of significantly activated voxels was 115.0+/-27.0 in pre-contrast runs and 90.8+/-27.1 in post-contrast runs (mean value of all 8 volunteers+/-standard deviation; p<0.05). The mean mean percentage signal change was 4.07+/-0.39 in pre-contrast runs and 3.86+/-1.91 in post-contrast runs ( p=0.16). Pre-surgical localization of the motor area by BOLD-fMRI should be performed before the administration of Gd contrast material.
