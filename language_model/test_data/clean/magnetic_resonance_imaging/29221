Four patients had anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP) as a manifestation of pontine infarction in the mediolateral region. Patients with AHP syndrome had no mental and neuropsychologic disturbances, and all had involvement of the medial or lateral part of the pons (medial or lateral pontine reticular nuclei). Brainstem lesions, which activate frontoparietosubcortical areas, may be a critical factor in the development of AHP syndrome.
