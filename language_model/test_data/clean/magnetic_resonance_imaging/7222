A 54-year-old female presented with multiple intracranial metastases following malignant transformation in the third recurrence of pleomorphic adenoma of the left lacrimal gland, 25 years after the first surgical treatment. The preoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated direct invasion of the orbital tumor into subdural and epidural spaces in the ipsilateral frontotemporal region and also an intracerebral metastasis in the ipsilateral parietal lobe. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed features of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, suggesting carcinomatous changes. The relevant literature is reviewed.
