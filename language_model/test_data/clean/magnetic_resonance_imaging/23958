We studied auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in correlation with Rey's auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) in an amnesic patient with a left temporal lobe lesion. On the AVLT, the number of words recalled was limited to immediate memory capacity (nine words) throughout five trials, and recall after interference was remarkably decreased. In the ERPs, the P300 component was elicited normally, but no N400 component was apparent. Present findings suggest that these two ERP components may be associated with independent processes and support the view that the N400 may index a neural process involved in transfer of information from immediate memory to long-term storage.
