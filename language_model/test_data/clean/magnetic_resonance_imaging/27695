The aim of this study is to analyze the proportional distribution of epilepsy and epileptic syndromes in children and to describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities found in these patients.

Data from 457 children aged 1 month to 15 years at the time of diagnosis of epilepsy were recorded. A routine MRI has been requested in all patients with epilepsy at diagnosis according to a standardized pediatric seizure protocol. Abnormalities on MRI were classified as either significant or non-significant (standardized scoring system). International League Against Epilepsy criteria were used for diagnoses.

The prevalence of significant MRI abnormalities was 21.9% (in infants 42.3%, in childhood 18.2%, and in adolescents 15.9%). The most common abnormalities included white-matter lesions (27.6%), volume loss (19.6%), gray-matter lesions (19.6%), and ventricular enlargement (12%).

The use of MRI and a reliable standardized scoring system at diagnosis of epilepsy in children identified a high rate of significant abnormalities findings. This may have important implications for practice guidelines in this population.
