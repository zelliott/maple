We report a case of total spinal cord disruption confirmed surgically. The spinal cord injury resulted from a traumatic event involving the thoracic spine which did not provoke any bone lesion. The patient presented joint injury and unilateral ligament damage. No spinal fracture was observed. In patients with neurological signs, the imaging work-up should associate CT-scan and magnetic resonance imaging to obtain a complete study of the bone and joint structures as well as the ligaments and the spinal cord.
