A 70-year-old man presented complaining of lid and facial drooping and facial numbness, which progressed over several months. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed an enlarged right cavernous sinus. His past medical history was remarkable to squamous cell carcinoma of the face. The patient underwent a craniotomy with biopsy of the cavernous sinus that confirmed malignancy. High index of suspicion in a patient that presents facial drooping and/or numbness should alert ophthalmologists about the occurrence of perineural spread of a previous malignant lesion of the skin.
