We report a functional application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the quantitative description of left ventricular geometry through systole and diastole in normal anaesthetized Wistar rats that might be applicable for the analysis of chronic changes resulting from pathological conditions. Images of cardiac anatomy were acquired through planes both parallel and perpendicular to the principal cardiac axis at times that were synchronized to the R wave of the electrocardiogram. The images of the transverse sections were assembled into three-dimensional representations of left ventricular geometry at consecutive time points through the cardiac cycle. This confirmed the geometrical coherence of the data sets, that each slice showed circular symmetry, and that the images were correctly aligned with the appropriate anatomical axes. Different models for the three-dimensional geometry of the left ventricle were then tested against the epi- and endocardial surfaces reconstructed from images of the transverse sections of the left ventricle in both systole and diastole using least-squares minimizations in three dimensions. In agreement with previous reports in the human heart, an elliptical figure of revolution offered an optimal fit to the epicardial and endocardial geometry for the rat heart in diastole. This was in preference to models that used spherical, quartic or parabolic geometries. However, in contrast to contraction in the human heart, all these geometrical representations broke down during systolic ejection in the rat heart. We therefore introduced a more general hybrid model which described left ventricular geometry in terms of the variation of the radii r(z), independently determined for each slice, with its position z along the principal cardiac axis. The resulting function r(z) could then be described by a simple ellipsoid of revolution not only during diastole, but also throughout ventricular ejection. The findings also ruled out alternative geometrical representations. It was then possible additionally to reconstruct the luminal and total left ventricular volumes, wall thicknesses and ejection fractions through the cardiac cycle and to confirm that the predicted total ventricular wall volume was conserved throughout the cardiac cycle. Our hybrid model of cardiac geometry may thus be useful for non-invasive serial studies of chronic pathological changes that use the rat as a model experimental system.
