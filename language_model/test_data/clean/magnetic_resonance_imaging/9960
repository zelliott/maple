The skeletal elements (spicules) of the demosponge Lubomirskia baicalensis were analyzed; they are composed of amorphous, non-crystalline silica, and contain in a central axial canal the axial filament which consists of the enzyme silicatein. The axial filament, that orients the spicule in its longitudinal axis exists also in the center of the spines which decorate the spicule. During growth of the sponge, new serially arranged modules which are formed from longitudinally arranged spicule bundles are added at the tip of the branches. X-ray analysis revealed that these serial modules are separated from each other by septate zones (annuli). We describe that the longitudinal bundles of spicules of a new module originate from the apex of the earlier module from where they protrude. A cross section through the oscular/apical-basal axis shows that the bundle rays are organized in a concentric and radiate pattern. High resolution magnetic resonance microimaging studies showed that the silica spheres of the spicules in the cone region contain high amounts of 'mobile' water. We conclude that the radiate accretive growth pattern of sponges is initiated in the apical region (cones) by newly growing spicules which are characterized by high amounts of 'mobile' water; subsequently spicule bundles are formed laterally around the cones.
