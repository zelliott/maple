Scapular clicking with shoulder motion has been described for a variety of conditions. Two unusual cases, a lymphangioma of the thoracic wall in a 42-year-old man and an aneurysmal bone cyst of the scapula in an 8-year-old boy, are presented. The lymphangioma was treated by marginal excision of the lesion and the aneurysmal bone cyst, by excision of the infraspinal portion of the scapula with resolution of symptoms.
