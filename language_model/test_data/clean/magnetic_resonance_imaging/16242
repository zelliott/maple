Tumor necrosis factor alpha was recently implicated as an important mediator of communication between the peripheral and cerebral immune systems in an animal model of chronic inflammation. The purpose of this study was to examine by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) the influence of inflammation on cerebral metabolism in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Single-voxel (1)H-MRS of the centrum semiovale was performed on 35 RA patients (6 men and 29 women; mean +/- SD age 51.8 +/- 14.6 years) and 28 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects (9 men and 19 women; mean +/- SD age 50.2 +/- 10.4 years). None of the study subjects had any neurologic signs or symptoms. Clinical markers of disease activity were correlated with the (1)H-MRS findings.

Patients with active RA, as reflected by an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), had a significantly higher ratio of choline to creatine and a significantly lower ratio of N-acetylaspartate to choline than did patients with inactive RA, as reflected by a normal ESR. Moreover, the ratios of choline to creatine and NAA to choline were significantly correlated with the ESR after correction for age, sex, smoking status, handedness, alcohol consumption, medication use, and disease duration. Medication use had no additional effect on these associations.

Our data show that systemic inflammation in RA is associated with metabolic changes in the brain.
