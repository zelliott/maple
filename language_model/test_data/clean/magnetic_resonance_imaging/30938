The latest innovation in MR imaging is SENSE (SENSitivity Encoding), a technology providing an important solution for the time necessary for signal encoding. In the SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE) approach, an array of multiple, simultaneously operated receiver coils is used for signal acquisition. In particular, the efficacy of SENSE technology is able to reduce the number of phase encodings by a factor (named R factor or Reduction factor) and to evaluate the same k space with fewer readout lines obtaining higher spatial and temporal resolution.

An heterogeneous group of 30 patients with a variety of clinically proven diagnoses underwent Cardiac MR with SENSE technology to evaluate the technique's diagnostic efficacy. The sequences used were "Balanced" Ultrafast Gradient Echo (B-FFE) characterised by a hyper-intense blood signal with multislice multiphase and single slice multiphase acquisitions.

In addition to reducing scan times, SENSE technology improved spatial and temporal resolution (40 frames/cardiac cycle) providing optimal dynamic evaluation of valve structures and wall kinesis. Furthermore, the use of the SENSE technique with B-FFE sequences (sB-FFE) enabled the qualitative evaluation of abnormal blood movements and transvalvular flows.

The considerable time savings allowed by SENSE technology and the clear improvement in image quality constitute a step forward in cardiac MR imaging. The possibility of executing morphologic, dynamic, perfusional and spectroscopic studies in the same MR examination session with short acquisition times and good image quality are becoming more feasible.
