Functional imaging has provided new evidence of the neurobiological impact of the treatment of aphasia, including speech therapy, through the alteration of the activated language neural network. In such a way, speech therapy has proved its impact. The role of each hemisphere is still very unclear. Some of the authors link the left-lateralisation of activations to the therapeutic improvement of language and the right-activated network to a maladaptative strategy, whereas others consider the latter as a useful compensatory network for speech disorders. Repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), first used to determine cortical activity, is now used to directly interfere with cerebral activity. In the years to come, rTMS should be developed as an adjuvant therapy for aphasia.
