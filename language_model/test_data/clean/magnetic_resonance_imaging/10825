Prenatal diagnosis of fetal intracranial hemorrhage has important etiologic, management, and prognostic implications. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used to identify and evaluate this condition. We present the first reported case of epidural hematoma diagnosed prenatally.

A 25-year-old para 3 was referred for evaluation of a suspected fetal intracranial abnormality following an alleged assault. Ultrasonography and MRI were used to diagnose an epidural hematoma prenatally. The fetus subsequently died in utero. Autopsy confirmed the presence of an epidural hematoma.

Ultrasonography and MRI were useful in diagnosing a fetal epidural hematoma. Unfortunately, no known effective in utero therapy exists for this rare problem.
