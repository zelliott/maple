Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas is a benign and rare pathology. Its histogenesis is still unknown. The diagnosis is difficult to establish before surgery. We report a new case of a 20-year-old woman admitted for abdominal pain and vomiting. Radiologic investigations described a multilocular cystic tumor of the tail of the pancreas. The patient underwent a left pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Histologic investigations revealed pancreatic cysts lined by squamous epithelium surrounded by dense lymphoid tissue. The diagnosis of lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas was done.
